ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (INCORPORATING ITEM 7A) 2001 BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT In this report, the term "Occidental" refers to Occidental Petroleum Corporation and or one or more entities in which it owns a majority voting interest (subsidiaries). Occidental is divided into two major operating businesses. OIL AND NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY The market price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) declined considerably during 2001, falling from around $30/bbl in January to less than $20/bbl in December. The fourth quarter was the weakest for oil prices since the third quarter of 1999. Overall, the crude oil market continued to indicate both long term and short term price uncertainty. NYMEX domestic natural gas prices were subject to greater volatility in 2001. Natural gas prices, which were over $5/thousand cubic feet (Mcf) in the fourth quarter of 2000, rose to $7/Mcf in the first quarter of 2001 and then declined significantly to less than $3/Mcf by year end. Increased supply from heavy investment in drilling by the industry in 2000 and 2001, higher inventories and decreased demand combined to lower gas prices back to the level last seen in the first quarter of 2000. The number of U.S. onshore rigs in use climbed from under 500 in mid 1999 to over 1,100 in mid 2001, but the decline in oil and gas prices resulted in fewer than 800 rigs in use by the end of the year. CHEMICAL INDUSTRY The chemical industry experienced a significant decrease in demand as the decade long U.S. economic expansion gave way to a recession in March 2001 following a slowdown that began midway through 2000. Due to a pessimistic outlook and no near term signs of economic recovery, customers and distributors continued with inventory reduction and limited purchases. Most Asian, European and South American countries also experienced an economic downturn similar to North American trends. Record high energy prices and feedstock costs began to drop in the second quarter, but poor product demand for the year resulted in overall weaker prices and profit margins. 12 Domestic chlorine demand decreased significantly in 2001, compared with 2000, due to poor demand for chlorine derivatives including vinyls, polyurethane chemicals, epichlorohydrin and others, which are primarily used in durable goods and consumer products. The poor chlorine demand resulted in chlorine prices declining throughout the year. Caustic soda prices peaked in the first half of the year due to major cutbacks in chlorine production. Demand was stable in the first half of the year but began to soften in the third quarter. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) prices, but not margins, improved for a short time reflecting higher energy and feedstock prices during the first few months before reaching a peak in April, but weakened throughout the remainder of the year due to poor demand and increased industry capacity. STRATEGIC OVERVIEW AND REVIEW OF BUSINESS RESULTS 1999 2001 STRATEGY Occidentals overall strategy to add value for shareholders consists of three basic elements: >> Shift corporate assets to large, long lived oil and gas assets with growth potential >> Maintain financial discipline and strengthen the balance sheet >> Harvest cash from chemicals Implementation of this strategy included divesting interests in the natural gas pipeline segment and buying large "legacy" oil and gas assets in California and Texas that are expected to provide stable production, strong earnings and cash flow and a solid platform for new growth initiatives. At Occidental, financial discipline means prudently investing capital in projects that are expected to produce superior returns while strengthening the balance sheet to reduce both risk and earnings volatility. The chemicals business is being used to provide free cash flow. SPECIFIC ACTIONS OIL AND GAS The oil and gas business strategy has three parts that, together, are focused on adding new oil and natural gas reserves at a pace well ahead of production, while simultaneously keeping finding and development costs among the lowest in the industry. >> Continue to add commercial reserves in and around core areas in the U.S., Middle East and Latin America through a combination of focused exploration and development programs. >> Pursue commercial opportunities with host governments in core areas to enhance the development of mature fields with large volumes of remaining oil in place by applying appropriate technology and innovative reservoir management practices. >> Maintain a disciplined approach in buying and selling assets at attractive prices. Occidentals oil and gas business is currently concentrated in five U.S. states and nine foreign countries. The asset mix within each of these areas has been strengthened by the sale of properties with low or no current return and investment in assets with much higher performance potential. The results of these changes are discussed below in "Business Review Oil & Gas." CHEMICAL Occidental conducts its chemical operations through Occidental Chemical Corporation and its various subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, OxyChem). OxyChem focuses on the chlorovinyls chain where it begins with ethylene and chlorine, which is co produced with caustic soda, and converts them through a series of intermediate products into PVC. In order to strengthen its position along the chlorovinyls chain, Occidental entered into a major business alliance in 1999, a vinyls partnership with Geon (now known as PolyOne) named OxyVinyls, LP (OxyVinyls). CORPORATE In July 2001, Occidental sold its interests in a subsidiary that owned a Texas intrastate pipeline and its interest in a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Indonesia. After tax proceeds of approximately $750 million from these transactions were used to reduce debt. In April 2000, Occidental sold its interest in Canadian Occidental Petroleum Ltd., renamed Nexen Inc. (CanadianOxy or Nexen). After tax proceeds, together with tax benefits from the disposition of oil producing properties in Peru, totaling $700 million were used to reduce debt following the Altura acquisition. Occidental received $775 million from Chevron in a litigation settlement in November 1999, which was used mainly to reduce high cost debt. DEBT STRUCTURE Occidentals total debt comprises three components, as shown in the table below (amounts in millions): Occidental Other Altura Non Public Recourse Recourse Total Date Debt Debt Debt Debt(a) 12/31/97 $ 4,965 $ 1,361 $ $ 6,326 12/31/98 $ 5,402 $ 776 $ $ 6,178 12/31/99 $ 4,401 $ 1,047 $ $ 5,448 April 2000(b) $ 5,766 $ 1,009 $ 2,400 $ 9,175 12/31/00 $ 3,544 $ 912 $ 1,900 $ 6,356 12/31/01 $ 4,119 $ 771 $ $ 4,890 (a) Includes Trust Preferred Securities, natural gas delivery commitment, preferred stock and capital lease obligations. (b) Reflects, on a pro forma basis, the effect of $1.2 billion in debt from the Altura acquisition on Occidentals debt as of April 2000. 13 Occidental took full advantage of its increased production profile and high oil and gas prices over an eighteen month period in 2000 and 2001 to reduce total debt. The Altura purchase increased pro forma debt to nearly $9.2 billion in April 2000. By the end of 2001, total debt had been lowered to $4.9 billion, $1.4 billion below the year end total in 1997. Occidentals public debt at year end 2001 is more than $800 million below the year end 1997 level and more than $275 million below year end 1999. Occidentals other recourse debt, which includes preferred stock and Trust Preferred Securities in the above table, decreased from $1.4 billion in 1997 to $771 million in 2001. Total Debt/Capitalization Ratio (%) Date Total Debt/Capitalization Ratio 12/31/97 67% 12/31/98 66% 12/31/99 61% April 2000(a) 71% 12/31/00 57% 12/31/01 46% (a) Reflects, on a pro forma basis, the effect of $1.2 billion in debt from the Altura acquisition on Occidentals public debt as of April 2000. Occidentals year end 2001 total debt to capitalization ratio has declined to approximately 46 percent from the 67 percent level that existed at the end of 1997. The debt to capitalization ratio is computed by dividing total debt by total capitalization, excluding minority interest. BUSINESS REVIEW OIL AND GAS Occidentals overall performance during the past three years reflected the successful implementation of its oil and gas business strategy, beginning with the 1998 $3.5 billion acquisition of the Elk Hills oil and gas field in California. Elk Hills is one of the top ten oil and gas fields in the U.S. and the largest source of gas in California. The Elk Hills acquisition was followed in April 2000 by the purchases of Altura Energy in Texas for $3.6 billion and the much smaller THUMS property in Long Beach for $110 million. At the end of 2001, these three assets made up 65 percent of Occidentals worldwide proven oil reserves and 52 percent of its proven gas reserves. On a barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) basis, they accounted for 63 percent of worldwide reserves. In 2001, the combined production from these assets averaged approximately 266,000 BOE per day, which represents 56 percent of Occidentals total worldwide production. ALTURA ACQUISITION Occidental completed the acquisition of the Altura properties on April 19, 2000. In the relatively short period since the acquisition, the Altura properties have generated nearly $1.2 billion in operating cash flow after capital expenditures of approximately $350 million. Net production averaged 140,000 BOE per day in 2001. The Altura properties were successfully integrated with Occidentals existing Permian operations, making Occidental the largest oil producer in Texas. With the Altura acquisition, Occidental has become a world leader in carbon dioxide (CO2) flood technology, an enhanced oil recovery technique that involves injecting CO2 into oil reservoirs where it acts as a solvent causing the oil to flow more freely so it can be pumped to the surface. Currently, Occidentals CO2 floods provide about half of its oil production in the Permian Basin. MILNE POINT BRAVO DOME SWAP In late 2000, Occidental swapped its 9 percent interest in the Milne Point oil field in Alaska operated by BP p.l.c. (BP) for BPs 75 percent working interest in the Bravo Dome CO2 unit in northern New Mexico. Bravo Dome CO2 production averaged approximately 320 million cubic feet per day in 2001. Because of third party sales commitments, Bravo Dome currently meets approximately one third of Occidentals CO2 demand in the Permian Basin. THUMS At year end 2001, net production from the THUMS oil property in Long Beach, CA was averaging 30,000 barrels per day, an increase from approximately 25,000 barrels per day at the end of 2000. In December 2001, work began on a 3 D vertical seismic profile survey, which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2002. The results of this survey are expected to assist in planning for the future development of the properties. Occidental plans to build a 45 megawatt gas fired power plant to enhance THUMS value. Since production at THUMS depends on electric submersible pumps, electricity is the single largest component of this operations cost structure. Moreover, the supply of electricity is interruptible, meaning that when power is in short supply, service may be interrupted to accommodate other users such as domestic households. The new power plant will allow THUMS to generate its own secure supply of electricity from its untapped natural gas resources, while simultaneously lowering operating costs. Any excess electricity can be sold back to the local electricity grid. The permitting process and pre construction activities are progressing well, and construction is expected to commence in the first half of 2002. GULF OF MEXICO In July 2000, Occidental monetized its interests on the Continental Shelf in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) and the proceeds were used to reduce debt. Also refer to "Acquisitions, Dispositions and Commitments 2000" for further information. The development in the GOM is currently focused on the deep water Horn Mountain oil discovery in which Occidental has a one third interest and BP is the operator. The discovery well, which was drilled to a depth of nearly 14,000 feet, is located about 60 miles off the Louisiana Mississippi coast in 5,400 feet of water. 14 Gross proved reserves exceed 100 million BOE with production scheduled to begin late in 2002. Production is expected to peak in 2003 with Occidentals peak share estimated at 21,000 BOE per day. ELK HILLS As a result of sustained capital investment, production increased in 2001 to approximately 99,000 BOE per day from approximately 96,000 BOE per day in 1999 and 2000. Elk Hills has generated total free cash flow, after capital expenditures, of approximately $2.4 billion since Occidental acquired the asset in early 1998. Since the date of acquisition, Occidental has replaced 108 percent of its total Elk Hills oil and gas production of 136 million BOE. At the end of 2001, the property still had an estimated 437 million BOE of proved reserves, compared to the 425 million BOE that were recorded at the time of the acquisition. MIDDLE EAST OMAN Occidentals Oman business centers on its 300 million barrel discovery in Block 9. Occidental has produced more than 150 million gross barrels from the Block, most of it from the Safah field. Net production to Occidental averaged 14,000 barrels of oil per day in the fourth quarter, and Occidental expects to expand its Oman business over the next few years. Occidental uses multi lateral horizontal wells to increase production and recovery rates and to minimize the number of wells needed. Today, 60 percent of Occidentals production in Oman relies on horizontal wells. A new waterflood program is currently under way at Safah that will enhance production and improve the ultimate recovery of reserves from the field. YEMEN In Yemen, Occidentals net production averaged 33,000 barrels of oil per day in 2001, with 29,000 coming from the Masila field and the remainder from East Shabwa. A series of step out wells are planned for Masila in 2002 that are expected to add new reserves. In 2001, Occidental completed a 3 D seismic program in Block 20. Preliminary analysis of these data was completed, and plans are under way to begin drilling two exploratory wells in Block 20 in late 2002. In addition, a 3 D seismic program is beginning in the first quarter of 2002 in Block 44. Analysis of seismic data for Block 59, which is part of the under explored southern portion of the Rub al Khali desert, has been completed and a test well began drilling in January 2002. QATAR In Qatar, Occidental successfully reversed 25 years of declining production in the Idd el Shargi North Dome field. By introducing advanced drilling systems and by applying new waterflooding and reservoir characterization techniques, gross production increased from 20,000 barrels per day to more than 100,000 barrels per day, peaking at 138,000 barrels in 1998. Occidental is developing the South Dome field as a satellite to the North Dome, which reduces the overall capital requirement of the two projects. Combined production from the two fields in the fourth quarter of 2001 was 43,000 barrels per day, net to Occidental. Occidental also has implemented a waterflood program in the North Domes Shuaiba Reservoir and is currently evaluating a second generation redevelopment project. Occidental is also pursuing new exploration opportunities in Qatar. SAUDI ARABIA In Saudi Arabia, Occidental has a 20 percent interest in the Core Venture Two consortium, which expects to invest in the Red Sea area to help the Kingdom identify and develop new natural gas reserves for the domestic market. The Red Sea venture currently consists of development of discovered gas from the Midyan and Barqan fields in the northwest part of the Kingdom, and construction of related gas processing and pipeline facilities. The consortium expects to build at least one power plant and possibly a water desalination unit and will also evaluate the potential for a petrochemical plant. The project also calls for onshore and offshore exploration in Blocks 40 to 49 located in and along the Red Sea. Exploration success in these blocks will lay the foundation for additional investment opportunities in power generation, water desalination and petrochemicals in the western part of the Kingdom. An initial agreement was signed with the Kingdom on June 3, 2001. Final agreements are currently expected to be signed in 2002. OTHER EASTERN HEMISPHERE PAKISTAN Occidental holds oil and gas interests in the Badin Blocks in Pakistan, which BP operates. Current gross production is 65,000 BOE per day. Occidentals net share is approximately 16,000 BOE per day. Current plans call for drilling 13 to 15 wells per year to develop new and existing fields by the end of 2003, and Occidental continues to evaluate additional exploration opportunities. RUSSIA In Russia, Occidentals 50 percent joint venture company, Vanyoganneft, produced approximately 28,000 BOE, net to Occidental, in the fourth quarter of 2001. INDONESIA In July 2001, Occidental sold its interest in the Tangguh LNG project in Indonesia, which was in its initial phase of development, to Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan for a sale price of $480 million. The proceeds were used in Occidentals debt reduction program. 15 LATIN AMERICA COLOMBIA In 2001, production from Occidentals Cano Limon operations in Colombia was substantially reduced from 2000 and 1999 levels due to a record number of attacks by local left wing terrorist groups on the pipeline, which is operated by Ecopetrol. Nevertheless, Occidentals net share of 2001 production averaged 18,000 barrels of oil per day and this operation continues to be profitable. This operation accounts for less than one percent of Occidentals worldwide assets and only three percent of total worldwide reserves and four percent of worldwide oil and gas production at year end 2001. Occidental presently anticipates that it will recover the proved reserves attributable to its contract. The potential rewards are significant when the pipeline is fully operational. The Gibraltar exploration well, which was drilled approximately 100 miles west of Cano Limon, did not encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons, and the $66 million cost of the well was written off in 2001. ECUADOR In 2000, Occidental farmed out a 40 percent economic interest in Block 15 in Ecuador to Alberta Energy Company Ltd. (AEC). This transaction reduced Occidentals exposure in Ecuador and is expected to largely fund its capital program in country through 2004. Gross production in Block 15 is currently flat with 2001 average production of approximately 30,000 barrels of oil per day, with 13,000 barrels net to Occidental. Occidental has begun development of the Eden Yuturi oil field in the southeastern corner of Block 15. The start up of production is scheduled to coincide with the completion of the Oleoducto de Crudos Pesados (OCP) Ltd. heavy oil pipeline in 2003. In addition, work is being carried out in the western portion of the block in and around fields currently in production. The combined effect of these projects is expected to add net incremental production of 30,000 barrels per day to Occidentals production profile. In addition, Occidental is expanding its exploration activities in Block 15 with an aggressive 3 D seismic program. Foreign oil companies, including Occidental, have been paying Value Added Tax (VAT), generally calculated on the basis of 10 12 percent of expenditures for goods and services used in the production of oil for export. Until 2001, these VAT payments were reimbursed to the oil companies because they are incurred for the production of an export product. In 2001, the Ecuador tax authority announced that these VAT payments do not qualify for reimbursement. In response, the affected oil companies filed actions in the Ecuador Tax Court to seek a judicial determination that the expenditures are subject to reimbursement. Occidental believes that it has a valid claim for reimbursement under applicable Ecuador tax law and historic precedent. BUSINESS REVIEW CHEMICAL Although industry volumes improved in early 2001 following weak second half 2000 demand, PVC resin sales in North America lagged 2000 levels by 8 percent through June 2001. Overall demand declined 2.6 percent from 2000 to 2001. Significant oversupply of PVC resin combined with continued inventory reductions by customers resulted in North American PVC industry operating rates of around 80 percent in 2001, versus 85 percent in 2000. PVC resin prices increased only slightly in the first half of 2001, but declined throughout the remainder of the year. Higher exports in 2001 prevented operating rates from falling lower, but export sales returned only minimal margins. On June 1, 2001, OxyChem temporarily idled its Ingleside, TX ethylene dichloride (EDC) plant and on December 27, 2001, OxyChem temporarily idled the Deer Park chlor alkali plant in Houston, TX due to a combination of deteriorating prices and weak demand. These facilities will remain idle until economic conditions improve. In Occidentals chlor alkali business, reduced demand for chlorine led to significantly reduced operating rates. OxyChems operating rate, as a percent of capacity, fell from 92 percent in 2000 to 84 percent in 2001. The chlorine industrys 2001 operating rate was 85 percent compared to 92 percent for 2000. Despite reduced liquid caustic production, caustic prices declined in the second half of the year on weak demand. As 2001 progressed, chlorine prices fell due to declining demand, especially in the global vinyls market. Operations at the Convent chlor alkali and EDC plant, which had been curtailed, were recommenced in 2001. Record high energy costs in the first quarter of 2001 adversely affected earnings. For the total year, energy costs were higher than 2000, but well below first quarter levels. Feedstock costs followed the same trend as energy costs. Petrochemical margins were under pressure throughout 2001 due to weak demand and significant capacity additions by BASF/AtoFina, Formosa Plastics and Union Carbide/Nova Chemical. Lower feedstock costs in the fourth quarter were offset by lower prices due to continued weak demand. The primary goal of Occidentals chemical business is to provide free cash flow. From 1995 through 2001, total cash flow from the chemicals business was $3.8 billion, including asset sales, net of acquisitions, of $1.0 billion. 2002 OUTLOOK OIL AND GAS The petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to numerous market forces. Crude oil and natural gas prices are affected by market fundamentals such as weather, inventory levels, competing fuel prices, overall demand and the availability of supply. 16 In the fourth quarter of 2001, worldwide oil prices weakened considerably and have remained lower than their ten year averages in the first quarter of 2002. Sustained low prices will significantly impact profitability and returns for Occidental and other upstream producers. However, the industry has historically experienced wide fluctuations within price cycles. While fundamentals are a decisive factor affecting crude oil prices over the long term, day to day prices may be more volatile in the futures markets; such as on the NYMEX and other exchanges, which make it difficult to accurately predict oil and natural gas prices. In the short term, other factors such as weather patterns do have a significant effect, particularly on natural gas prices. In the United States, increased gas supplies from large capital investment over the past year, combined with a later winter, resulted in inventory levels at the end of 2001 exceeding the average of the preceding five years by 20 percent. The combination of higher gas supplies and lower demand, which is continuing into the first quarter of 2002, is expected to result in significantly lower average gas price realizations for Occidental in 2002 than in 2001. CHEMICAL The performance of the chemical business is difficult to forecast, but this business is capable of contributing significant earnings and cash flow when demand is strong. Industry operating rates in the chlor alkali/vinyls business are expected to recover gradually in 2002. CHLOR ALKALI Domestic chlorine demand is expected to increase by nearly 2 percent in 2002, which should allow the industrys operating rates to improve in the absence of capacity additions. Liquid caustic pricing is expected to continue to be weak. The domestic chlorine market price is expected to improve gradually throughout 2002 as the vinyls demand for chlorine increases. Liquid caustic pricing peaked in the second quarter of 2001 and is expected to decline through the second quarter of 2002. In late 2001, OxyChem temporarily idled its Deer Park, TX chlor alkali facility until economic conditions improve. VINYLS While the beginning of a weak recovery is expected in the second half of 2002, continued supply/demand imbalances in PVC markets will likely prevent all but seasonal product price increases. Continued pressure on raw materials, particularly ethylene, should result in relatively stable, albeit low, price spreads over raw materials. Overall, North American PVC growth is expected to average only 2.6 percent in 2002, reflecting weak consumer confidence and low GDP growth. While PVC will continue to make inroads into new markets, the high volume construction and automotive end markets for PVC products will likely remain well below peak demand levels. North American PVC industry operating rates are expected to average between 80 85 percent for the year. PETROCHEMICALS (EQUISTAR PARTNERSHIP) In January 2002, Occidental and Lyondell Chemical Company (Lyondell) agreed, in principle, for Occidental to sell its share of Equistar to Lyondell and to purchase an equity interest of approximately 21 percent in Lyondell. These transactions are subject to the execution of definitive documents and corporate and regulatory approvals. In connection with the agreement in principle, Occidental wrote down its investment in the Equistar partnership by $240 million, after tax, in December 2001. Occidental will continue to reflect its share of Equistars results until the transaction closes, which is expected in the second quarter of 2002. INCOME SUMMARY Occidental reported net income of $1.2 billion ($3.10 per share) in 2001, on net sales of $14.0 billion, compared with net income of $1.6 billion ($4.26 per share) in 2000, on net sales of $13.6 billion. Earnings before special items were $1.3 billion in 2001 and 2000. SEGMENT OPERATIONS The following discussion of Occidentals two operating segments and corporate items should be read in conjunction with Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment earnings exclude interest income, interest expense, unallocated corporate expenses and extraordinary items, but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment assets and results from equity investments. Foreign income and other taxes and certain state taxes are included in segment earnings on the basis of operating results. U.S. federal income taxes are not allocated to segments except for amounts in lieu thereof that represent the tax effect of operating charges resulting from purchase accounting adjustments, and the tax effects resulting from major, infrequently occurring transactions, such as asset dispositions and legal settlements that relate to segment results. Segment earnings in 2001 were affected by $14 million of net charges allocated comprising $56 million of charges and $42 million of credits in oil and gas and chemical, respectively. The oil and gas amount included a charge for the sale of the Indonesian Tangguh LNG project. The chemical amount included credits for the sale of certain chemical operations. Segment earnings in 2000 were affected by $25 million from net charges allocated comprising $32 million of charges and $7 million in credits in oil and gas and chemical, respectively. The oil and gas amount included a charge for the monetization of the GOM Continental Shelf assets. The chemical amount included a net charge for the sale of certain chemical operations. Segment earnings in 1999 were affected by $212 million from net charges allocated comprising $228 million of charges and $16 million of credits in oil and gas and chemical, respectively. The oil and gas amount included a charge related to the income on the Chevron litigation settlement and a credit for losses on sales of assets. 17 The following table sets forth the sales and earnings of each operating segment and corporate items: SEGMENT OPERATIONS In millions For the years ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 SALES Oil and Gas $ 10,893 $ 9,779 $ 4,599 Chemical 3,092 3,795 3,221 $ 13,985 $ 13,574 $ 7,820 EARNINGS(LOSS) Oil and Gas $ 2,845 $ 2,417 $ 1,267 Chemical (394) 169 (37) 2,451 2,586 1,230 Unallocated corporate items Interest expense, net(a) (263) (380) (468) Income taxes(c) (366) (861) (68) Trust preferred distributions (56) (67) (62) and other Other (b) (580) 291 (64) Income before extraordinary items and effect of changes in accounting principles 1,186 1,569 568 Extraordinary gain(loss), net (8) 1 (107) Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, net (24) (13) Net Income $ 1,154 $ 1,570 $ 448 (a) The 2001 and 2000 amounts are net of $102 million and $106 million, respectively, of interest income on notes receivable from Altura partners. (b) The 2001 amount includes the after tax loss of $272 million related to the sale of the entity that owns pipelines in Texas that were leased to a former subsidiary, a $109 million charge for environmental remediation expenses and $104 million of preferred distributions to the Altura partners. The 2000 amount includes the pre tax gain on the sale of the CanadianOxy investment of $493 million, partially offset by preferred distributions to the Altura partners of $107 million. The preferred distributions are essentially offset by the interest income discussed in (a) above. (c) The 2001 amount excludes the income tax benefit of $188 million attributed to the sale of the entity that owns pipelines in Texas. > CHEMICAL TRANSACTIONS TAFT COGENERATION FACILITY Occidental has undertaken certain commitments in connection with the construction and leasing of a cogeneration facility in Taft, LA. This facility will supply all the steam and electric power requirements for Occidentals Taft chlor alkali plant for less cost than if the plant were to generate its own steam and purchase electricity from a public utility. An owner trust with investors as participating beneficiaries owns the project, with Occidental acting as general contractor during construction. The equity participant in the owner trust has committed to fund the owner trust with equity in the amount of three percent of the total project cost during construction and 13 percent of the total project cost upon commencement of the lease term. During the construction period, Occidental is fully liable for total project costs if an event of termination occurs due to its 21 willful misconduct or bankruptcy, and Occidental is liable to pay up to 89.9 percent of the eligible construction costs if an event of termination occurs for reasons other than force majeure. Upon completion of construction and satisfaction of certain other conditions, expected to occur by December 31, 2002, Occidental will enter into a 26 year operating lease of the facility. The total cost of the project at the inception of the lease is expected to be approximately $450 million. The total accumulated costs of the project as of December 31, 2001 amount to approximately $328 million. If these costs were recorded as liabilities on Occidentals balance sheet, either during construction or during the lease term, the Taft cogeneration facility would also be recorded as an asset on the balance sheet. LEASES Occidental has entered into various operating lease agreements, mainly for railcars, manufacturing facilities and office space. The leased assets are used in Occidentals operations where leasing offers advantages of greater operating flexibility and generally costs less than alternative methods of funding. Lease payments are charged to Occidentals operations, mainly as cost of sales. Occidental estimates the present value of the remaining lease payments to be $310 million at December 31, 2001. Occidental has fixed price purchase options associated with certain leases at various dates ranging from 2003 to 2015, with an estimated present value of $285 million. These obligations are not recorded as liabilities on Occidentals consolidated balance sheets. If they were so recorded, the leased properties also would be included on the balance sheets as assets. OXYMAR Occidental has a 78.6 percent ownership interest in OxyMar, a general partnership that owns a vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) facility in Texas operated by OxyChem. Marubeni Corporation (Marubeni) owns the remaining 21.4 percent of OxyMar, but has a 50 percent voting interest. The OxyMar VCM plant is a modern, efficient manufacturing facility. Occidentals chlorovinyls business derives economic benefit as the supplier of chlorine, a major raw material, to OxyMar. OxyMar, in turn, supplies VCM required by Occidental to manufacture PVC, one of its major products. This investment in OxyMar is recorded as an equity investment on the consolidated balance sheet. Occidental owns 28.6 percent of OxyMar directly and the OxyVinyls partnership, which is 76 percent owned by Occidental, owns 50 percent. Therefore, because of the effect of a third partys minority ownership interest, Occidentals total share of OxyMars results is only approximately 67 percent. Occidental guarantees 50 percent of OxyMars $165 million private placement bonds due 2016 and 100 percent of a $220 million revolving line of credit which matures in 2005, under which $105 million was outstanding at December 31, 2001. These amounts are reflected as debt on OxyMars balance sheet. Marubeni has a right to put its interest in OxyMar to Occidental in 2004 by paying approximately $30 million to Occidental and, in connection with this transfer, require Occidental to assume Marubenis guarantee of OxyMars debt. If Occidental acquires the Marubeni interest, it will consolidate OxyMar. If OxyMar were to be consolidated, its assets, including the VCM facility, and its liabilities, including debt to third parties, would be recorded on Occidentals consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2001, Occidental had advanced $144 million to OxyMar and had a net equity investment of $52 million. INGLESIDE Occidental and Conoco Inc. (Conoco) each has a 50 percent interest in Ingleside Cogeneration Limited Partnership, a limited partnership (Ingleside LP), which operates a cogeneration plant in Texas. The cogeneration facility supplies all of the steam and electric power requirements to Occidentals Ingleside chlor alkali plant and the VCM plant Occidental owns with Marubeni, at less cost than if these facilities were to produce their own steam and purchase electric power from a public utility. At December 31, 2001, Ingleside LP had approximately $178 million in debt, which is secured by its assets. Occidental has not guaranteed this debt; however, Occidental and Conoco currently each guarantee half of a debt service reserve amount of approximately $8.5 million. Occidental accounts for this investment using the equity method. EQUISTAR Occidental has entered into an indemnity agreement with Equistar, its 29.5 percent equity investee, to contribute to Equistar an amount equal to the lesser of approximately $420 million or the principal amount of Equistars notes due 2009 then outstanding, together with interest. At December 31, 2001, the outstanding principal amount of Equistars notes due 2009 was almost $600 million. Occidental is only required to pay this amount to Equistar if the holders of the notes have not been able to obtain payment after having pursued and exhausted all their remedies to compel payment by Equistar, including the liquidation of assets. The indemnity expressly does not create any right in the holders of the notes or any person other than Occidental, Equistar and the partners of Equistar. Occidental may elect to terminate the indemnity in certain circumstances. v OIL AND GAS TRANSACTIONS ECUADOR In Ecuador, Occidental has a 12 percent interest in a company currently constructing a pipeline, which is expected to be completed in 2003. Construction of the pipeline has made it feasible for Occidental to begin developing the Eden Yuturi field it discovered several 22 years ago in the southeastern corner of Block 15. The development of Eden Yuturi, together with ongoing work in the western portion of the block that is currently in production, is expected to add net incremental production of 30,000 barrels per day, all of which is expected to be shipped through the new pipeline. Occidental has committed to make capital contributions up to its share (approximately $148 million) of the estimated total project costs, less an equivalent percentage (up to approximately $110 million under existing financing arrangements) of any senior project debt incurred by the pipeline company. The pipeline companys senior project debt is to be repaid with the proceeds of ship or pay tariffs of certain upstream producers in Ecuador, including Occidental. Under their ship or pay commitments, Occidental and the other upstream producers have each assumed their respective share of project specific risks, including construction risk, operating risk and force majeure risk. Under certain circumstances, Occidental could be required to pay an advanced tariff payment that would in turn be used by the pipeline company to service or prepay project debt. As of December 31, 2001, Occidental has contributed $9 million to the company. Occidental reports this investment in its consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. ELK HILLS POWER Occidental and Sempra Energy (Sempra) each has a 50 percent interest in Elk Hills Power LLC, a limited liability company that is currently constructing a gas fired, power generation plant in California. Occidental accounts for this investment using the equity method. In January 2002, Elk Hills Power LLC entered into a $400 million construction loan facility. Occidental guarantees $200 million (50 percent) of the loan facility. At January 31, 2002, approximately $94 million of the $200 million guaranteed amount was outstanding. v OTHER TRANSACTIONS RECEIVABLES SALE PROGRAM Occidental has an agreement in place to sell, under a revolving sale program, an undivided interest in a designated pool of trade receivables. This program is used by Occidental as a low cost source of working capital funding. The amount of proceeds, which totaled $360 million outstanding in each of 2001 and 2000, that Occidental has received on the sale of the undivided interest and the related accounts receivable that have been sold, are not included in the debt and trade receivables accounts, respectively, on Occidentals consolidated balance sheets. Fees and expenses under this program are included in selling, general and administrative and other operating expense. Under the program, receivables must meet certain criteria. The program terminates upon certain events, including Occidentals senior debt rating falling below investment grade. In such an event, the amount of proceeds outstanding at that time would have to be funded through other means, which could result in an increase in debt recorded on the consolidated balance sheets along with a corresponding increase in the accounts receivable balance. The consolidated income statement effect of such an event would not be significant. v CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The table below summarizes and cross references certain contractual obligations that are disclosed in the Consolidated Balance Sheets (CBS) and or the accompanying Notes. (In millions) Payments Due by Year Contractual 2003 2005 2007 and Obligations Total 2002 to 2004 to 2006 thereafter Long Term Debt (CBS and Note 6)(a) $ 4,065 $ $ 829 $ 852 $ 2,384 Capital Leases (CBS and Note 8) 27 1 1 1 24 Operating Leases (Note 8)(b) 426 67 102 70 187 Fixed and Determinable Purchase Obligations (Note 9)(c) 81 15 26 22 18 Other Long Term Contracts (Notes 1, 7 and 12)(e) 1,105 137 145 360 (d) 463 TOTAL $ 5,704 $ 220 $ 1,103 $ 1,305 $ 3,076 (a) Includes principal payments, unamortized discounts and mark to market adjustments related to fair value hedges. (b) Offset by sub lease rental income. (c) Excludes capital commitments. (d) The $360 million receivable securitization amount is reflected in the 2005 2006 year column since Occidental could finance the amount with its committed credit line, which becomes due in 2006, if the program was terminated. (e) Includes the $282 million natural gas delivery commitment (CBS), the $360 million receivable securitization program and the $463 million Trust Preferred Securities (CBS). COMMITMENTS In addition to those discussed above, Occidental has entered into commitments on behalf of entities, whether or not affiliated with Occidental, including performance bonds and guarantees of environmental, financial or other obligations. Occidentals liability under these commitments arises only if the entity primarily responsible fails to perform its contractual obligations. In managements opinion, it is unlikely that any of these commitments will have a material adverse effect upon Occidentals consolidated financial position or results of operations. 23 ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL POSITION The changes in the following components of Occidentals balance sheet are discussed below: SELECTED BALANCE SHEET COMPONENTS In millions 2001 2000 Trade receivables, net $ 360 $ 809 Receivables from joint ventures, partnerships and other $ 327 $ 517 Long term receivables, net $ 2,186 $ 2,119 Equity investments $ 993 $ 1,327 Property, plant and equipment, net $ 12,858 $ 13,471 Current maturities of long term debt and capital lease liabilities $ $ 258 Accounts payable $ 720 $ 1,091 Accrued liabilities $ 858 $ 1,089 Current obligation under natural gas delivery commitment $ 137 $ 129 Long term debt, net $ 4,065 $ 3,285 Altura non recourse debt $ $ 1,900 Long term obligation under natural gas delivery commitment $ 145 $ 282 Other deferred credits and liabilities $ 2,326 $ 2,415 Minority interest $ 2,224 $ 2,265 Trust Preferred Securities $ 463 $ 473 Stockholders equity $ 5,634 $ 4,774 The lower balance in trade receivables at December 31, 2001, compared with December 31, 2000, reflected lower product prices during the fourth quarter of 2001 versus 2000. The decrease in receivables from joint ventures, partnerships and other was due to lower mark to market adjustments on derivative financial instruments in the oil and gas trading group. The lower balance in equity investments primarily reflected the write down of the equity investment in Equistar in December 2001. The decrease in the net balance in property, plant and equipment reflected depreciation, depletion and amortization and the sale of the entity that owns pipelines in Texas, offset in part by capital spending. The decrease in current maturities of long term debt reflected a reclassification of the current portion of long term debt, since it is managements intention to refinance the amount on a long term basis by issuing long term debt. The decrease in accounts payable was due to lower trade payable balances in the oil and gas marketing and trading operations. The decrease in accrued liabilities was due to lower mark to market adjustments on derivative financial instruments in the oil and gas trading group, a lower accrual for interest expense and other miscellaneous items. The increase in long term debt primarily reflected the $800 million senior notes that were issued in 2001 mainly to extinguish the non recourse debt, which was originally incurred as a result of the Altura acquisition. The non recourse debt was extinguished in 2001 using free operating cash flow and senior note proceeds. The long term balance of the obligations under the natural gas delivery commitment decreased from December 31, 2000, which reflected the reduction in the overall amount of the obligation. Other deferred credits and liabilities included deferred compensation, primarily other post retirement benefits, environmental reserves, contract advances, deferred revenue and other deferred items. The decrease in this account was primarily the result of the decrease in deferred revenue from the GOM monetization. The increase in stockholders equity primarily reflected net income, partially offset by dividends on common stock. The table below presents principal amounts, by currency and by year of maturity for Occidentals long term debt obligations, excluding $9 million in unamortized discount, at December 31, 2001: DEBT CURRENCY DENOMINATIONS AND INTEREST RATES In millions of U.S. dollars, except rates U.S. Dollar U.S. Dollar Year of Maturity Fixed Rate Variable Rate(a) Grand Total(b) 2003 $ 507 $ $ 507 2004 324 324 2005 1 157 158 2006 246 450 696 2007 2 300 302 Thereafter 1,576 510 2,086 TOTAL $ 2,656 $ 1,417 $ 4,073 Average interest rate 7.67% 3.48% 6.21% (a) Includes fixed rate debt with fair value hedges. (b) Excludes $9 million of unamortized discounts. The estimated fair value of Occidentals long term debt at December 31, 2001 was $4.3 billion. Occidental has the option to call certain issues of long term debt before their maturity dates. In February 2002, Occidental filed a shelf registration statement for up to $1 billion of its senior debt securities, subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units, preferred securities of two subsidiary trusts and Occidentals guarantees of such preferred securities. Occidental, at its option, may issue the entire $1 billion under its medium term notes program, which includes its Medium Term Senior Notes, Series C and its Medium Term Subordinated Notes, Series A. Currently, no notes are issued and outstanding under the program. In December 2001, Occidental issued $300 million of 5.875 percent senior notes due 2007 and $500 million of 6.750 percent senior notes due 2012 for net combined proceeds of approximately $794 million. Approximately $700 million of the net proceeds were used to extinguish the Altura non recourse debt. Occidental recorded an after tax extraordinary loss of $4 million from this transaction. The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. On March 5, 2001, Occidental retired $20.5 million of 7.8 percent pollution control revenue bonds due on December 1, 2005. As a result of this transaction, Occidental recognized an after tax extraordinary loss of $3 million in the first quarter of 2001. 24 On December 20, 2000, Occidental redeemed all $270 million of its outstanding floating rate extendible notes due 2008 at par. During the third and fourth quarters of 2000, Occidental repurchased some of its outstanding public debt securities in open market transactions, with principal balances totaling $154 million, at current market prices. Occidental recorded an after tax extraordinary gain of $1 million that resulted from these purchases. On June 1, 2000, Occidental redeemed all of its outstanding 11.125 percent senior debentures due June 1, 2019, at a redemption price of 100 percent of the principal amount thereof. The outstanding aggregate principal amount of the debentures, which were issued on May 15, 1989, was $75 million. In December 1999, Occidental repurchased for cash, $240 million principal amount of its 10.125 percent senior notes due November 15, 2001, and $138 million principal amount of its 11.125 percent senior notes due August 1, 2010 and redeemed all of OXY USAs $274 million principal amount of 7 percent debentures due 2011, for a total of $722 million, including premium, expenses and accrued interest. Occidental recorded an after tax extraordinary loss of $104 million in the fourth quarter of 1999 related to these transactions. In September 1999, Occidental redeemed $250 million of its 8.5 percent medium term notes due 2004 at par. In August 1999, Occidental called for redemption all of the outstanding shares of its $3.00 cumulative CXY indexed convertible preferred stock. Holders of 3,125,837 shares of such preferred stock converted their shares into approximately 9.9 million shares of Occidental common stock. Occidental redeemed the remaining outstanding shares in September 1999. Also in June 1999, Occidental redeemed $68.7 million of its 11.125 percent senior debentures due June 1, 2019, at a redemption price of 105.563 percent of their principal amount. Occidental recorded an after tax extraordinary loss of $3 million in the second quarter of 1999 related to the redemption. In February 1999, Occidental issued $450 million of 7.65 percent senior notes due 2006 and $350 million of 8.45 percent senior notes due 2029 for net proceeds of approximately $792 million. The net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, which included the repayment of commercial paper and the redemption of other debt. In January 1999, Occidental issued $525 million of 8.16 percent Trust Preferred Securities due in 2039, and callable in 2004, for net proceeds of $508 million. The net proceeds were used to repay commercial paper. The Trust Preferred Securities balance reflects the issuance of preferred securities, net of unamortized issue costs and repurchases. At December 31, 2001, Occidental had approximately $2.1 billion of committed credit lines, which are all available and are utilized, as needed, for daily operating and other purposes. These lines of credit are primarily used to back up the issuance of commercial paper. Occidental has reclassified $199 million of maturities due 2002 to long term debt based on its ability to refinance this debt on a long term basis utilizing the committed credit lines mentioned above. Occidental expects to have sufficient cash in 2002 from operations, and from proceeds from existing credit facilities, as necessary, for its operating needs, capital expenditure requirements, dividend payments and mandatory debt repayments. In the event of fluctuations in operating cash flow, Occidental has the ability to vary its discretionary cash outflow, such as capital expenditures. ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND COMMITMENTS 2001 SALE OF INTRASTATE PIPELINE On August 31, 2001, Occidental sold the entity that owns pipelines in Texas that are leased to a former subsidiary. The entity was sold to Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. Occidental recorded an after tax loss of approximately $272 million in connection with this transaction. SALE OF INDONESIA GAS PROPERTIES On July 10, 2001, Occidental completed the sale of its interest in the Tangguh LNG project in Indonesia to Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan. Occidental recorded an after tax gain of approximately $399 million for this transaction. 2000 MILNE POINT ASSET SWAP On December 4, 2000, Occidental completed an agreement with BP to obtain BPs interest in a carbon dioxide field in New Mexico and related pipelines in exchange for Occidentals interest in the Milne Point oil field in Alaska, together with additional cash consideration. The gain on this transaction was not significant. OXYMAR PURCHASE On November 29, 2000, OxyChem purchased a 28.6 percent interest in OxyMar, a Texas general partnership that owns the Ingleside, Texas VCM facility operated by OxyChem. The interest was purchased from U.S. VCM Corporation, an affiliate of Marubeni Corporation, which continues to own a 21.4 percent interest and remains a 50 percent partner for corporate governance purposes. OxyVinyls owns the remaining 50 percent interest. ECUADOR FARM OUT TO AEC On November 1, 2000, Occidental agreed to farm out a partial economic interest in its Block 15 operations in Ecuador to AEC. AEC will earn a 40 percent interest in the block and will assume certain capital costs through 2004. Occidental will remain the operator of Block 15. The gain on this transaction was not significant. 25 SALE OF DUREZ On November 1, 2000, Occidental completed the sale of its Durez phenolic resins and compounding businesses and assets to Sumitomo Bakelite Co., Ltd. for gross proceeds of approximately $150 million. There was a $13 million after tax gain on this transaction. GULF OF MEXICO ASSETS MONETIZED On August 15, 2000, Occidental completed agreements with respect to two transactions with Apache Corporation (Apache) involving Occidentals interests in the Continental Shelf of the GOM. Occidental entered into a transaction to deliver, over four years, substantially all of its share of future gas production from these GOM interests to Apache for approximately $280 million. Occidental also agreed to sell an interest in the subsidiary that holds the GOM assets for approximately $62 million, with an option for Apache to purchase additional interests for $44 million over the next four years. As a result of these transactions, and the consequent elimination of a portion of Occidentals responsibility for abandonment liabilities, Occidental recorded an after tax gain of $39 million. SALE OF PERU PROPERTIES On May 8, 2000, Occidental completed an agreement to sell its producing properties in Peru to Pluspetrol. In connection with this transaction, Occidental recorded an after tax charge of approximately $29 million in December 1999 to write down the properties to their fair values. THUMS ACQUISITION On April 24, 2000, Occidental completed the acquisition of THUMS, an oil producing entity, for approximately $68 million. The acquisition added approximately 95 million barrels of net oil reserves and approximately 25,000 barrels per day of net oil production to Occidentals growing California operations. ALTURA ACQUISITION On April 19, 2000, Occidental completed its acquisition of all of the common interest in Altura, the largest oil producer in Texas. Occidental, through its subsidiaries, paid approximately $1.2 billion to the sellers, affiliates of BP and Shell, to acquire the common limited partnership interest and control of the general partner which manages, operates and controls 100 percent of the Altura assets. The partnership borrowed approximately $2.4 billion, which had recourse only to the Altura assets. The partnership also loaned approximately $2.0 billion to affiliates of the sellers, evidenced by two notes, which provide credit support to the partnership. The sellers retained a preferred limited partnership interest of approximately $2.0 billion and are entitled to certain distributions from the partnership. The acquisition is valued at approximately $3.6 billion. The $2.4 billion loan had been completely paid by the end of 2001. Proved reserves at Altura were 882 million barrels of oil equivalent at December 31, 2001. SALE OF CANADIANOXY INVESTMENT On April 18, 2000, Occidental completed the sale of its 29.2 percent stake in CanadianOxy for gross proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion Canadian. Of Occidentals 40.2 million shares of CanadianOxy, 20.2 million were sold to the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Board and 20 million to CanadianOxy. In addition, Occidental and CanadianOxy exchanged their respective 15 percent interests in joint businesses of approximately equal value, resulting in Occidental owning 100 percent of an oil and gas operation in Ecuador and CanadianOxy owning 100 percent of sodium chlorate operations in Canada and Louisiana. After tax proceeds from the CanadianOxy disposition together with tax benefits from the disposition of the Peru producing properties totaled approximately $700 million. 1999 ASSET SWAP WITH EOG In December 1999, Occidental and EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG) exchanged certain oil and gas assets. Occidental received producing properties and exploration acreage in its expanding California asset base, as well as producing properties in the western Gulf of Mexico near existing operations, in exchange for oil and gas production and reserves in east Texas. The exchange increased Occidentals exploration acreage in California from approximately 89,000 acres to approximately 850,000 acres. Occidental also farmed out Oklahoma panhandle properties to EOG, retaining a carried interest, and expects to benefit from EOGs drilling program. Occidental was not planning on drilling this acreage and, under this program, EOG will fund all the capital and Occidental will share in the results. INDSPEC ACQUISITION In the third quarter of 1999, Occidental acquired the remaining ownership of INDSPEC through the issuance of approximately 3.2 million shares of Occidental common stock at an estimated value of approximately $68 million and the assumption of approximately $80 million of bank debt. As a result of the transactions, Occidental owns 100 percent of the stock of INDSPEC. YEMEN ASSET SWAP WITH UNOCAL In the third quarter of 1999, Occidental acquired oil and gas interests in Yemen from Unocal International Corporation (UNOCAL) and UNOCAL acquired Occidentals properties in Bangladesh. The results, after tax benefits, did not have a significant impact on earnings. OXYVINYLS PARTNERSHIP Effective April 30, 1999, Occidental and PolyOne formed two partnerships. Occidental has a 76 percent interest in OxyVinyls, the PVC commodity resin partnership, which is the larger of the partnerships, and a 10 percent interest in a PVC powder compounding partnership. OxyVinyls also has entered into long term 26 agreements to supply PVC resin to PolyOne and VCM to Occidental and PolyOne. In addition, Occidental sold its pellet compounding plant in Pasadena, Texas and its vinyl film assets in Burlington, New Jersey to PolyOne. As part of the transaction, PolyOne received $104 million through the retention of working capital and the distribution of cash from OxyVinyls, and OxyVinyls undertook approximately $180 million in obligations, for certain PolyOne plant facilities, which are treated as operating leases for accounting purposes. Occidental did not record a significant gain or loss on the transaction. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Commitments at December 31, 2001 for major capital expenditures during 2002 and thereafter were approximately $167 million. Total capital expenditures for 2002 are estimated to be approximately $1.1 billion. Occidental will fund these commitments and capital expenditures with cash from operations and proceeds from existing credit facilities as necessary. DERIVATIVE AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES GENERAL Occidentals market risk exposures relate primarily to commodity prices, and, to a lesser extent, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Occidentals results are sensitive mainly to crude oil and natural gas prices and fluctuations in those prices have an impact on Occidentals results. Based on current levels of production, if oil prices vary overall by $1 per barrel, they would have approximately a $108 million annual affect, before U.S. income tax. If natural gas prices vary by $0.25 per million Btu (MMBtu), they would have approximately a $60 million annual effect, before U.S. income tax. If production levels change in the future, the sensitivity of Occidentals results to oil and gas prices also would change. Occidental may periodically use different types of derivative instruments to achieve the best prices for oil and gas, to reduce its exposure to price volatility and thus mitigate fluctuations in commodity related cash flows. Usually Occidental remains unhedged to long term oil and gas prices. Overall, Occidentals use of derivatives in hedging activity remains at a relatively low level. However, current rules require extensive disclosure regarding any level of derivative use. The following disclosures describe each area of Occidentals derivative activity in detail. Effective January 1, 1999, Occidental adopted the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities", which establishes accounting and reporting standards for certain energy trading contracts. EITF 98 10 requires that energy trading contracts must be marked to fair value with gains and losses included in earnings and separately disclosed in the financial statements or accompanying footnotes. The initial adoption of EITF 98 10 resulted in a first quarter non cash after tax benefit of $2 million, recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in 1999. Effective January 1, 2001, Occidental adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138 (collectively SFAS No. 133, as amended). These statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities and require an entity to recognize all derivatives in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value unless the instrument qualifies as a normal purchase or sale contract. Changes in the derivative instruments fair value must be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that meet specific cash flow hedge accounting criteria are reported in other comprehensive income (OCI). The gains and losses on cash flow hedge transactions that are reported in OCI are reclassified to earnings in the periods in which earnings are affected by the variability of the cash flows of the hedged item. Gains and losses from derivatives that qualify for fair value hedge accounting are recorded in earnings along with the change in fair value of the hedged item. The ineffective portions of all hedges are recognized in current period earnings. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 133, gains and losses on commodity futures contracts that qualified for hedge accounting, essentially those associated with equity production or purchases, were deferred until recognized as an adjustment to sales revenue or purchase costs when the related transaction being hedged was finalized. Occidentals initial adoption of SFAS No. 133, as amended, resulted in a first quarter after tax reduction in net income of $24 million recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles and an after tax reduction in OCI of approximately $27 million. The adoption also increased total assets by $588 million and total liabilities by $639 million as of January 1, 2001. COMMODITY PRICE DERIVATIVES GENERAL With respect to derivatives used in its oil and gas marketing operations, Occidental used a combination of futures, options and swaps to offset various open price positions. The fair value recorded for derivative instruments is based on quoted market prices, dealer quotes or synthetic price curves established from quoted prices (adjusted for time, location and quality differentials). CASH FLOW COMMODITY HEDGES Occidental used cash flow hedges for the sale of crude oil and natural gas in 2001, with the objective of mitigating price risk arising from fluctuating values for 27 these commodities. Crude oil hedges were executed for Occidentals West Texas production. Its strategy to achieve these objectives included a combination of purchased put options and written call options resulting in no net premium received for crude oil hedging. Purchased put options were used for natural gas hedging and were executed for the Mid continent production area to establish a minimum sales price for its production. Occidental used no fair value hedges for crude oil or natural gas production during 2001. Occidentals cash flow hedging instruments, which consist of natural gas put option contracts, are highly effective. During 2001, net gains of $0.6 million were recorded to OCI relating to changes in current cash flow hedges and net losses of $7.6 million were reclassified from OCI into earnings as a reduction to net sales revenue, as the forecasted transactions actually occurred. The fair value at December 31, 2001 of derivative financial instruments that have been designated and have qualified as cash flow hedging instruments was $0.2 million. The gain was recorded as an increase to OCI and will be reclassified into earnings during 2002 when the forecasted transactions actually occur. MARKETING AND TRADING OPERATIONS The fair value at December 31, 2001 of derivative instruments used in marketing and trading operations is a net gain of $9 million. Gains of $24 million were recorded in earnings due to the change in fair value of these financial derivative instruments during 2001. Offsetting the value of these instruments are related physical positions with a fair value of $2 million loss at December 31, 2001. Gains of $15 million were recorded in earnings due to the change in the fair value of related physical positions during 2001. The net positions mostly expire in 2002. Additionally, a long term sales contract volume commitment is 38,100 MMBtu per day through October 2010. The approximate $39 million net gain from the change in fair value during 2001 of derivative instruments used in marketing and trading operations was reflected in the income statement. The $39 million net gain represents a reversal of negative mark to market adjustments resulting from the adoption of SFAS No. 133, as amended. At December 31, 2001, total assets and liabilities include $108 million and $101 million for the fair value of derivative instruments used in marketing and trading operations. Prior to the physical settlement of any energy contract held for trading purposes, favorable or unfavorable price movement is reported in the income statement. An offsetting amount is recorded on the balance sheet as unrealized gains or unrealized losses on trading transactions. When a contract to sell energy is physically settled, the above entries are reversed and the gross amount invoiced to the customer is included as net sales in the income statement. Similarly, when a contract to purchase energy is physically settled, the purchase price is included as cost of sales in the income statement. Until a contract is physically settled, the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified to a receivable or payable account. Other than the positive effect on oil and gas realized prices, the results of trading activities are not significant. RECONCILIATION OF FAIR VALUE OF CONTRACTS FROM JANUARY 1, 2001 TO DECEMBER 31, 2001 (in millions) Fair value of contracts outstanding at January 1, 2001 $ (66) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period gains/(losses) (30) Changes in fair value attributable to changes in valuation techniques and assumptions Other changes in fair values 103 Fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2001 $ 7 Maturity Periods 2007 Total Source of 2003 2005 and Fair Fair Value 2002 to 2004 to 2006 thereafter Value Prices actively quoted $ (12) $ $ $ $ (12) Prices provided by other external sources 20 1 21 Prices based on models and other valuation methods (1) (1) (2) TOTAL $ 8 $ $ (1) $ $ 7 GAS PRESALE In November 1998, Occidental entered into a natural gas delivery commitment for proceeds of $500 million, which obligates Occidental to deliver 263 billion cubic feet of natural gas over a four year period ending in December 2003. This transaction resulted in less expensive financing and enables Occidental to satisfy the delivery commitment at a fixed price with open market purchases without reducing its own natural gas reserves. The imputed interest rate in the transaction is approximately 6 percent. The current portion of Occidentals natural gas delivery commitment ($137 million at December 31, 2001) is shown as a current liability on Occidentals consolidated balance sheets. The present value of the non current commitment ($145 million at December 31, 2001) is shown under deferred credits and other liabilities on Occidentals consolidated balance sheets. In connection with this transaction, Occidental simultaneously entered into a natural gas price swap based on identical volumes of natural gas and a delivery schedule that corresponds to the natural gas delivery commitment. Under the terms of the swap, Occidental will pay an average fixed price of $2.27 per MMBtu of gas and will receive a floating price that will approximate market, which essentially eliminates Occidentals exposure to commodity price fluctuations that could affect this transaction. At December 31, 2001, the fair value of this price swap is an $84 million gain, which is offset by an $84 million loss applicable to the related physical positions. 28 ACTIVITIES PRIOR TO SFAS 133 IMPLEMENTATION At December 31, 2000, Occidental was a party to commodity exchange and over the counter forward obligations. The instruments held for purposes other than trading expire during the period from January 2001 to December 2003, and relate to the hedging of natural gas and crude oil prices. The fair value of these instruments at December 31, 2000 was $511 million. Offsetting the value of these instruments were related physical positions with a $528 million loss. The principal components of these instruments and related physical positions are the related natural gas price swap and the natural gas delivery commitment, which is discussed above. At December 31, 2000, the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of these obligations was an unrealized loss of approximately $17 million. The instruments held or issued for trading purposes mostly expired in 2001, with the exception of a long term sales contract that expires in 2010. The fair value of these instruments at December 31, 2000 was $31 million. Offsetting the value of these instruments were related physical positions with a $12 million loss. The net gain of approximately $19 million was reflected in the income statement. The majority of the gain was from the mark to market adjustment under EITF Issue No. 98 10 of a long term sales contract. INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES FAIR VALUE HEDGES Interest rate swaps, forward locks and futures contracts are entered into as part of Occidentals overall strategy to manage interest rate exposure. During 2001, Occidental entered into several interest rate swaps that qualified for fair value hedge accounting. These derivatives effectively convert approximately $1.3 billion of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt with maturities ranging from 2005 to 2008. In 2000 and 1999, Occidental also had interest rate swaps converting fixed rate debt to floating rate debt that matured in November 2000. Net interest expense was impacted by $6.6 million of income in 2001, $1.0 million of expense in 2000 and income of almost $1.0 million in 1999 to reflect the effects of the fair value hedges. CASH FLOW HEDGES Occidental is a party to a series of forward interest rate locks, which qualified as a cash flow hedge, that are required to be settled on or prior to December 31, 2002. These financial instruments relate to debt raised by a third party to construct a cogeneration plant that will be subject to a long term operating lease to OxyChem. As the lease payments will be directly related to the amount of interest paid on the underlying debt, the forward rate locks were put in place to hedge the future lease payments. The lease payments are expected to commence on or before January 15, 2003. The fair value of these financial instruments at December 31, 2001 was an unrealized loss of $28 million, that would be offset by potentially lower lease payments due to the lower interest rate environment. Occidental and its equity investees have also entered into additional derivative instruments that qualified as cash flow hedges. The amounts related to these hedges are included below. For the year ended 2001, a $4 million gain was reclassified from OCI to income due to the expiration of cash flow hedges and a $3 million loss was recorded to OCI relating to changes in current cash flow hedges. During the next twelve months, Occidental expects that less than about $0.1 million of net derivative losses included in OCI, based on their valuation at December 31, 2001, will be reclassified into earnings. Hedge ineffectiveness did not have a significant impact on earnings for the year. FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVES Many of Occidentals foreign oil and gas operations and foreign chemical operations are located in countries whose currencies generally depreciate against the U.S. dollar on a continuing basis. Generally, an effective currency forward market does not exist for these countries. Therefore, Occidental attempts to manage its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions only at levels necessary for operating purposes. Additionally, all of Occidentals oil and gas foreign entities have the U.S. dollar as the functional currency since the cash flows are mainly denominated in U.S. dollars. However, in one foreign chemical subsidiary where the local currency is the functional currency, Occidental has exposure on debt that is denominated in U.S. dollars that is not material. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, Occidental had not entered into any foreign currency derivative instruments. The effect of exchange rate transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income. CREDIT RISK Occidentals derivative contracts are spread among numerous banks and market leaders in the industry. Creditworthiness is reviewed before doing business with a new counterparty and on an on going basis. Occidental monitors aggregated counter party exposure relative to credit limits, and manages credit enhancement requirements such as collateral, parental guarantees and letters of credit. Credit limits for all customers (whether financial or physical) are established and entered into Occidentals risk management systems, and these limits are monitored for compliance on an aggregated basis across all traded commodities. Credit exposure for each customer is monitored for outstanding balances, current month activity, and forward mark to market exposure. The credit determination process takes into consideration the creditworthiness of the counter party, the counter partys parent, parental guarantees, letters of credit, and other credit enhancing instruments. 29 TAXES Deferred tax liabilities were $989 million at December 31, 2001, net of deferred tax assets of $768 million. The current portion of the deferred tax assets of $114 million is included in prepaid expenses and other. The net deferred tax assets are expected to be realized through future operating income and reversal of taxable temporary differences. LAWSUITS, CLAIMS, COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND RELATED MATTERS Occidental and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in a substantial number of lawsuits, claims and proceedings. They have also been named as potentially responsible parties (PRPs) in governmental proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and corresponding state acts. These governmental proceedings seek funding, remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages and civil penalties, aggregating substantial amounts. Occidental is usually one of many companies in these proceedings, and has to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies. Occidental has accrued reserves at the most likely cost to be incurred in those proceedings where it is probable that Occidental will incur remediation costs which can be reasonably estimated. During the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by taxing authorities for varying periods in various tax jurisdictions. It is impossible at this time to determine the ultimate liabilities that Occidental and its subsidiaries may incur resulting from any lawsuits, claims and proceedings, audits, commitments, contingencies and related matters. Several of these matters may involve substantial amounts, and if these were to be ultimately resolved unfavorably to the full amount of their maximum potential exposure, an event not currently anticipated, it is possible that such event could have a material adverse effect upon Occidentals consolidated financial position or results of operations. However, in managements opinion, after taking into account reserves, it is unlikely that any of the foregoing matters will have a material adverse effect upon Occidentals consolidated financial position or results of operations. ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES Occidentals operations in the United States are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to improving or maintaining the quality of the environment. Foreign operations also are subject to environmental protection laws. Costs associated with environmental compliance have increased over time and may continue to rise in the future. Environmental expenditures related to current operations are factored into the overall business planning process. These expenditures are mainly considered an integral part of production in manufacturing quality products responsive to market demand. ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION The laws that require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively to previous waste disposal practices. In many cases, the laws apply regardless of fault, legality of the original activities or ownership or control of sites. Occidental is currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups under these laws at federal CERCLA sites, comparable state sites and other remediation sites, including Occidental facilities and previously owned sites. Also, Occidental and certain of its subsidiaries have been involved in a substantial number of governmental and private proceedings involving historical practices at various sites including, in some instances, having been named as defendants and or as PRPs under the federal CERCLA law. These proceedings seek funding and or remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged personal injury or property damage, punitive damages and civil penalties, aggregating substantial amounts. Occidental does not consider the number of CERCLA and similar state sites at which it has been notified that it has been identified as being involved to be a relevant measure of exposure. Although the liability of a PRP may be joint and several, Occidental is usually one of many companies cited as a PRP at these sites and has, to date, been successful in sharing cleanup costs with other financially sound companies. Also, many of these sites are still under investigation by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or the equivalent state agencies. Before actual cleanup, the parties involved assess site conditions and responsibility and determine the appropriate remedy. The majority of remediation costs are incurred after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval to proceed. The ultimate future cost of remediation of certain of the sites for which Occidental has been notified that it has been identified as being involved cannot be reasonably determined at this time. As of December 31, 2001, Occidental had been notified by the EPA or equivalent state agencies, or otherwise had become aware, that it had been identified as being involved at 126 CERCLA or comparable state sites. (This number does not include those sites where Occidental has been successful in resolving its involvement.) The 126 sites include 34 former Diamond Shamrock Chemical sites as to which Maxus Energy Corporation has retained all liability. Of the remaining 92 sites, Occidental has denied involvement at 9 sites and has yet to determine involvement in 20 sites. With respect to the remaining 63 of these sites, Occidental is in various stages of evaluation, and the extent of liability retained by Maxus Energy Corporation is disputed at 2 of these sites. For 54 of these sites, where environmental 30 remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated, Occidental has accrued reserves at the most likely cost to be incurred. The 54 sites include 11 sites as to which present information indicates that it is probable that Occidentals aggregate exposure is insignificant. In determining the reserves, Occidental uses the most current information available, including similar past experiences, available technology, regulations in effect, the timing of remediation and cost sharing arrangements. For the remaining 9 of the 63 sites being evaluated, Occidental does not have sufficient information to determine a range of liability, but Occidental does have sufficient information on which to base the opinion expressed above in the "Lawsuits, Claims, Commitments, Contingencies and Related Matters" section of this "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." For managements opinion on lawsuits and proceedings and on other environmental loss contingencies, see the above noted section. ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS Occidentals environmental costs, some of which may include estimates, relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations are shown below for each segment: In millions 2001 2000 1999 OPERATING EXPENSES Oil and Gas $ 22 $ 17 $ 13 Chemical 47 51 51 $ 69 $ 68 $ 64 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Oil and Gas $ 60 $ 27 $ 19 Chemical 19 20 17 $ 79 $ 47 $ 36 REMEDIATION EXPENSES Corporate $ 109 $ $ ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES Corporate $ 454 $ 402 $ 454 Operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis. Capital expenditures relate to long lived improvements in currently operating facilities. Remediation expenses relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and do not contribute to current or future revenue generation. Although total costs may vary in any one year, over the long term, segment operating and capital expenditures for environmental compliance generally are expected to increase. Occidental manages its environmental remediation efforts through a wholly owned subsidiary, Glenn Springs Holdings, Inc. (GSH). GSH has full management authority over all remediation sites and reports directly to Occidentals corporate management. The environmental reserves, as shown in the table above, have been provided for environmental remediation liabilities at the Superfund and comparable state sites discussed above, and for Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other sites where Occidental has environmental remediation responsibility. Eight counties in the Houston Galveston area are subject to a federal EPA mandate to adopt a plan for implementing certain requirements of the federal Clean Air Act, known as a State Implementation Plan. In October 2001, the EPA approved a State Implementation Plan for the Houston Galveston area (the Plan). The Plan contains provisions requiring the reduction of 80 90 percent of current nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions in the Houston Galveston area by November 2007. Occidental operates five facilities that will be subject to the Plans NOx reduction requirements. Occidental estimates that its capital expenditures will increase by between $80 $120 million for environmental control and monitoring equipment necessary to comply with the Plans enacted or proposed NOx reduction requirements. Occidental began expending the capital necessary to comply with the Plan in 2001 and expects expenditures to end in 2007, although the timing of the expenditures will vary by facility. Occidental presently estimates that divisional capital expenditures for environmental compliance (including the SIP discussed above) will be in the range of $38 million for 2002 and $46 million for 2003. FOREIGN INVESTMENTS Portions of Occidentals assets outside North America are exposed to political and economic risks. Occidental conducts its financial affairs so as to mitigate its exposure against those risks. At December 31, 2001, the carrying value of Occidentals assets in countries outside North America aggregated approximately $2.0 billion, or approximately 11 percent of Occidentals total assets at that date. Of such assets, approximately $1.3 billion was located in the Middle East, approximately $502 million was located in Latin America, and substantially all of the remainder were located in Pakistan and Russia. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Generally accepted accounting principles require the use of management judgments and estimates in addition to the rules and regulations established by accounting pronouncements. Occidental has adopted a number of accounting policies, the most important of which are discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies." Occidental believes the most critical accounting policy, including judgments in its application, that may have an impact on Occidentals financial statements relates to the accounting for capitalized, long term assets. The rates at which these assets are depreciated or otherwise written off are subject to a number of judgments about future events, many of which are beyond managements control. 31 Oil and gas properties are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring proved and unproved properties, costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs are capitalized. Annual lease rentals and exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs and exploratory dry hole costs, are expensed as incurred. Depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties is determined principally by the unit of production method and is based on estimated recoverable reserves. These reserves are subject to revision based upon actual performance as well as changes in the price of oil and gas. Significantly higher or lower product prices will lead to changes in the amount of reserves due to economic limits or the effects of production sharing contracts. The process of estimation of reserves is inherently judgmental, especially during the early life of a field. Estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond Occidentals control, such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs. Thus, Occidentals depreciation and depletion expense could change in the future. At December 31, 2001, the costs attributable to unproved properties were approximately $1.6 billion, as shown in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These costs are not subject to depreciation or depletion on a current basis. As development work progresses and the reserves on these properties are proven, capitalized cost of the properties will be subject to depreciation and depletion. If the development work were to be unsuccessful, the capitalized cost of the properties related to this unsuccessful work would be expensed in the year in which the determination was made. The rate at which these unproven properties are written off, therefore, depends upon future exploration and development activities as well as the product price environment. Occidental believes its development and exploration efforts will result in the addition of sufficient reserves to fully realize this investment in unproved properties. Chemical facilities are depreciated using either the unit of production method or straight line method, both based upon the estimated productive life of the facilities. Occidental makes annual capital renewal expenditures for its chemical plants on a continual basis while the plants are in operation. Impairment reserves are provided when a decision is made to dispose of a property or when operations have been curtailed on other than a temporary basis. Judgments about the useful life of a chemical plant can change depending on a number of factors, such as sustained higher or lower energy prices, environmental regulations, foreign competition and technological change. Thus, Occidentals depreciation expense could be higher or lower depending on these and other factors. ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTING CHANGES Listed below are additional changes in accounting principles applicable to Occidental. SFAS NO. 144 In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." SFAS No. 144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets. The provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Occidental will adopt this statement in the first quarter of 2002 and it is not expected to have an impact on the financial statements. SFAS NO. 143 In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No.143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. The provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. Occidental must implement SFAS No. 143 in the first quarter of 2003 and has not yet determined its impact on the financial statements. SFAS NO. 142 In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 142 changes the accounting and reporting requirements for acquired goodwill and intangible assets. The provisions of this statement must be applied starting with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Certain transitional provisions of the statement can be implemented as late as the fourth quarter of 2002, provided that the transitional effect, if any, is recorded retroactive to the first quarter of 2002. At December 31, 2001, the balance sheet included approximately $108 million of goodwill and intangible assets with annual amortization expense of approximately $6 million recorded in the income statement. Occidental expects to implement SFAS No. 142 in the first quarter of 2002. The adoption of this accounting standard is expected to result in a cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles after tax reduction in net income of approximately $95 million due to the anticipated impairment of the goodwill. SFAS NO. 141 In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations." SFAS No. 141 establishes new standards for accounting and reporting business combinations including eliminating the pooling method of accounting. The standard applies to all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. Occidental has implemented the provisions of SFAS No. 141, which had no impact on the financial statements. 32 EITF ISSUE NO. 00 10 In the fourth quarter of 2000, Occidental adopted the provisions of EITF Issue No. 00 10, "Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs", which establishes accounting and reporting standards for the treatment of shipping and handling costs. Among its provisions, EITF Issue No. 00 10 requires that transportation costs that had been accounted for as deductions from revenues should now be recorded as an expense. The implementation of EITF Issue No. 00 10 had no effect on net income. All prior year balances have been adjusted to reflect this accounting change. The transportation costs that have been removed as deductions from revenues and included in cost of sales on Occidentals Statements of Operations totaled $245 million in 2000 and $210 million in 1999. SFAS NO. 140 In the fourth quarter of 2000, Occidental adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities a Replacement of FASB Statement No. 125", which revises disclosure standards for asset securitizations and other financial asset transfers. SFAS No. 140 also contains provisions which revise certain criteria for accounting for securitizations, financial asset transfers and collateral. These accounting provisions were adopted by Occidental on April 1, 2001. The implementation of all of the provisions of SFAS No. 140 did not have an impact on Occidentals consolidated financial positions or results of operations. SAB NO. 101 In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements." SAB No. 101 summarizes the Staffs views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in the financial statements. The bulletin was effective in the fourth quarter of 2000. Occidental was in compliance with these standards; accordingly, the adoption of SAB No. 101 did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements. SOP NO. 98 5 Effective January 1, 1999, Occidental adopted the provisions of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position (SOP) 98 5, "Reporting on the Costs of Start Up Activities", which requires that costs of start up activities, including organizational costs, be expensed as incurred. The initial application of the statement resulted in a charge to income for costs of previously capitalized start up activities that have not yet been fully amortized. The initial adoption of SOP 98 5 resulted in a first quarter noncash after tax charge of $15 million, net of $8 million in taxes, which has been recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT REGARDING OUTLOOK AND OTHER FORWARD LOOKING DATA Portions of this report, including Items 1 and 2 and the information appearing under the caption "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," including the information under the sub caption "2002 Outlook," contain forward looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and business prospects. Factors that could cause results to differ materially include, but are not limited to: global commodity pricing fluctuations; competitive pricing pressures; higher than expected costs including feedstocks; crude oil and natural gas prices; chemical prices; potential liability for remedial actions under existing or future environmental regulations and litigation; potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation; general domestic and international political conditions; potential disruption or interruption of Occidentals production or manufacturing facilities due to accidents, political events or insurgent activity; potential failure to achieve expected production from existing and future oil and gas development projects; the supply/demand considerations for Occidentals products; any general economic recession or slowdown domestically or internationally; regulatory uncertainties; and not successfully completing, or any material delay of, any development of new fields, expansion, capital expenditure, efficiency improvement project, acquisition or disposition. Forward looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as "estimate", "project", "predict", "will", "anticipate", "plan", "intend", "believe", "expect" or similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. Occidental undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information or otherwise. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward looking events discussed might not occur. REPORT OF MANAGEMENT The management of Occidental Petroleum Corporation is responsible for the integrity of the financial data reported by Occidental and its subsidiaries. Fulfilling this responsibility requires the preparation and presentation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Management uses internal accounting controls, corporate wide policies and procedures and judgment so that such statements reflect fairly the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Occidental. 33
