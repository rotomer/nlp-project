ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A) (INCORPORATING ITEM 7A) In this report, the term "Occidental" refers to Occidental Petroleum Corporation and or one or more entities in which it owns a majority voting interest (subsidiaries). Occidental is divided into two segments: oil and gas and chemical. 2002 BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT OIL AND NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY Oil and gas prices are the key variables that drive the industrys financial performance. Prices can vary even on a short term basis. The average West Texas Intermediate (WTI) market price for 2002 was $26.08/barrel (bbl) compared with $25.97/bbl in 2001. From a low point of less than $20.00/bbl in 2001, prices have improved to a fourth quarter of 2002 average price of $28.15/bbl, which was the strongest quarter for oil prices since the first quarter of 2001. NYMEX domestic natural gas prices began 2002 at approximately $2.50 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), but increased during the year. For the fourth quarter of 2002, gas prices averaged $3.57/Mcf compared with $2.55/Mcf for the fourth quarter of 2001. CHEMICAL INDUSTRY The chemical industry continued to struggle throughout the year due to poor economic conditions. However, several commodity chemical product prices improved moderately due to the resilient building and construction industry and marginal improvement in demand for general durable goods. 8 Domestic chlorine demand improved slightly in 2002, compared to 2001 due to the modest growth across all markets other than vinyl chloride monomer (VCM). Despite modest growth in chlorine demand, prices remained strong and improved significantly through the year. Strong chlorine prices resulted from a 5 percent overall decrease in industry capacity and unplanned production outages. Caustic soda prices declined through the second quarter due to a slow rebound in downstream product demand, but improved in the fourth quarter as supply became tighter. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) prices improved reflecting the ability to pass through price increases in feedstock costs as well as strong demand in building and construction markets, resulting in some margin improvement. STRATEGIC OVERVIEW AND REVIEW OF BUSINESS RESULTS 2000 2002 STRATEGY Occidentals overall corporate strategy aims to generate competitive total returns to stockholders and consists of three basic elements: >> Focus on large, long lived oil and gas assets with growth potential. >> Maintain financial discipline and strengthen the balance sheet. >> Harvest cash from chemicals. Large, long lived "legacy" oil and gas assets like those in California, the Permian Basin in Texas and Qatar tend to have moderate decline rates, enhanced secondary and tertiary recovery opportunities and economies of scale that lead to cost effective production. These assets are expected to contribute strong earnings and cash flow and serve as a strong foundation for new growth initiatives. At Occidental, maintaining financial discipline means prudently investing capital in projects that are expected to generate above cost of capital returns from these investments throughout the business cycle. During periods of high commodity prices, Occidental will use the bulk of its cash flow after capital and dividends to reduce the volatility of its earnings either through debt reduction or, to a lesser extent, by acquiring additional properties with low risk characteristics. Occidental may also sell properties to reduce debt and to fund other higher return acquisitions, while strengthening the balance sheet to reduce risk and increase earnings. The chemicals business provides free cash flow. From 1995 through 2002, cash flow, after subtracting capital expenditures, from the chemicals business totaled $3.0 billion. This does not include asset sales, net of acquisitions, which provided an additional $1.0 billion. SPECIFIC ACTIONS OIL AND GAS The oil and gas business strategy has three parts that, together, are focused on adding new oil and natural gas reserves at a pace well ahead of production, while simultaneously keeping finding and development costs among the lowest in the industry: >> Continue to add commercial reserves in and around Occidentals core areas, which are the U.S., Middle East and Latin America, through a combination of focused exploration and development programs. >> Pursue commercial opportunities with host governments in core areas to enhance the development of mature fields with large volumes of remaining oil in place by applying appropriate technology and innovative reservoir management practices. >> Maintain a disciplined approach in buying and selling assets at attractive prices. Occidentals oil and gas operations are located in California, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Texas domestically and in Colombia, Ecuador, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Russia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen internationally. Occidental also has interests in several other countries. The asset mix within each of the core areas has been strengthened. Occidental has sold properties with low or no current return and invested in assets with higher performance potential. The results of these changes are discussed below in "Business Review Oil and Gas." CHEMICAL Occidental manufactures and markets basic chemicals, vinyls and performance chemicals directly and through various affiliates (collectively, OxyChem). OxyChem focuses on the chlorovinyls chain where it begins with chlorine, which is co produced with caustic soda, and then converts chlorine and ethylene, through a series of intermediate products, into PVC. In August 2002, Occidental and Lyondell Chemical Company completed an agreement for Occidental to sell its 29.5 percent share of Equistar to Lyondell and to purchase a 21 percent equity interest in Lyondell. Occidental entered into these transactions to diversify its petrochemicals interest. These transactions reduced Occidentals direct exposure to petrochemicals volatility, yet allowed it to maintain a presence and preserve, through its Lyondell investment, an economic upside when the petrochemicals industry recovers. 9 CORPORATE In July 2001, Occidental sold its interests in a subsidiary that owned a Texas intrastate pipeline system and its interest in a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Indonesia. After tax proceeds of approximately $750 million from these transactions were used to reduce debt. In April 2000, Occidental sold its interest in Canadian Occidental Petroleum Ltd., renamed Nexen Inc. (CanadianOxy or Nexen). After tax proceeds, together with tax benefits from the disposition of oil producing properties in Peru at the same time, totaling $700 million were used to reduce debt following the Altura acquisition. DEBT STRUCTURE The components of Occidentals total debt are shown in the table below (amounts in millions): Other Occidental Recourse Total Date Debt Debt (a) Debt (a) 12/31/98 $ 5,382 $ 776 $ 6,158 12/31/99 $ 4,380 $ 1,047 $ 5,427 12/31/00 $ 5,441 $ 913 $ 6,354 12/31/01 $ 4,119 $ 771 $ 4,890 12/31/02 $ 4,203 $ 556 $ 4,759 (a) Includes Trust Preferred Securities, natural gas delivery commitment (which was terminated in 2002), corporate and subsidiary preferred stock and capital lease obligations. Occidentals year end 2002 total debt to capitalization ratio has declined to approximately 43 percent from the 66 percent level that existed at the end of 1998, as shown in the table below. The debt to capitalization ratio is computed by dividing total debt by total capitalization. Total Debt/Capitalization Ratio (%) Date Total Debt/Capitalization Ratio 12/31/98 66% 12/31/99 61% 12/31/00 57% 12/31/01 46% 12/31/02 43% BUSINESS REVIEW OIL AND GAS Occidentals overall performance during the past several years reflects the successful implementation of its oil and gas business strategy, beginning with the 1998 $3.5 billion acquisition of the Elk Hills oil and gas field in California. The Elk Hills acquisition was followed in April 2000 by the purchases of both Altura Energy in Texas for $3.6 billion and the THUMS property in Long Beach, California for $68 million. At the end of 2002, these three assets made up 69 percent of Occidentals worldwide proven oil reserves and 55 percent of its proven gas reserves. On a barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) basis, they accounted for 67 percent of Occidentals worldwide reserves. In 2002, the combined production from these assets averaged approximately 290,000 BOE per day, which represents 56 percent of Occidentals total worldwide production. These businesses also contributed approximately 60 percent of oil and gas segment earnings and 85 percent of oil and gas segment free cash flow. ELK HILLS Occidental operates the Elk Hills oil and gas field in the southern portion of Californias San Joaquin Valley with an approximate 78 percent interest. The field reserves are among the top ten in the lower 48 United States and the field is the largest producer of gas in California. Production increased in 2002 to approximately 101,000 BOE per day from approximately 99,000 BOE per day in 2001. Elk Hills has generated total net cash flow, after subtracting $696 million of capital expenditures, of approximately $2.8 billion since Occidental acquired the asset in early 1998. Since the date of acquisition, Occidental has replaced 109 percent of its total Elk Hills oil and gas production of 173 million BOE. At the end of 2002, the property still had an estimated 440 million BOE of proved reserves, compared to the 425 million BOE that were recorded at the time of the acquisition. PERMIAN BASIN Occidental integrated the Altura properties with its previously existing Permian Basin properties in Southwest Texas and Southeast New Mexico. Since the acquisition, the former Altura properties have generated more than $1.8 billion in total net cash flow, after subtracting capital expenditures of approximately $400 million. One element of Occidentals strategy in the Permian Basin is to acquire producing properties at attractive prices that offer synergies with its existing operations. In 2002, Occidental made a number of small acquisitions in the Permian Basin for a total purchase price of $73 million. These acquisitions accounted for total proven reserve additions of 53.3 million BOE for an average cost of $1.36 per BOE. Total Permian oil and gas production averaged 164,000 BOE per day in 2002 compared to 162,000 BOE per day in 2001. Net Permian oil production averaged 142,000 barrels per day in 2002 compared to 137,000 barrels per day in 2001. Occidental is the largest oil producer in Texas. Approximately 50 percent of Occidentals Permian Basin production is reliant upon the application of carbon dioxide (CO2) flood technology, an enhanced oil recovery technique, a portion of which is supplied by the Bravo Dome CO2 unit. This involves injecting CO2 into oil reservoirs where it acts as a solvent, causing the oil to flow more freely so it can be pumped to the surface. The size of these CO2 flood operations makes Occidental a world leader in the development and application of this technology. In 2002, Occidental implemented two large CO2 projects, one in the Cogdell field in West Texas and the other in Hobbs, New Mexico. When these two projects become fully operational, they are expected to add approximately 10,000 BOE per day to Occidentals production. 10 THUMS Occidental purchased THUMS, the field contractor of the Long Beach Unit, an oil and gas production unit offshore Long Beach, California, in 2000. It is part of the Wilmington field, which is the fourth largest oil field in the continental U.S. At year end 2002, net production from the THUMS oil property was averaging 26,000 barrels per day. Occidental completed construction of a 45 megawatt gas fired power plant and began generating electricity in December 2002. Previously, the oil fields operations depended on the local utility for power to operate electric pumps critical to production. The electricity supply from the utility was interruptible, meaning that when power was in short supply, service could be temporarily discontinued. Electricity is the largest component of operating costs for this field and by securing a reliable source of electricity, it will be possible to reduce overall field production costs. GULF OF MEXICO In July 2000, Occidental completed agreements with respect to two transactions involving its interests on the Continental Shelf in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) and the proceeds were used to reduce debt. Occidental has a one third interest in the deep water Horn Mountain oil field, which is its primary asset in the GOM. BP p.l.c. (BP) is the operator. The discovery well, which was drilled to a depth of nearly 14,000 feet, is located about 60 miles off the Louisiana Mississippi coast in 5,400 feet of water. Development work was completed on time and under budget and the field began production in November 2002, with a year end exit rate of approximately 9,000 net BOE per day. Net proved reserves are approximately 36 million BOE. HUGOTON Occidental owns a large concentration of gas reserves, production interests and royalty interests in the Hugoton area of Kansas and Oklahoma. The Hugoton field is the largest natural gas field discovered to date in North America. Occidentals Hugoton operations produced 148,000 Mcf of natural gas and 3,000 barrels of oil per day in 2002. MIDDLE EAST DOLPHIN PROJECT In 2002, Occidental purchased a 24.5 percent interest in Dolphin Energy Limited (DEL), the operator of the Dolphin Project. The Dolphin Project, which is expected to cost its owners $3.5 billion in total, consists of two parts: (1) a development and production sharing agreement with Qatar to develop and produce natural gas and condensate in Qatars North Field; and (2) the rights for DEL to build, own and operate a 260 mile long, 48 inch export pipeline to transport 2 billion cubic feet per day of dry natural gas from Qatar to markets in the UAE for a period of 25 years. The pipeline will have capacity to transport up to 3.2 billion cubic feet per day, which will allow for additional business development projects. DEL is currently negotiating contracts to market the gas with users in the UAE. Construction on the upstream production and processing facilities and the pipeline is expected to begin in 2003 and production is scheduled to begin in early 2006. The Dolphin partners anticipate securing project financing. Occidental has not recorded any revenue or production costs for this project and no oil and gas reserves have been included in its 2002 proved oil and gas reserves. OMAN Occidentals Oman business centers on its 300 million barrel discovery in Block 9, in which it has a 65 percent working interest. Occidental has produced more than 150 million gross barrels from the Block, most of it from the Safah field. Net production to Occidental averaged 13,000 barrels of oil per day in the fourth quarter. Occidental uses multi lateral horizontal wells to increase production and recovery rates and to minimize the number of wells needed. Today, 60 percent of Occidentals production in Oman relies on horizontal wells. A new waterflood program is currently under way at Safah that will enhance production and improve the ultimate recovery of reserves from the field. Occidental recently entered into an agreement, which is awaiting government approval, to sell an estimated 120 130 million cubic feet of natural gas per day from Block 9 operations to the Omani government, beginning in early 2004 and extending through 2007. The Occidental Omani agreement is expected to open up a market for previously stranded gas that is associated with oil production from the Safah field. Occidental also continues its exploration program in the adjacent Block 27. YEMEN In Yemen, Occidental owns direct working interests in the Masila field in Block 14 (38 percent) and the East Shabwa field in Block 10 (28.6 percent). In addition, Occidental has interests in seven exploration blocks encompassing nearly 15 million acres. Of these, Occidental is the operator of Blocks 44 and 20, with working interests of 75 percent and 50 percent, respectively, and has a 40 percent working interest in each of five blocks Blocks 11, 12, 36, 54 and 59 on the border with Saudi Arabia. Occidentals net production averaged 38,000 barrels of oil per day in 2002, with 32,000 coming from the Masila field and the remainder from East Shabwa. A series of step out wells at Masila in 2002 added 5 million barrels of new reserves. Occidental drilled and completed two exploratory wells in Block 20 in late 2002 and completed a 2 D seismic program in the third quarter of 2002 in Block 44. QATAR In Qatar, Occidental successfully reversed 25 years of declining production in the Idd El Shargi North Dome (ISND) field. By introducing advanced drilling systems and by applying new waterflooding and reservoir characterization techniques, Occidental is increasing production and recoverable reserves from the fields 4 billion barrels of remaining oil in place. 11 Occidental is moving forward under a new agreement with a second phase in the development of ISND. The new phase is targeting the development and recovery of 145 million gross barrels of additional reserves from ISND. Occidental is also engaged in full field development of the Idd El Shargi South Dome (ISSD) field which, as a satellite to the North Dome, reduces the overall capital requirement of the two projects. Combined production from the two fields averaged 42,000 barrels per day, net to Occidental, in 2002. When the second phase of ISND and the full field development of ISSD are fully completed, Occidental expects its total net production from Qatar to increase to approximately 76,000 barrels per day in 2006. Reserves, net to Occidental, related to these projects are expected to total 94 million barrels. Also, see the Dolphin Project discussed above. SAUDI ARABIA In Saudi Arabia, Occidental has a 20 percent interest in the Core Venture Two consortium, which is proposing to invest in the Red Sea area to help the Kingdom identify and develop new natural gas reserves for the domestic market. An initial agreement was signed with the Kingdom on June 3, 2001. OTHER EASTERN HEMISPHERE PAKISTAN Occidental holds oil and gas working interests, that vary from 25 to 50 percent, in four Badin Blocks in Pakistan. BP is the operator. In 2002, Occidental purchased additional interests in two of these blocks from the government of Pakistan for approximately $72 million. Current gross production is 65,000 BOE per day, while Occidentals net share is approximately 25,000 BOE per day. Current plans call for drilling 13 to 15 wells per year to develop new and existing fields. Additionally, Occidental continues to evaluate various exploration opportunities. RUSSIA In Russia, Occidental owns 50 percent of a joint venture company, Vanyoganneft, that operates in the western Siberian oil basin. Production for 2002 was approximately 27,000 BOE per day, net to Occidental. LATIN AMERICA COLOMBIA Occidental has a 35 percent net share of production and is operator of the Cano Limon oil field in Colombia. Colombias national oil company, Ecopetrol, operates the Cano Limon Covenas oil pipeline and marine export terminal. The pipeline transports oil produced from the Cano Limon field for export to international markets. In addition, Occidental has an 88 percent working interest in two exploration blocks encompassing 6,647 square miles in the Central Llanos Basin. In 2002, production from Occidentals Cano Limon operations in Colombia increased substantially from 2001 due to improved security along the export pipeline that reduced the number of attacks by local terrorist groups. The pipeline was subjected to a record number of attacks in 2001. Occidentals net share of 2002 production averaged 35,000 barrels of oil per day compared to 18,000 barrels per day in 2001. This operation accounts for less than one percent of Occidentals worldwide assets, only two percent of total worldwide reserves and less than seven percent of average worldwide oil and gas production in 2002. Occidental presently anticipates that it will recover the proved reserves attributable to its contract. ECUADOR Gross production in Block 15 in 2002, which Occidental operates with a 60 percent working interest, averaged approximately 13,000 barrels of oil per day net to Occidental. Full field development of the Eden Yuturi oil field in the southeastern corner of Block 15 is complete. Full scale production is scheduled to coincide with the anticipated completion, in the second half of 2003, of the Oleoducto de Crudos Pesados (OCP) Ltd. oil export pipeline, in which Occidental has a 12 percent interest. In addition, work continues in the producing areas in the western portion of the block. The combined effect of these projects is expected to add total net incremental production of 30,000 barrels per day to Occidentals production profile in 2004. In addition, Occidental is expanding its exploration activities in Block 15 with aggressive 3 D seismic and drilling programs. In 2000, Occidental farmed out a 40 percent economic interest in Block 15 in Ecuador to Alberta Energy Company Ltd. (AEC), now EnCana. As a result of this transaction, EnCana agreed to fund a significant portion of the capital program. Foreign oil companies, including Occidental, have been paying Value Added Tax (VAT), generally calculated on the basis of 10 12 percent of expenditures for goods and services used in the production of oil for export. Until 2001, oil companies, like other companies producing products for export, filed for and received reimbursement of VAT. In 2001, the Ecuador tax authority announced that the oil companies VAT payments did not qualify for reimbursement. In response, the affected oil companies filed actions in the Ecuador Tax Court to seek a judicial determination that the expenditures are subject to reimbursement. In November 2002, Occidental initiated an international arbitration proceeding against the Ecuadorian Government under the United States Ecuador bilateral investment treaty based on Occidentals belief that the Ecuadorian Government is arbitrarily and discriminatorily refusing to refund the VAT to Occidental. Occidental believes that it has a valid claim for reimbursement under applicable Ecuador tax law and the treaty. In the event of an unfavorable outcome, the potential income statement effect would not be significant. 12 PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS Occidental conducts its operations in Qatar, Oman and Yemen under production sharing contracts. Occidental receives a share of production from production sharing contracts to recover its costs and an additional share for profit. Occidentals share of production from these contracts decreases when oil prices improve and increases when oil prices decline. Overall, Occidentals net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices. BUSINESS REVIEW CHEMICAL CHLOR ALKALI 2002 saw increased demand for chlorine in all major market segments, particularly VCM, propylene oxide and epichlorohydrin. Domestic demand for co product caustic soda was flat year over year and exports from the U.S. declined. The chlor alkali industry entered 2002 coming off the lowest operating rate since 1985. As a result of increased demand, coupled with a full year of capacity reductions in 2002, industry operating rates increased from 81 percent in the fourth quarter of 2001 to a peak of 93 percent in the third quarter of 2002. Annual operating rates increased from 85 percent for 2001 to 89 percent for 2002. Prices for chlorine followed the demand curve and increased steadily throughout the year. Declining total demand for caustic soda coupled with increased electrochemical unit (ECU) production led to falling caustic soda prices through the third quarter. Although markets have improved steadily in 2002, OxyChem has maintained its Deer Park chlor alkali production facility in Houston, Texas in a standby mode pending further strengthening in overall economic conditions and improved demand for caustic soda. OxyChem successfully began commercial operation of a 778 megawatt cogeneration facility in Taft, Louisiana in the fourth quarter of 2002. This facility provides all of the steam and electric power requirements for the Taft, Louisiana chlor alkali plant at a lower cost than if the plant were to generate its own steam and purchase electricity from a public utility. It sells excess power in the merchant market. VINYLS 2002 saw improvement in North American PVC resin demand following a strengthening trend which began in early 2001. For the year, North American PVC resin demand grew at a rate of approximately 5 percent. The 2002 market exhibited strong growth through July, with more moderate growth in the third quarter, followed by seasonal contraction in the fourth quarter. As a result of higher demand, together with lower inventory levels, in much of the chain, industry operating rates climbed from the low 80 percent levels of the second half of 2001 to above 90 percent for the second and third quarters of 2002. Although PVC resin capacity remains in oversupply, tightness in VCM and chlorine feedstocks have constrained vinyls production levels throughout the year. Vinyls prices reflected this tightness by rising 14 cents/lb in the first seven months of 2002. Prices to vinyls export markets peaked somewhat earlier in the year then retreated during the third quarter, due primarily to a sharp reduction in Chinese imports. Prices posted improvements in late fourth quarter as spot buyers anticipated supply constraints for 2003 coupled with an overall improvement in demand in Southeast Asia. 2003 OUTLOOK OIL AND GAS The petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to numerous market forces. Crude oil and natural gas prices are affected by market fundamentals such as weather, inventory levels, competing fuel prices, overall demand and the availability of supply. In the last half of 2002, worldwide oil prices strengthened due to increasing political and economic turmoil in Venezuela and the growing threat of conflict with Iraq. Venezuela alone accounts for approximately 13 percent of total U.S. oil imports. These uncertainties raised concerns about the security and availability of ample supplies to meet growing demand. In 2003, continued unrest in Venezuela and the Middle East portend significant volatility for short term crude oil prices and continued price uncertainty over the long term. If the turmoil continues well into 2003, the result could be a continued tightening of crude oil supplies and correspondingly higher prices. Conversely, a lessening of the uncertainties could result in greater crude oil supply and lower prices. Sustained high oil prices will significantly impact profitability and returns for Occidental and other upstream producers. However, the industry has historically experienced wide fluctuations within price cycles. For example, the average price of WTI crude oil in the first quarter of 2002 was $21.64/bbl compared to $28.15 in the fourth quarter. Although oil prices cannot be predicted with any certainty, WTI price has averaged approximately $21.25/barrel over the past ten years. While supply demand fundamentals are a decisive factor affecting domestic natural gas prices over the long term, day to day prices may be more volatile in the futures markets, such as on the NYMEX and other exchanges, which make it difficult to predict prices with any degree of confidence. Over the long term, volatile prices, sharp production decline rates and the uncertain timing of new gas supplies, in response to new gas related drilling, place constraints on the domestic gas supply industry. Record high gas related drilling rates in the first half of 2001 added very little new domestic production capacity, increasing uncertainty about the 2003 gas supply outlook, particularly as drilling declined in the wake of falling prices in the first half of 2002. The early onset of severe winter weather for the 2002 2003 heating season contributed to an increase in gas prices in the second half of 2002. However, this did not spark a corresponding increase in gas driven drilling activity, giving rise to expectations of steeper production decline rates in 2003. Robust prices in 2003 could lead to a new upsurge in gas related drilling to address longer term supply uncertainties. 13 CHEMICAL The performance of the chemical business is difficult to forecast, but this business is capable of contributing significant earnings and cash flow when demand is strong. The major factors that have an impact on the performance of the chemicals business are general economic conditions, energy and feedstock costs, and the effect of changes in productive capacity. CHLOR ALKALI Further improvement in ECU operating rates is expected as domestic demand for both chlorine and caustic soda are forecasted to increase over 2 percent in 2003 and industry capacity is expected to decline further. PVC, and other derivatives not manufactured by Occidental, are leading the growth in demand for chlorine. Growth in demand for caustic soda is expected to track overall manufacturing activity. With increasing demand and increased capacity utilization, pricing for chlorine is expected to improve slightly over the fourth quarter 2002 levels. Caustic soda prices are expected to show a marked improvement over 2002 as contracts reflect previously announced price increases and overall supply and demand become more balanced. Energy costs for 2003 are expected to increase over 2002 levels. VINYLS Occidental expects North American PVC resin demand to grow 4 5 percent for 2003, based on annual U.S. and global GDP growth expectations of approximately 2.5 percent. North American PVC operating rates are expected to continue to move upward in 2003, averaging 1 2 percent higher than 2002 rates. Chlorovinyls supply constraints, together with spiking energy costs, have created conditions for vinyls price increases early in 2003. In addition, VCM intermediates will be in shorter supply than PVC because of industry capacity rationalizations and maintenance requirements. Operating rates for North American VCM producers are expected to average well above 90 percent. Energy and raw material price escalation will limit margin growth in 2003. Tightness in chlorine supply for vinyls production will remain a concern in 2003. INCOME SUMMARY Occidental reported net income of $1.0 billion ($2.63 per share) in 2002, on net sales of $7.3 billion, compared with net income of $1.2 billion ($3.10 per share) in 2001, on net sales of $8.1 billion. Core earnings were $1.0 billion in 2002 and $1.2 billion in 2001. SEGMENT OPERATIONS The following discussion of Occidentals two operating segments and corporate items should be read in conjunction with Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment earnings exclude interest income, interest expense, unallocated corporate expenses, discontinued operations and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment assets and results from equity investments. Foreign income and other taxes and certain state taxes are included in segment earnings based on their operating results. U.S. federal income taxes are not allocated to segments except for amounts in lieu thereof that represent the tax effect of operating charges resulting from purchase accounting adjustments, and the tax effects resulting from major, infrequently occurring transactions, such as asset dispositions and legal settlements that relate to segment results. The following table sets forth the sales and earnings of each operating segment and corporate items: SEGMENT OPERATIONS In millions For the years ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 SALES Oil and Gas $ 4,634 $ 5,134 $ 4,875 Chemical 2,704 2,968 3,629 $ 7,338 $ 8,102 $ 8,504 EARNINGS(LOSS) Oil and Gas (a) $ 1,707 $ 2,845 $ 2,417 Chemical (a) 275 (399) 141 1,982 2,446 2,558 Unallocated corporate items Interest expense, net (b) (253) (272) (372) Income taxes (c) (364) (359) (853) Trust preferred distributions and other (47) (56) (67) Other (c, d) (155) (580) 291 Income from continuing operations 1,163 1,179 1,557 Discontinued operations, net (79) (1) 13 Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, net (95) (24) Net Income $ 989 $ 1,154 $ 1,570 (a) Segment earnings in 2002 were affected by $402 million of net credits allocated, comprising $1 million of charges and $403 million of credits in oil and gas and chemical, respectively.

The preferred distributions are essentially offset by the interest income discussed in (b) above. 14 OIL AND GAS In millions, except as indicated 2002 2001 2000 SEGMENT SALES $ 4,634 $ 5,134 $ 4,875 SEGMENT EARNINGS $ 1,707 $ 2,845 $ 2,417 CORE EARNINGS (a) $ 1,707 $ 2,446 $ 2,417 NET PRODUCTION PER DAY UNITED STATES Crude oil and liquids (MBBL) California 86 76 70 Permian 142 137 101 U.S. Other 4 1 Total 232 213 172 Natural Gas (MMCF) California 286 303 306 Hugoton 148 159 168 Permian 130 148 119 U.S. Other 66 Total 564 610 659 LATIN AMERICA Crude oil & condensate (MBBL) Colombia 40 21 37 Ecuador 13 13 17 Total 53 34 54 MIDDLE EAST AND OTHER EASTERN HEMISPHERE Crude oil & condensate (MBBL) Oman 13 12 9 Pakistan 10 7 6 Qatar 42 43 49 Yemen 37 33 32 Total 102 95 96 Natural Gas (MMCF) Pakistan 63 50 49 Total 63 50 49 CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES (MBOE) 492 452 440 Less: Colombia minority interest (5) (3) (5) Add: Russia Occidental net interest 27 27 26 Add: Yemen Occidental net interest 1 TOTAL WORLDWIDE PRODUCTION 515 476 461 AVERAGE SALES PRICES CRUDE OIL PRICES ($ per barrel) U.S. $ 23.47 $ 21.74 $ 26.66 Latin America $ 23.14 $ 20.10 $ 26.07 Middle East and Other Eastern Hemisphere (e) $ 24.01 $ 22.97 $ 26.92 Total consolidated subsidiaries $ 23.56 $ 21.91 $ 26.62 Other interests $ 14.80 $ 15.57 $ 18.60 Total worldwide $ 22.91 $ 21.41 $ 25.99 GAS PRICES ($ per thousand cubic feet) U.S. $ 2.89 $ 6.40 $ 3.66 Middle East and Other Eastern Hemisphere $ 2.08 $ 2.29 $ 1.99 Total worldwide $ 2.81 $ 6.09 $ 3.53 EXPENSED EXPLORATION (b) $ 176 $ 184 $ 94 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Development $ 897 $ 918 $ 582 Exploration $ 55 $ 86 $ 79 Acquisitions and other (c, d) $ 86 $ 134 $ 77 (a) Occidentals results of operations often include the effects of significant transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount.

Occidental explores for and produces oil and natural gas, domestically and internationally. Occidental seeks long term growth and improvement in profitability and cash flow through a combination of increased operating efficiencies in core assets, enhanced oil recovery projects, focused exploration opportunities and complementary property acquisitions. Core earnings in 2002 were $1.7 billion compared with $2.4 billion in 2001. The decrease in core earnings primarily reflects the impact of lower natural gas prices and production volumes, partially offset by higher crude oil prices and production volumes.

CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS SELECTED REVENUE ITEMS In millions 2002 2001 2000 Net sales $ 7,338 $ 8,102 $ 8,504 Interest, dividends and other income $ 143 $ 223 $ 263 Gains on disposition of assets, net $ 10 $ 10 $ 639 The decrease in sales in 2002, compared to 2001, primarily reflects lower natural gas and chemical prices and lower natural gas and chemical volumes, partially offset by higher crude oil prices and higher crude oil production. The decrease in sales in 2001, compared to 2000, primarily reflects lower crude oil and chemical prices, partially offset by higher natural gas prices. Interest, dividends and other income in 2002, 2001 and 2000 includes interest income on the notes receivable from the Altura partners of $21 million, $102 million and $106 million, respectively. Occidental exercised an option in May 2002 to redeem the sellers remaining partnership interests in exchange for the notes receivable. Gains on disposition of assets in 2001 includes the pre tax gain of $454 million on the sale of the interest in the Tangguh LNG project and the pre tax loss of $459 million on the sale of its interests in a subsidiary that owned a Texas intrastate pipeline system. Gains on disposition of assets in 2000 includes the pre tax gain of $493 million on the sale of the CanadianOxy investment, the pre tax gain of $61 million on the partial sale of the Gulf of Mexico assets, the pre tax gain of $63 million on the receipt of contingency payments related to a prior year sale of a Dutch North Sea subsidiary and the pre tax gain of $34 million on the sale of the Durez business. SELECTED EXPENSE ITEMS In millions 2002 2001 2000 Cost of sales $ 3,385 $ 3,626 $ 3,933 Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses $ 635 $ 665 $ 686 Write down of assets $ 42 $ 3 $ 180 Exploration expense $ 176 $ 184 $ 94 Interest and debt expense, net $ 295 $ 401 $ 510 Cost of sales decreased in 2002, compared to 2001, and 2001 compared to 2000, due mainly to lower chemical raw material costs. Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses decreased in 2002, compared to 2001, due mainly to 2001 severance and other charges. Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses decreased in 2001, compared to 2000, due mainly to a decrease in chemical selling costs. The 2002 write down of assets amount includes write downs for certain chemical assets. The 2000 amount includes the write down of certain oil and gas investments and the chemical intermediate businesses. Exploration expense in 2002 includes a $33 million write off for Lost Hills leases and a $25 million write off for the Thunderball deep gas well, both in California. Exploration expense in 2001 includes expensing higher cost exploration wells, primarily the Gibraltar well in Colombia of $66 million. The decrease in interest and debt expense in 2002, compared to 2001, and 2001 compared to 2000, reflects lower outstanding debt levels and lower interest rates. OTHER ITEMS In millions 2002 2001 2000 Provision for income taxes $ 422 $ 556 $ 1,434 Minority interest $ 77 $ 143 $ 185 Loss (income) from equity investments $ 261 $ 504 $ (67) The 2002 provision for income taxes includes an income tax benefit of $406 million for the sale of the Equistar investment. The 2001 provision includes income tax benefits of $172 million resulting from the write down of the Equistar investment, $188 million from the sale of the entity that owns a Texas intrastate pipeline system, and a $70 million settlement of a state tax issue. The 2000 provision includes an income tax charge for the gain on the sale of the CanadianOxy investment. The decrease in minority interest in 2002, compared to 2001, was due to an $84 million decrease in preferred distributions to the Altura partners. The remaining Altura partnership interests were redeemed in May 2002. The decrease in minority interest in 2001, compared to 2000, was due to a $38 million decrease in the minority interest attributable to PolyOne, the minority interest partner in OxyVinyls. 16 The 2002 loss from equity investments includes a pre tax loss of $242 million from the sale of the Equistar investment in August 2002. The loss from equity investments in 2001 includes a $412 million pre tax write down of Equistar and a loss of $89 million from the Equistar equity investment. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OPERATING ACTIVITIES In millions 2002 2001 2000 NET CASH PROVIDED $ 2,100 $ 2,566 $ 2,348 The lower operating cash flow in 2002, compared with 2001, results from lower core earnings and higher working capital usage. The higher operating cash flow in 2001, compared with 2000, results from lower core earnings and higher working capital usage more than offset by additional significant non cash items. Other non cash charges in 2002 include environmental remediation accruals and the asset writedown for two chemical facilities. Other non cash charges in 2001 include environmental remediation accruals. Other non cash charges in 2000 include the write down of the chemical intermediate businesses and other miscellaneous items. Each of the three years also includes charges for employee benefit plans and other items. INVESTING ACTIVITIES In millions 2002 2001 2000 NET CASH USED $ (1,696) $ (651) $ (3,044) The 2002 amount includes approximately $349 million for a 24.5 percent interest in DEL, the operator of the Dolphin Project. The 2001 amount includes the gross proceeds of $863 million from the sale of the entity that owns a Texas intrastate pipeline system and the sale of Occidentals interest in the Tangguh LNG project in Indonesia. The 2000 amount includes the gross proceeds of approximately $800 million from the sale of the CanadianOxy investment, gross proceeds of $150 million from the sale of the Durez business and approximately $342 million from the GOM asset transactions. The 2000 amount also includes approximately $3.7 billion for the purchases of Altura and THUMS. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES In millions 2002 2001 2000 Oil and Gas $ 1,038 $ 1,138 $ 738 Chemical 109 112 148 Corporate and other 89 58 6 TOTAL $ 1,236 $ 1,308 $ 892 Occidentals capital spending estimate for 2003 is $1.3 billion. Of the total, approximately $1.2 billion will be allocated to oil and gas, with Qatar, Elk Hills and the Permian Basin receiving the highest priority. FINANCING ACTIVITIES In millions 2002 2001 2000 NET CASH (USED)PROVIDED $ (456) $ (1,814) $ 579 The 2002 amount reflects the net $179 million buyout of the natural gas delivery commitment and $72 million of net proceeds from the issuance of a subsidiarys preferred stock. The 2001 amount reflects the repayment of $2.3 billion of long term and non recourse debt, partially offset by proceeds of $861 million from new long term debt. The 2000 amount reflects the proceeds from the $2.4 billion non recourse debt, partially offset by repayments of $1.4 billion on the long term and non recourse debt. The 2000 amount also includes the first year of purchases made to satisfy delivery commitments under the natural gas delivery commitment that was signed in 1998. Occidental paid common stock dividends of $375 million in 2002, $372 million in 2001 and $369 million in 2000. Occidental has a centralized cash management system that funds the working capital and capital expenditure requirements of its various subsidiaries. There are no provisions under existing debt agreements that significantly restrict Occidentals ability to move funds among operating entities. ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY In the course of its business activities, Occidental pursues a number of projects and transactions to meet its core business objectives. The accounting and financial statement treatment of these transactions is a result of the varying methods of funding employed. Occidental also makes commitments on behalf of unconsolidated entities. These transactions, or groups of transactions, are recorded in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles and, unless otherwise noted, are not reflected on Occidentals balance sheets. The following is a description of the business purpose and nature of these transactions. * OIL AND GAS TRANSACTIONS ECUADOR In Ecuador, Occidental has a 12 percent interest in a company currently constructing an oil export pipeline, which is expected to be completed in 2003. Construction of the pipeline has made it feasible for Occidental to develop the Eden Yuturi field it discovered several years ago in the southeastern corner of Block 15. The development of Eden Yuturi, together with ongoing work in the western portion of the block that is currently in production, is expected to add net incremental production of 30,000 barrels per day in 2004, all of which is expected to be transported through the new pipeline. Occidental has committed to make capital contributions up to its share (currently estimated to be approximately $64 million) of the estimated total project capital requirements. As of December 31, 2002, Occidental has 17 contributed $9 million to the project. Occidental reports this investment in its consolidated statements using the equity method of accounting. The project is being funded in part by senior project debt. The senior project debt is to be repaid with the proceeds of ship or pay tariffs of certain upstream producers in Ecuador, including Occidental. Under their ship or pay commitments, Occidental and the other upstream producers have each assumed their respective share of project specific risks, including construction risk, operating risk and force majeure risk. Occidental would be required to make an advance tariff payment in the event of termination of the agreement authorizing the pipeline company to build the pipeline, prolonged delay in project completion, prolonged force majeure, upstream expropriation events, bankruptcy of the pipeline company or its parent company, abandonment of the project, termination of an investment guarantee agreement with Ecuador, or certain defaults by Occidental. This advance tariff would be used by the pipeline company to service or prepay project debt. Occidentals obligation relating to the pipeline companys senior project debt totaled $101 million, and the completion bonds and other bonds totaled $17 million at December 31, 2002. As Occidental ships product using the pipeline, its overall obligations will decrease with the reduction of the pipeline companys senior project debt. ELK HILLS POWER Occidental and Sempra Energy (Sempra) each has a 50 percent interest in Elk Hills Power LLC, a limited liability company that is currently constructing a gas fired, power generation plant in California. Occidental accounts for this investment using the equity method. In January 2002, Elk Hills Power LLC entered into a $400 million construction loan facility. Occidental guarantees $200 million (50 percent) of the loan facility. At December 31, 2002, approximately $162 million of debt guaranteed by Occidental was outstanding. * CHEMICAL TRANSACTIONS TAFT COGENERATION FACILITY Occidental is leasing a cogeneration facility which was completed in 2002. This facility supplies all the steam and electric power requirements for Occidentals Taft chlor alkali plant at a lower cost than if the plant were to generate its own steam and purchase electricity from a public utility. An owner trust with investors as participating beneficiaries owns the project. The equity participants in the owner trust funded the owner trust with equity during construction in the amount of three percent of the cumulative project costs throughout the period and in an amount in excess of 14 percent of the final project costs upon the commencement of the lease term. In connection with the completion of construction and satisfaction of certain other conditions, the 26 year term of the operating lease commenced in December 2002. At December 31, 2002, Occidental estimates the present value of the remaining lease payments to be $455 million. LEASES Occidental has entered into various operating lease agreements, mainly for railcars, power plants, manufacturing facilities and office space. The leased assets are used in Occidentals operations where leasing offers advantages of greater operating flexibility and generally costs less than alternative methods of funding that were available at the time financing decisions were made. Lease payments are charged to Occidentals operations, mainly as cost of sales. The accounting treatment for the leases described above, including the Taft lease, is dictated by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 13 and other related pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). These leases have been classified as operating leases in accordance with the operating lease criteria. As discussed under "Additional Accounting Changes" (below), FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 46 is expected to result in the consolidation of certain variable interest entities that are owners of plant and equipment Occidental leases from them. The probable consolidation would affect the LaPorte, Texas VCM plant lease. If consolidation were to take place, there would be no significant effect on Occidentals financial condition; however, consolidation would result in an increase in assets of approximately $132 million and liabilities of $154 million, with an after tax charge of approximately $22 million in the third quarter of 2003 that would be recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles. Annual expense for depreciation would increase by approximately $12 million pre tax. If Occidental chose to terminate the leases prior to adoption, there would be no cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles. OXYMAR Occidental has a 78.6 percent ownership interest (before minority interest) in OxyMar. Occidental owns 28.6 percent of OxyMar directly and the OxyVinyls partnership, which is 76 percent owned by Occidental, owns 50 percent. Therefore, after minority interest, Occidentals effective ownership interest is 67 percent. Marubeni Corporation (Marubeni) owns the remaining 21.4 percent of OxyMar, but has a 50 percent voting interest. The OxyMar VCM plant is a modern, efficient manufacturing facility. Occidentals chlorovinyls business derives significant economic benefit from OxyMars operations as the supplier of certain products to OxyMar. OxyMar, in turn, supplies VCM required by Occidental to manufacture PVC. This investment in OxyMar is recorded as an equity investment on the consolidated balance sheet. Occidental guarantees 50 percent of OxyMars $165 million private placement bonds due 2016 and 100 percent of a $220 million revolving line of credit which matures in 2005, under which $105 million was outstanding at December 31, 2002. These amounts are reflected as debt on OxyMars balance sheet. Marubeni has a right to put its interest in OxyMar to Occidental in 2004 by paying approximately $25 million to Occidental and, in connection with this 18 transfer, require Occidental to assume Marubenis guarantee of OxyMars debt. Occidental determined that Marubenis strike price was equal to fair value as of the issue date and assigned a fair value of zero to the option. Therefore, Occidental did not record an asset or liability associated with this put option in the consolidated financial statements. Since the put price was negotiated on arms length terms and has no predetermined conditions that would require exercise of the option, Occidental cannot determine whether Marubeni will exercise its option. Occidental does not expect to record a loss if the option is exercised. If OxyMar were to be consolidated at December 31, 2002, assets would increase by $172 million and liabilities would increase by $163 million on Occidentals consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2002, Occidental had advanced $95 million to OxyMar and had a net equity investment of $30 million. As discussed under "Additional Accounting Changes" (below), FIN No. 46 is expected to result in the consolidation of OxyMar in the third quarter of 2003. This consolidation is not expected to have a significant effect on Occidentals financial condition and will not change Occidentals results of operations. INGLESIDE Occidental and ConocoPhillips (Conoco) each has a 50 percent interest in Ingleside Cogeneration Limited Partnership, a limited partnership (Ingleside LP), which operates a cogeneration plant in Texas. The cogeneration facility supplies all of the steam and electric power requirements to Occidentals Ingleside chlor alkali plant and OxyMars VCM plant at less cost than if these facilities were to produce their own steam and purchase electric power from a public utility. At December 31, 2002, Ingleside LP had approximately $171 million in debt, which is secured by its assets. Occidental has not guaranteed this debt; however, Occidental and Conoco currently each guarantee half of a debt service reserve amount of approximately $8 million. Occidental accounts for this investment using the equity method. * OTHER TRANSACTIONS RECEIVABLES SALE PROGRAM Occidental has an agreement in place to sell, under a revolving sale program, an undivided interest in a designated pool of trade receivables. This program is used by Occidental as a low cost source of working capital funding. The balance of receivables sold at December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $360 million. This amount is not included in the debt and related trade receivables accounts, respectively, on Occidentals consolidated balance sheets. Receivables must meet certain criteria to qualify for the program. Under this program, Occidental serves as the collection agent with respect to the receivables sold. An interest in new receivables is sold as collections are made from customers. Fees and expenses under this program are included in selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses. The fair value of any retained interests in the receivables sold is not material. The buyers of the receivables are protected against significant risk of loss on their purchase of receivables. Occidental provides for allowances for any doubtful receivables based on its periodic evaluation of such receivables. The provisions for such receivables were not material in the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. The program terminates upon certain events, including Occidentals senior debt rating falling below investment grade. In such an event, alternative funding would have to be arranged, which could result in an increase in debt recorded on the consolidated balance sheet, with a corresponding increase in the accounts receivable balance. The consolidated income statement effect of such an event would not be significant. * CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The table below summarizes and cross references certain contractual obligations that are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and or disclosed in the accompanying Notes.

(d) The $360 million receivable sale amount is reflected in the 2006 2007 year column since Occidental could finance the amount with its committed credit line, which becomes due in 2006, if the program is terminated. COMMITMENTS At December 31, 2002, commitments for major capital expenditures during 2003 and thereafter were approximately $158 million. 19 ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL POSITION The changes in the following components of Occidentals balance sheet are discussed below: SELECTED BALANCE SHEET COMPONENTS In millions 2002 2001 Trade receivables, net $ 608 $ 360 Receivables from joint ventures, partnerships and other $ 321 $ 266 Inventories $ 491 $ 414 Income tax receivable $ 150 $ 35 Long term receivables, net $ 275 $ 2,185 Investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries $ 1,056 $ 993 Property, plant and equipment, net $ 13,036 $ 12,791 Current maturities of long term debt and capital lease liabilities $ 206 $ Accounts payable $ 785 $ 715 Accrued liabilities $ 914 $ 849 Dividends payable $ 193 $ 94 Current obligation under natural gas delivery commitment $ $ 137 Long term debt, net $ 3,997 $ 4,065 Long term obligation under natural gas delivery commitment $ $ 145 Other deferred credits and liabilities $ 2,228 $ 2,322 Minority interest $ 333 $ 2,224 Trust Preferred Securities $ 455 $ 463 Stockholders equity $ 6,318 $ 5,634 The higher balance in trade receivables at December 31, 2002, compared with December 31, 2001, reflects higher product prices during the fourth quarter of 2002 versus 2001. The increase in receivables from joint ventures, partnerships and other is due to higher mark to market adjustments on derivative financial instruments in the marketing and trading group. The increase in inventories was primarily the result of higher gas trading inventory. The increase in income tax receivable was due to a tax receivable from the Equistar sale. The decrease in the long term receivables, net, account is due to the redemption of the notes from the Altura partners. The higher balance in investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries primarily reflects the Dolphin Project and Lyondell acquisitions, partially offset by the sale of the Equistar investment. The increase in the net balance in property, plant and equipment reflects capital spending, partially offset by depreciation, depletion and amortization. The increase in current maturities of long term debt reflects a reclassification of the current portion of long term debt. The increase in accounts payable is due to higher payable balances in the oil and gas marketing and trading operations. The increase in accrued liabilities is due to the timing of interest accruals on debt. The increase in dividends payable is due to an early declaration of the first quarter 2003 dividend payable in April 2003. The decrease in long term debt primarily reflects the reclassification of long term debt to current maturities, partially offset by mark to market adjustments related to fair value hedges on a portion of the debt. In accordance with hedge accounting, applicable debt balances are also marked to fair value, which offsets the change in fair value of the derivative. The current and long term portions of the obligations under the natural gas delivery commitment were eliminated since this commitment was terminated in 2002. Other deferred credits and liabilities include deferred compensation, other post retirement benefits, environmental remediation reserves, contract advances, deferred revenue and other deferred items. The decrease in minority interest is due to the redemption of the remaining Altura interests in May 2002. The 2002 minority interest balance also includes $75 million of preferred stock issued to a financial institution by a subsidiary of Occidental in December 2002. The increase in stockholders equity primarily reflects net income, partially offset by dividends on common stock. FINANCING ACTIVITY In 2003, Occidental expects to record a pre tax interest charge of $50 $70 million to repay a $450 million 6.4 percent senior notes issue that has ten years of remaining life, but is subject to remarketing on April 1, 2003. Occidental intends to refinance part of this issue on a long term basis. In February 2002, Occidental filed a shelf registration statement for up to $1 billion of its senior debt securities, subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units, preferred securities of two subsidiary trusts and Occidentals guarantees of such preferred securities. In November 2002, Occidental issued $175 million of 4 percent Medium Term Senior Notes, Series C, and $75 million of 4.101 percent Medium Term Senior Notes, Series C, due 2007 for net combined proceeds of approximately $249 million. The net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. Occidental may issue the remaining $750 million under its medium term notes program, which includes its Medium Term Senior Notes, Series C and its Medium Term Subordinated Notes, Series A. On November 15, 2002, Occidental repaid $163 million of 6.75 percent senior notes. During 2002, Occidental also redeemed approximately $35 million of medium term notes with a weighted average coupon rate of approximately 7.66 percent. In December 2002, a subsidiary of Occidental issued $75 million of preferred stock to a financial institution. Occidental retains all common shares of the subsidiary and elects the majority of the directors. The subsidiary is the holding company for a number of international subsidiaries of Occidental. In the event that the subsidiary fails to pay preferred dividends for two consecutive quarters or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the holder of the preferred stock could gain control of the subsidiarys board of directors. In December 2001, Occidental issued $300 million of 5.875 percent senior notes due 2007 and $500 million of 6.750 percent senior notes due 2012 for net combined proceeds of approximately $794 million. Approximately $700 million of the net proceeds were used to extinguish the Altura non recourse debt. The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. On March 5, 2001, Occidental retired $20.5 million of 7.8 percent pollution control revenue bonds due on December 1, 2005. At January 2, 2003, Occidental had approximately $1.8 billion of committed credit lines, which are all available and are utilized, as needed, for daily operating 20 and other purposes. These lines of credit are primarily used to back up the issuance of commercial paper. Occidental expects to have sufficient cash in 2003 from operations, and from proceeds from existing credit facilities, as necessary, for its operating needs, capital expenditure requirements, dividend payments, mandatory debt repayments and other commitments. In the event of fluctuations in operating cash flow, Occidental has the ability to vary its discretionary cash outflow, such as capital expenditures. ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND COMMITMENTS 2002 DOLPHIN PROJECT INVESTMENT In November 2002, Occidental closed a transaction with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Offsets Group in which Occidental acquired a 24.5 percent interest in DEL, the operator of the Dolphin Project, for a total of $342 million. DEL is a company that also includes as shareholders the UAE Offsets Group (51 percent interest) and TotalFinaElf (24.5 percent interest). The amount has been allocated, on a preliminary basis, primarily to investment in unconsolidated entities. Occidental will also be responsible for its 24.5 percent share of costs on an ongoing basis. LYONDELL EQUISTAR TRANSACTION In August 2002, Occidental and Lyondell Chemical Company completed an agreement for Occidental to sell its 29.5 percent share of Equistar to Lyondell and to purchase a 21 percent equity interest in Lyondell. Occidental entered into these transactions to diversify its petrochemicals interests. These transactions also reduced Occidentals direct exposure to petrochemicals volatility, yet allowed it to preserve, through its Lyondell investment, an economic upside when the petrochemicals industry recovers. In connection with these transactions, Occidental wrote down its investment in the Equistar partnership to fair value by recording a $412 million pre tax charge as of December 2001. After the write down, the net book value of Occidentals investment in Equistar at December 31, 2001, after considering tax effects, approximated the fair value of the Lyondell shares Occidental expected to receive, less transaction costs. Occidental recorded an after tax gain of $164 million in the third quarter of 2002, as a result of closing these transactions on August 22, 2002. Occidentals initial carrying value of the Lyondell investment was $489 million, which represented the fair value of Lyondells shares at closing. PAKISTAN ACQUISITION In 2002, Occidental increased its ownership in Badin Block 1 and 2R by purchasing additional interests in these two blocks from the government of Pakistan for approximately $72 million. DISPOSITION OF CHROME AND VULCAN In the fourth quarter of 2002, Occidental sold its chrome business at Castle Hayne, North Carolina for $25 million and its calendering operations (Vulcan) for a $6 million note receivable. In the third quarter of 2002, Occidental recorded an after tax impairment charge of $69 million and classified both of these businesses as discontinued operations. The fair value of these businesses was determined by the expected sales proceeds from third party buyers. When these transactions closed, no significant gain or loss was recorded. 2001 SALE OF INTRASTATE PIPELINE On August 31, 2001, Occidental sold its interest in a subsidiary that owned a Texas intrastate pipeline system. The entity was sold to Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. for $360 million. Occidental recorded an after tax loss of approximately $272 million in connection with this transaction. SALE OF INDONESIA GAS PROPERTIES On July 10, 2001, Occidental completed the sale of its interest in the Tangguh LNG project in Indonesia to Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan for proceeds of $503 million. Occidental recorded an after tax gain of approximately $399 million for this transaction. 2000 MILNE POINT ASSET SWAP On December 4, 2000, Occidental completed an agreement with BP to obtain BPs interest in a carbon dioxide field in New Mexico and related pipelines in exchange for Occidentals interest in the Milne Point oil field in Alaska, together with additional cash consideration. The BP properties acquired had a book value of $51 million, and Occidental paid $14 million as additional consideration. The gain on this transaction was immaterial. OXYMAR PURCHASE On November 29, 2000, OxyChem purchased a 28.6 percent interest in OxyMar, a Texas general partnership that owns the Ingleside, Texas VCM facility operated by OxyChem. The interest was purchased from U.S. VCM Corporation, an affiliate of Marubeni Corporation, which continues to own a 21.4 percent interest and remains a 50 percent partner for corporate governance purposes. Occidental received approximately $37 million relating to the purchase and, as a result, agreed to guarantee an additional $110 million of OxyMars debt. The $37 million was recorded as a reduction to Occidentals investment in OxyMar. OxyVinyls owns the remaining 50 percent interest. No gain or loss was recognized on this transaction. ECUADOR FARM OUT On November 1, 2000, Occidental agreed to farm out a partial economic interest in its Block 15 operations in Ecuador to AEC, now EnCana, for $68 million. EnCana earns a 40 percent interest in the block and will reimburse Occidental for certain capital costs through 2004 estimated at $110 million. Occidental remains the operator of Block 15. The gain on this transaction was not significant. 21 SALE OF DUREZ On November 1, 2000, Occidental completed the sale of its Durez phenolic resins and compounding businesses and assets to Sumitomo Bakelite Co., Ltd. for gross proceeds of approximately $150 million. There was a $13 million after tax gain on this transaction. GULF OF MEXICO TRANSACTIONS On August 15, 2000, Occidental completed agreements with respect to two transactions with Apache Corporation involving Occidentals interests in the Continental Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). Occidental entered into a volumetric production payment (VPP) transaction to deliver, over 36 months, a substantial portion of its share of the proved developed producing gas reserves from these GOM interests to Apache amounting to 86 Bcf, for approximately $280 million. The value attributed to the production payment was based on price curves existing at the time the transaction was entered into. The $280 million, which represented the initial fair value of Occidentals obligation to deliver future gas production, was deferred and is being recognized in income as the gas is delivered. Occidental retained ownership of the first 2.7 million barrels of oil, which is being used to pay for the VPP production costs. Occidental believes this amount is sufficient to cover these costs. The remaining amount of this retained interest at December 31, 2002 was 0.4 million barrels, or approximately $12 million. Occidental also agreed to sell a 60 percent interest in the subsidiary that holds a residual interest, post VPP, in the GOM assets for approximately $62 million. As a result of this sale and the consequent elimination of a portion of Occidentals responsibility for abandonment liabilities, Occidental recorded an after tax gain of $39 million. Approximately 70 percent of the gain was the result of the elimination of the abandonment liability. As part of these transactions, Apache was granted four annual call options, each of which gives them the right to purchase for $11 million an additional 10 percent of the entity holding the residual interest in the GOM assets. Occidental also was granted four annual put options with generally similar provisions. Nominal value was attributed to the call and put options. Apache exercised the call options that became available in 2001 and 2002. Gains resulting from each exercise of the options were not material. SALE OF PERU PROPERTIES On May 8, 2000, Occidental completed an agreement to sell its producing properties in Peru to Pluspetrol for $30 million. In connection with this transaction, Occidental recorded an after tax charge of approximately $29 million in December 1999 to write down the properties to their fair values. THUMS ACQUISITION On April 24, 2000, Occidental completed the acquisition of THUMS, the field contractor of the Long Beach Unit, an oil and gas production unit, for approximately $68 million. ALTURA ACQUISITION On April 19, 2000, Occidental completed its acquisition of all of the common interest in Altura, the largest oil producer in Texas. The acquisition was valued at approximately $3.6 billion. Occidental paid approximately $1.2 billion to the sellers, affiliates of BP and Royal Dutch/Shell Group (Shell), to acquire the common limited partnership interest and control of the general partner, which manages, operates and controls 100 percent of the Altura assets. The partnership borrowed approximately $2.4 billion, which had recourse only to the Altura assets. The $2.4 billion loan had been completely repaid by the end of 2001. The partnership also loaned approximately $2.0 billion to affiliates of the sellers, evidenced by two notes, which provide credit support to the partnership. The sellers retained a preferred limited partnership interest of approximately $2.0 billion and were entitled to certain distributions from the partnership. Occidental exercised an option in May 2002 to redeem the remaining partnership interests of $2.0 billion held by affiliates of BP and Shell in exchange for the notes receivable of $2.0 billion to the partnership. SALE OF CANADIANOXY INVESTMENT On April 18, 2000, Occidental completed the sale of its 29.2 percent stake in CanadianOxy for gross proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion Canadian. This sale resulted in a net pre tax gain of approximately $493 million. In addition, Occidental and CanadianOxy exchanged their respective 15 percent interests in joint businesses of approximately equal value, resulting in Occidental owning 100 percent of an oil and gas operation in Ecuador and CanadianOxy owning 100 percent of sodium chlorate operations in Canada and Louisiana. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Commitments at December 31, 2002 for major capital expenditures during 2003 and thereafter were approximately $158 million. Total capital expenditures for 2003 are estimated to be approximately $1.3 billion. Occidental will fund these commitments and capital expenditures with cash from operations and proceeds from existing credit facilities as necessary. DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES AND MARKET RISK GENERAL Occidentals market risk exposures relate primarily to commodity prices and, to a lesser extent, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Occidental periodically enters into derivative instrument transactions to reduce these price and rate fluctuations. A derivative is a financial instrument which derives its value from another instrument or variable. In general, the fair value recorded for derivative instruments is based on quoted market prices, dealer quotes and the Black Scholes or similar valuation models. 22 ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES AND DEFINITIONS Occidental accounts for its derivatives under the provisions of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138 (collectively SFAS No. 133). Under SFAS No. 133, recognition of the gain or loss that results from recording and adjusting a derivative to fair market value depends on the purpose for issuing or holding the derivative. Gains and losses from derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized immediately in earnings. A hedge is considered effective if changes in its value are offset exactly by changes in the value of the item being hedged. A hedge is ineffective to the extent changes in its value are not matched by offsetting changes in value for the item being hedged. If a derivative is used to hedge the fair value of an asset or liability (fair value hedge), the gains or losses from adjusting the derivative to its market value are recognized in earnings immediately and to the extent the hedge is effective, offset the concurrent recognition in earnings of changes in the fair value of the hedged item. Gains or losses from derivatives used to hedge future cash flows (cash flow hedges) are recorded on the balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI), a component of stockholders equity, until the transaction that is hedged is recognized in earnings. However, to the extent the value of the derivative differs from the value of the anticipated cash flows of the hedged transaction, the hedge is considered partly ineffective and the resulting gains or losses are recognized immediately in earnings. COMMODITY PRICE RISK GENERAL Occidentals results are sensitive to fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices. Based on current levels of production, if oil prices vary overall by $1 per barrel, it would have approximately a $110 million annual effect on income, before U.S. income tax. If natural gas prices vary by $0.10 per million Btu (MMBtu), it would have approximately a $19 million annual effect on income, before U.S. income tax. If production levels change in the future, the sensitivity of Occidentals results to oil and gas prices also would change. Occidentals results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices. If chlorine or caustic soda prices vary by $10/ton, it would have approximately a $10 million and $26 million, respectively, annual effect on income before U.S. income taxes. If PVC prices vary by $.01/lb, it would have approximately a $35 million annual effect on income, before U.S. income taxes. If EDC prices vary by $10/ton, it would have approximately a $6 million annual effect on income, before U.S. income taxes. According to Chemical Market Associates, Inc., December 2002 average contract prices were: chlorine $215/ton, caustic soda $148/ton, PVC $0.37/lb and EDC $220/ton. MARKETING AND TRADING OPERATIONS Occidental periodically uses different types of derivative instruments to achieve the best prices for oil and gas. Derivatives are also used by Occidental to reduce its exposure to price volatility and mitigate fluctuations in commodity related cash flows. Occidental enters into low risk marketing and trading activities through its separate marketing organization, which operates under established policy controls and procedures. With respect to derivatives used in its oil and gas marketing operations, Occidental utilizes a combination of futures, forwards, options and swaps to offset various physical transactions. Overall, Occidental usually remains unhedged to long term oil and gas prices and its use of derivatives in hedging activity remains at a low level. In September 2002, Occidental unwound its natural gas delivery commitment and corresponding natural gas price swap which were entered into in November 1998. Occidental recognized a pre tax loss of $3 million related to these transactions. RISK MANAGEMENT Occidental conducts its risk management activities for energy commodities (which include buying, selling, marketing, trading, and hedging activities) under the controls and governance of the Risk Management Policy. The Chief Financial Officer and Risk Management Committee oversee these controls, which are implemented and enforced by the Trading Control Officer. The Trading Control Officer provides an independent and separate check on results of marketing and trading activities. Controls for energy commodities include limits on credit, limits on trading, segregation of duties, delegation of authority and a number of other policy and procedural controls. FAIR VALUE OF CONTRACTS The following tables reconcile the changes in the fair value of Occidentals marketing and trading contracts during 2002 and 2001 and segregate the open contracts at December 31, 2002 by maturity periods. in millions 2002 2001 Fair value of contracts outstanding at beginning of year $ 7 $ (66) Gains on contracts realized or otherwise settled during the year (1) (30) Changes in fair value attributable to changes in valuation techniques and assumptions Other changes in fair values 28 103 Fair value of contracts outstanding at end of year $ 34 $ 7 Maturity Periods 2004 2006 2008 Total Source of to to and Fair Fair Value 2003 2005 2007 thereafter Value Prices actively quoted $ (12) $ 6 $ 2 $ 2 $ (2) Prices provided by other external sources 35 7 (8) 2 36 Prices based on models and other valuation methods (5) 5 TOTAL $ 18 $ 18 $ (6) $ 4 $ 34 23 The tables above include the fair value of physical positions and the fair value of the related financial instruments for trading and marketing operations. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the physical positions were a net gain of $42 million and a net loss of $2 million, respectively. The value of the derivative financial instruments that offset these physical positions are a net loss of $8 million at December 31, 2002 and a net gain of $9 million at December 31, 2001. Gains and losses are netted in the statement of operations. On the balance sheets, except where a right of set off exists, gains are recognized as assets and losses are recognized as liabilities. COMMODITY HEDGES On a limited basis, Occidental uses cash flow hedges for the sale of crude oil and natural gas. Crude oil cash flow hedges were executed for approximately 20 percent and 29 percent of total U.S. oil production in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Natural gas cash flow hedges were executed for approximately 7 percent of total U.S. 2002 gas production. Occidentals commodity cash flow hedging instruments were highly effective. At December 31, 2002, all of these cash flow hedges were settled. No fair value hedges were used for oil and gas production during 2002. QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION Occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of derivatives and commodity contracts used in trading activities. This method determines the maximum potential negative short term change in fair value with a 95 percent level of confidence. For non trading activities, there were no material amounts outstanding at December 31, 2002. The value at risk for both oil and natural gas is summarized below: MARKETING AND TRADING VALUE AT RISK For the years ended December 31 (in millions) 2002 2001 Value at Risk Oil High during the year $ 1 $ 1 Low during the year Average for the year 1 1 Value at Risk Natural Gas High during the year $ 1 $ 1 Low during the year Average for the year 1 1 INTEREST RATE RISK GENERAL Occidental is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates and it enters into various derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate exposure. Interest rate swaps, forward locks and futures contracts are entered into periodically as part of Occidentals overall strategy. HEDGING ACTIVITIES Occidental has entered into several interest rate swaps that qualified for fair value hedge accounting. These derivatives effectively convert approximately $1.3 billion of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt with maturities ranging from 2005 to 2008. Occidental was a party to a series of forward interest rate locks, which qualified as cash flow hedges. The hedges were related to the construction of a cogeneration plant that was completed in December 2002 and leased by Occidental concurrently. The associated loss on the hedges through December 2002 is approximately $21 million after tax, which is recorded in accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) and will be recognized in earnings over the lease term of 26 years on a straight line basis. Certain of Occidentals equity investees have entered into additional derivative instruments that qualified as cash flow hedges. Occidental reflects its proportionate share of these cash flow hedges in OCI.

(b) Excludes $8 million of unamortized discounts. CREDIT RISK Occidentals energy contracts are spread among numerous counterparties. Creditworthiness is reviewed before doing business with a new counterparty and on an ongoing basis. Occidental monitors aggregated counterparty exposure relative to credit limits, and manages credit enhancement issues. Credit exposure for each customer is monitored for outstanding balances, current month activity, and forward mark to market exposure. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK Several of Occidentals foreign operations are located in countries whose currencies generally depreciate against the U.S. dollar on a continuing basis. Typically, effective currency forward markets do not exist for these countries. Therefore, Occidental attempts to manage its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions only at levels necessary for operating purposes. Generally, 24 international crude oil sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Additionally, all of Occidentals oil and gas foreign entities have the U.S. dollar as the functional currency. However, in one foreign chemical subsidiary where the local currency is the functional currency, Occidental has exposure on U.S. dollar denominated debt that is not material. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, Occidental had not entered into any foreign currency derivative instruments. The effect of exchange rate transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income. DERIVATIVE AND FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES The following table shows derivative financial instruments included in the consolidated balance sheets: Balance at December 31, (in millions) 2002 2001 Derivative financial instrument assets (a) Current $ 164 $ 116 Non current 157 120 $ 321 $ 236 Derivative financial instrument liabilities (a) Current $ 115 $ 102 Non current 23 119 $ 138 $ 221 (a) Amounts include energy trading contracts. As a result of fair value swaps, the amount of interest expense recorded in the income statement is lower by approximately $45 million and $7 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The following table summarizes after tax derivative activity recorded in OCI: For the years ended December 31 (in millions) 2002 2001 Beginning Balance $ (20) $ Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (27) (Losses) gains from changes in current cash flow hedges (14) 11 Amount reclassified to income 8 (4) Ending Balance $ (26) $ (20) During the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, an $8 million after tax loss and a $4 million after tax gain, respectively, were reclassified from OCI into earnings, resulting from the expiration of cash flow hedges when the hedged transactions closed. During the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, a net unrealized after tax loss of $14 million and a net unrealized after tax gain of $11 million, respectively, were recorded to OCI relating to changes in current cash flow hedges. During the next twelve months, Occidental expects that $3 million of net derivative after tax losses included in OCI, based on their valuation at December 31, 2002, will be reclassified into earnings when the hedged transactions close. Hedge ineffectiveness did not have a significant impact on earnings for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. ACCOUNTING FOR ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES In the third quarter of 2002, Occidental adopted certain provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 02 3, "Issues involved in Accounting for Contracts under Issue No. 98 10." These provisions prescribe significant changes in how revenue from energy trading is recorded. Occidental has two major types of oil and gas revenues: (1) Revenues from its equity production; and (2) revenues from the sale of oil and gas produced by other companies, but purchased and resold by Occidental, referred to as revenue from trading activities. Both types of sales involve physical deliveries and had been historically recorded on a gross basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. With the adoption of EITF Issue No. 02 3, Occidental now reflects the revenue from trading activities on a net basis. There were no changes in gross margins, net income, cash flow or earnings per share for any period as a result of adopting this requirement. However, net sales and cost of sales were reduced by equal and offsetting amounts to reflect the adoption of this requirement. Occidental has not engaged in any of the round trip trading activities that were the focus of the FERCs energy industry investigation activity in 2002. For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, net sales and cost of sales were reduced from amounts previously reported by approximately $2.2 billion (representing amounts for the first two quarters of 2002), $5.8 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, to conform to the current presentation. Since 1999, Occidental has accounted for certain energy trading contracts in accordance with EITF Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities." EITF Issue No. 98 10 required that all energy trading contracts must be marked to fair value with gains and losses included in earnings, whether the contracts were derivatives or not. In October 2002, the EITF rescinded EITF Issue No. 98 10 thus precluding mark to market accounting for all energy trading contracts that are not derivatives and fair value accounting for inventories purchased from third parties. Also, the rescission requires derivative gains and losses to be presented net on the income statement, whether or not they are physically settled, if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes. Occidental will adopt this accounting change in the first quarter of 2003 and expects to record a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles charge of approximately $19 million, after tax. Starting January 1, 2003, Occidental no longer records energy trading contracts that are not derivatives on a mark to market basis. TAXES Deferred tax liabilities were $868 million at December 31, 2002, net of deferred tax assets of $733 million. The current portion of the deferred tax assets of $114 million is included in prepaid expenses and other. The net deferred tax assets are expected to be realized through future operating income and reversal of taxable temporary differences. 25 LAWSUITS, CLAIMS, COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND RELATED MATTERS Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OPC) and certain of its subsidiaries have been named in a substantial number of lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings. These actions seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties or other losses; or injunctive or declaratory relief. OPC and certain of its subsidiaries also have been named in proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and similar federal, state and local environmental laws. These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages and civil penalties; however, Occidental is usually one of many companies in these proceedings and has to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, including environmental proceedings, Occidental accrues reserves when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. During the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions. Taxable years prior to 1996 are closed for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Taxable years 1996 through 2000 are in various stages of audit by the Internal Revenue Service. Disputes arise during the course of such audits as to facts and matters of law. At December 31, 2002, commitments for major capital expenditures during 2003 and thereafter were approximately $158 million. Occidental has entered into agreements providing for future payments to secure terminal and pipeline capacity, drilling services, electrical power, steam and certain chemical raw materials. At December 31, 2002, the net present value of the fixed and determinable portion of the obligations under these agreements, which were used to collateralize financings of the respective suppliers, aggregated $94 million, which was payable as follows (in millions): 2003 $21, 2004 $19, 2005 $16, 2006 $14, 2007 $11 and 2008 through 2019 $13. Fixed payments under these agreements were $27 million in 2002, $20 million in 2001 and $42 million in 2000. Occidental has certain other commitments under contracts, guarantees and joint ventures, and certain other contingent liabilities. Many of these commitments, although not fixed or determinable, involve capital expenditures and are part of the $1.3 billion capital expenditures estimated for 2003. As discussed under "Additional Accounting Changes" (below), FIN No. 45 requires the disclosure in Occidentals financial statements of information relating to guarantees issued by Occidental and outstanding at December 31, 2002. These guarantees encompass performance bonds, letters of credit, indemnities, commitments and other forms of guarantees provided by Occidental to third parties, mainly to provide assurance that Occidental and or its subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations ("guarantees"). At December 31, 2002, the notional amount of the guarantees was approximately $1 billion. Of this amount, approximately $700 million relates to Occidentals guarantee of equity investees debt and other commitments. An additional $200 million relates to the LaPorte, Texas VCM plant operating lease and other equipment leases. The foregoing items have also been discussed above in the "Additional Considerations Regarding Funding and Liquidity" section, specifically, the debt guarantees relating to OxyMar and Elk Hills Power, the guarantees on debt and other commitments relating to the Ecuador pipeline and the residual value guarantee of the LaPorte, Texas VCM plant operating lease. The remaining $100 million relates to various indemnities and guarantees provided to third parties. Occidental has indemnified various parties against specified liabilities that those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with Occidental. These indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds. As of December 31, 2002, Occidental is not aware of circumstances that would lead to future indemnity claims against it for material amounts in connection with these transactions. It is impossible at this time to determine the ultimate liabilities that OPC and its subsidiaries may incur resulting from any lawsuits, claims and proceedings, audits, commitments, contingencies and related matters. If these matters were to be ultimately resolved unfavorably at amounts substantially exceeding Occidentals reserves, an outcome not currently anticipated, it is possible that such outcome could have a material adverse effect upon Occidentals consolidated financial position or results of operations. However, after taking into account reserves, management does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of these matters to have a material adverse effect upon Occidentals consolidated financial position or results of operations. ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES Occidentals operations in the United States are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to improving or maintaining the quality of the environment. Foreign operations also are subject to environmental protection laws. Costs associated with environmental compliance have increased over time and are generally expected to rise in the future. Environmental expenditures related to current operations are factored into the overall business planning process. These expenditures are mainly considered an integral part of production in manufacturing quality products responsive to market demand. ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION The laws which require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively to past waste disposal practices and releases. In many cases, the laws apply regardless of fault, legality of the original activities or current ownership or control of sites. 26 OPC or certain of its subsidiaries are currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups under these laws at federal Superfund sites, comparable state sites and other remediation sites, including Occidental facilities and previously owned sites. Also, OPC and certain of its subsidiaries have been involved in a substantial number of governmental and private proceedings involving historical practices at various sites including, in some instances, having been named in proceedings under CERCLA and similar federal, state and local environmental laws. These proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages and civil penalties. Occidental manages its environmental remediation efforts through a wholly owned subsidiary, Glenn Springs Holdings, Inc. (GSH), which reports its results directly to Occidentals corporate management. The following table presents Occidentals environmental remediation reserves at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 grouped by three categories of environmental remediation sites: ($ amounts in millions) 2002 2001 2000 # of # of # of Sites Reserve Sites Reserve Sites Reserve CERCLA & Equivalent Sites 124 $ 284 126 $ 320 127 $ 263 Active Facilities 14 46 14 59 14 66 Closed or Sold Facilities 44 63 47 75 49 73 TOTAL 182 $ 393 187 $ 454 190 $ 402 In determining the environmental remediation reserves, Occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience, available technology, regulations in effect, the timing of remediation and cost sharing arrangements. Occidental expects that it will continue to incur additional liabilities beyond those recorded for environmental remediation at these and other sites. The range of reasonably possible loss for existing environmental remediation matters could be up to $400 million beyond the amount accrued. Many factors could result in changes to Occidentals environmental reserves and reasonably possible range of loss. The most significant are: >> The original cost estimate may have been inaccurate. >> Modified remedial measures might be necessary to achieve the required remediation results. Occidental generally assumes that the remedial objective can be achieved using the most cost effective technology reasonably expected to achieve that objective. Such technologies may include air sparging or phyto remediation of shallow groundwater, or limited surface soil removal or in situ treatment producing acceptable risk assessment results. Should such remedies fail to achieve remedial objectives, more intensive or costly measures may be required. >> The remedial measure might take more or less time than originally anticipated to achieve the required contaminant reduction. Site specific time estimates can be affected by factors such as groundwater capture rates, anomalies in subsurface geology, interactions between or among water bearing zones and non water bearing zones, or the ability to identify and control contaminant sources. >> The regulatory agency might ultimately reject or modify Occidentals proposed remedial plan and insist upon a different course of action. Additionally, other events might occur that could affect Occidentals future remediation costs, such as: >> The discovery of more extensive contamination than had been originally anticipated. For some sites with impacted groundwater, accurate definition of contaminant plumes requires years of monitoring data and computer modeling. Migration of contaminants may follow unexpected pathways along geologic anomalies that could initially go undetected. Additionally, the size of the area requiring remediation may change based upon risk assessment results following site characterization or interim remedial measures. >> Remediation technology might improve to decrease the cost of remediation. In particular, for groundwater remediation sites with projected long term operation and maintenance, the development of more effective treatment technology, or acceptance of alternative and more cost effective treatment methodologies such as bio remediation, could significantly affect remediation costs. >> Laws and regulations might change to impose more or less stringent remediation requirements.

CERCLA AND EQUIVALENT SITES At December 31, 2002, OPC or certain of its subsidiaries have been named in 124 CERCLA or state equivalent proceedings, as shown below. Number Reserve Description ($ amounts in millions) of Sites Balance Minimal/No Exposure (a) 102 $ 7 Reserves between $1 10 MM 14 54 Reserves over $10 MM 8 223 TOTAL 124 $ 284 (a) Includes 33 sites for which Maxus Energy Corporation has retained the liability and indemnified Occidental, 7 sites where Occidental has denied liability without challenge, 48 sites where Occidentals reserves are less than $50,000 each, and 14 sites where reserves are between $50,000 and $1 million each. The eight sites with individual reserves over $10 million in 2002 are a former copper mining and smelting operation in Tennessee, two closed landfills in Western New York, groundwater treatment facilities at three former chemical plants (Western New York, Montague, Michigan and Tacoma, Washington), replacement of a municipal drinking water treatment plant in Western New York, and various sediment clean up actions in Washington. 27 ACTIVE FACILITIES Certain subsidiaries of OPC are currently addressing releases of substances from past operations at 14 active facilities. Three facilities certain oil and gas properties in the southwestern United States, a chemical plant in Louisiana, and a phosphorous recovery operation in Tennessee account for 62 percent of the reserves associated with these facilities. CLOSED OR SOLD FACILITIES There are 44 sites formerly owned or operated by certain subsidiaries of OPC that have ongoing environmental remediation requirements. Three sites account for 66 percent of the reserves associated with this group. The three sites are: an active refinery in Louisiana where Occidental indemnifies the current owner and operator for certain remedial actions, a water treatment facility at a former coal mine in Pennsylvania, and a former chemical plant in West Virginia. ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS Occidentals costs, some of which may include estimates, relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations, are shown below for each segment: In millions 2002 2001 2000 OPERATING EXPENSES Oil and Gas $ 32 $ 22 $ 17 Chemical 46 47 51 $ 78 $ 69 $ 68 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Oil and Gas $ 70 $ 60 $ 27 Chemical 16 19 20 $ 86 $ 79 $ 47 REMEDIATION EXPENSES Corporate $ 23 $ 109 $ ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES Corporate $ 393 $ 454 $ 402 Operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis. Capital expenditures relate to longer lived improvements in currently operating facilities. Remediation expenses relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and do not contribute to current or future revenue generation. Although total costs may vary in any one year, over the long term, segment operating and capital expenditures for environmental compliance generally are expected to increase. Eight counties in the Houston Galveston area are subject to a federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mandate to adopt a plan for implementing certain requirements of the federal Clean Air Act, known as a State Implementation Plan. In October 2001, the EPA approved a State Implementation Plan for the Houston Galveston area (the Plan). In December 2002, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality revised the regulations associated with the Plan. The revised Plan contains provisions requiring the reduction of 80 percent of current nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and 60 percent of the volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions in the Houston Galveston area by November 2007. Occidental operates six facilities that will be subject to the Plans NOx and VOC reduction requirements. Occidental estimates that over the next several years its capital expenditures will increase by a total of $70 $120 million for environmental control and monitoring equipment necessary to comply with the Plan, depending on the amount of emissions reduction that is ultimately required. Occidental began expending the capital necessary to comply with the Plan in 2001 and expects expenditures to end in 2007, although the timing of the expenditures will vary by facility. Occidental presently estimates that capital expenditures for environmental compliance (including the Plan discussed above) will be approximately $72 million for 2003 and $95 million for 2004. FOREIGN INVESTMENTS Portions of Occidentals assets outside North America are exposed to political and economic risks. Occidental conducts its financial affairs so as to mitigate its exposure against those risks. At December 31, 2002, the carrying value of Occidentals assets in countries outside North America aggregated approximately $2.8 billion, or approximately 17 percent of Occidentals total assets at that date. Of such assets, approximately $1.9 billion are located in the Middle East, approximately $628 million are located in Latin America, and substantially all of the remainder are located in Pakistan. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The process of preparing financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the management of Occidental to make estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions. It is possible that materially different amounts could be recorded if these estimates and judgments change or if the actual results differ from these estimates and judgments. Occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies which involve the judgment of Occidentals management. OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES Occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties. Under this method, costs of acquiring properties, costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration costs, geological, geophysical and seismic costs and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids (NGLs) that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty can be recovered in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions considering future production and development costs. There are several factors which could change Occidentals recorded oil and gas reserves. Significantly higher or lower product prices could lead to changes in the amount of reserves due to economic limits or the effects of production sharing contracts. Occidental receives a share of production from production sharing contracts to recover its costs and an additional share for 28 profit. Occidentals share of production from these contracts decreases when oil prices improve and increases when oil prices decline. Overall, Occidentals net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices. In other contractual arrangements, sustained lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of reserves becomes uneconomical. This, in turn, could lead to a reduction in the quantity of recorded reserves. An additional factor that could result in a change of recorded reserves is the reservoir decline rates being different than those assumed when the reserves were initially recorded. Estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond Occidentals control, such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs. Overall, Occidentals revisions to recorded proved reserves were positive for 2002, 2001 and 2000 and amounted to less than 1 percent, 1 percent and 7 percent, respectively. Additionally, Occidental is required to perform impairment tests pursuant to SFAS No. 144 when prices decline and or reserve estimates change significantly. There have been no impairments over the past three years. Depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties is determined by the unit of production method and could change with revisions to estimated proved recoverable reserves. The change in the depreciation and depletion rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous reserve estimates has been immaterial. If Occidentals oil and gas reserves were to change based on the factors mentioned above, the most significant impact would be on the depreciation and depletion rate. A 5 percent increase in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the rate from $4.27/barrel to $4.06/barrel, which would increase net income by $26 million annually. A 5 percent decrease in the oil and gas reserves would change the rate from $4.27/barrel to $4.48/barrel and would result in a decrease in net income of $26 million annually. A portion of the carrying value of Occidentals oil and gas properties are attributable to unproved properties. At December 31, 2002, the costs attributable to unproved properties were approximately $1.3 billion. These costs are not currently being depreciated or depleted. As exploration and development work progresses and the reserves on these properties are proven, capitalized costs of the properties will be subject to depreciation and depletion. If the development work were to be unsuccessful, the capitalized costs of the properties related to this unsuccessful work would be expensed in the year in which the determination was made. The timing of any writedowns of these unproven properties, if warranted, depends upon the nature, timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results. Occidental believes its exploration and development efforts will allow it to fully realize the unproved property balance. CHEMICAL ASSETS The most critical accounting policy affecting Occidentals chemical assets is the determination of the estimated useful lives of its property, plant and equipment. The estimated useful lives of Occidentals chemical assets, which range from 3 years to 50 years, are used to compute depreciation expense and are also used for impairment tests. The estimated useful lives used for the chemical facilities were based on the assumption that Occidental would provide an appropriate level of annual capital expenditures while the plants are still in operation. Without these continued capital expenditures, the useful lives of these plants could significantly decrease. Other factors which could change the estimated useful lives of Occidentals chemical plants include higher or lower product prices, feedstock costs, energy prices, environmental regulations, competition and technological changes. Occidental is required to perform impairment tests on its assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when managements plans change with respect to those assets. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 144, Occidental must compare the undiscounted future cash flows of an asset to its carrying value. The key factors that could significantly affect future cash flows are future product prices, feedstock costs, energy costs and remaining estimated useful life. Due to a temporary decrease in demand for some of its products, Occidental temporarily idled an EDC plant in June 2001, and a chlor alkali plant in December 2001. These facilities will remain idle until market conditions improve. Management expects that both of these plants will become operational in the future. The net book value of these two plants was $150 million at December 31, 2002. These facilities were tested for impairment at the time they were temporarily idled and, based on the results, no impairment was deemed necessary for these two facilities. Occidental continues to depreciate these facilities based on their remaining estimated useful lives. Occidentals chemical plants are depreciated using either the unit of production or straight line method based upon the estimated useful life of the facilities. The change in the depreciation rate over the prior three years has been immaterial. If the estimated useful lives of Occidentals chemical plants were to decrease based on the factors mentioned above, the most significant impact would be on depreciation expense. If the estimated remaining useful lives were to decrease by 10 percent, the annual depreciation charge would increase from $164 million to $182 million. 29 ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS AND CONTINGENCIES Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Reserves for estimated costs that relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future revenue generation are recorded when environmental remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. In determining the reserves, Occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience, available technology, regulations in effect, the timing of remediation and cost sharing arrangements. The environmental reserves are based on managements estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred and are reviewed periodically and adjusted as additional or new information becomes available. For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, Occidental has not accrued any reimbursements or recoveries as assets. Recoveries and reimbursements are recorded in income when receipt is probable. Environmental reserves are recorded on a discounted basis only when a reserve is initially established and the aggregate amount of the estimated costs for a specific site and the timing of cash payments are reliably determinable. The reserve methodology for a specific site is not modified once it has been established. At sites involving multiple parties, Occidental provides environmental reserves based upon its expected share of liability. When other parties are jointly liable, the financial viability of the parties, the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to Occidental of their failure to participate are evaluated when estimating the companys ultimate share of liability. Occidental believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of other potentially responsible parties, with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, in an amount that would have a material effect on Occidentals consolidated financial position or liquidity or results of operations. Most cost sharing arrangements with other parties fall into one of the following three categories: Category 1: CERCLA or state equivalent sites wherein Occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties share the cost of remediation in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations; Category 2: Oil and gas joint ventures wherein each joint venture partner pays its proportionate share of remedial cost; and Category 3: Contractual arrangements typically relating to purchases and sales of property wherein the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating the costs of environmental remediation. In all three of these categories, Occidental records as a reserve its expected net cost of remedial activities, as adjusted by recognition for any non performing parties. In addition to the costs of investigating and implementing remedial measures, which often take in excess of ten years at CERCLA sites, Occidentals reserves include managements estimates of the cost of operation and maintenance of remedial systems. To the extent that the remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site specific data, laws, regulations, technologies or engineering estimates, Occidental reviews and changes the reserves accordingly on a site specific basis. The following table shows environmental reserve activity for the past three reporting periods: In millions 2002 2001 2000 Balance Beginning of Year $ 454 $ 402 $ 454 Increases to provision including interest accretion 25 111 2 Changes from acquisitions/dispositions 5 23 Payments (84) (75) (85) Other (2) 11 8 Balance End of Year $ 393 $ 454 $ 402 Occidental expects to expend funds equivalent to about half of the current environmental reserve over the next three years and the balance over the next ten or more years. If the environmental reserve balance were to either increase or decrease based on the factors mentioned above, the amount of the increase or decrease would be immediately recognized in earnings. If the reserve balance were to decrease by 10 percent, the company would record a pre tax gain of $39 million. If the reserve balance were to increase by 10 percent, the company would record an additional pre tax remediation expense of $39 million. OTHER LOSS CONTINGENCIES Occidental is involved with numerous lawsuits, claims, proceedings and audits in the normal course of its operations. Occidental records a loss contingency for these matters when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In addition, Occidental discloses, in aggregate, its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred. In order to assess its loss contingencies, Occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an on going basis so that they are adequately reserved on the balance sheet. These reserves are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate. Managements judgments could change based on new information, changes in laws or regulations, changes in managements plans or intentions, the outcome of legal proceedings, settlements or other factors. 30 ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTING CHANGES Listed below are additional changes in accounting principles applicable to Occidental. FIN NO. 46 In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." FIN No. 46 requires a company to consolidate a variable interest entity if it is designated as the primary beneficiary of that entity even if the company does not have a majority of voting interests. A variable interest entity is generally defined as an entity where its equity is unable to finance its activities or where the owners of the entity lack the risk and rewards of ownership. The provisions of this statement apply at inception for any entity created after January 31, 2003. For an entity created before February 1, 2003, the provisions of this Interpretation must be applied at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2003. Occidental will adopt the provisions of FIN No. 46 in the third quarter of 2003 for existing entities that are within the scope of this interpretation. The statement also has disclosure requirements, some of which are required to be disclosed for financial statements issued after January 31, 2003. On a preliminary basis, Occidental believes that its OxyMar investment and its LaPorte, Texas VCM plant lease will be consolidated under the provisions of this statement. (See further discussion in "Additional Considerations Regarding Funding and Liquidity" in the MD&A). FIN NO. 45 In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." FIN No. 45 requires a company to recognize a liability for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing a guarantee. This liability would be recorded at the inception of a guarantee and would be measured at fair value. The measurement provisions of this statement apply prospectively to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure provisions of the statement apply to financial statements for periods ending after December 15, 2002. (See further discussion in "Lawsuits, Claims, Commitments, Contingencies and Related Matters" in the MD&A). Occidental will adopt the measurement provisions of this statement in the first quarter of 2003. The adoption of the statement is not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements when adopted. SFAS NO. 148 In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure." SFAS No. 148 permits two additional transition methods for companies that elect to adopt the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. The statement also expands the disclosure requirements for stock based compensation. The provisions of this statement apply to financial statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. The statement is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements when adopted. SFAS NO. 146 In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability be recognized for exit and disposal costs only when the liability has been incurred and when it can be measured at fair value. The statement is effective for exit and disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. Occidental will adopt SFAS No. 146 in the first quarter of 2003 and it is not expected to have a material impact on its financial statements. SFAS NO. 145 In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections." In addition to amending or rescinding other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections, clarify meanings, or describe their applicability under changed conditions, SFAS No. 145 precludes companies from recording gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt as an extraordinary item. Occidental implemented SFAS No. 145 in the fourth quarter of 2002 and all comparative financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation. Since Occidental had no 2002 extraordinary items, there was no effect on the 2002 presentation. The effects of the statement on prior years include the reclassification of an extraordinary loss to net income from continuing operations of $8 million ($0.02 per share) in 2001 and of $1 million (no per share effect) in 2000. There was no effect on net income or basic earnings per common share upon adoption. SFAS NO. 144 In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." SFAS No. 144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations for long lived assets. The provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Occidental adopted this statement in the first quarter of 2002 and it did not have an impact on the financial statements when adopted. SFAS NO. 143 In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. Occidentals current policy for dismantlement, restoration and reclamation costs is to accrue the estimated future abandonment and removal costs of offshore production platforms, net of salvage value, over their operating lives. For onshore oil and gas production, Occidental estimates that the salvage value of the oil and 31 gas properties generally will approximate the dismantlement, restoration and reclamation costs or that the net cost will not be material; therefore, no accrual is recorded. Occidental makes capital renewal expenditures for its chemical plants on a continual basis while an asset is in operation. Thus, retirement obligations are provided for when a decision is made to dispose of a property or when operations have been curtailed on other than a temporary basis. Under SFAS No. 143, companies are required to recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which the liability is incurred if there is a legal obligation to dismantle the asset and reclaim or remediate the property at the end of the useful life. Occidental will adopt SFAS No. 143 in the first quarter of 2003. The initial adoption is expected to result in an after tax charge of $50 $60 million, which will be recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles. The adoption is also expected to increase net property, plant and equipment by $59 million, increase asset retirement obligation by $150 million and decrease deferred tax liabilities by $33 million. In addition, Occidental will record a pre tax charge to income of approximately $17 million a year to reflect the accretion of the liability and higher depreciation expense beginning in 2003. SFAS NO. 142 In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 142 changes the accounting and reporting requirements for acquired goodwill and intangible assets. The provisions of this statement must be applied starting with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. At December 31, 2001, the balance sheet included approximately $108 million of goodwill and intangible assets with annual amortization expense of approximately $6 million recorded in each of the years income statements for the three year period ended December 31, 2001. As a result, elimination of goodwill amortization would not have had a material impact on net income or earnings per share of any of the years presented and, as a result, the transitional disclosures of adjusted net income excluding goodwill amortization described by SFAS No. 142 have not been presented. Upon implementation of SFAS No. 142 in the first quarter of 2002, three separate specialty chemical businesses were identified as separate reporting units and tested for goodwill impairment. All three of these businesses are components of the chemical segment and were the only reporting units having any goodwill on the balance sheet. The fair value of each of the three reporting units was determined through third party appraisals. The appraisals determined fair value to be the price that the assets could be sold for in a current transaction between willing parties. As a result of the impairment testing, Occidental recorded a "cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles" after tax reduction in net income of approximately $95 million due to the impairment of all the goodwill attributed to these reporting units. Occidental now has no remaining goodwill on its financial statements. SFAS NO. 141 In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations." SFAS No. 141 establishes new standards for accounting and reporting business combinations including eliminating the pooling method of accounting. The standard applies to all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. Occidental implemented the provisions of SFAS No. 141, which had no impact on the financial statements. SFAS NO. 133 On January 1, 2001, Occidental adopted SFAS No. 133, as amended. These statements established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities and required an entity to recognize all derivatives in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value. Changes in the derivative instruments fair value must be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Adoption of these new accounting standards resulted in cumulative after tax reductions in net income of approximately $24 million and OCI of approximately $27 million in the first quarter of 2001. The adoption also increased total assets by $588 million and total liabilities by $639 million as of January 1, 2001. EITF ISSUE NO. 00 10 In the fourth quarter of 2000, Occidental adopted the provisions of EITF Issue No. 00 10, "Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs", which establishes accounting and reporting standards for the treatment of shipping and handling costs. Among its provisions, EITF Issue No. 00 10 requires that transportation costs that had been accounted for as deductions from revenues should now be recorded as an expense. The implementation of EITF Issue No. 00 10 had no effect on net income. All prior year balances have been adjusted to reflect this accounting change. The transportation costs that have been removed as deductions from revenues and included in cost of sales on Occidentals Statements of Operations totaled $245 million in 2000. SFAS NO. 140 In the fourth quarter of 2000, Occidental adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities a Replacement of FASB Statement No. 125", which revises disclosure standards for asset securitizations and other financial asset transfers. SFAS No. 140 also contains provisions which revise certain criteria for accounting for securitizations, financial asset transfers and collateral. These accounting provisions were adopted by Occidental on April 1, 2001. The implementation of the provisions of SFAS No. 140 did not have an impact on Occidentals consolidated financial position or results of operations. See "Derivative Activities and Market Risk" above for other accounting changes. 32 SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT REGARDING OUTLOOK AND OTHER FORWARD LOOKING DATA Portions of this report, including Items 1 and 2 and the information appearing under the caption "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," including the information under the sub caption "2003 Outlook," contain forward looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and business prospects. Factors that could cause results to differ materially include, but are not limited to: global commodity pricing fluctuations; competitive pricing pressures; higher than expected costs including feedstocks; crude oil and natural gas prices; chemical prices; potential liability for remedial actions under existing or future environmental regulations and litigation; potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation; general domestic and international political conditions; potential disruption or interruption of Occidentals production or manufacturing facilities due to accidents, political events or insurgent activity; potential failure to achieve expected production from existing and future oil and gas development projects; the supply/demand considerations for Occidentals products; any general economic recession or slowdown domestically or internationally; regulatory uncertainties; and not successfully completing, or any material delay of, any development of new fields, expansion, capital expenditure, efficiency improvement project, acquisition or disposition. Forward looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as "estimate", "project", "predict", "will", "anticipate", "plan", "intend", "believe", "expect" or similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. Occidental expressly disclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information or otherwise. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward looking events discussed might not occur. REPORT OF MANAGEMENT The management of Occidental Petroleum Corporation is responsible for the integrity of the financial data reported by Occidental and its subsidiaries. Fulfilling this responsibility requires the preparation and presentation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Management uses internal accounting controls, corporate wide policies and procedures and judgment so that such statements reflect fairly Occidentals consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 33
