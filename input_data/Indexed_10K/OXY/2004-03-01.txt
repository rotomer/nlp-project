ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A) (INCORPORATING ITEM 7A) In this report, the term "Occidental" refers to Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OPC) and or one or more entities in which it owns a majority voting interest (subsidiaries). Occidental is divided into two segments: oil and gas and chemical. 2003 BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT OIL AND GAS Oil and gas prices are the key variables that drive the industrys financial performance. Prices can vary significantly, even on a short term basis. Oil prices continued to strengthen in 2003 over their levels in the previous year. The average West Texas Intermediate (WTI) market price for 2003 was $31.03/barrel (bbl) compared with $26.08/bbl in 2002. NYMEX domestic natural gas prices increased significantly from 2002. For 2003, NYMEX gas prices averaged $5.26/Mcf compared with $3.07/Mcf for 2002. CHEMICAL The sectors of the chemical industry in which Occidental participates showed signs of improvement in 2003 largely due to the improving economy and the continued strength of the building and construction markets. The industry experienced higher product prices for all major commodity chemicals; however, the margin improvement was largely offset by higher costs for key raw materials, primarily energy and ethylene. Domestic chlorine demand dropped slightly in 2003, compared to 2002, as the robust housing sector could not overcome general weakness in other manufacturing markets. However, chlorine prices increased sharply in 2003 from their depressed levels in early 2002 in part due to the tightening of supply resulting from industry capacity reductions and the favorable influence of the strong vinyls (VCM/PVC) demand, mainly in the housing sector. Caustic soda prices began to improve in the 8 second quarter of 2003 but softened late in the year due to pressure to move more caustic soda volume versus chlorine. However, overall caustic soda prices improved for the year. PVC prices improved significantly although the price improvement was largely offset by higher raw material costs. STRATEGY AND OVERALL PERFORMANCE Occidentals overall corporate strategy aims to generate competitive total returns to stockholders and consists of three basic elements: >> Focus on large, long lived oil and gas assets with growth potential. >> Maintain financial discipline and a strong balance sheet. >> Harvest cash from chemicals. Large, long lived "legacy" oil and gas assets, like those in California, the Permian Basin in Texas and Qatar, tend to have moderate decline rates, enhanced secondary and tertiary recovery opportunities and economies of scale that lead to cost effective production. These assets are expected to contribute substantial earnings and cash flow after capital. At Occidental, maintaining financial discipline means prudently investing capital in projects that are expected to generate above cost of capital returns throughout the business cycle. During periods of high commodity prices, Occidental will use the bulk of its cash flow after capital expenditures and dividends to improve future earnings levels by acquiring additional properties with low risk characteristics or through debt reduction. The chemicals business generates free cash flow. In 2003, free cash flow for the segment was approximately $290 million, which compares favorably with the 10 year annual average. The segment was able to achieve this result despite a difficult year for the chemical industry as a whole. (For a calculation of chemical free cash flow, see "Selected Cash Flow Information" below.) In order to ensure that its strategic objectives are reached, Occidentals management focuses on the following key business goals over the short term: >> Achieve top quartile performance, compared to peer companies, in return on equity with a below average level of debt. >> Segments are to achieve top quartile performance, compared to peer companies, in return on assets and other measurements unique to that segment. These include profits per unit produced, costs to produce each unit, cash flow per unit, costs to find and develop new reserves and other similar measures. DEBT STRUCTURE Occidentals total debt and total debt to capitalization ratios are shown in the table below: Total Debt to Capitalization Date ($ amounts in millions) Total Debt(a) Ratio 12/31/99 $ 5,427 61% 12/31/00 $ 6,354 57% 12/31/01 $ 4,890 46% 12/31/02 $ 4,759 43% 12/31/03 $ 4,570 37% (a) Includes trust preferred securities (redeemed January 20, 2004), natural gas delivery commitment (which was terminated in 2002), subsidiary preferred stock and capital lease obligations. Occidentals year end 2003 total debt to capitalization ratio has declined to approximately 37 percent from the 61 percent level that existed at the end of 1999, as shown in the table above. The decrease in the total debt to capitalization ratio in 2003 compared to 1999 is the result of total debt reductions of 16 percent combined with an increase in stockholders equity of 125 percent over the same period. RETURN ON EQUITY Three Year Average Annual 2003 (a) 2001 2003 (b) 21.4% 18.5% (a) The Return on Equity for 2003 was calculated by dividing Occidentals 2003 earnings applicable to common stock by the average equity balance in 2003. (b) The Return on Equity for the three year period was calculated as the sum of the annual earnings applicable to common stock for each of the three years ended 2003 divided by the sum of the ending equity balances for each year end in the same period. Over the past three years, Occidental has focused on improving its return on equity. In 2003, Occidentals return on equity was 21.4 percent and the three year average return on equity was 18.5 percent. During the same three year period, Occidentals equity increased by over 41 percent. OIL AND GAS STRATEGY The oil and gas business strategy has three parts that, together, are focused on adding new oil and natural gas reserves at a pace well ahead of production, while simultaneously keeping finding and development costs among the lowest in the industry: >> Continue to add commercial reserves in and around Occidentals core areas, which are the U.S., Middle East and Latin America, through a combination of focused exploration and development programs. >> Pursue commercial opportunities with host governments in core areas to enhance the development of mature fields with large volumes of remaining oil in place by applying appropriate technology and innovative reservoir management practices. 9 >> Maintain a disciplined approach in buying and selling assets at attractive prices. Over the past several years, the asset base within each of the core areas has been strengthened. Occidental has invested in assets with higher performance potential and sold properties with low or no current return. The results of these changes are discussed below in "Business Review Oil and Gas." CHEMICAL STRATEGY OxyChem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain where it begins with chlorine, which is co produced with caustic soda, and then converts chlorine and ethylene, through a series of intermediate products, into PVC. OxyChem mainly focuses on being a low cost producer to maximize its cash flow generation. BUSINESS REVIEW OIL AND GAS Occidentals overall performance during the past several years reflects the successful implementation of its oil and gas business strategy, beginning with the acquisition of the Elk Hills oil and gas field in California. The Elk Hills acquisition was followed in April 2000 by the purchase of Altura Energy in the Permian Basin in West Texas for $3.6 billion and thereafter by several smaller acquisitions. During 2003, Occidental enhanced its industry leading position in the Permian Basin by making several complementary acquisitions. At the end of 2003, the Elk Hills and Permian Basin assets made up 65 percent of Occidentals worldwide proven oil reserves and 45 percent of its proven gas reserves. On a BOE basis, they accounted for 62 percent of Occidentals worldwide reserves. In 2003, the combined production from these assets averaged approximately 265,000 BOE per day, which represents 48 percent of Occidentals total worldwide production. These businesses also contributed approximately 56 percent of oil and gas segment earnings. ELK HILLS Occidental operates the Elk Hills oil and gas field in the southern portion of Californias San Joaquin Valley with an approximate 78 percent interest. The field was acquired in 1998 for $3.5 billion and is the largest producer of gas in California. Production in 2003 was approximately 94,000 BOE per day. Since the acquisition date, Elk Hills has generated total net pre tax cash flow of approximately $3.5 billion, after subtracting $871 million of capital expenditures, and has replaced 109 percent of its total Elk Hills oil and gas production of 207 million BOE. At the end of 2003, the property still had an estimated 444 million BOE of proved reserves, compared to the 425 million BOE that were recorded at the time of the acquisition. Occidentals California natural gas production is declining as it produces the Elk Hills gas cap, but the decline has been mitigated by increased development activities. Total gas production averaged 246 MMcf per day in 2003 compared to 281 MMcf in 2002. PERMIAN BASIN The entire Permian Basin is the largest oil basin in the lower 48 United States and accounts for approximately 15 percent of total U.S. oil production. Occidental is the largest producer in the Permian Basin with approximately 15 percent of the total Permian production. Occidental integrated its acquisition of Altura, which was valued at approximately $3.6 billion, with its previously existing Permian Basin properties in Southwest Texas and Southeast New Mexico. Since the acquisition in 2000, the former Altura properties have generated approximately $2.6 billion in total net pre tax cash flow, after subtracting capital expenditures of approximately $565 million. One element of Occidentals strategy in the Permian Basin is to acquire producing properties at attractive prices that offer synergies with its existing operations. In 2003, Occidental made a number of complementary acquisitions in the Permian Basin for a total purchase price of $317 million. These acquisitions increased total proven reserves by 103 million BOE for an average cost of $3.08 per BOE. On January 31, 2004, Occidental acquired a 1,300 mile oil gathering and pipeline system in the Permian Basin. This system will allow Occidental to efficiently gather and transport its production to Midland where it has storage facilities. The remainder of the pipelines capacity will be filled by third party producers. Net Permian oil and gas production averaged 171,000 BOE per day in 2003 compared to 164,000 BOE per day in 2002. Approximately 50 percent of Occidentals Permian Basin production is reliant upon the application of carbon dioxide (CO2) flood technology, an enhanced oil recovery technique. This involves injecting CO2 into oil reservoirs where it acts as a solvent, causing the oil to flow more freely so it can be pumped to the surface. The size of these CO2 flood operations makes Occidental a world leader in the development and application of this technology. THUMS Occidental purchased THUMS, the field contractor for an oil production unit offshore Long Beach, California, in 2000. Occidentals share of production from THUMS is subject to contractual arrangements similar to a production sharing contract, whereby Occidentals share of production varies inversely with oil prices. For 2003, net production from the THUMS oil property averaged 23,000 barrels per day. 10 GULF OF MEXICO Occidental has a one third interest in the deep water Horn Mountain oil field, which is Occidentals only asset in the Gulf of Mexico. BP p.l.c. (BP) is the operator. The field began production in November 2002 and production was increased until it reached platform capacity in the third quarter of 2003. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Occidentals net production at Horn Mountain averaged 28,000 BOE per day. HUGOTON Occidental owns a large concentration of gas reserves, production interests and royalty interests in the Hugoton area of Kansas and Oklahoma. The Hugoton field is the largest natural gas field discovered to date in North America. Occidentals Hugoton operations produced 138,000 Mcf of natural gas and 4,000 barrels of oil per day in 2003. MIDDLE EAST DOLPHIN PROJECT In 2002, Occidental purchased a 24.5 percent interest in the Dolphin Project for $310 million. This investment includes a 24.5 percent interest in Dolphin Energy Limited (Dolphin Energy), the operator of the Dolphin Project. The Dolphin Project consists of two parts: (1) a development and production sharing agreement with Qatar to develop and produce natural gas and condensate in Qatars North Field for 25 years, with a provision to request a 5 year extension; and (2) the rights for Dolphin Energy to build, own and operate a 260 mile long, 48 inch export pipeline to transport 2 billion cubic feet per day of dry natural gas from Qatar to markets in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for the life of the Dolphin Project and longer. The pipeline will have capacity to transport up to 3.2 billion cubic feet per day, which will allow for additional business opportunities. Several important milestones have been reached since Occidental joined the Dolphin Project. In 2002, two development wells were drilled and tested, providing sufficient information to complete the field development plan. In October 2003, Dolphin Energy signed two 25 year contracts to supply approximately one BCF of natural gas per day to two entities in the UAE. A third supply contract with the Emirate of Dubai is currently being negotiated. In addition, other markets for natural gas and hydrocarbon liquids are being pursued. In December 2003, the Government of Qatar approved the final field development plan for the Dolphin Project. Based on the foregoing developments, Occidental recorded 107 million BOE of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves in 2003. Most recently, in January 2004, Dolphin Energy awarded engineering, procurement and construction contracts for the gas processing and compression plant at Ras Laffan in Qatar as well as for two offshore gas production platforms. The plant will receive wet gas from Dolphins facilities in Qatars North Field and will remove hydrocarbon liquids, including condensate and natural gas liquids, for further processing and sale. The resulting dry gas will be compressed and transported to the UAE through Dolphin Energys pipeline. The projected start up date for production is in 2006. The Dolphin Project is expected to cost approximately $4.0 billion in total. Occidental expects to invest approximately $1 billion for its 24.5 percent share in the Dolphin Project over the next three years. A portion of the project costs may be project financed. During 2004, Occidental expects to invest approximately $250 to $300 million, which is expected to be provided by Occidentals operating cash flow. This investment is in addition to Occidentals expected 2004 capital expenditures of $1.4 billion that are discussed under "Liquidity and Capital Resources." As the project has not begun operation, no revenue or production costs were recorded in 2003. QATAR By introducing advanced drilling systems and applying new waterflooding and reservoir characterization techniques in the Idd El Shargi North Dome (ISND) field, Occidental has increased production and recoverable reserves from the field. Occidental is moving forward with a second phase under its existing agreement in the development of ISND. The new phase is targeting the development and recovery of additional reserves from ISND. Occidental is also engaged in full field development of the Idd El Shargi South Dome (ISSD) field which, as a satellite to the North Dome, reduces the overall capital requirement of the two projects. Combined production from the two fields averaged 45,000 barrels per day, net to Occidental, in 2003. Also, see the Dolphin Project discussed above. YEMEN In Yemen, Occidental owns direct working interests in the Masila field in Block 14 (38 percent) and a 40.4 percent interest in the East Shabwa field, comprising a 28.6 percent direct working interest and a 11.8 percent equity interest in an unconsolidated entity. Occidentals net production averaged 37,000 barrels of oil per day in 2003, with 31,000 coming from the Masila field and the remainder from East Shabwa. OMAN Occidentals Oman business is centered in Block 9 where it holds a 65 percent working interest in the production sharing contract for this block. Net production to Occidental averaged 12,000 barrels of oil per day in 2003. Occidental has entered into a gas sales and purchase agreement with the Government of Oman to sell approximately 120 million gross cubic feet of natural gas per day from Block 9 operations to the Government. First gas sales are anticipated in mid 2004. This agreement has opened up a market for previously stranded gas that is associated with oil production from the Safah field. Occidental also continues its exploration program in the adjacent Block 27. In 2003, the Government of Oman approved a farm out of a 35 percent working interest in Block 27 to Mitsui E&P Middle East B.V. (Mitsui). As a result, Occidental and Mitsui now share the same working interest percentages in both Block 9 and Block 27. 11 LIBYA Occidental suspended all activities in Libya in 1986 as a result of economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. government, but continues to hold an interest in the assets that it formerly operated. Since the imposition of sanctions, Occidental has derived no economic benefit from its Libyan interests and has no Libyan assets on its balance sheet. Over the past two years, Occidental representatives have met with Libyan officials, under specific authority and guidelines set by the U.S. Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), for the purpose of fact finding and discussing generally the status of its contractual interests and property rights. Recent developments that have led to an improvement in U.S. Libya relations have given rise to speculation that the sanctions could be eased, or perhaps lifted, in the near future. Until that happens, Occidental will continue complying with the existing sanctions and its OFAC licenses. Occidental remains very interested in returning to Libya, where it had considerable success in finding and developing large volumes of commercial oil reserves. Management is carefully monitoring the dynamics of the evolving U.S. Libya relationship. OTHER EASTERN HEMISPHERE PAKISTAN Occidental holds oil and gas working interests, that vary from 25 to 50 percent, in four Badin Blocks in Pakistan. BP is the operator. In 2002, Occidental purchased additional interests in two of these blocks from the Government of Pakistan for approximately $72 million. 2003 gross production was 102,000 BOE per day, while Occidentals net share was approximately 22,000 BOE per day. RUSSIA In Russia, Occidental owns 50 percent of a joint venture company, Vanyoganneft, that operates in the western Siberian oil basin. Production for 2003 was approximately 30,000 BOE per day, net to Occidental. LATIN AMERICA COLOMBIA Occidental has a 35 percent net share of production and is the operator of the Cano Limon oil field in Colombia. Cumulative gross production from Cano Limon reached one billion barrels of oil in 2003. Colombias national oil company, Ecopetrol, operates the Cano Limon Covenas oil pipeline and marine export terminal. The pipeline transports oil produced from the Cano Limon field for export to international markets. In addition, Occidental has working interests in three exploration blocks: Rio Aipe (50 percent), Chipiron (88 percent) and Cosecha (75 percent). Production in 2003 approximated 2002 levels as improved security along the export pipeline reduced the number of attacks by local terrorist groups below the peak levels of 2001. Occidentals net share of 2003 production averaged 32,000 barrels of oil per day. Occidentals interests in Colombia account for approximately 1 percent of its worldwide assets, 2 percent of its total worldwide reserves and about 6 percent of its worldwide oil and gas production in 2003. Occidental anticipates that it will recover the proved reserves attributable to its contract. ECUADOR Net production in Block 15, which Occidental operates with a 60 percent working interest, averaged approximately 25,000 barrels of oil per day in 2003. In the second half of 2003, the increased production from the Eden Yuturi oil field in the southeastern corner of Block 15 coincided with the completion of the Oleoducto de Crudos Pesados (OCP) Ltd. oil export pipeline, in which Occidental has a 14 percent interest. Full field development of the Eden Yuturi oil field is underway with continued development drilling planned in 2004. In addition, work continues in the producing areas in the western portion of the block at the Indillana complex and the Yanaquincha and Limoncocha fields. These projects are expected to increase production by 20,000 barrels per day, for a total net production of 45,000 barrels per day in 2004. In addition, Occidental has completed extensive 3 D seismic surveys and plans to continue expanding its exploration activities in Block 15 in 2004. Foreign oil companies, including Occidental, have been paying a Value Added Tax (VAT), generally calculated on the basis of 10 to 12 percent of expenditures for goods and services used in the production of oil for export. Until 2001, oil companies, like other companies producing products for export, filed for and received reimbursement of VAT. In 2001, the Ecuador tax authority announced that the oil companies VAT payments did not qualify for reimbursement. In response, the affected oil companies filed actions in the Ecuador Tax Court to seek a judicial determination that the expenditures are subject to reimbursement. In November 2002, Occidental initiated an international arbitration proceeding against the Ecuadorian Government under the United States Ecuador bilateral investment treaty based on Occidentals belief that the Ecuadorian Government is arbitrarily and discriminatorily refusing to refund the VAT to Occidental. Arbitration proceedings continue at present. Occidental believes that it has a valid claim for reimbursement under applicable Ecuador tax law and the treaty. In the event of an unfavorable outcome, the potential financial statement effect would not be significant. PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS Occidental conducts its operations in Qatar, Oman and Yemen under production sharing contracts and, under such contracts, receives a share of production to recover its costs and an additional share for profit. Occidentals share of production from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise and increases when oil prices decline. Overall, Occidentals net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices. 12 CHEMICAL CHLOR ALKALI Demand for chlor alkali products improved throughout the first half of 2003 with combined chlorine and caustic soda prices peaking about mid year. However, as supply and demand shifted to a more balanced position, prices softened in the latter part of the year. OxyChems chlor alkali operating rate for 2003 was 90 percent, approximately matching the industry. Domestic caustic soda pricing improved in the second quarter, but then fell to its lowest level of the year in the fourth quarter. Export pricing for caustic soda remained weak throughout the year as the worldwide supply exceeded demand, exerting downward pressure on pricing. OxyChem maintained its Deer Park chlor alkali production facility in Houston, Texas and its EDC facility in Ingleside, Texas in standby mode. In June 2003, OxyChem idled a circuit which produced chlorine and caustic soda at its Delaware City plant. These idle facilities will be reactivated upon strengthening in overall economic conditions that leads to improved demand and higher margins for caustic soda. VINYLS Continuing strength in natural gas and ethylene prices pushed costs higher in PVC, and led to price increases of two cents per pound per month for four consecutive months in early 2003, for a total increase of 22 percent. These increases were in addition to the 43 percent increase in PVC resin prices in 2002, which was also driven by rising feedstock and energy costs. Total year 2003 demand was lower by 2 percent compared with 2002. For 2003, ethylene prices rose by over 5.5 cents per pound, and average natural gas costs were nearly $2 per million British Thermal Units (MMBTU) higher than 2002. OxyChem operated its PVC facilities at an average operating rate of 88 percent for 2003, slightly above the North American industry average operating rate of 86 percent. In the fourth quarter of 2003, export markets for both PVC and VCM strengthened notably, helped by VCM outages in the U.S. and overseas. DISPOSITION OF EQUISTAR INTEREST AND ACQUISITION OF LYONDELL INTEREST In August 2002, Occidental sold its 29.5 percent share of Equistar to Lyondell and purchased a 21 percent equity interest in Lyondell. Occidental entered into these transactions to diversify its petrochemicals interest. These transactions reduced Occidentals direct exposure to the inherent volatility in the petrochemicals markets, yet will allow it to participate, through its Lyondell investment, in the economic recovery of the petrochemicals industry. In connection with these transactions, Occidental wrote down its investment in the Equistar partnership to fair value by recording a $412 million pre tax charge as of December 2001. When this transaction closed in the third quarter of 2002, Occidental recorded an after tax gain of $164 million. As a result of increases in its investment during 2003, at December 31, 2003, Occidental owned 22 percent (39.5 million shares) of Lyondell stock with a carrying value of $479 million. DISPOSITION OF CHROME AND CALENDERING OPERATIONS In the fourth quarter of 2002, Occidental sold its chrome business at Castle Hayne, North Carolina for $25 million and its plastic calendering operations in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for a $6 million note receivable. In the third quarter of 2002, Occidental recorded an after tax impairment charge of $69 million and classified both of these businesses as discontinued operations. CORPORATE AND OTHER Corporate and other includes the investments in Lyondell and Premcor, Inc., a refining business, and a leased co generation facility in Taft, Louisiana. In 2004, corporate and other will also include the results of a 1,300 mile oil pipeline and gathering system located in the Permian Basin, which was acquired in January 2004 and will be used in corporate directed oil and gas marketing and trading operations. In July 2001, Occidental sold its interests in a subsidiary that owned a Texas intrastate natural gas pipeline system and also sold its interest in a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Indonesia. After tax proceeds of approximately $750 million from these transactions were used to reduce debt. 2004 OUTLOOK OIL AND GAS The petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to numerous market forces. Crude oil and natural gas prices are affected by market fundamentals such as weather, inventory levels, competing fuel prices, overall demand and the availability of supply. In the last half of 2003, worldwide oil prices strengthened due to increasing concerns about the security and availability of ample supplies to meet growing demand. Continued economic growth, resulting in increased demand and concerns about supply availability, could result in continued high prices. A lower growth rate could result in lower crude oil prices. Sustained high oil prices will significantly affect profitability and returns for Occidental and other upstream producers. However, the industry has historically experienced wide fluctuations within price cycles. Although oil prices cannot be predicted with any certainty, the WTI price has averaged approximately $22.50/barrel over the past ten years. While supply demand fundamentals are a decisive factor affecting domestic natural gas prices over the long term, day to day prices may be more volatile in the futures markets, such as on the NYMEX and other exchanges, which make it difficult to forecast prices with any degree of confidence. Over the last ten years, the NYMEX gas price has averaged $3.00 per Mcf. 13 CHEMICAL The chemical business has been profitable historically; however, the average level of earnings has declined over the past several years. The major factors that have an impact on the performance of this business are general economic conditions, including demand for chemical products, energy and feedstock costs, and the effect of changes in available capacity. Over the last five years, the U.S. chemical industry and its primary market, the U.S. based manufacturing industry, have faced significant challenges. Foreign competition continues to make price increases by the U.S. manufacturing industry difficult to achieve. In the chemical industry, increasing natural gas prices, which affect U.S. electricity prices, have sharply reduced, and in many cases eliminated, the domestic chemical industrys natural advantage of proximity to its markets. This has affected basic commodity chemicals such as caustic soda, chlorine and PVC, but is particularly significant for niche specialty products such as resorcinol, mercaptans and antimony based products. As a result, the U.S. based chemical industry is facing increasing pressure from competitors in both domestic and export markets. Export sales accounted for approximately 17 percent of Occidentals 2003 chemical sales. The end of the most recent recession and resultant world economic recovery is expected to improve the overall outlook. Construction of LNG terminals on the U.S. Gulf Coast could stabilize natural gas prices at a lower than current level and thereby help improve the competitive position of efficient Gulf Coast chemical facilities. However, this may not occur in the immediate future. Although Occidentals chemical business is profitable, if U.S. manufacturing becomes non competitive on a worldwide basis, this could shorten the estimated productive lives of some of Occidentals plants, resulting in higher annual depreciation. Significantly shorter productive lives could also result in asset impairments, including plant closures. It is unlikely that any changes in estimated productive lives would be uniform. While potential impairment charges could have a material impact on the earnings in a discrete period, such changes are unlikely to have a material effect on Occidentals overall financial situation. For additional discussion of the possible financial effect, please see the "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" section below in the MD&A. CHLOR ALKALI Further improvement in chlor alkali operating rates is expected in 2004 and beyond as domestic demand for chlorine and caustic soda is forecasted to increase 2 percent in 2004. PVC and other downstream derivatives are leading the growth in demand for chlorine. Demand growth for caustic soda is expected to track closely with overall manufacturing activity. With increasing demand and improved capacity utilization, pricing for chlorine is expected to continue to rise compared to 2003. Caustic soda prices should also improve as overall manufacturing demand strengthens. VINYLS Gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the latter part of 2003 and consensus forecasts of 2004 GDP growth exceeding 4 percent for North America are encouraging and suggest a strengthening in the economy that will favorably impact chlorovinyls. Overall, Occidental expects 2 percent growth in vinyls demand in North America in 2004. PVC and VCM operating rates are expected to move upward during the year, also averaging 2 percent higher than 2003 rates. Chlorovinyls supply constraints, together with high energy costs, have created conditions for vinyls price increases early in 2004. Resin producer price increases of 2 cents per pound have taken effect for January, and a second 2 cents per pound increase has been announced for February. In addition, VCM intermediates are expected to be in shorter supply than PVC because of industry capacity reductions and maintenance requirements. Average operating rates for North American VCM producers are expected to exceed 90 percent. The increased demand for chlorine and tighter VCM supplies, due to capacity reductions, is expected to result in supply restrictions for vinyl producers. SEGMENT OPERATIONS The following discussion of Occidentals two operating segments and corporate items should be read in conjunction with Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment earnings exclude interest income, interest expense, unallocated corporate expenses, discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment assets and results from the segments equity investments. Foreign income and other taxes and certain state taxes are included in segment earnings based on their operating results. U.S. federal income taxes are not allocated to segments except for amounts in lieu thereof that represent the tax effect of operating charges resulting from purchase accounting adjustments, and the tax effects resulting from major, infrequently occurring transactions, such as asset dispositions that relate to segment results. 14 The following table sets forth the sales and earnings of each operating segment and corporate items: SEGMENT OPERATIONS In millions, except per share amounts For the years ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 SALES Oil and Gas $ 6,003 $ 4,634 $ 5,134 Chemical 3,178 2,704 2,968 Other (a) 145 $ 9,326 $ 7,338 $ 8,102 EARNINGS(LOSS) Oil and Gas (b) $ 2,664 $ 1,707 $ 2,845 Chemical (b) 210 275 (399) 2,874 1,982 2,446 Unallocated corporate items Interest expense, net (c) Debt, net (289) (253) (272) Trust preferred distributions and other (44) (47) (56) Income taxes (d) (662) (364) (359) Other (d, e) (284) (155) (580) Income from continuing operations 1,595 1,163 1,179 Discontinued operations, net (79) (1) Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, net (68) (95) (24) Net Income $ 1,527 $ 989 $ 1,154 Basic Earnings per Common Share $ 3.98 $ 2.63 $ 3.10 (a) The 2003 amount represents revenue from a co generation plant in Taft, Louisiana. (b) Includes U.S. federal tax charge of $6 million related to oil and gas in 2003. Segment earnings in 2002 were affected by $402 million of net credits allocated, comprising $1 million of charges and $403 million of credits in oil and gas and chemical, respectively. The chemical amount includes a $392 million credit for the sale of the Equistar investment, which resulted in a net gain of $164 million. Segment earnings in 2001 were affected by $14 million of net charges allocated, comprising $56 million of charges and $42 million of credits in oil and gas and chemical, respectively.

(e) Includes mineral acquisitions but excludes significant acquisitions individually discussed in this report. 15 Core earnings in 2003 were $2.7 billion compared with $1.7 billion in 2002. The increase in core earnings primarily reflects the impact of higher crude oil and natural gas prices and higher crude oil production volumes, partially offset by lower natural gas production volumes, higher depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) rates and increased costs.

(b) Product volumes produced at former PolyOne facilities, now part of OxyVinyls, are excluded from the product price indexes. (c) Product volumes include those manufactured and consumed internally. (d) The 2003 amount includes $180 million for the purchase of a previously leased facility in LaPorte, Texas and $44 million related to the exercise of purchase options for certain leased railcars. Core earnings were $210 million in 2003, compared with $111 million in 2002. The increase in core earnings reflects the impact of higher sales prices for all major products (PVC, EDC, chlorine and caustic), partially offset by higher energy and ethylene costs. SIGNIFICANT ITEMS AFFECTING EARNINGS Occidentals results of operations often include the effects of significant transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount. Therefore, management uses a measure called "core earnings", which excludes those items. This non GAAP measure is not meant to disassociate those items from managements performance, but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing Occidentals earnings performance between periods. Reported earnings are considered representative of managements performance over the long term. Core earnings is not considered to be an alternative to operating income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS SELECTED REVENUE ITEMS In millions 2003 2002 2001 Net sales $ 9,326 $ 7,338 $ 8,102 Interest, dividends and other income $ 89 $ 143 $ 223 Gains on disposition of assets, net $ 32 $ 10 $ 10 The increase in sales in 2003, compared to 2002, primarily reflects higher crude oil, natural gas and chemical prices and higher crude oil production volumes, partially offset by lower natural gas production volumes. The decrease in sales in 2002, compared to 2001, primarily reflects lower natural gas and chemical prices and lower natural gas and chemical volumes, partially offset by higher crude oil prices and production. Interest, dividends and other income in 2002 and 2001 includes interest income on the notes receivable from the Altura partners of $21 million and $102 million, respectively. Occidental exercised an option in May 2002 to redeem the sellers remaining partnership interests in exchange for the notes receivable. Gains on disposition of assets in 2003 include the final gain of $22 million on the sale of the remaining Continental Shelf Gulf of Mexico (GOM) assets to Apache Corporation. Gains on disposition of assets in 2001 include the gain of $454 million on the sale of the interest in the Tangguh LNG project and the loss of $459 million on the sale of its interests in a subsidiary that owned a Texas natural gas intrastate pipeline system. 16 SELECTED EXPENSE ITEMS In millions 2003 2002 2001 Cost of sales $ 3,988 $ 3,385 $ 3,626 Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses $ 855 $ 677 $ 668 Depreciation, depletion and amortization $ 1,177 $ 1,012 $ 965 Exploration expense $ 139 $ 176 $ 184 Interest and debt expense, net $ 332 $ 295 $ 401 Cost of sales increased in 2003, compared to 2002, due mainly to oil and gas volume increases and higher energy and feedstock costs in the chemical segment. The 2003 amount also includes $156 million for the costs of operating a co generation facility. Cost of sales decreased in 2002, compared to 2001, due mainly to lower chemical raw material costs, partially offset by volume increases in oil and gas. Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2003 compared with 2002. The increases were in several areas. General and administrative costs increased in both oil and gas and corporate infrastructure and general support areas. In addition, non operating costs were generally higher in international operations, mainly Latin America. Higher oil and gas production taxes reflected the overall increase in worldwide production. Also, additional expense resulted from adoption of the new asset retirement obligation accounting standard. Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2002, compared to 2001, due mainly to $42 million of chemical asset writedowns in 2002, partially offset by other charges in 2001. The increase in DD&A in 2003, compared to 2002, and 2002, compared to 2001, was primarily due to the increase in oil and gas production from the prior year and a higher DD&A rate in 2003. The decrease in exploration expense in 2003, compared to 2002, was primarily due to lower dry hole write offs and impairment costs and lower seismic, geological and geophysical costs in 2003. The increase in interest and debt expense in 2003, compared to 2002, reflected a pre tax debt repayment charge of $61 million in 2003, partially offset by lower interest rates and lower average debt levels. In addition, since Occidental adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 150 in July 2003, the 2003 interest expense amount includes six months of interest that had been classified as distributions on trust preferred securities prior to the adoption (see below). The decrease in interest and debt expense in 2002, compared to 2001, reflects lower average debt levels and lower interest rates. OTHER ITEMS In millions 2003 2002 2001 Provision for income taxes $ 1,227 $ 422 $ 556 Minority interest $ 62 $ 77 $ 143 Loss from equity investments $ 9 $ 261 $ 504 The increase in the provision for income taxes in 2003, compared to 2002, reflected an increase in income before taxes. In addition, the 2002 provision for income taxes includes an income tax benefit of $406 million for the sale of the Equistar investment. The 2001 provision includes income tax benefits of $172 million resulting from the write down of the Equistar investment, $188 million from the sale of the entity that owns a Texas intrastate natural gas pipeline system, and a $45 million after tax settlement of a state tax issue. The decrease in minority interest in 2003, compared to 2002, resulted from the July 1, 2003 adoption of SFAS No. 150, which required distributions on trust preferred securities to be classified as interest expense. These distributions were previously recorded in minority interest. The decrease in minority interest in 2002, compared to 2001, was due to an $84 million decrease in preferred distributions to the Altura partners. The remaining Altura partnership interests were redeemed in May 2002. The 2002 loss from equity investments includes a pre tax loss of $242 million from the sale of the Equistar investment in August 2002. The loss from equity investments in 2001 includes a $412 million pre tax write down of Equistar and a loss of $89 million from the Equistar equity investment. TAXES Deferred tax liabilities were $926 million at December 31, 2003, net of deferred tax assets of $839 million. The current portion of the deferred tax assets of $75 million is included in prepaid expenses and other. The net deferred tax assets are expected to be realized through future operating income and reversal of taxable temporary differences. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES FINANCING ACTIVITY During 2003, Occidental strengthened its liquidity position, generating approximately $3 billion in cash from operations. Although future volatility in commodity prices may result in varying operating cash flows, Occidental believes that cash on hand, cash generated from operating activities, unused committed bank credit lines and other sources of funds, such as debt issued in the capital markets and the receivables sale program, will be adequate to satisfy its future financial obligations and liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2003, available borrowing capacity under Occidentals unused committed bank credit lines was $1.5 billion. Occidental had approximately $683 million in cash on hand at December 31, 2003, an increase of $537 million from 2002. A portion of the year end 2003 cash balance was used to redeem all of the outstanding 8.16 percent Trust Preferred Redeemable Securities (trust preferred securities) on January 20, 2004. The trust preferred securities were redeemed at par plus accrued interest, resulting in a decrease in current liabilities of approximately $453 million. 17 In 2003, Occidental recorded a pre tax interest charge of $61 million to repay a $450 million 6.4 percent senior notes issue that had ten years of remaining life, but was subject to remarketing on April 1, 2003. Occidental refinanced $300 million of this amount and paid the remaining $150 million out of existing cash. In 2002, Occidental filed a shelf registration statement for up to $1 billion of various securities, including senior debt securities. In November 2002, Occidental issued $175 million of 4 percent Medium Term Senior Notes, Series C, and $75 million of 4.101 percent Medium Term Senior Notes, Series C, due 2007 for general corporate purposes. In March 2003, Occidental issued $300 million of 4.25 percent Medium Term Senior Notes and used the proceeds to refinance a portion of the $450 million senior notes discussed above. Occidental has $450 million of securities remaining under the shelf registration. In 2002, Occidental repaid and or redeemed approximately $198 million of senior notes and medium term notes and a subsidiary of Occidental issued $75 million of preferred stock. Occidental retains all common shares of the subsidiary and elects the majority of the directors. The subsidiary is the holding company for a number of international subsidiaries of Occidental. In the event that the subsidiary fails to pay preferred dividends for two consecutive quarters or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the holder of the preferred stock could gain control of the subsidiarys board of directors. CASH FLOW ANALYSIS In millions 2003 2002 2001 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,074 $ 2,100 $ 2,566 The increase in operating cash flow in 2003 compared to 2002 resulted from higher net income. The lower operating cash flow in 2002, compared with 2001, results from lower core earnings and higher working capital usage. Non cash charges in 2003 include deferred compensation, stock incentive plan amortization and environmental remediation accruals. Non cash charges in 2002 include environmental remediation accruals and the asset writedown for two chemical facilities. Non cash charges in 2001 include environmental remediation accruals. 2002 and 2001 also include charges for employee benefit plans and other items. In millions 2003 2002 2001 Net cash used by investing activities $ (2,021) $ (1,696) $ (651) The 2003 amount includes several Permian Basin acquisitions totaling $317 million. The 2002 amount includes approximately $349 million for a 24.5 percent interest in the Dolphin Project and Dolphin Energy, including $39 million for historical costs. The 2001 amount includes the gross proceeds of $863 million from the sale of the entity that owns a Texas intrastate pipeline system and the sale of Occidentals interest in the Tangguh LNG project in Indonesia. Also, see the "Capital Expenditures" section below. In millions 2003 2002 2001 Net cash used by financing activities $ (516) $ (456) $ (1,814) The 2003 amount includes net debt repayments of $334 million. The 2002 amount reflects the net $179 million buyout of the natural gas delivery commitment and $72 million of net proceeds from the issuance of a subsidiarys preferred stock. The 2001 amount reflects the repayment of $2.3 billion of long term and non recourse debt, partially offset by proceeds of $861 million from new long term debt. Occidental paid common stock dividends of $392 million in 2003, $375 million in 2002 and $372 million in 2001. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES In millions 2003 2002 2001 Oil and Gas $ 1,237 $ 1,038 $ 1,138 Chemical 345 109 112 Corporate and other 19 89 58 TOTAL $ 1,601 $ 1,236 $ 1,308 The 2003 chemical amount includes $180 million for the purchase of a previously leased facility in LaPorte, Texas and $44 million related to the exercise of purchase options for certain leased railcars. Occidentals capital spending estimate for 2004 is approximately $1.4 billion. In addition, Occidental expects to spend $250 million to $300 million on the Dolphin Project. A majority of the capital spending will be allocated to oil and gas, with the main focus on Qatar, Elk Hills and the Permian Basin. Commitments at December 31, 2003, for major capital expenditures during 2004 and thereafter were approximately $201 million. Occidental will fund these commitments and capital expenditures with cash from operations and, as needed, with proceeds from existing credit facilities. ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL POSITION The changes in the following components of Occidentals balance sheet are discussed below: SELECTED BALANCE SHEET COMPONENTS In millions 2003 2002 Cash and cash equivalents $ 683 $ 146 Trade receivables, net $ 804 $ 608 Income tax receivable $ 20 $ 150 Investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries $ 1,155 $ 1,056 Property, plant and equipment, net $ 14,005 $ 13,036 Current maturities of long term debt and capital lease liabilities $ 23 $ 206 Accounts payable $ 909 $ 785 Accrued liabilities $ 877 $ 914 Dividends payable $ 101 $ 193 Trust preferred securities current $ 453 $ Trust preferred securities non current $ $ 455 Other deferred credits and liabilities $ 2,407 $ 2,228 Stockholders equity $ 7,929 $ 6,318 18 The higher balance in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2003, compared to December 31, 2002, reflects the build up of cash, part of which was used to redeem $453 million of trust preferred securities in January 2004. The higher balance in trade receivables at December 31, 2003, compared with December 31, 2002, reflects higher product prices and sales volumes during the fourth quarter of 2003 versus 2002 in the oil and gas segment. The decrease in income tax receivable was due to a 2002 tax receivable from the Equistar sale that was received in 2003. The higher balance in investments in unconsolidated entities primarily reflects a capital contribution to the Ecuador OCP pipeline investment, additional purchases of Lyondell and Premcor stock and mark to market increases in the available for sale Premcor investment. The increase in the net balance in property, plant and equipment reflects capital spending, the addition of the acquired Permian Basin assets and the consolidation of the OxyMar property, plant and equipment as a result of the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. (FIN) 46, partially offset by depreciation, depletion and amortization. The decrease in current maturities of long term debt is due to the fact that a lower level of debt will mature in 2004. The increase in accounts payable is due to higher payable balances in the oil and gas marketing and trading operations. The decrease in accrued liabilities is due to lower mark to market adjustments on derivative financial instruments. The decrease in dividends payable is due to the fact that at the end of 2002, there were two quarters of dividend accruals due to an early declaration in 2002 of a dividend paid in 2003. At June 30, 2003, pursuant to the adoption of SFAS No. 150, the trust preferred securities were reclassified to long term liabilities. At year end 2003, they were further reclassified to current liabilities as Occidental announced its intention to redeem all of the trust preferred securities. On January 20, 2004, all of the trust preferred securities were redeemed. Other deferred credits and liabilities include deferred compensation, other post retirement benefits, environmental remediation reserves, asset retirement obligations and other deferred items. The increase in other deferred credits and liabilities in 2003, compared to 2002, was primarily due to the asset retirement obligation that was recorded in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 143. The increase in stockholders equity primarily reflects net income and issuance of new stock related to options exercised, partially offset by dividends on common stock. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS In the course of its business activities, Occidental pursues a number of projects and transactions to meet its core business objectives. The accounting and financial statement treatment of these transactions is a result of the varying methods of funding employed. Occidental also makes commitments on behalf of unconsolidated entities. These transactions, or groups of transactions, are recorded in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles and, unless otherwise noted, are not reflected on Occidentals balance sheets. The following is a description of the business purpose and nature of these transactions. DOLPHIN PROJECT See discussion of the Dolphin Project in the "Business Review Oil and Gas, Middle East" section of the MD&A above. ECUADOR In Ecuador, Occidental has a 14 percent interest in the OCP oil export pipeline. In the second half of 2003, the increased production from the Eden Yuturi oil field in the southeastern corner of Block 15 coincided with the completion of the pipeline. Occidental made capital contributions of $64 million in 2003 and as of December 31, 2003, has contributed a total of $73 million to the project. Occidental reports this investment in its consolidated statements using the equity method of accounting. The project was funded in part by senior project debt. The senior project debt is to be repaid with the proceeds of ship or pay tariffs of certain upstream producers in Ecuador, including Occidental. Under their ship or pay commitments, Occidental and the other upstream producers have each assumed their respective share of project specific risks, including operating risk and force majeure risk. Occidental would be required to make an advance tariff payment in the event of prolonged force majeure, upstream expropriation events, bankruptcy of the pipeline company or its parent company, abandonment of the project, termination of an investment guarantee agreement with Ecuador, or certain defaults by Occidental. This advance tariff would be used by the pipeline company to service or prepay project debt. Occidentals obligation relating to the pipeline companys senior project debt totaled $108 million, and Occidentals obligations relating to performance bonds totaled $14 million at December 31, 2003. As Occidental ships product using the pipeline, its overall obligations will decrease with the reduction of the pipeline companys senior project debt. ELK HILLS POWER Occidental has a 50 percent interest in Elk Hills Power LLC (EHP), a limited liability company that operates a gas fired, power generation plant in California. EHP is a variable interest entity (VIE) under the provisions of FIN 46. Occidental has concluded it is not the primary beneficiary of EHP and, therefore, accounts for this investment using the equity method. In January 2002, EHP entered into a $400 million construction loan facility, which was amended in May 2003 to increase the facility to $425 million. Upon construction completion on July 17, 2003, the facility converted to a $415 million term loan, 50 percent of which is guaranteed by Occidental. 19 RECEIVABLES SALE PROGRAM Occidental has an agreement in place to sell, under a revolving sale program, an undivided interest in a designated pool of trade receivables. This program is used by Occidental as a low cost source of working capital funding. The balance of receivables sold at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $360 million. This amount is not included in the debt and related trade receivables accounts, respectively, on Occidentals consolidated balance sheets. Receivables must meet certain criteria to qualify for the program. Under this program, Occidental serves as the collection agent with respect to the receivables sold. An interest in new receivables is sold as collections are made from customers. Fees and expenses under this program are included in selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses. The fair value of any retained interests in the receivables sold is not material. The buyers of the receivables are protected against significant risk of loss on their purchase of receivables. Occidental provides for allowances for any doubtful receivables based on its periodic evaluation of such receivables. The provisions for such receivables were not material in the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. The program can terminate upon the occurrence of certain events, which generally are under Occidentals control or relate to bankruptcy. In such an event, alternative funding would have to be arranged, which could result in an increase in debt recorded on the consolidated balance sheet, with a corresponding increase in the accounts receivable balance. The consolidated income statement effect of such an event would not be significant. LEASES Occidental has entered into various operating lease agreements, mainly for railcars, power plants, manufacturing facilities and office space. The leased assets are used in Occidentals operations where leasing offers advantages of greater operating flexibility and generally costs less than alternative methods of funding that were available at the time financing decisions were made. Lease payments are expensed mainly as cost of sales. See contractual obligation table below. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The table below summarizes and cross references certain contractual obligations that are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and or disclosed in the accompanying Notes. Payments Due by Year 2005 2007 2009 Contractual to to and Obligations (in millions) Total 2004 2006 2008 thereafter CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET Long term debt (Note 6) (a) $ 4,389 $ 476 $ 653 $ 955 $ 2,305 Capital leases (Note 7) 33 1 2 2 28 Other long term liabilities (b) 658 75 146 102 335 OTHER OBLIGATIONS Operating leases (Note 7) (c) 1,332 106 179 137 910 Purchase obligations (d) 2,728 1,657 292 151 628 TOTAL $ 9,140 $ 2,315 $ 1,272 $ 1,347 $ 4,206 (a) Includes trust preferred securities reported as current liabilities at December 31, 2003, and excludes fair value hedge mark to market adjustments and unamortized debt discounts. (b) Primarily includes obligations under postretirement benefit and deferred compensation plans. (c) Amounts are presented gross of sublease rental income. (d) Primarily includes long term purchase contracts and purchase orders and contracts for goods and services used in manufacturing and producing operations in the normal course of business. Some of these arrangements involve take or pay commitments but they do not represent debt obligations. Due to their long term nature, purchase contracts with terms greater than 5 years are discounted using a 6 percent discount rate. LAWSUITS, CLAIMS, COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND RELATED MATTERS OPC and certain of its subsidiaries have been named in a substantial number of lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings. These actions seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties or other losses; or injunctive or declaratory relief. OPC and certain of its subsidiaries also have been named in proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and similar federal, state and local environmental laws. These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages and civil penalties; however, Occidental is usually one of many companies in these proceedings and has to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, including environmental proceedings, Occidental accrues reserves when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. 20 During the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions. Taxable years prior to 1997 are closed for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Taxable years 1997 through 2002 are in various stages of audit by the Internal Revenue Service. Disputes arise during the course of such audits as to facts and matters of law. Occidental has entered into agreements providing for future payments to secure terminal and pipeline capacity, drilling services, electrical power, steam and certain chemical raw materials. At December 31, 2003, the net present value of the fixed and determinable portion of the obligations under these agreements, which were used to collateralize financings of the respective suppliers, aggregated $45 million, which was payable as follows (in millions): 2004 $12, 2005 $11, 2006 $10, 2007 $9 and 2008 $3. Fixed payments under these agreements were $16 million in 2003, $27 million in 2002 and $20 million in 2001. Occidental has certain other commitments under contracts, guarantees and joint ventures, and certain other contingent liabilities. Many of these commitments, although not fixed or determinable, involve capital expenditures and are part of the $1.4 billion capital expenditures estimated for 2004, and the $250 to $300 million estimated to be spent on the Dolphin Project in 2004. As discussed under "Significant Accounting Changes" below, FIN 45 requires the disclosure in Occidentals financial statements of information relating to guarantees issued by Occidental and outstanding at December 31, 2003. These guarantees encompass performance bonds, letters of credit, indemnities, commitments and other forms of guarantees provided by Occidental to third parties, mainly to provide assurance that Occidental and or its subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations (guarantees). At December 31, 2003, the notional amount of the guarantees was approximately $500 million. Of this amount, approximately $400 million relates to Occidentals guarantee of equity investees debt and other commitments. The debt guarantees relating to Elk Hills Power and the guarantees on debt and other commitments relating to the Ecuador pipeline have been discussed above in the "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements" section. The remaining $100 million relates to various indemnities and guarantees provided to third parties. Occidental has indemnified various parties against specified liabilities that those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with Occidental. These indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds. As of December 31, 2003, Occidental is not aware of circumstances that would lead to future indemnity claims against it for material amounts in connection with these transactions. It is impossible at this time to determine the ultimate liabilities that OPC and its subsidiaries may incur resulting from any lawsuits, claims and proceedings, audits, commitments, contingencies and related matters. If these matters were to be ultimately resolved unfavorably at amounts substantially exceeding Occidentals reserves, an outcome not currently anticipated, it is possible that such outcome could have a material adverse effect upon Occidentals consolidated financial position or results of operations. However, after taking into account reserves, management does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of these matters to have a material adverse effect upon Occidentals consolidated financial position or results of operations. ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURES Occidentals operations in the United States are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to improving or maintaining environmental quality. Foreign operations also are subject to environmental protection laws. Costs associated with environmental compliance have increased over time and are generally expected to rise in the future. Environmental expenditures related to current operations are factored into the overall business planning process. These expenditures are mainly considered an integral part of production in manufacturing quality products responsive to market demand. ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION The laws that require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively to past waste disposal practices and releases. In many cases, the laws apply regardless of fault, legality of the original activities or current ownership or control of sites. OPC or certain of its subsidiaries are currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups under these laws at federal Superfund sites, comparable state sites and other remediation sites, including Occidental facilities and previously owned sites. Also, OPC and certain of its subsidiaries have been involved in a substantial number of governmental and private proceedings involving historical practices at various sites including, in some instances, having been named in proceedings under CERCLA and similar federal, state and local environmental laws. These proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages and civil penalties. Occidental manages its environmental remediation efforts through a wholly owned subsidiary, Glenn Springs Holdings, Inc. (GSH), which reports its results directly to Occidentals corporate management. 21 The following table presents Occidentals environmental remediation reserves at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 grouped by three categories of environmental remediation sites: $ amounts in millions 2003 2002 2001 # OF RESERVE # of Reserve # of Reserve SITES BALANCE Sites Balance Sites Balance CERCLA & equivalent sites 131 $ 240 124 $ 284 126 $ 320 Active facilities 13 79 14 46 14 59 Closed or sold facilities 39 53 44 63 47 75 TOTAL 183 $ 372 182 $ 393 187 $ 454 The increase in the number of CERCLA and equivalent sites between 2002 and 2003 was primarily in the "minimal/no exposure" category as discussed below. The following table shows environmental reserve activity for the past three reporting periods: In millions 2003 2002 2001 Balance Beginning of Year $ 393 $ 454 $ 402 Increases to provision including interest accretion 64 25 111 Changes from acquisitions/dispositions 5 Payments (83) (84) (75) Other (2) (2) 11 Balance End of Year $ 372 $ 393 $ 454 Occidental expects to expend funds equivalent to about half of the current environmental reserve over the next three years and the balance over the next ten or more years. Occidental expects that it may continue to incur additional liabilities beyond those recorded for environmental remediation at these and other sites. The range of reasonably possible loss for existing environmental remediation matters could be up to $400 million beyond the amount accrued. For managements opinion, refer to the "Lawsuits, Claims, Commitments, Contingencies and Related Matters" section above. CERCLA AND EQUIVALENT SITES At December 31, 2003, OPC or certain of its subsidiaries have been named in 131 CERCLA or state equivalent proceedings, as shown below. Reserve Description ($ amounts in millions) # of Sites Balance Minimal/No exposure (a) 109 $ 5 Reserves between $1 10 MM 15 59 Reserves over $10 MM 7 176 TOTAL 131 $ 240 (a) Includes 33 sites for which Maxus Energy Corporation has retained the liability and indemnified Occidental, 7 sites where Occidental has denied liability without challenge, 57 sites where Occidentals reserves are less than $50,000 each, and 12 sites where reserves are between $50,000 and $1 million each. The seven sites with individual reserves over $10 million in 2003 are a former copper mining and smelting operation in Tennessee, two closed landfills in Western New York, groundwater treatment facilities at three former chemical plants (Western New York, Montague, Michigan and Tacoma, Washington) and a municipal drinking water treatment plant in Western New York. ACTIVE FACILITIES Certain subsidiaries of OPC are currently addressing releases of substances from past operations at 13 active facilities. Four facilities certain oil and gas properties in the southwestern United States, a chemical plant in Louisiana, a chemical plant in Texas, and a phosphorous recovery operation in Tennessee account for 89 percent of the reserves associated with these facilities. CLOSED OR SOLD FACILITIES There are 39 sites formerly owned or operated by certain subsidiaries of OPC that have ongoing environmental remediation requirements. Three sites account for 72 percent of the reserves associated with this group. The three sites are: an active refinery in Louisiana where Occidental indemnifies the current owner and operator for certain remedial actions, a water treatment facility at a former coal mine in Pennsylvania, and a former chemical plant in West Virginia. ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS Occidentals costs, some of which may include estimates, relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations, are shown below for each segment: In millions 2003 2002 2001 OPERATING EXPENSES Oil and Gas $ 40 $ 32 $ 22 Chemical 49 46 47 $ 89 $ 78 $ 69 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Oil and Gas $ 98 $ 70 $ 60 Chemical 15 16 20 $ 113 $ 86 $ 80 REMEDIATION EXPENSES Corporate $ 63 $ 23 $ 109 Operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis. Capital expenditures relate to longer lived improvements in currently operating facilities. Remediation expenses relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and do not contribute to current or future revenue generation. Although total costs may vary in any one year, over the long term, segment operating and capital expenditures for environmental compliance generally are expected to increase. 22 In October 2001, the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved a State Implementation Plan (SIP) for eight counties in the Houston Galveston area of Texas to implement certain requirements of the federal Clean Air Act. The SIP contains provisions requiring the reduction of 80 percent of nitrogen oxide emissions and 60 percent of certain volatile organic compound emissions by November 2007. Occidental operates six facilities that are subject to the SIPs emissions reduction requirements and estimates that its future capital expenditures will total approximately $25 to $30 million for environmental control and monitoring equipment necessary to comply with the SIP. Occidental expects expenditures to end in 2007, although the timing of the expenditures will vary by facility. Occidental presently estimates that capital expenditures for environmental compliance (including the SIP discussed above) will be approximately $82 million for 2004 and $97 million for 2005. FOREIGN INVESTMENTS Portions of Occidentals assets outside North America are exposed to political and economic risks. Occidental conducts its financial affairs so as to mitigate its exposure against those risks. At December 31, 2003, the carrying value of Occidentals assets in countries outside North America aggregated approximately $3.3 billion, or approximately 18 percent of Occidentals total assets at that date. Of such assets, approximately $2.3 billion are located in the Middle East, approximately $759 million are located in Latin America, and substantially all of the remainder are located in Pakistan. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The process of preparing financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the management of Occidental to make estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions. It is possible that materially different amounts could be recorded if these estimates and judgments change or if the actual results differ from these estimates and judgments. Occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve the judgment of Occidentals management. There has been no material change to these policies over the past three years. The selection and development of these critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES Occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties. Under this method, costs of acquiring properties, costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration costs, geological, geophysical and seismic costs and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids (NGLs) that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty can be recovered in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions considering future production and development costs. There are several factors that could change Occidentals recorded oil and gas reserves. Occidental receives a share of production from production sharing contracts to recover its costs and an additional share for profit. Occidentals share of production from these contracts decreases when oil prices improve and increases when oil prices decline. Overall, Occidentals net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices. In other contractual arrangements, sustained lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of proved reserves becomes uneconomical. Estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond Occidentals control, such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs. These factors, in turn, could lead to a reduction in the quantity of recorded proved reserves. An additional factor that could result in a change of proved reserves is the reservoir decline rates being different from those assumed when the reserves were initially recorded. Overall, Occidentals revisions to proved reserves were positive for 2003, 2002 and 2001 and amounted to less than 1 percent of the total reserves for each year. Additionally, Occidental is required to perform impairment tests pursuant to SFAS No. 144 generally when prices decline and or reserve estimates change significantly. There have been no impairments of reserves over the past three years. Depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties is determined by the unit of production method and could change with revisions to estimated proved recoverable reserves. The change in the depreciation and depletion rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous reserve estimates has been immaterial. If Occidentals oil and gas reserves were to change based on the factors mentioned above, the most significant impact would be on the depreciation and depletion rate. For example, a 5 percent increase in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the rate from $4.82/barrel to $4.58/barrel, which would increase pre tax income by $48 million annually. A 5 percent decrease in the oil and gas reserves would change the rate from $4.82/barrel to $5.06/barrel and would result in a decrease in pre tax income of $48 million annually. A portion of the carrying value of Occidentals oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties. At December 31, 2003, the costs attributable to unproved properties were approximately $900 million. These costs are not currently being depreciated or depleted. As exploration and development work progresses and the reserves on these properties are proven, capitalized 23 costs attributable to the properties will be subject to depreciation and depletion. If the exploration and development work were to be unsuccessful, the capitalized costs of the properties related to this unsuccessful work would be expensed in the year in which the determination was made. The timing of any writedowns of these unproven properties, if warranted, depends upon the nature, timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results. Occidental believes its exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize the unproved property balance. CHEMICAL ASSETS The most critical accounting policy affecting Occidentals chemical assets is the determination of the estimated useful lives of its property, plant and equipment. Occidentals chemical plants are depreciated using either the unit of production or straight line method based upon the estimated useful life of the facilities. The estimated useful lives of Occidentals chemical assets, which range from 3 years to 50 years, are used to compute depreciation expense and are also used for impairment tests. The estimated useful lives used for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that Occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to maintain the facilities in good operating condition. Without these continued expenditures, the useful lives of these plants could significantly decrease. Other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of Occidentals chemical plants include higher or lower product prices, which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition, feedstock costs, energy prices, environmental regulations, competition and technological changes. Occidental is required to perform impairment tests on its assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when managements plans change with respect to those assets. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 144, Occidental must compare the undiscounted future cash flows of an asset to its carrying value. The key factors that could significantly affect future cash flows are future product prices, which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition, feedstock costs, energy costs, significantly increased regulation and remaining estimated useful life. Due to a temporary decrease in demand for some of its products, Occidental temporarily idled an EDC plant in June 2001, a chlor alkali plant in December 2001 and a portion of a chlor alkali plant in June 2003. These facilities will remain idle until market conditions improve. Management expects that these plants will become operational in the future. The net book value of these plants was $156 million at December 31, 2003. Based on year end value, the chlor alkali plant that closed on December 1, 2001 has a 24 percent minority interest of $28 million. These facilities are periodically tested for impairment and, based on the results, no impairment is deemed necessary at this time. Occidental continues to depreciate these facilities based on their remaining estimated useful lives. Over the prior three years, the change in the depreciation rate due to changes in estimated useful lives has been immaterial. Occidentals net property, plant and equipment for chemicals is approximately $2.6 billion and its annual depreciation expense is expected to be approximately $225 million. If the estimated useful lives of Occidentals chemical plants were to decrease based on the factors mentioned above, the most significant impact would be on depreciation expense. For example, a reduction in the remaining useful lives of 20 percent would increase depreciation and reduce pre tax earnings by approximately $50 million per year. ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURES Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Reserves for estimated costs that relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future revenue generation are recorded when environmental remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. In determining the reserves and the reasonably possible range of loss, Occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience, available technology, regulations in effect, the timing of remediation and cost sharing arrangements. The environmental reserves are based on managements estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred and are reviewed periodically and adjusted as additional or new information becomes available. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, Occidental has not accrued any reimbursements or indemnification recoveries for environmental remediation matters as assets. Recoveries and reimbursements are recorded in income when receipt is probable. Environmental reserves are recorded on a discounted basis only when a reserve is initially established and the aggregate amount of the estimated costs for a specific site and the timing of cash payments are reliably determinable. The reserve methodology for a specific site is not modified once it has been established. Many factors could result in changes to Occidentals environmental reserves and reasonably possible range of loss. The most significant are: >> The original cost estimate may have been inaccurate. >> Modified remedial measures might be necessary to achieve the required remediation results. Occidental generally assumes that the remedial objective can be achieved using the most cost effective technology reasonably expected to achieve that objective. Such technologies may include air sparging or phyto remediation of shallow groundwater, or limited surface soil removal or in situ treatment producing acceptable risk assessment results. Should such remedies fail to achieve remedial objectives, more intensive or costly measures may be required. 24 >> The remedial measure might take more or less time than originally anticipated to achieve the required contaminant reduction. Site specific time estimates can be affected by factors such as groundwater capture rates, anomalies in subsurface geology, interactions between or among water bearing zones and non water bearing zones, or the ability to identify and control contaminant sources. >> The regulatory agency might ultimately reject or modify Occidentals proposed remedial plan and insist upon a different course of action. Additionally, other events might occur that could affect Occidentals future remediation costs, such as: >> The discovery of more extensive contamination than had been originally anticipated. For some sites with impacted groundwater, accurate definition of contaminant plumes requires years of monitoring data and computer modeling. Migration of contaminants may follow unexpected pathways along geologic anomalies that could initially go undetected. Additionally, the size of the area requiring remediation may change based upon risk assessment results following site characterization or interim remedial measures. >> Improved remediation technology might decrease the cost of remediation. In particular, for groundwater remediation sites with projected long term operation and maintenance, the development of more effective treatment technology, or acceptance of alternative and more cost effective treatment methodologies such as bio remediation, could significantly affect remediation costs. >> Laws and regulations might change to impose more or less stringent remediation requirements. At sites involving multiple parties, Occidental provides environmental reserves based upon its expected share of liability. When other parties are jointly liable, the financial viability of the parties, the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to Occidental of their failure to participate are evaluated when estimating Occidentals ultimate share of liability. Based on these factors, Occidental believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of other potentially responsible parties, with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, in an amount that would have a material effect on Occidentals consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Most cost sharing arrangements with other parties fall into one of the following three categories: Category 1: CERCLA or state equivalent sites wherein Occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties share the cost of remediation in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations; Category 2: Oil and gas joint ventures wherein each joint venture partner pays its proportionate share of remedial cost; and Category 3: Contractual arrangements typically relating to purchases and sales of property wherein the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating the costs of environmental remediation. In all three of these categories, Occidental records as a reserve its expected net cost of remedial activities, as adjusted by recognition for any non performing parties. In addition to the costs of investigating and implementing remedial measures, which often take in excess of ten years at CERCLA sites, Occidentals reserves include managements estimates of the cost of operation and maintenance of remedial systems. To the extent that the remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site specific data, laws, regulations, technologies or engineering estimates, Occidental reviews and changes the reserves accordingly on a site specific basis. If the environmental reserve balance were to either increase or decrease based on the factors mentioned above, the amount of the increase or decrease would be immediately recognized in earnings. For example, if the reserve balance were to decrease by 10 percent, Occidental would record a pre tax gain of $37 million. If the reserve balance were to increase by 10 percent, Occidental would record an additional remediation expense of $37 million. OTHER LOSS CONTINGENCIES Occidental is involved with numerous lawsuits, claims, proceedings and audits in the normal course of its operations. Occidental records a loss contingency for these matters when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In addition, Occidental discloses, in aggregate, its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred. Occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an on going basis so that they are adequately reserved on the balance sheet. These reserves are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate. Managements judgments could change based on new information, changes in laws or regulations, changes in managements plans or intentions, the outcome of legal proceedings, settlements or other factors. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING CHANGES Listed below are significant changes in Occidentals accounting principles. SFAS NO. 132 REVISED In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to SFAS No. 132, "Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits" to improve financial statement disclosures for defined benefit plans. The standard requires that companies provide more details about their plan assets, benefit obligations, cash flows and other relevant information, such as plan assets by category. A description of investment policies and strategies for these asset categories and target allocation percentages or target ranges are also required 25 in financial statements. This statement is effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003. Occidental adopted this statement in the fourth quarter of 2003 and provided the required disclosure in this report. SFAS NO. 150 In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity." SFAS No. 150 establishes accounting standards for how a company classifies and measures financial instruments that have characteristics of liabilities and equity. Occidental adopted the provisions of this statement on July 1, 2003. As a result of the adoption, Occidentals mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities are now classified as a liability and the payments to the holders of the securities, which were previously recorded as minority interest on the statement of operations, are recorded as interest expense. On January 20, 2004, all of the trust preferred securities were redeemed. SFAS NO. 149 In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS No. 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments. This statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. Occidental adopted this statement in the third quarter of 2003 and it did not have a material effect on its financial statements. FIN 46 AND FIN 46 R (REVISED) In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." FIN 46 requires a company to consolidate a VIE if it is designated as the primary beneficiary of that entity even if the company does not have a majority of voting interests. A VIE is generally defined as an entity whose equity is unable to finance its activities or whose owners lack the risks and rewards of ownership. The statement also imposes disclosure requirements for all the VIEs of a company, even if the company is not the primary beneficiary. The provisions of this statement apply at inception for any entity created after January 31, 2003. Occidental adopted the provisions of this Interpretation for its existing entities on April 1, 2003, which resulted in the consolidation of its OxyMar investment. As a result of the OxyMar consolidation, assets increased by $166 million and liabilities increased by $178 million. There was no material effect on net income as a result of the consolidation. In September 2003, Marubeni indicated it would exercise its option to put its interest in OxyMar to Occidental by paying approximately $25 million to Occidental. In connection with the transfer, which is expected to be complete in April 2004, Occidental will assume Marubenis guarantee of OxyMars debt. As all the OxyMar debt is already consolidated in Occidentals financial statements with the adoption of FIN 46, the exercise of the put will not have a material effect on Occidentals financial position or results of operations. See "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Elk Hills Power" for information on VIEs where Occidental is not the primary beneficiary. In December 2003, the FASB revised FIN 46 to exempt certain entities from its requirements and to clarify certain issues arising during the initial implementation of FIN 46. Occidental will adopt the revised interpretation in the first quarter of 2004 and it is not expected to have an impact on the financial statements when adopted. FIN 45 In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." FIN 45 requires a company to recognize a liability for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing a guarantee. This liability would be recorded at the inception of a guarantee and would be measured at fair value. FIN 45 also requires certain disclosures related to guarantees, which are included in Note 9. Occidental adopted the measurement provisions of this statement in the first quarter of 2003 and it did not have an effect on the financial statements when adopted. EITF ISSUE NO. 02 3 In the third quarter of 2002, Occidental adopted certain provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 02 3, "Issues involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities." These provisions prescribed significant changes in how revenue from energy trading is recorded. Historically, Occidental had two major types of oil and gas revenues: (1) revenues from its equity production; and (2) revenues from the sale of oil and gas produced by other companies, but purchased and resold by Occidental, referred to as revenue from trading activities. Both types of sales involve physical deliveries and had been historically recorded on a gross basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. With the adoption of EITF Issue No. 02 3, Occidental now reflects the revenue from trading activities on a net basis. There were no changes in gross margins, net income, cash flow or earnings per share for any period as a result of adopting this requirement. However, net sales and cost of sales were reduced by equal and offsetting amounts to reflect the adoption of this requirement. For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, net sales and cost of sales were reduced from amounts previously reported by approximately $2.2 billion (representing amounts for the first two quarters of 2002) and $5.8 billion, respectively, to conform to the current presentation. Since 1999, Occidental has accounted for certain energy trading contracts in accordance with EITF Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities." EITF Issue No. 98 10 required that all energy trading contracts must be marked to fair value with gains and losses included in earnings, whether the contracts were derivatives or not. 26 In October 2002, the EITF rescinded EITF Issue No. 98 10 thus precluding mark to market accounting for all energy trading contracts that are not derivatives and fair value accounting for inventories purchased from third parties. Also, the rescission requires derivative gains and losses to be presented net on the income statement, whether or not they are physically settled, if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes. Occidental adopted this accounting change in the first quarter of 2003 and recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles charge of approximately $18 million, after tax. SFAS NO. 146 In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability be recognized for exit and disposal costs only when the liability has been incurred and when it can be measured at fair value. The statement is effective for exit and disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. Occidental adopted SFAS No. 146 in the first quarter of 2003 and it did not have a material effect on its financial statements. SFAS NO. 145 In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections." In addition to amending or rescinding other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections, clarify meanings, or describe their applicability under changed conditions, SFAS No. 145 precludes companies from recording gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt as an extraordinary item. Occidental implemented SFAS No. 145 in the fourth quarter of 2002 and all comparative financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation. Since Occidental had no 2002 extraordinary items, there was no effect on the 2002 presentation. The effects of the statement on prior years include the reclassification of an extraordinary loss to net income from continuing operations of $8 million ($0.02 per share) in 2001. There was no effect on net income or basic earnings per common share upon adoption. SFAS NO. 143 In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. Under SFAS No. 143, companies are required to recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which the liability is incurred if there is a legal obligation to dismantle the asset and reclaim or remediate the property at the end of the useful life. Occidental adopted SFAS No. 143 in the first quarter of 2003. The initial adoption resulted in an after tax charge of $50 million, which was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles. The adoption increased net property, plant and equipment by $73 million, increased asset retirement obligations by $151 million and decreased deferred tax liabilities by $28 million. The pro forma asset retirement obligation, if the adoption of this statement had occurred on January 1, 2002, would have been $131 million at January 1, 2002 and $151 million at December 31, 2002. SFAS NO. 142 In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 142 changes the accounting and reporting requirements for acquired goodwill and intangible assets. The provisions of this statement are applied to companies starting with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. At December 31, 2001, the balance sheet included approximately $108 million of goodwill and intangible assets with annual amortization expense of approximately $6 million recorded in each of the years income statements for the three year period ended December 31, 2001. As a result, elimination of goodwill amortization would not have had a material impact on net income or earnings per share of any of the years presented and, as a result, the transitional disclosures of adjusted net income excluding goodwill amortization described by SFAS No. 142 have not been presented. Upon implementation of SFAS No. 142 in the first quarter of 2002, three separate specialty chemical businesses were identified as separate reporting units and tested for goodwill impairment. All three of these businesses are components of the chemical segment. The fair value of each of the three reporting units was determined through third party appraisals. The appraisals determined fair value to be the price that the assets could be sold for in a current transaction between willing parties. As a result of the impairment testing, Occidental recorded a cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles after tax reduction in net income of approximately $95 million due to the impairment of all the goodwill attributed to these reporting units. SFAS NO. 133 On January 1, 2001, Occidental adopted SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended. This statement established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities and required an entity to recognize derivatives on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. Changes in the derivative instruments fair value must be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Adoption of this new accounting standard resulted in cumulative after tax reductions in net income of approximately $24 million and Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) of approximately $27 million in the first quarter of 2001. The adoption also increased total assets by $588 million and total liabilities by $639 million as of January 1, 2001. 27 INTANGIBLE ASSETS The EITF currently is deliberating on EITF No. 03 O, "Whether Mineral Rights Are Tangible or Intangible Assets" and EITF No. 03 S "Application of FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to Oil and Gas Companies." These proposed statements will determine whether contract based oil and gas mineral rights are classified as tangible or intangible assets based on the EITFs interpretation of SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No. 142. Historically, Occidental has classified all of its contract based mineral rights within property, plant and equipment and has generally not identified these amounts separately. If the EITF determines that these mineral rights should be presented as intangible assets, Occidental would have to reclassify its contract based oil and gas mineral rights acquired after June 30, 2001 to intangible assets and make additional disclosures in accordance with SFAS No. 142. If Occidental adopted this change, approximately $492 million and $226 million of the property, plant and equipment balance would be reclassified to intangible assets at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These amounts, which are net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization, include approximately $475 million and $210 million of mineral rights related to proved properties at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Occidental has been amortizing these amounts under the unit of production method and would continue to amortize the mineral rights under this method. Based on its understanding of the scope of the EITF deliberations, Occidental believes the adoption of this potential decision would have no material effect on its results of operations. DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES AND MARKET RISK GENERAL Occidentals market risk exposures relate primarily to commodity prices and, to a lesser extent, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Occidental periodically enters into derivative instrument transactions to reduce these price and rate fluctuations. A derivative is a financial instrument which derives its value from another instrument or variable. In general, the fair value recorded for derivative instruments is based on quoted market prices, dealer quotes and the Black Scholes or similar valuation models. ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES AND DEFINITIONS Occidental applies either fair value or cash flow hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria to obtain hedge accounting treatment. If the derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge, the gain or loss is immediately recognized in earnings. If the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting, the gain or loss on the derivative is either recognized in income with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged for fair value hedges, or deferred in OCI to the extent the hedge is effective for cash flow hedges. A hedge is regarded as highly effective and qualifies for hedge accounting if, at inception and throughout its life, it is expected that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item are almost fully offset by the changes in the fair value or changes in cash flows of the hedging instrument and actual effectiveness is within a range of 80 percent to 125 percent. In the case of hedging a forecasted transaction, the transaction must be highly probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect reported net profit or loss. Occidental discontinues hedge accounting when it is determined that a derivative has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge; when the derivative expires, or is sold, terminated, or exercised; when the hedged item matures or is sold or repaid; or when a forecasted transaction is no longer deemed highly probable. COMMODITY PRICE RISK GENERAL Occidentals results are sensitive to fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices. Based on current levels of production, if oil prices vary overall by $1 per barrel, it would have approximately a $125 million annual effect on income before U.S. income tax. If natural gas prices vary by $0.25 per MCF, it would have approximately a $48 million annual effect on income before U.S. income tax. If production levels change in the future, the sensitivity of Occidentals results to oil and gas prices also would change. Occidentals results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices. If chlorine and caustic soda prices vary by $10/ton, it would have approximately a $12 million and $25 million, respectively, annual effect on income before U.S. income taxes. If PVC prices vary by $.01/lb, it would have approximately a $27 million annual effect on income before U.S. income taxes. If EDC prices vary by $10/ton, it would have approximately a $3 million annual effect on income before U.S. income taxes. Historically, price changes either precede or follow raw material and feedstock price changes; therefore, the margin improvement of price changes can be mitigated. According to Chemical Market Associates, Inc., December 2003 average contract prices were: chlorine $203/ton, caustic soda $133/ton, PVC $0.44/lb and EDC $228/ton. MARKETING AND TRADING OPERATIONS Occidental periodically uses different types of derivative instruments to achieve the best prices for oil and gas. Derivatives are also used by Occidental to reduce its exposure to price volatility and mitigate fluctuations in commodity related cash flows. Occidental enters into low risk marketing and trading activities through its separate marketing organization, which operates under established policy controls and procedures. With respect to derivatives used in its oil and gas marketing operations, Occidental utilizes a combination of futures, forwards, options and swaps to offset various physical transactions. Overall, Occidental has a low level of involvement in the hedging of long term oil and gas prices and its use of derivatives in hedging activity remains at a correspondingly low level. 28 In September 2002, Occidental unwound its natural gas delivery commitment and corresponding natural gas price swap which were entered into in November 1998. Occidental recognized a pre tax loss of $3 million related to these transactions. RISK MANAGEMENT Occidental conducts its risk management activities for energy commodities (which include buying, selling, marketing, trading, and hedging activities) under the controls and governance of its Risk Management Policy. The Chief Financial Officer and Risk Management Committee, comprising members of Occidentals management, oversee these controls, which are implemented and enforced by the Trading Control Officer. The Trading Control Officer provides an independent and separate check on results of marketing and trading activities. Controls for energy commodities include limits on credit, limits on trading, segregation of duties, delegation of authority and a number of other policy and procedural controls. FAIR VALUE OF CONTRACTS The following tables reconcile the changes in the fair value of Occidentals marketing and trading contracts during 2003 and 2002 and segregate the open contracts at December 31, 2003 by maturity periods. In millions 2003 2002 (a) Fair value of contracts outstanding at beginning of year $ (2) $ 43 Losses(gains) on changes on contracts realized or otherwise settled during the year 50 (17) Changes in fair value attributable to changes in valuation techniques and assumptions (Gains)losses on other changes in fair values (16) (28) Fair value of contracts outstanding at end of year $ 32 $ (2) (a) Amounts have been reclassified to conform to current presentation.

At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the physical positions were a net gain of $10 million and $6 million, respectively. The value of the derivative financial instruments that offset these physical positions are a net gain of $22 million and a net loss of $8 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Gains and losses are netted in the statement of operations. On the balance sheets, except where a right of set off exists, gains are recognized as assets and losses are recognized as liabilities. COMMODITY HEDGES On a limited basis, Occidental uses cash flow hedges for the sale of crude oil and natural gas production. Crude oil cash flow hedges were executed for approximately 20 percent of total U.S. oil production in 2002. Natural gas cash flow hedges were executed for approximately 7 percent of total U.S. 2002 gas production. Occidentals commodity cash flow hedging instruments in 2002 were highly effective. At December 31, 2002, all of these cash flow hedges had been settled. No fair value hedges were used for oil and gas production during 2003 or 2002 and no cash flow hedges were used for the sale of production in 2003. QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION Occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commodity based derivatives and commodity contracts used in trading activities. This method determines the maximum potential negative short term change in fair value with a 95 percent level of confidence. For non trading activities, there were no material amounts outstanding at December 31, 2003. The value at risk for both oil and natural gas is summarized below: MARKETING AND TRADING VALUE AT RISK For the years ended December 31, (in millions) 2003 2002 Value at Risk Oil High during the year $ $ 1 Low during the year Average for the year 1 Value at Risk Natural Gas High during the year $ 3 $ 1 Low during the year Average for the year 1 1 INTEREST RATE RISK GENERAL Occidental is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates and it enters into various derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate exposure. Interest rate swaps, forward locks and futures contracts are entered into periodically as part of Occidentals overall strategy. HEDGING ACTIVITIES Occidental has entered into several interest rate swaps that qualified for fair value hedge accounting. These derivatives effectively convert approximately $1.8 billion of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt with maturities ranging from 2005 to 2009. 29 Occidental was a party to a series of forward interest rate locks, which qualified as cash flow hedges. The hedges were related to the construction of a cogeneration plant leased by Occidental that was completed in December 2002. The remaining loss on the hedges through December 2003 was approximately $21 million after tax, which is recorded in accumulated OCI and is being recognized in earnings over the lease term of 26 years on a straight line basis. Certain of Occidentals equity investees have entered into additional derivative instruments that qualified as cash flow hedges. Occidental reflects its proportionate share of these cash flow hedges in OCI.

CREDIT RISK Occidentals energy contracts are spread among numerous counterparties. Creditworthiness is reviewed before doing business with a new counterparty and on an ongoing basis. Occidental monitors aggregated counterparty exposure relative to credit limits, and manages credit enhancement issues. Credit exposure for each customer is monitored for outstanding balances, current month activity, and forward mark to market exposure. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK Several of Occidentals foreign operations are located in countries whose currencies generally depreciate against the U.S. dollar. Typically, effective currency forward markets do not exist for these countries. Therefore, Occidental attempts to manage its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions only at levels necessary for operating purposes. Generally, international crude oil sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Additionally, all of Occidentals oil and gas foreign entities have the U.S. dollar as the functional currency. However, in one foreign chemical subsidiary where the local currency is the functional currency, Occidental has exposure on U.S. dollar denominated debt that is not material. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, Occidental had not entered into any foreign currency derivative instruments. The effect of exchange rate transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income. DERIVATIVE AND FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES The following table shows derivative financial instruments included in the consolidated balance sheets: Balance at December 31, (in millions) 2003 2002 Derivative financial instrument assets (a) Current $ 138 $ 164 Non current 118 157 $ 256 $ 321 Derivative financial instrument liabilities (a) Current $ 85 $ 115 Non current 23 23 $ 108 $ 138 (a) Amounts include energy trading contracts. As a result of fair value hedges, the amount of interest expense recorded in the income statement was lower by approximately $58 million and $45 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The following table summarizes after tax derivative activity recorded in OCI: For the years ended December 31, (in millions) 2003 2002 Beginning Balance $ (26) $ (20) Losses from changes in current cash flow hedges (17) (14) Amount reclassified to income 19 8 Ending Balance $ (24) $ (26) During the next twelve months, Occidental expects that approximately $3 million of net derivative after tax losses included in OCI, based on their valuation at December 31, 2003, will be reclassified into earnings when the hedged transactions close. Hedge ineffectiveness did not have a significant impact on earnings for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. SELECTED CASH FLOW INFORMATION Occidental calculates chemical segment free cash flow as segment income, adding back depreciation, depletion and amortization, and subtracting from that amount total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions. Occidental believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as an indicator of Occidentals ability to generate positive cash results to service and or repay debt and generate cash for acquisitions and other investments. Free cash flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Changes in working capital are not reflected in free cash flow, and Occidental has certain non discretionary obligations, such as debt service, that are not deducted from this measure. In addition, this measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of profitability or liquidity. Free cash flow as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. There is no comparable segment cash flow measure available under GAAP. 30 In addition, Occidental discloses cumulative net pre tax cash flows generated by particular properties, which it believes is an important indicator of cumulative life to date performance. There is no comparable property level cash flow measure available under GAAP. Chemical segment free cash flow is calculated as follows: In millions 2003 Segment earnings $ 210 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 205 Capital spending (a) (121) Free Cash Flow (b) $ 294 (a) Excludes $180 million for the purchase of a previously leased facility in LaPorte, Texas and $44 million related to the exercise of purchase options for certain leased railcars. (b) Excludes working capital changes.
