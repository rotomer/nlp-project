ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A) (INCORPORATING ITEM 7A) In this report, the term "Occidental" refers to Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OPC) and or one or more entities in which it owns a majority voting interest (subsidiaries). Occidental is divided into two segments: oil and gas and chemical. STRATEGY GENERAL Occidental aims to generate competitive total returns to stockholders using the following strategy: >> Focus on large, long lived oil and gas assets with growth potential. >> Maintain financial discipline and a strong balance sheet. >> Manage chemical segment to provide cash in excess of normal capital expenditures. Occidental prefers to own large, long lived "legacy" oil and gas assets, like those in California, the Permian Basin and Qatar, that tend to have moderate decline rates, enhanced secondary and tertiary recovery opportunities and economies of scale that lead to cost effective production. Management expects such assets to contribute substantial earnings and cash flow after invested capital. At Occidental, maintaining financial discipline means investing capital in projects that management expects will generate above cost of capital returns throughout the business cycle. During periods of high commodity prices, Occidental will use most of its cash flow after capital expenditures and dividends to improve future earnings by making such investments or through debt reduction. 9 The chemical business is not managed with a growth strategy. Capital is expended to operate the chemical business in a safe and environmentally sound way, to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects designed to lower manufacturing costs. Asset acquisitions may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chlor alkali and polyvinyl chloride businesses. Historically, the chemical segment has generated cash flow exceeding its normal capital expenditure requirements. Occidental intends to invest this cash mainly in strategically attractive assets or to reduce debt. As part of Occidentals strategy to grow its oil and gas business, any excess cash generated by the chemical segment may be used as part of the overall funding for oil and gas growth. OIL AND GAS The oil and gas business seeks to add new oil and natural gas reserves at a pace well ahead of production while keeping costs incurred for finding and development among the lowest in the industry. The oil and gas business implements this strategy within the limits of the overall corporate strategy primarily by: >> Continuing to add commercial reserves through a combination of focused exploration and development programs conducted in and around Occidentals core areas, which are the U.S., the Middle East and Latin America; >> Pursuing commercial opportunities in core areas to enhance the development of mature fields with large volumes of remaining oil by applying appropriate technology and state of the art reservoir management practices; and >> Maintaining a disciplined approach in buying and selling assets at attractive prices. Over the past several years, Occidental has strengthened its asset base within each of the core areas. Occidental has invested in, and disposed of, assets with the goal of raising the average performance and potential of its assets. See "Oil and Gas Segment Business Review" for a discussion of these changes. Occidentals overall performance during the past several years reflects the successful implementation of its oil and gas business strategy, beginning with the acquisition of the Elk Hills oil and gas field in California followed by the purchase of Altura Energy in the Permian Basin in West Texas and thereafter by several smaller acquisitions. At the end of 2004, the Elk Hills and Permian Basin assets made up 66 percent of Occidentals consolidated proven oil reserves and 45 percent of its consolidated proven gas reserves. On a barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) basis, they accounted for 62 percent of Occidentals consolidated reserves. In 2004, the combined production from these assets averaged approximately 265,000 BOE per day, which represents approximately 47 percent of Occidentals total worldwide production. These assets also contributed approximately 58 percent of oil and gas segment earnings. CHEMICAL OxyChems strategy is to be a low cost producer so that it can maximize its cash flow generation. OxyChem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain where it begins with chlorine, which is coproduced with caustic soda, and then converts chlorine and ethylene, through a series of intermediate products, into PVC. OxyChems focus on chlorovinyls permits it to take advantage of economies of scale. KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS GENERAL Occidental seeks to ensure that it meets its strategic goals by continuously measuring its success in maintaining below average debt levels and top quartile performance compared to its peers in: >> Overall return on equity; >> Overall return on capital employed; and >> Other segment specific measurements such as profit per unit produced, cost to produce each unit, cash flow per unit, cost to find and develop new reserves and other similar measures. DEBT STRUCTURE Occidentals total debt and total debt to capitalization ratios are shown in the table below: Total Debt to Capitalization Date ($ amounts in millions) Total Debt (a) Ratio 12/31/00 $ 6,354 57% 12/31/01 $ 4,890 46% 12/31/02 $ 4,759 43% 12/31/03 $ 4,570 37% 12/31/04 $ 3,905 27% (a) Includes trust preferred securities (redeemed January 20, 2004), natural gas delivery commitment (terminated in 2002), subsidiary preferred stock and capital lease obligations. As shown, Occidentals year end 2004 total debt to capitalization ratio declined to approximately 27 percent from the 57 percent level that existed at the end of 2000. The decrease in the total debt to capitalization ratio in 2004 compared with 2000 resulted from total debt reductions of 39 percent combined with an increase in stockholders equity of 121 percent over the same period. RETURN ON EQUITY Annual 2004 (a) Three Year Average 2002 2004 (b) 28% 22% (a) The Return on Equity for 2004 was calculated by dividing Occidentals 2004 earnings applicable to common stock by the average equity balance in 2004. (b) The three year average Return on Equity was calculated by dividing the average annual earnings applicable to common stock over the three year period 2002 2004 by the average equity balance over the same period. Over the past three years, Occidental has focused on improving its return on equity. In 2004, Occidentals return on equity was 28 percent and the three year average return on equity was 22 percent. During the same three year period, Occidentals equity increased by over 67 percent. 10 OIL AND GAS SEGMENT BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT Oil and gas prices are the key variables that drive the industrys financial performance. Prices can vary significantly, even on a short term basis. Oil prices continued to strengthen in 2004 over their levels in the previous year. During the year, Occidental experienced an increase in its price differential between the average West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price and Occidentals realized prices. Occidentals realized crude oil price was $39.11 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2004, compared to $37.87 per barrel in the third quarter of 2004. During this same period, WTI prices increased $4.41 per barrel. The change in the differential between the average price of WTI and Occidentals realized price was primarily due to a significant increase in the volume of sour crude oil in global markets. Approximately 70 percent of Occidentals crude oil could be classified as sour. This change in the historical pattern of differentials makes forecasting realized prices difficult. The average WTI market price for 2004 was $41.40 per barrel compared with $31.03 per barrel in 2003. Occidentals average realized price for oil in 2004 was $35.09, compared with $27.25 in 2003. NYMEX domestic natural gas prices increased approximately 12 percent from 2003. For 2004, NYMEX gas prices averaged $5.92/Mcf compared with $5.26/Mcf for 2003. BUSINESS REVIEW All production and reserve figures are net to Occidental unless otherwise specified. ELK HILLS Occidental operates the Elk Hills oil and gas field in the southern portion of Californias San Joaquin Valley with an approximate 78 percent interest. The field was acquired in 1998 for $3.5 billion and is the largest producer of gas in California. Oil and gas production in 2004 was approximately 90,000 BOE per day. Since its acquisition, total Elk Hills oil and gas production has been approximately 235 million BOE. At the end of 2004, the property still had an estimated 462 million BOE of proved reserves, compared to the 425 million BOE that were recorded at the time of the acquisition. Total gas production averaged 228 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day in 2004 compared to 246 MMcf per day in 2003. PERMIAN BASIN The Permian Basin extends throughout Southwest Texas and Southeast New Mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the United States, with the entire basin accounting for approximately 15 percent of total U.S. oil production. Occidental is the largest producer in the Permian Basin with an approximately 14 percent net share of the total Permian Basin oil production. Occidental also produces and processes natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) in the Permian Basin. Most of Occidentals Permian Basin interests were obtained through the acquisition of Altura in 2000, which was valued at approximately $3.6 billion. On January 31, 2004, Occidental acquired a 1,300 mile oil gathering and pipeline system in the Permian Basin that includes storage facilities at a marketing hub in Midland. This system allows Occidental to efficiently transport its production to these storage facilities. The pipeline is also used to transport production for third party producers. Occidentals total share of Permian Basin oil, gas and NGL production averaged 175,000 BOE per day in 2004 compared to 171,000 BOE per day in 2003. At the end of 2004, Occidentals Permian Basin properties had 1,083 million BOE in proved reserves. Occidentals Permian Basin production is diversified across a large number of producing areas. The largest producing areas include Wasson San Andres, Slaughter, Levelland, North Cowden and Wasson Clearfork, which contributed 21 percent, 11 percent, 6 percent, 6 percent and 5 percent, respectively, to 2004 Permian BOE production. Approximately 45 percent of Occidentals Permian Basin production is from fields that employ the application of carbon dioxide (CO2) flood technology, an enhanced oil recovery technique. This involves injecting CO2 into oil reservoirs where it acts as a solvent, causing the oil to flow more freely into producing wells. The size of these CO2 flood operations makes Occidental a world leader in the application of this technology. THUMS Occidental purchased THUMS, the field contractor for an oil production unit offshore Long Beach, California, in 2000. Occidentals share of production from THUMS is subject to contractual arrangements similar to a production sharing contract (PSC), whereby Occidentals share of production varies inversely with oil prices. For 2004, production from THUMS averaged 20,000 barrels per day. GULF OF MEXICO Occidental has a one third interest in the deep water Horn Mountain oil field, which is Occidentals only asset in the Gulf of Mexico. BP p.l.c. (BP) is the operator. The field, which began production in November 2002, reached platform capacity in the third quarter of 2003. For 2004, Occidentals production at Horn Mountain averaged 22,000 BOE per day. In the second half of 2004, the Horn Mountain field was shut down for about 46 days due to Hurricane Ivan. At year end 2004, production at the field again reached its capacity. HUGOTON Occidental owns a large concentration of gas reserves, production interests and royalty interests in the Hugoton area of Kansas and Oklahoma. The Hugoton field is the largest natural gas field discovered in North America. Occidentals Hugoton operations produced 127,000 Mcf of natural gas per day and 3,000 barrels of oil per day in 2004. 11 MIDDLE EAST DOLPHIN PROJECT Occidentals interest in the Dolphin Project, which was acquired in 2002, consists of two separate economic interests held through two separate legal entities. One entity, OXY Dolphin E&P, LLC, owns a 24.5 percent undivided interest in the assets and liabilities associated with a Development and Production Sharing Agreement (DPSA) with the Government of Qatar to develop and produce natural gas and condensate in Qatars North Field for 25 years from the start of production, with a provision to request a 5 year extension. The purchase price of the undivided working interest in the DPSA was approximately $60 million and was recorded in Property, Plant & Equipment. This undivided interest will be proportionately consolidated in Occidentals financial statements. A second entity, OXY Dolphin Pipeline, LLC, owns 24.5 percent of the stock of Dolphin Energy Limited (Dolphin Energy). Dolphin Energy owns the rights to build, own and operate a 260 mile long, 48 inch natural gas pipeline which will transport dry natural gas from Qatar to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for the life of the Dolphin Project or longer. Initially, the Dolphin Project will export 2 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day of natural gas (plus associated liquids and byproducts). However, the pipeline is expected to have capacity to transport up to 3.2 Bcf of natural gas per day, and Dolphin Energy is pursuing additional business opportunities to meet the growing demand for natural gas in the UAE and Oman. The purchase price of Dolphin Energy stock totaled approximately $250 million and was recorded as an equity investment. Several important milestones have been reached since Occidental joined the Dolphin Project. In 2002, two development wells were drilled and tested, providing sufficient information to complete the field development plan. In October 2003, Dolphin Energy signed two 25 year contracts to supply approximately one Bcf of natural gas per day to two entities in the UAE. As stated above, demand for natural gas is growing in the UAE and Oman and a third supply contract with the Emirate of Dubai is currently being negotiated. In December 2003, the Government of Qatar approved the final field development plan for the Dolphin Project. In January 2004, Dolphin Energy was awarded engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts for the gas processing and compression plant at Ras Laffan in Qatar as well as for two offshore gas production platforms. Dolphin Energy is operator on behalf of the contractors under the DPSA. The remaining major EPC contracts were also awarded during 2004. To date, Occidental has recorded 157 million BOE of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves for the Dolphin Project DPSA activity. The Ras Laffan plant will receive wet gas from Dolphins facilities in Qatars North Field and will remove hydrocarbon liquids, including condensate and natural gas liquids, for further processing and sale in the global market. The resulting dry gas will be compressed and transported to the UAE through Dolphin Energys pipeline. The projected start up date for production is in late 2006. The Dolphin Project is expected to cost approximately $4.0 billion in total. Occidental expects to invest approximately $1 billion of this total. The project will be financed by a combination of participant investment and project financing. During 2005, Occidental expects to spend a combined total of approximately $540 million for the gas exploration and development activity and the investment in Dolphin Energy compared to $153 million in 2004. No revenue or production costs were recorded in 2004 for the Dolphin Project gas exploration and development activity. QATAR Occidental participates in two production projects in Qatar: Idd El Shargi South Dome (ISSD) and Idd El Shargi North Dome (ISND). Occidental is engaged in Phase II of full field development of ISND and is in the process of developing the ISSD field. ISSD is a satellite to the ISND field, thereby reducing the overall capital requirement of the two projects. Occidental expects to increase production and recoverable reserves with the second phase of development under its existing agreement in the ISND field. This new phase is targeting the development and recovery of additional reserves by applying advanced drilling systems and improved reservoir characterization techniques. Capital expenditures in Qatar for the ISSD and ISND projects were $450 million in 2004 and are expected to be approximately $400 million in 2005. Combined production from the two fields averaged 45,000 barrels per day in 2004. Also, see the Dolphin Project discussed above. YEMEN In Yemen, Occidental owns direct working interests in the Masila field in Block 14 (38 percent) and a 40.4 percent interest in the East Shabwa field, comprising a 28.6 percent direct working interest and an 11.8 percent equity interest in an unconsolidated entity. Occidentals production averaged 33,000 barrels of oil per day in 2004, with 29,000 coming from the Masila field and the remainder from East Shabwa. In addition, Occidental operates Block 20, where it owns an 80 percent working interest. Occidental drilled two exploratory wells in Block 20 in 2004. OMAN Occidentals Oman business is centered in Block 9 where it is the operator and holds a 65 percent working interest. Under the Block 9 PSC, Occidentals share of production averaged 13,000 barrels of oil per day in 2004. In March 2004, Occidental began selling gas to the Government of Oman under a gas sales agreement, thereby allowing Occidental to produce previously stranded gas and condensates from Block 9. Under the agreement, Occidental (and its Block 9 partner) must supply approximately 114 MMcf per day of natural gas until December 31, 2007. Thereafter, Occidental will nominate quantities that it has available for delivery. Since March 2004, Occidental (and its partner) supplied an average of approximately 110 MMcf per day of 12 natural gas to the Government under the gas sales agreement, including gas delivered during a commissioning period and prior to Occidentals obligation to deliver gas. The minimum gross quantities to be delivered under the gas sales agreement through December 31, 2007 represent approximately 60 percent of the expected average gross production of gas from Block 9 during that period. As of December 31, 2004, the gross proved gas reserves from Block 9 are approximately 270 percent of the total minimum of gas that remains to be delivered under the gas sales agreement. Occidental also holds a 65 percent working interest in Block 27, which is adjacent to Block 9. As operator, Occidental is conducting an active exploration program in Block 27. LIBYA Occidental suspended all activities in Libya in 1986 as a result of economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. government, but continues to hold an interest in the assets that it formerly operated. Since the imposition of sanctions, Occidental has derived no economic benefit from its Libyan interests and has no Libyan assets on its balance sheet. In 2004, the U.S. government lifted all of the principal economic sanctions against Libya. As a result, Occidental began actively negotiating with the Libyan government for Occidentals return to its historical assets in Libya. Those negotiations are continuing. Separately, in January 2005, Occidental participated in the EPSA IV exploration bid round in Libya. Occidental was the successful bidder on nine of the 15 areas available. Occidental will operate five onshore areas and will have a 90 percent exploration working interest. In addition, Occidental will have a 35 percent exploration working interest in four offshore areas. The offshore areas will be operated by Woodside Petroleum Ltd. OTHER EASTERN HEMISPHERE PAKISTAN Occidental holds oil and gas working interests, that vary from 25 to 50 percent, in four Badin Blocks in Pakistan. BP is the operator. Occidentals share of production was approximately 20,000 BOE per day in 2004. RUSSIA In Russia, Occidental owns 50 percent of a joint venture company, Vanyoganneft, that operates in the western Siberian oil basin. Production for 2004 was approximately 29,000 BOE per day. LATIN AMERICA COLOMBIA In April 2004, Occidental extended the term of its contract with the Government of Colombia for the Cano Limon field. The contract was extended to the economic life of the field. Occidental has a 35 percent net share of production and is the operator of the field. Colombias national oil company, Ecopetrol, operates the Cano Limon Covenas oil pipeline and marine export terminal. The pipeline transports oil produced from the Cano Limon field for export to international markets. In addition, Occidental also has various working interests in four exploration blocks. Occidentals share of 2004 production averaged 33,000 barrels of oil per day. ECUADOR Occidental operates Block 15 in Ecuador and has a 60 percent economic interest therein. Although Occidental holds legal title to 100 percent of the Block 15 Participation Contract, it has farmed out 40 percent of its economic interest related to Block 15. Occidentals share of production averaged approximately 46,000 barrels of oil per day in 2004. In addition, Occidental has a 14 percent interest in the Oleoducto de Crudos Pesados Ltd. (OCP) oil export pipeline. See "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements" for further information about the OCP pipeline. Full development of the Eden Yuturi oil field in the southeastern corner of Block 15 continued in 2004. Additional development wells drilled in the western portion of the block resulted in an increase in production of approximately 21,000 barrels from the 25,000 barrels per day produced in 2003. After completing extensive 3 D seismic surveys Occidental continues to expand its exploration activities in Block 15. Foreign oil companies, including Occidental, have been paying a Value Added Tax (VAT), generally calculated on the basis of 10 to 12 percent of expenditures for goods and services used in the production of oil for export. Until 2001, oil companies, like other companies producing products for export, filed for and received reimbursement of VAT. In 2001, the Ecuador tax authority announced that the oil companies VAT payments did not qualify for reimbursement. In 2002, Occidental initiated an international arbitration proceeding against the Ecuadorian Government under the United States Ecuador bilateral investment treaty based on Occidentals belief that the Ecuadorian Government is arbitrarily and discriminatorily refusing to refund the VAT to Occidental. In July 2004, a tribunal of international arbitrators awarded Occidental compensation for VAT refunds from Occidentals Block 15 operations that were withheld by the Ecuadorian Government and indicated that similar VAT refunds should be paid going forward. The Ecuadorian Government has appealed the tribunals decision and the appeals proceedings continue at present. In the event of an unfavorable outcome, the potential effect on Occidentals financial statements would not be material. In September 2004, Occidental received formal notification that Petroecuador, the state oil company of Ecuador, was initiating proceedings to determine if Occidental had violated its Participation Contract for Block 15 or the Ecuadorian Hydrocarbons Law and whether the alleged violations constitute grounds for terminating the Participation Contract. The principal allegation stated in the notice is an assertion that Occidental should have obtained government approval of a farmout agreement entered into in 2000. Occidental believes that it has complied with all material obligations under the Participation Contract and Ecuadorian law, 13 and that any termination of the contract based upon the stated allegations would be unfounded and would constitute an unlawful expropriation. Occidental is cooperating with the Ecuadorian authorities in the current proceedings and will continue to strive for an amicable resolution. Block 15 operations represent approximately 9 percent of Occidentals 2004 consolidated production, 4 percent of its proved consolidated reserves, and 2 percent of its total property, plant and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization. PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS Occidental conducts its operations in Qatar, Oman and Yemen under PSCs and, under such contracts, receives a share of production to recover its costs and an additional share for profit. In addition, Occidentals share of production from THUMS is subject to contractual arrangements similar to a PSC. Occidentals share of production from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise and increases when oil prices decline. Overall, Occidentals net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices. PROVED RESERVES EVALUATION AND REVIEW PROCESS A senior corporate officer of Occidental is responsible for the internal audit and review of its oil and gas reserves data. In addition, a Corporate Reserves Review Committee (the Reserves Committee) has been established, consisting of senior corporate officers, to monitor and review Occidentals oil and gas reserves. The Reserves Committee reports to the Audit Committee of Occidentals Board of Directors periodically throughout the year. Occidental has retained Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott), independent petroleum engineering consultants, to review its oil and gas estimation processes. Ryder Scott has compared Occidentals methods and procedures for estimating oil and gas reserves to generally accepted industry standards and has reviewed certain data, methods and procedures used in estimating reserves volumes, the reserve and economic evaluations and reserves classifications. Ryder Scott then reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for a selection of oil and gas fields considered to be a valid representation of Occidentals total reserves portfolio. Based on this review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, Ryder Scott has concluded that the methodologies used by Occidental in preparing the relevant estimates generally comply with current Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) standards. Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reserves volumes presented by Occidental. PROVED RESERVE ADDITIONS Occidental consolidated subsidiaries had proved reserves at year end 2004 of 2,489 million BOE, as compared with the year end 2003 amount of 2,421 million BOE. Additionally, Occidental owns investments in other interests which had proved reserves of 43 million and 50 million BOE at year end 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in the consolidated subsidiaries reserves from all sources was 266 million BOE, of which 212 million BOE were from proved developed reserves and 54 million BOE were from proved undeveloped reserves. Proved developed reserves represent approximately 78 percent of Occidentals total proved reserves. PROVED RESERVE ADDITIONS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES 2004 Proved Proved Proved In Millions of BOE Developed Undeveloped Total Revisions 114 (69) 45 Improved Recovery 36 84 120 Extensions and Discoveries 23 38 61 Purchases 39 1 40 Total Additions 212 54 266 Proved reserves are 80 percent crude oil and condensate and 20 percent natural gas. REVISIONS OF PREVIOUS ESTIMATES In 2004, Occidental added reserves from revisions of previous estimates of 45 million BOE, 38 million of which are in the Middle East. The Dolphin Project added 49 million BOE. These were partially offset by 11 million BOE of negative revisions in Qatar, Yemen and Oman, due primarily to the impact of higher oil prices reducing Occidentals share of reserves under PSCs. If oil prices increase by $5 per barrel, less oil volume is required to recover costs, and PSCs would reduce Occidentals share of proved reserves by approximately 22 million BOE. Oil price increases would also tend to extend the economic lives for proved reserves from other contracts, which would partially offset these PSC reserve volume changes. Conversely, if oil prices drop by $5 per barrel, Occidentals share of proved reserves would increase by a similar amount. The economic lives of other reserves would be shorter, and this would partially offset the PSC reserve volume changes. Apart from the effects of product prices, Occidentals approach to interpreting technical data regarding oil and gas reserves makes it more likely future reserve revisions will be positive rather than negative. Occidental expects future revisions to be positive as they have been for the last several years. IMPROVED RECOVERY In 2004, Occidental added reserves of 120 million BOE through improved recovery, mainly in the Permian Basin, Elk Hills field, and THUMS in the United States and also in Qatar. In an effort to partially mitigate the decline in oil and gas production from the Elk Hills field, from the acquisition in 1998 through year end 2004, Occidental has successfully implemented an infill drilling program. The Elk Hills field employs both gas flood and water flood techniques. In the Permian Basin, the increased reserves were primarily attributable to enhanced recovery techniques, such as drilling additional CO2 flood and water flood wells. In Qatar, Occidental is currently in the second phase of 14 development under its existing agreement for the ISND field. This phase targets the development and recovery of additional reserves by applying advance drilling systems and improved reservoir characterization techniques. EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES Occidental obtains reserve additions from extensions which are dependent on successful exploitation programs. In 2004, Occidental added reserves of 61 million BOE, with 39 million BOE in the United States and 18 million BOE in Ecuador. In the Rocky Mountain area, Occidental added approximately 24 million BOE from the extension of gas reserves to proved locations, most of which will require additional development capital. In Ecuador, Occidental continued full development of the Eden Yuturi oil field in Block 15. The success of improved recovery, extension and discovery projects depends on reservoir characteristics and technology improvements, as well as oil and gas prices, capital costs and operating costs. Many of these factors are outside of managements control, and will affect whether or not these historical sources of reserve additions continue at similar levels. PURCHASES OF PROVED RESERVES In 2004, Occidental purchased reserves of 40 million BOE, of which 29 million BOE are in Latin America and the remainder in the United States. In April 2004, Occidental extended the term of its contract with the Government of Colombia to the economic life of the Cano Limon field. Of the 29 million BOE of reserve additions, Occidental owns 25 million BOE and a minority shareholder holds interests in the remaining 4 million BOE. See the "Oil and Gas Segment Business Review Latin America Colombia" section above for a more complete description of this transaction. The reserve additions of 11 million BOE in the United States were from various small acquisitions, primarily in the Permian Basin, of which 84 percent were proved developed reserves. Occidental continues to add reserves through acquisitions when properties are available at reasonable prices. Acquisitions are dependent on successful bidding and negotiating of oil and gas contracts at attractive terms. As market conditions change, the available supply of properties may increase or decrease accordingly. PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES In 2004, Occidentals proved undeveloped reserves increased by 54 million BOE. This net increase resulted from improved recovery, extensions and discoveries, primarily in the Elk Hills field, in the Permian Basin, in the Rocky Mountain area and in the Dolphin Project. These proved undeveloped additions were partially offset by reserve transfers to the proved developed category as a result of 2004 development programs. The Dolphin Project DPSA activity was the largest addition to proved undeveloped reserves in 2004. The Government of Qatar approved the Dolphin Project final field development plan in December 2003. Dolphin development progress, including drilling additional wells and constructing platforms, lines, a gas plant and gas compression and pipeline facilities, will continue through an expected start up in 2006. For details of proved reserve activity by geographic areas, see the "Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (Unaudited)" section in the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements." INDUSTRY OUTLOOK The petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to numerous market forces. Crude oil and natural gas prices are affected by market fundamentals such as weather, inventory levels, competing fuel prices, overall demand and the availability of supply. Worldwide oil prices in 2004 remained at or near historical highs. Continued economic growth, resulting in increased demand and concerns about supply availability, could result in continued high prices. A lower demand growth rate could result in lower crude oil prices. Sustained high oil prices will significantly affect profitability and returns for Occidental and other upstream producers. However, the industry has historically experienced wide fluctuations within price cycles. Although oil prices cannot be predicted with any certainty, the WTI price has averaged approximately $24.90 per barrel over the past ten years. During 2004, Occidental experienced an increase in its price differential between the average WTI price and Occidentals realized prices. See the "Oil and Gas Segment Business Environment" section above for further information. While supply/demand fundamentals are a decisive factor affecting domestic natural gas prices over the long term, day to day prices may be more volatile in the futures markets, such as on the NYMEX and other exchanges, making it more difficult to forecast prices with any degree of confidence. Over the last ten years, the NYMEX gas price has averaged $3.40 per Mcf. CHEMICAL SEGMENT BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT The chemical segment experienced improved results in 2004 due to the continued improvement in most sectors in which OxyChem participates, particularly the building and construction markets. The economic recovery continued its measured growth and the supply/demand for major commodities tightened. Product prices were higher but the resulting improvement in profitability was partially offset by higher costs for raw materials, primarily energy and ethylene. Domestic chlorine demand rose nearly 7 percent compared to 2003, as many sectors experienced volume growth. Due to the industrys efforts to improve profitability by reducing capacity, the upturn in demand resulted in industry wide chlor alkali operating rates of 99 percent, the highest since 1995. 15 BUSINESS REVIEW CHLOR ALKALI Demand for chlor alkali products improved throughout 2004 with combined chlorine and caustic soda prices rising throughout the second half of the year. As supply and demand remained tight, prices increased significantly in the latter part of the year, particularly for caustic soda. OxyChems chlor alkali operating rate for 2004 was 99 percent, approximately matching the industry operating rate. The tight supply/demand supported higher chlorine prices, which improved over 50 percent during 2004. Caustic soda volumes rose with higher demand, especially in the alumina and pulp and paper sectors. Caustic soda prices were highly volatile in 2004 as the impact of imports early in the year caused spot realizations to bottom out early in the second quarter. As demand continued to rise with the improvement of the U.S. manufacturing sector, prices rebounded and increased substantially by year end. Export pricing for caustic soda remained steady through September before rising as the worldwide supply/demand balance tightened, exerting upward pressure on pricing. OxyChem maintained its Deer Park chlor alkali production facility in Houston, Texas and its EDC facility in Ingleside, Texas in standby mode. These idle facilities will be reactivated upon strengthening in overall economic conditions that leads to sustained improved demand and higher margins for caustic soda. In December 2004, OxyChem permanently idled a circuit which produced chlorine and caustic soda at its Delaware City plant and recorded a pre tax charge of $12 million. VINYLS Strong demand and increasing ethylene costs led to PVC price increases in 2004. Both ethylene and natural gas costs increased in 2004. PVC prices increased 8 percent compared to 2003. These increases were in addition to the 23 percent increase in PVC resin prices in 2003, which was driven by rising feedstock and energy costs. Industry wide total 2004 demand was 6 percent higher compared with 2003. OxyChem operated its PVC facilities at an average operating rate of 94 percent for 2004, equal to the North American industry average. EXIT OF VINYL SPECIALTY RESINS BUSINESS At the end of 2004, Occidental decided to exit the vinyl specialty resins business for strategic and economic reasons. This resulted in the immediate closure of the Pottstown, Pennsylvania manufacturing facility. Occidental recorded an after tax charge of $32 million in 2004 and classified this business as a discontinued operation. AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE VULCAN ASSETS In October 2004, Occidental agreed to purchase three chemical manufacturing facilities from Vulcan Materials Company for $214 million in cash, subject to adjustment for changes in net working capital. In addition, Occidental may become obligated to make contingent payments based upon the future performance of these businesses, and will assume specified obligations. This transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to close in 2005. DISPOSITION OF EQUISTAR INTEREST AND ACQUISITION OF LYONDELL INTEREST In August 2002, Occidental sold its 29.5 percent share of Equistar to Lyondell and purchased a 21 percent equity interest in Lyondell. Occidental entered into these transactions to diversify its petrochemicals interest. These transactions reduced Occidentals direct exposure to petrochemicals volatility, yet allowed it to preserve, through its Lyondell investment, an economic upside of a recovery in the petrochemicals industry. In connection with these transactions, Occidental wrote down its investment in the Equistar partnership to fair value by recording a $412 million pre tax charge as of December 2001. When this transaction closed in the third quarter of 2002, Occidental recorded an after tax gain of $164 million. In November 2004, Lyondell acquired Millennium Chemicals Inc. (Millennium) by issuing additional shares of Lyondell common stock. Under SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 51, Occidental is required to record its share of the increase in Lyondells net equity resulting from this issuance. The effect of this is an increase of $121 million in the carrying value of Occidentals investment in Lyondell and an increase in Occidentals net income of $77 million after tax. At December 31, 2004, Occidental owned 41.3 million shares of Lyondell common stock, with a carrying value of $603 million and a fair market value of $1.2 billion. As a result of the stock issuance, Occidentals ownership percentage of Lyondell has decreased from approximately 22 percent to 17 percent. DISPOSITION OF CHROME AND CALENDERING OPERATIONS In the fourth quarter of 2002, Occidental sold its chrome business at Castle Hayne, North Carolina for $25 million and its plastic calendering operations in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for a $6 million note receivable. In the third quarter of 2002, Occidental recorded an after tax impairment charge of $69 million and classified both of these businesses as discontinued operations. INDUSTRY OUTLOOK Occidentals chemical business improved its profitability in 2004, nearly doubling 2003s earnings levels. The major factors that contributed to this improved performance are the improved U.S. economy and higher demand for major chemical products. If operating rates remain at their year end 2004 levels and the U.S. economy continues to improve, the chemical industry may experience modest price increases in 2005. Improved profitability will depend on the amount of increase in future energy and feedstock costs. Construction of LNG terminals on the U.S. Gulf Coast could stabilize natural gas prices at a lower than current level and thereby help improve the competitive position of efficient Gulf Coast chemical facilities. However, this construction may not occur in the immediate future. 16 Occidentals chemical business is profitable and is expected to remain profitable if the current favorable economic conditions continue. If, however, U.S. manufacturing becomes noncompetitive on a worldwide basis, this could shorten the estimated productive lives of some of Occidentals plants, resulting in higher annual depreciation. Significantly shorter productive lives could also result in asset impairments, including plant closures. It is unlikely that any changes in estimated productive lives would be uniform. While potential impairment charges could have a material impact on the earnings in a discrete period, such changes are unlikely to have a material effect on Occidentals overall financial situation. For additional discussion of the possible financial effect of a change to the productive lives of OxyChems assets, please see the "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" section below. CHLOR ALKALI Industry operating rates are near historical highs. Demand growth is expected to remain moderate, which will put additional strains on manufacturing capacity. Due to the high volatility of caustic soda prices in 2004, the 2004 average price was essentially unchanged from 2003. However, the caustic soda markets tightened in the last half of 2004, which may result in increased prices in 2005 versus 2004. VINYLS Consensus forecasts for 2005 gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 3.6 percent suggest expectations for a strong economy that will favorably affect the vinyls business. Overall, OxyChem expects 2 to 3 percent growth in vinyls demand in North America in 2005. Industry wide PVC and VCM operating rates are expected to be slightly lower in 2005 as a result of the restart of some idled capacity. Chlorovinyls supply constraints, together with high ethylene costs, have created conditions for vinyls price increases early in 2005. PVC resin producers have announced a 2 cents per pound increase for January 2005. Despite the restart of some idled capacity, VCM supply is expected to be tight due to maintenance requirements and higher global demand for PVC. Average operating rates for North American VCM producers are expected to exceed 93 percent. CORPORATE AND OTHER Corporate and Other includes the investments in Lyondell and Premcor, Inc., a refining business, and a leased cogeneration facility in Taft, Louisiana. In 2004, Corporate and Other also includes the results of a 1,300 mile oil pipeline and gathering system located in the Permian Basin, which was acquired in January 2004 and is used in corporate directed oil and gas marketing and trading operations. SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of Occidentals two operating segments and corporate items should be read in conjunction with Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment earnings generally exclude interest income, interest expense, unallocated corporate expenses, discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment assets and results from the segments equity investments. Foreign income and other taxes and certain state taxes are included in segment earnings based on their operating results. U.S. federal income taxes are not allocated to segments, except for amounts in lieu thereof that represent the tax effect of operating charges resulting from purchase accounting adjustments, and the tax effects resulting from major, infrequently occurring transactions, such as asset dispositions that relate to segment results. The following table sets forth the sales and earnings of each operating segment and corporate items: SEGMENT OPERATIONS In millions, except per share amounts For the years ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 SALES Oil and Gas $ 7,582 $ 6,003 $ 4,634 Chemical 3,675 3,092 2,613 Other (a) 111 145 $ 11,368 $ 9,240 $ 7,247 EARNINGS(LOSS) Oil and Gas (b, c) $ 3,544 $ 2,664 $ 1,707 Chemical (b) 412 220 304 3,956 2,884 2,011 Unallocated corporate items Interest expense, net (d) Debt and trust preferred distributions (240) (333) (320) Income taxes (e) (939) (666) (375) Other (f) (171) (284) (135) Income from continuing operations 2,606 1,601 1,181 Discontinued operations, net (38) (6) (97) Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, net (68) (95) Net Income $ 2,568 $ 1,527 $ 989 Basic Earnings per Common Share $ 6.49 $ 3.98 $ 2.63 (a) The 2004 amount represents revenue from a Taft, Louisiana cogeneration plant and the Permian Basin pipeline and gathering system. The 2003 amount represents revenue from a Taft, Louisiana cogeneration plant. (b) Includes U.S. federal tax charge of $6 million related to oil and gas in 2003. Segment earnings in 2002 were affected by $402 million of net credits allocated, comprising $1 million of charges and $403 million of credits in oil and gas and chemical, respectively. The 2002 chemical amount includes a $392 million credit for the sale of the Equistar investment, which resulted in a net gain of $164 million. (c) The 2004 amount includes interest income of $18 million from loans made to an equity investee. (d) The 2004 amount includes $17 million of interest charges to redeem or repurchase various debt issues during the year. The 2003 amount includes a $61 million interest charge to repay a $450 million senior note that had 10 years of remaining life, but was subject to remarketing on April 1, 2003. The 2002 amount is net of $21 million of interest income on notes receivable from Altura partners. (e) The 2004 amount includes $47 million of credits related to tax settlements with the Internal Revenue Service. The 2004 amount also reflects a lower U.S. income tax rate resulting from the crediting of foreign income taxes. (f) The 2004 amount includes $169 million of corporate equity method investment income, $59 million of environmental remediation expense and the costs attributable to the cogeneration plant in Taft, Louisiana. The 2003 amount includes $58 million of corporate equity method investment losses and $63 million of environmental remediation expense. The 2002 amount includes $22 million of preferred distributions to the Altura partners, $23 million of environmental remediation expenses and $25 million of corporate equity method investment losses. 17 OIL AND GAS In millions, except as indicated 2004 2003 2002 SEGMENT SALES $ 7,582 $ 6,003 $ 4,634 SEGMENT EARNINGS $ 3,544 $ 2,664 $ 1,707 CORE EARNINGS (a) $ 3,544 $ 2,664 $ 1,707 NET PRODUCTION PER DAY UNITED STATES Crude oil and liquids (MBBL) California 78 81 86 Permian 154 150 142 Horn Mountain 19 21 1 Hugoton 3 4 3 Total 254 256 232 Natural Gas (MMCF) California 237 252 286 Hugoton 127 138 148 Permian 130 129 130 Horn Mountain 13 13 Total 507 532 564 LATIN AMERICA Crude oil & condensate (MBBL) Colombia 37 37 40 Ecuador 46 25 13 Total 83 62 53 MIDDLE EAST Crude oil & condensate (MBBL) Oman 13 12 13 Qatar 45 45 42 Yemen 32 35 37 Total 90 92 92 Natural Gas (MMCF) Oman 55 OTHER EASTERN HEMISPHERE Crude oil & condensate (MBBL) Pakistan 7 9 10 Natural Gas (MMCF) Pakistan 75 74 63 BARRELS OF OIL EQUIVALENT (MBOE) SUBTOTAL CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES 540 520 492 Colombia minority interest (4) (5) (5) Russia Occidental net interest 29 30 27 Yemen Occidental net interest 1 2 1 TOTAL WORLDWIDE PRODUCTION 566 547 515 AVERAGE SALES PRICES CRUDE OIL PRICES ($ per barrel) U.S. $ 37.72 $ 28.74 $ 23.47 Latin America $ 33.09 $ 27.21 $ 23.14 Middle East (b) $ 34.88 $ 27.81 $ 24.13 Other Eastern Hemisphere $ 33.13 $ 26.61 $ 23.02 Total consolidated subsidiaries $ 35.95 $ 28.18 $ 23.56 Other interests $ 23.83 $ 15.95 $ 14.80 Total worldwide $ 35.09 $ 27.25 $ 22.91 GAS PRICES ($ per thousand cubic feet) U.S. $ 5.35 $ 4.81 $ 2.89 Middle East $ 0.97 $ $ Other Eastern Hemisphere $ 2.25 $ 2.04 $ 2.08 Total worldwide $ 4.56 $ 4.45 $ 2.81 EXPENSED EXPLORATION (c) $ 219 $ 139 $ 176 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Development $ 1,438 $ 1,097 $ 897 Exploration $ 102 $ 43 $ 55 Acquisitions and other (d, e) $ 109 $ 97 $ 86 (a) For an explanation of core earnings, see "Significant Items Affecting Earnings." (b) These amounts exclude taxes owed by Occidental but paid by governmental entities on its behalf. (c) Includes dry hole write offs and lease impairments of $159 million in 2004, $80 million in 2003 and $96 million in 2002. (d) Includes capitalized portion of injected CO2 of $54 million, $48 million and $42 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. (e) Includes mineral acquisitions but excludes significant acquisitions individually discussed in this report. Core earnings in 2004 were $3.5 billion compared with $2.7 billion in 2003. The increase in core earnings is primarily due to the effect of higher worldwide crude oil and natural gas prices of approximately $1.2 billion and higher crude oil volumes, partially offset by higher operating expenses, higher exploration expense and increased DD&A rates. Core earnings in 2003 were $2.7 billion compared with $1.7 billion in 2002. The increase in core earnings primarily reflects the effect of higher crude oil and natural gas prices and higher crude oil volumes, partially offset by lower natural gas volumes, higher DD&A rates and increased costs. Average consolidated production costs for 2004 were $6.95 per BOE compared to the average 2003 production cost of $5.91 per BOE. Occidental expects first quarter 2005 production to be slightly higher than fourth quarter 2004 production, assuming oil prices remain in a $40 per barrel range. High oil prices affect the volumes for Occidentals PSCs in Oman, Qatar and Yemen and the production sharing type contract at THUMS. In this current product price range, a $1.00 change in the per barrel price of oil changes production by approximately one thousand barrels per day. Also, see "Production Sharing Contracts" above.

(b) Product volumes produced at former PolyOne facilities, now part of OxyVinyls, are excluded from the product price indexes. (c) Product volumes include those manufactured and consumed internally. (d) The 2003 amount includes $180 million for the purchase of a previously leased facility in LaPorte, Texas and $44 million related to the exercise of purchase options for certain leased railcars. Core earnings in 2004 were $412 million compared with $220 million in 2003. The increase in core earnings is primarily due to higher prices for chlorine, EDC, PVC resins and VCM, partially offset by higher ethylene and energy costs. 18 Core earnings were $220 million in 2003, compared with $140 million in 2002. The increase in core earnings reflects the impact of higher prices for all major products (PVC, EDC, chlorine and caustic), partially offset by higher energy and ethylene costs. Occidental expects first quarter 2005 chemical earnings to be slightly higher than the fourth quarter 2004, assuming industry conditions remain at year end 2004 levels with current ethylene and energy prices and continued strengthening of caustic soda margin realizations. SIGNIFICANT ITEMS AFFECTING EARNINGS Occidentals results of operations often include the effects of significant transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount. Therefore, management uses a measure called "core earnings," which excludes those items. This non GAAP measure is not meant to disassociate those items from managements performance, but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing Occidentals earnings performance between periods. Reported earnings are considered representative of managements performance over the long term. Core earnings is not considered to be an alternative to operating income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. SIGNIFICANT ITEMS AFFECTING EARNINGS Benefit (Charge) (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 TOTAL REPORTED EARNINGS $ 2,568 $ 1,527 $ 989 OIL AND GAS Segment Earnings $ 3,544 $ 2,664 $ 1,707 No significant items affecting earnings Segment Core Earnings $ 3,544 $ 2,664 $ 1,707 CHEMICAL Segment Earnings $ 412 $ 220 $ 304 Less: Gain on sale of Equistar investment (a) 164 Segment Core Earnings $ 412 $ 220 $ 140 CORPORATE Results $ (1,388) $ (1,357) $ (1,022) Less: Gain on Lyondell stock issuance 121 Trust preferred redemption charge (11) Settlement of tax issues 47 Debt repayment fee (61) Changes in accounting principles, net (a) (68) (95) Discontinued operations, net (a) (38) (6) (97) Tax effect of pre tax adjustments (40) 21 TOTAL CORE EARNINGS $ 2,489 $ 1,641 $ 1,017 (a) These amounts are shown after tax. TAXES Deferred tax liabilities, net of deferred tax assets of $822 million, were $1.1 billion at December 31, 2004. The current portion of the deferred tax assets of $115 million is included in prepaid expenses and other. The net deferred tax assets are expected to be realized through future operating income and reversal of taxable temporary differences. WORLDWIDE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE The following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for reported income from continuing operations and core earnings: In millions 2004 2003 2002 REPORTED INCOME Oil and Gas (a) $ 4,311 $ 3,229 $ 2,181 Chemical (b) 414 223 (99) Corporate and Other (411) (620) (468) Pre tax income 4,314 2,832 1,614 Income tax expense Federal and State (b) 946 673 (39) Foreign (included in segments) (a) 762 558 472 Total 1,708 1,231 433 Income from continuing operations $ 2,606 $ 1,601 $ 1,181 Worldwide effective tax rate 40% 43% 27% CORE INCOME Oil and Gas (a) $ 4,311 $ 3,228 $ 2,181 Chemical (b) 414 224 143 Corporate and Other (521) (559) (468) Pre tax income 4,204 2,893 1,856 Income tax expense Federal and State (b) 952 694 367 Foreign (included in segments) (a) 763 558 472 Total 1,715 1,252 839 Core income $ 2,489 $ 1,641 $ 1,017 Worldwide effective tax rate 41% 43% 45% (a) Revenues and income tax expense include taxes owed by Occidental but paid by governmental entities on its behalf. Oil and gas pre tax income includes the following revenue amounts for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, of $525 million, $397 million and $335 million, respectively. (b) In 2002, the $406 million tax benefit related to the gain on the sale of the Equistar investment has been reclassified to Federal and State income taxes. Occidentals 2004 worldwide effective tax rate was 40 percent for reported income and 41 percent for core income. The lower U.S. income tax rate in 2004, compared to 2003, resulted from the crediting of foreign income taxes. Previously, Occidental deducted foreign income taxes in determining U.S. taxable income. An annual tax election permits a taxpayer to claim either a credit or a deduction for foreign income taxes, whichever is more beneficial. Occidental expects to continue its election to credit foreign income taxes in future years. The increase in the federal and state tax rate in 2003, compared to 2002, is due to a $406 million tax benefit in 2002 related to the gain on sale of the Equistar investment. 19 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SELECTED REVENUE ITEMS In millions 2004 2003 2002 Net sales $ 11,368 $ 9,240 $ 7,247 Interest, dividends and other income $ 144 $ 89 $ 143 The increase in sales in 2004, compared to 2003, reflects higher crude oil, natural gas and chemical prices, higher crude oil production and higher chemical volumes, partially offset by lower domestic natural gas production volumes. The increase in sales in 2003, compared to 2002, reflects higher crude oil, natural gas and chemical prices and higher crude oil production volumes, partially offset by lower natural gas production volumes. Interest, dividends and other income in 2004 includes a $27 million derivative mark to market adjustment for stock warrants of an equity investee and interest income of $21 million from loans made to equity investees. Interest, dividends and other income in 2002 includes interest income on the notes receivable from the Altura partners of $21 million. Occidental exercised an option in May 2002 to redeem the sellers remaining partnership interests in exchange for the notes receivable. SELECTED EXPENSE ITEMS In millions 2004 2003 2002 Cost of sales (a) $ 4,509 $ 3,897 $ 3,299 Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses $ 1,008 $ 852 $ 646 Depreciation, depletion and amortization $ 1,303 $ 1,175 $ 1,009 Exploration expense $ 219 $ 139 $ 176 Interest and debt expense, net $ 260 $ 332 $ 295 (a) Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization of $1,263 million in 2004, $1,137 million in 2003 and $978 million in 2002. Cost of sales increased in 2004, compared to 2003, due primarily to higher oil and gas production volumes and other operating costs, higher energy and feedstock costs and higher crude oil volumes. Cost of sales increased in 2003, compared to 2002, due mainly to oil volume increases and higher operating and production costs in the oil and gas segment and higher energy and feedstock costs in the chemical segment. The 2003 amount also includes $156 million for the costs of operating a cogeneration facility. Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2004, compared to 2003, mainly due to higher general and administrative costs for corporate infrastructure and general support areas and higher oil and gas costs, including higher production related taxes and other operating costs. Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2003 compared with 2002. The increases were in several areas. General and administrative costs increased in both oil and gas and corporate infrastructure and general support areas. In addition, nonoperating costs were higher in international operations, mainly Latin America. Higher oil and gas production taxes reflected the overall increase in worldwide production. Also, additional expense resulted from adoption of the asset retirement obligation accounting standard in 2003. The increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) in 2004, compared to 2003, and 2003, compared to 2002, was due to the increase in oil and gas production from the prior year and a higher DD&A rate. The increase in exploration expense in 2004, compared to 2003, was due mostly to higher dry hole write offs and impairment costs in California and the Other Eastern Hemisphere region. The decrease in exploration expense in 2003, compared to 2002, was due mostly to lower dry hole write offs and impairment costs and lower seismic, geological and geophysical costs in 2003. Interest and debt expense in 2004 and 2003 included pre tax debt repayment charges of $17 million and $61 million, respectively. Excluding the effects of these debt repayment charges, interest and debt expense decreased in 2004, compared to 2003, and in 2003, compared to 2002, due primarily to lower average debt levels. In addition, since Occidental adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 150 in July 2003, the 2003 interest expense amount includes six months of interest that had been classified as distributions on trust preferred securities prior to the adoption. OTHER ITEMS In millions 2004 2003 2002 Provision for income taxes $ 1,708 $ 1,231 $ 433 (Income) loss from equity investments $ (113) $ 9 $ 261 Gain on Lyondell stock issuance $ (121) $ $ The increase in the provision for income taxes in 2004, compared to 2003, was primarily due to an increase in income before taxes, partially offset by the use of a lower tax rate in 2004 resulting from the crediting of foreign income taxes. See the "Taxes" section above for further information. The increase in the provision for income taxes in 2003, compared to 2002, reflected an increase in income before taxes. In addition, the 2002 provision for income taxes includes an income tax benefit of $406 million for the sale of the Equistar investment. The increase in the income from equity investments in 2004, compared to results reported in 2003, was mostly attributable to improved results from Lyondell and higher income from a Russian oil and gas affiliate. The 2002 loss from equity investments includes a pre tax loss of $242 million from the sale of the Equistar investment in August 2002. The gain on Lyondell stock issuance in 2004 represents Occidentals share of the increase in Lyondells net equity resulting from Lyondells issuance of stock to purchase Millennium. 21 CONSOLIDATED ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL POSITION The changes in the following components of Occidentals balance sheet are discussed below: SELECTED BALANCE SHEET COMPONENTS In millions 2004 2003 CURRENT ASSETS Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,449 $ 683 Trade receivables, net 1,882 795 Receivables from joint ventures, partnerships and other 353 350 Inventories 545 489 Prepaid expenses and other 166 127 Assets held for sale 36 58 TOTAL CURRENT ASSETS $ 4,431 $ 2,502 Investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries $ 1,727 $ 1,155 Property, plant and equipment, net $ 14,633 $ 13,984 Other assets $ 361 $ 263 CURRENT LIABILITIES Current maturities of long term debt and capital lease liabilities $ 459 $ 23 Accounts payable 1,557 906 Accrued liabilities 1,013 874 Dividends payable 110 101 Domestic and foreign income taxes 263 163 Trust preferred securities 453 Liabilities held for sale 21 6 TOTAL CURRENT LIABILITIES $ 3,423 $ 2,526 Trust preferred securities current $ $ 453 Long term debt, net $ 3,345 $ 3,993 Deferred credits and other liabilities $ 3,746 $ 3,408 Stockholders equity $ 10,550 $ 7,929 ASSETS The higher balance in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2004, compared to December 31, 2003, reflects the buildup of cash, primarily as a result of higher oil and gas prices, which is expected to be used for operating needs, capital expenditures and potential acquisitions. The higher balance in trade receivables at December 31, 2004, compared to December 31, 2003, reflects higher product prices and crude oil sales volumes during the fourth quarter 2004 versus 2003. In addition, in June 2004, Occidental discontinued the sale of interests in its outstanding receivables balance which had the effect of increasing receivables by $360 million compared to December 31, 2003. The increase in inventories at December 31, 2004, compared to December 31, 2003, is primarily due to higher oil and gas marketing and trading inventory due to higher prices and volumes during the fourth quarter 2004 versus 2003. The higher balance in the investments in unconsolidated entities at December 31, 2004, compared to December 31, 2003, reflects a note receivable issued to Elk Hills Power, a gain from Lyondells stock issuance and mark to market increases in the available for sale Premcor investment. The increase in the net balance in property, plant and equipment reflects capital expenditures and acquisitions, partially offset by certain asset retirements and DD&A expense. The higher balance in other assets at December 31, 2004, compared to 2003, was mainly due to higher long term prepaid pension costs and the oil inventory line fill from the Permian Basin pipeline and gathering system acquisition in early 2004. LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY The increase in current maturities of long term debt and capital lease liabilities at December 31, 2004, compared to December 31, 2003, reflects the expected March 2005 redemption of the 7.65 percent senior notes, which were included in long term debt in 2003. The higher balance in accounts payable at December 31, 2004, compared to December 31, 2003, mainly reflects higher prices and volumes for purchased oil and gas in Occidentals marketing and trading operations. The increase in accrued liabilities at December 31, 2004, compared to December 31, 2003, is primarily due to higher mark to market adjustments on derivative financial instruments, and higher accrued payroll amounts. The increase in domestic and foreign income taxes current at December 31, 2004, compared to December 31, 2003, reflects additional taxes payable due to higher income before taxes. The decrease in trust preferred securities current at December 31, 2004, compared to December 31, 2003, reflects the redemption of all the trust preferred securities in early 2004. The decrease in long term debt at December 31, 2004, compared to December 31, 2003, reflects the redemption or repurchase of various debt issues during the year. It also reflects the reclassification of the 7.65 percent senior notes that will be redeemed in March 2005, which were classified as long term debt in 2003 and are now classified as a current liability in 2004. Deferred credits and other liabilities includes deferred income taxes, deferred compensation, other post retirement benefits, environmental remediation reserves, asset retirement obligations and other deferred items. The increase in this account at December 31, 2004, compared to December 31, 2003, is due mainly to higher deferred federal income tax, an increase in the asset retirement obligation, an increase in deferred compensation and a long term payable related to the Colombia contract extension signed in 2004. The increase in stockholders equity at December 31, 2004, compared to December 31, 2003, reflects higher net income and the issuance of new stock related to options exercised, partially offset by dividends on common stock. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES FINANCING ACTIVITY During 2004, Occidental strengthened its liquidity position, generating approximately $3.9 billion in cash from operations. At December 31, 2004, Occidental had approximately $1.4 billion in cash on hand, an increase of $766 million from 2003. Although its income and cash flows are largely dependent on oil and gas prices and production, Occidental believes that cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its operating needs, capital expenditure requirements, dividend payments and potential acquisitions. If needed, Occidental could access its existing credit facilities. 21 Available but unused lines of committed bank credit totaled approximately $1.5 billion at December 31, 2004. Occidentals $1.5 billion bank credit matures on June 18, 2009. None of Occidentals committed bank credits contain material adverse change (MAC) clauses or debt rating triggers that could restrict Occidentals ability to borrow under these lines. Occidentals credit facilities and debt agreements do not contain ratings triggers that could terminate bank commitments or accelerate debt in the event of a ratings downgrade. At December 31, 2004, under the most restrictive covenants of certain financing agreements, Occidentals capacity for additional unsecured borrowing was approximately $22.7 billion, and the capacity for the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on, and for acquisitions of, Occidentals capital stock was approximately $8.4 billion, assuming that such dividends, distributions and acquisitions were made without incurring additional borrowing. In January 2004, Occidental redeemed all of its outstanding 8.16 percent Trust Preferred Redeemable Securities (trust preferred securities) at par plus accrued interest, resulting in a decrease in current liabilities of $453 million. In the third quarter of 2004, Occidental redeemed all of its 6.5 percent senior notes, which reduced long term debt by approximately $157 million. In July 2004, Dolphin Energy, the operator of the Dolphin Project, entered into an agreement with banks to provide a $1.36 billion bridge loan for the Dolphin Project. The loan has a term of five years and is a revolving credit facility for the first two years. Occidental guaranteed 24.5 percent of the obligations of Dolphin Energy under the bank agreement. As part of the financing, a subsidiary of Occidental that is an upstream participant in the Dolphin Project entered into an on loan agreement with Dolphin Energy to borrow up to $245 million from the proceeds of loans under the facility agreement for its share of upstream costs. At December 31, 2004, approximately $63 million had been borrowed under this agreement. In 2003, Occidental recorded a pre tax interest charge of $61 million to repay a $450 million 6.4 percent senior notes issue that had ten years of remaining life, but was subject to remarketing on April 1, 2003. Occidental refinanced $300 million of this amount and paid the remaining $150 million out of existing cash. In 2002, Occidental filed a shelf registration statement for up to $1 billion of various securities, including senior debt securities. In November 2002, Occidental issued $175 million of 4 percent Medium Term Senior Notes, Series C, and $75 million of 4.101 percent Medium Term Senior Notes, Series C, due 2007 for general corporate purposes. In March 2003, Occidental issued $300 million of 4.25 percent Medium Term Senior Notes and used the proceeds to refinance a portion of the $450 million of senior notes discussed above. Occidental has $450 million of capacity remaining under the shelf registration. On February 24, 2005, Occidental gave notice that it will redeem, out of existing cash on hand, all of its outstanding $450,000,000 7.65 percent senior notes due 2006 on March 28, 2005. CASH FLOW ANALYSIS In millions 2004 2003 2002 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,878 $ 3,074 $ 2,100 The significant increase in operating cash flow in 2004, compared to 2003, resulted from several factors. The most important drivers were the significantly higher oil and natural gas prices and, to a much lesser extent, chemical prices. Although the changes in realized prices varied among the regions in which Occidental operates, in 2004, Occidentals realized oil prices were higher overall by 29 percent. Occidentals realized natural gas price increased over 11 percent in the U.S., where approximately 80 percent of Occidentals natural gas was produced in 2004. Oil and gas worldwide production, on a BOE basis, increased for 2004 overall by over 3 percent on a daily basis, as compared with 2003, which also contributed to increased cash flow. Crude oil production was higher in Latin America, while natural gas production was higher in the Middle East and lower in the U.S. for 2004. Increases in sales prices realized for Occidentals major chemical product lines ranged from zero to 34 percent, compared to 2003. Chemical prices increased in 2004 at a higher rate than the energy driven increase in feedstock and power costs, thereby improving profits and cash flow. The overall impact of the chemical price changes on cash flow was much less than for oil and gas price changes, not only because the chemical segment earnings and cash flow are significantly smaller than those for the oil and gas segment, but also because of increases in energy price driven feedstock and electric power costs, which are major elements of manufacturing cost for the chemical segments products. Sales volumes for chemical products generally were higher in 2004, but this did not have a significant effect on Occidentals earnings and cash flow. Increases in the costs of producing oil and gas, such as purchased goods and services, particularly materials and oil field services, partially offset oil and gas sales price increases, but such cost increases had a much lower effect on cash flow than the realized price increases. Other cost elements, such as labor costs and overheads, are not significant drivers of cash flow because they are mainly fixed within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term. The significant increase in operating cash flow in 2003, compared to 2002, resulted from the significantly higher oil and gas prices and, to a much lesser extent, chemical prices. In 2003, Occidentals realized oil prices were higher overall by 19 percent and realized natural gas prices overall were up 58 percent. Oil and gas worldwide production, on a BOE basis, increased for 2003 overall by approximately 6 percent on a daily basis, as compared with 2002, which also contributed to increased cash flow. Crude oil production was higher overall in the U.S. and Latin America, while natural gas production was lower in the U.S. for 2003. 22 Sales prices realized for Occidentals major chemical product lines ranged from 15 percent to 70 percent higher in 2003, compared to 2002. Chemical prices in 2003 also improved at a higher rate than feedstock and power costs increases, thus improving profits and cash flow. The overall effect of chemical price changes on cash flow was much less than for oil and gas price changes. Sales volumes for chemical products generally were lower in 2003, but this did not have a significant effect on Occidentals earnings and cash flow. Increases in the costs of production partially offset sales price increases, but such cost increases had a much lower effect on cash flow than the realized price increases. Non cash charges in 2004 include deferred compensation, stock incentive plan amortization, environmental remediation accruals and a chemical asset writedown. Non cash charges in 2003 include deferred compensation, stock incentive plan amortization and environmental remediation accruals. Non cash charges in 2002 include environmental remediation accruals and the asset writedown for two chemical facilities. 2002 also includes charges for employee benefit plans and other items. In millions 2004 2003 2002 Net cash used by investing activities $ (2,288) $ (2,021) $ (1,696) The 2004 amount includes the purchase of a pipeline and gathering system in the Permian Basin and a $204 million advance to the Elk Hills Power LLC (EHP) equity investment, which EHP used to repay a portion of its debt. The 2003 amount includes several Permian Basin acquisitions totaling $317 million. The 2002 amount includes approximately $250 million for the purchase of 24.5 percent of the stock of Dolphin Energy and $60 million for the purchase of a 24.5 percent undivided interest in the DPSA related to the Dolphin Project, plus $39 million for historical costs. Also, see the "Capital Expenditures" section below. In millions 2004 2003 2002 Net cash used by financing activities $ (824) $ (516) $ (456) The 2004 amount includes $466 million paid to redeem the trust preferred securities in January 2004 and $159 million paid to redeem Occidentals 6.5 percent senior notes. The 2003 amount includes net debt repayments of $334 million. The 2002 amount reflects the net $179 million buyout of the natural gas delivery commitment and $72 million of net proceeds from the issuance of a subsidiarys preferred stock. Occidental paid common stock dividends of $424 million in 2004, $392 million in 2003 and $375 million in 2002. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES In millions 2004 2003 2002 Oil and Gas $ 1,649 $ 1,237 $ 1,038 Chemical (a) 155 344 107 Corporate and Other 39 19 89 TOTAL $ 1,843 $ 1,600 $ 1,234 (a) The 2003 amount includes $180 million for the purchase of a previously leased facility in LaPorte, Texas and $44 million related to the exercise of purchase options for certain leased railcars. Occidentals capital spending estimate for 2005 is approximately $1.9 billion. A majority of the capital spending will be allocated to oil and gas, with the main focus on the Dolphin Project gas exploration and development activity, Qatar, Elk Hills and the Permian Basin. In addition, Occidental expects to make a further equity investment of about $200 million in Dolphin Energy. Commitments at December 31, 2004, for major capital expenditures during 2005 and thereafter were approximately $740 million. Occidental will fund these commitments and capital expenditures with cash from operations and, as needed, with proceeds from existing credit facilities. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS In the course of its business activities, Occidental pursues a number of projects and transactions to meet its core business objectives. The accounting and financial statement treatment of these transactions is a result of the varying methods of funding employed. Occidental also makes commitments on behalf of unconsolidated entities. These transactions, or groups of transactions, are recorded in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles and, unless otherwise noted, are not reflected on Occidentals balance sheets. The following is a description of the business purpose and nature of these transactions. DOLPHIN PROJECT In July 2004, Dolphin Energy entered into an agreement with banks to provide a $1.36 billion bridge loan for the Dolphin Project. Occidental guaranteed 24.5 percent of the obligations of Dolphin Energy under this bank agreement. See "Oil and Gas Segment Business Review Middle East Dolphin Project" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Activity" for further information. ECUADOR In Ecuador, Occidental has a 14 percent interest in the OCP oil export pipeline. In the second half of 2003, the increased production from the Eden Yuturi oil field in the southeastern corner of Block 15 coincided with the completion of the pipeline. As of December 31, 2004, Occidental contributed and advanced a total of $78 million to the project. Occidental reports this investment in its consolidated statements using the equity method of accounting. 23 The project was funded in part by senior project debt. The senior project debt is to be repaid with the proceeds of ship or pay tariffs of certain upstream producers in Ecuador, including Occidental. Under their ship or pay commitments, Occidental and the other upstream producers have each assumed their respective share of project specific risks, including operating risk, political risk and force majeure risk. Occidental would be required to make an advance tariff payment in the event of prolonged force majeure, upstream expropriation events, bankruptcy of the pipeline company or its parent company, abandonment of the project, termination of an investment guarantee agreement with Ecuador, or certain defaults by Occidental. This advance tariff would be used by the pipeline company to service or prepay project debt. At December 31, 2004, Occidentals obligation relating to the pipeline companys senior project debt totaled $104 million, and Occidentals obligations relating to performance bonds totaled $14 million. Occidentals overall obligations will decrease with the reduction of the pipeline companys senior project debt. RECEIVABLES SALE PROGRAM Occidental has an agreement in place to sell, under a revolving sale program, an undivided interest in a designated pool of trade receivables. This program is used by Occidental as a low cost source of working capital funding. The balance of receivables sold at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was zero and $360 million, respectively. The 2003 amount is not included in the debt and related trade receivables accounts, respectively, on Occidentals consolidated balance sheet. Receivables must meet certain criteria to qualify for the program. Under this program, Occidental serves as the collection agent with respect to the receivables sold. An interest in new receivables is sold as collections are made from customers. Fees and expenses under this program are included in selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses. The fair value of any retained interests in the receivables sold is not material. The buyers of the receivables are protected against significant risk of loss on their purchase of receivables. Occidental provides for allowances for any doubtful receivables based on its periodic evaluation of such receivables. The provisions for such receivables were not material in the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Although Occidental has not sold any receivables under this program since June 2004, the program has not been terminated. However, the program can terminate upon the occurrence of certain events, which generally are under Occidentals control or relate to bankruptcy. LEASES Occidental has entered into various operating lease agreements, mainly for railcars, power plants, manufacturing facilities and office space. The leased assets are used in Occidentals operations where leasing offers advantages of greater operating flexibility and usually costs less than alternative methods of funding that were available at the time financing decisions were made. Lease payments are expensed mainly as cost of sales. See contractual obligation table below. GUARANTEES Occidental has entered into various guarantees including performance bonds, letters of credit, indemnities, commitments and other forms of guarantees provided by Occidental to third parties, mainly to provide assurance that OPC and or its subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations (guarantees). At December 31, 2004, the notional amount of the guarantees was approximately $500 million. Of this amount, approximately $400 million relates to Occidentals guarantee of equity investees debt and other commitments. The debt guarantees and other commitments primarily relate to the Dolphin Energy equity investment and the investment in the Ecuador OCP pipeline, which are discussed above. The remaining $100 million relates to various indemnities and guarantees provided to third parties. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The table below summarizes and cross references certain contractual obligations that are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and or disclosed in the accompanying Notes. Payments Due by Year 2006 2008 2010 Contractual to to and Obligations (in millions) Total 2005 2007 2009 thereafter CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET Long term debt (Note 6) (a) $ 3,766 $ 450 $ 581 $ 744 $ 1,991 Capital leases (Note 7) 34 1 2 2 29 Other long term liabilities (b) 775 81 227 126 341 OTHER OBLIGATIONS Operating leases (Note 7) (c) 1,299 118 189 150 842 Purchase obligations (d, e) 4,585 3,005 449 273 858 TOTAL $ 10,459 $ 3,655 $ 1,448 $ 1,295 $ 4,061 (a) Excludes fair value hedge mark to market adjustments and unamortized debt discounts. (b) Includes obligations under postretirement benefit and deferred compensation plans. (c) Amounts have not been reduced for sublease rental income. (d) Includes long term purchase contracts and purchase orders and contracts for goods and services used in manufacturing and producing operations in the normal course of business. Some of these arrangements involve take or pay commitments but they do not represent debt obligations. Due to their long term nature, purchase contracts with terms greater than 5 years are discounted using a 6 percent discount rate. (e) Amounts do not include purchase obligations related to oil and gas marketing and trading activities where an offsetting sales position exists. LAWSUITS, CLAIMS, COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND RELATED MATTERS OPC and certain of its subsidiaries have been named in a substantial number of lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings. These actions seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage, punitive damages, civil 24 penalties or other losses; or injunctive or declaratory relief. OPC and certain of its subsidiaries also have been named in proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and similar federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws. These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages and civil penalties; however, Occidental is usually one of many companies in these proceedings and has to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, including environmental proceedings, Occidental accrues reserves when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. During the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions. Taxable years prior to 1997 are closed for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Taxable years 1997 through 2003 are in various stages of audit by the Internal Revenue Service. Disputes arise during the course of such audits as to facts and matters of law. Occidental has been in continuing tax audit settlement discussions with the Internal Revenue Service on issues related to foreign tax credits and various domestic income issues for the 1997 to 2000 audit years. Occidental believes that it is reasonably possible that substantive issues for taxable years 1997 to 2000 could be favorably resolved during 2005 and that such resolutions, if they occur, could have a positive and material effect on its results of operations and its financial condition, however, Occidental believes such resolutions will not have a significant cash effect. Occidental has entered into agreements providing for future payments to secure terminal and pipeline capacity, drilling services, electrical power, steam and certain chemical raw materials. See Note 9 of the audited financial statements for further discussion. Occidental has certain other commitments under contracts, guarantees and joint ventures, and certain other contingent liabilities. Many of these commitments, although not fixed or determinable, involve capital expenditures and are part of the $1.9 billion capital expenditures estimated for 2005. Occidental has indemnified various parties against specified liabilities that those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with Occidental. These indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds. As of December 31, 2004, Occidental is not aware of circumstances that would lead to future indemnity claims against it for material amounts in connection with these transactions. It is impossible at this time to determine the ultimate liabilities that OPC and its subsidiaries may incur resulting from any lawsuits, claims and proceedings, audits, commitments, contingencies and related matters. If these matters were to be ultimately resolved unfavorably at amounts substantially exceeding Occidentals reserves, an outcome not currently anticipated, it is possible that such outcome could have a material adverse effect upon Occidentals consolidated financial position or results of operations. However, after taking into account reserves, management does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of these matters to have a material adverse effect upon Occidentals consolidated financial position or results of operations. ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURES Occidentals operations in the United States are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to improving or maintaining environmental quality. Foreign operations also are subject to environmental protection laws. Costs associated with environmental compliance have increased over time and are expected to rise in the future. Environmental expenditures related to current operations are factored into the overall business planning process and are considered an integral part of production in manufacturing quality products responsive to market demand. ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION The laws that require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively to past waste disposal practices and releases. In many cases, the laws apply regardless of fault, legality of the original activities or current ownership or control of sites. OPC or certain of its subsidiaries are currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups under these laws at federal Superfund sites, comparable state sites and other domestic and foreign remediation sites, including Occidental facilities and previously owned sites. Also, OPC and certain of its subsidiaries have been involved in a substantial number of governmental and private proceedings involving historical practices at various sites including, in some instances, having been named in proceedings under CERCLA and similar federal, state and local environmental laws. These proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages and civil penalties. Occidental manages its environmental remediation efforts through a wholly owned subsidiary, Glenn Springs Holdings, Inc., which reports its results directly to Occidentals corporate management. The following table presents Occidentals environmental remediation reserves at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 grouped by three categories of environmental remediation sites: $ amounts in millions 2004 2003 2002 # OF RESERVE # of Reserve # of Reserve SITES BALANCE Sites Balance Sites Balance CERCLA & equivalent sites 125 $ 239 131 $ 240 124 $ 284 Active facilities 16 75 13 79 14 46 Closed or sold facilities 39 61 39 53 44 63 TOTAL 180 $ 375 183 $ 372 182 $ 393 25 The following table shows environmental reserve activity for the past three years: In millions 2004 2003 2002 Balance Beginning of Year $ 372 $ 393 $ 454 Increases to provision including interest 60 64 25 accretion Changes from acquisitions 6 Payments (63) (83) (84) Other (2) (2) Balance End of Year $ 375 $ 372 $ 393 Occidental expects to expend funds equivalent to about half of the current environmental reserve over the next three years and the balance over the next ten or more years. Occidental expects that it may continue to incur additional liabilities beyond those recorded for environmental remediation at these and other sites. The range of reasonably possible loss for existing environmental remediation matters could be up to $375 million beyond the amount accrued. For managements opinion, refer to the "Lawsuits, Claims, Commitments, Contingencies and Related Matters" section above. CERCLA AND EQUIVALENT SITES At December 31, 2004, OPC or certain of its subsidiaries have been named in 125 CERCLA or state equivalent proceedings, as shown below. Reserve Description ($ amounts in millions) # of Sites Balance Minimal/No exposure (a) 101 $ 6 Reserves between $1 10 MM 17 64 Reserves over $10 MM 7 169 TOTAL 125 $ 239 (a) Includes 27 sites for which Maxus Energy Corporation has retained the liability and indemnified Occidental, 7 sites where Occidental has denied liability without challenge, 54 sites where Occidentals reserves are less than $50,000 each, and 13 sites where reserves are between $50,000 and $1 million each. The seven sites with individual reserves over $10 million in 2004 are a former copper mining and smelting operation in Tennessee, two closed landfills in Western New York, groundwater treatment facilities at three currently closed or formerly owned chemical plants (Montague, Michigan, Western New York and Tacoma, Washington) and replacement of a municipal drinking water treatment plant in Western New York. ACTIVE FACILITIES Certain subsidiaries of OPC are currently addressing releases of substances from past operations at 16 active facilities. Four facilities certain oil and gas properties in the southwestern United States, a chemical plant in Louisiana, a chemical plant in Texas, and a phosphorous recovery operation in Tennessee account for 75 percent of the reserves associated with these facilities. CLOSED OR SOLD FACILITIES There are 39 sites formerly owned or operated by certain subsidiaries of OPC that have ongoing environmental remediation requirements in which Occidental or its subsidiaries are involved. Three sites account for 62 percent of the reserves associated with this group. The three sites are: an active refinery in Louisiana where Occidental indemnifies the current owner and operator for certain remedial actions, a water treatment facility at a former coal mine in Pennsylvania, and a former OxyChem chemical plant in Ohio operated by new ownership. ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS Occidentals costs, some of which may include estimates, relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations, are shown below for each segment: In millions 2004 2003 2002 OPERATING EXPENSES Oil and Gas $ 54 $ 40 $ 32 Chemical 59 55 54 $ 113 $ 95 $ 86 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Oil and Gas $ 48 $ 98 $ 70 Chemical 12 15 16 $ 60 $ 113 $ 86 REMEDIATION EXPENSES Corporate $ 59 $ 63 $ 23 Operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis. Capital expenditures relate to longer lived improvements in currently operating facilities. Remediation expenses relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and do not contribute to current or future revenue generation. Although total costs may vary in any one year, over the long term, segment operating and capital expenditures for environmental compliance generally are expected to increase. Occidental presently estimates that capital expenditures for environmental compliance will be approximately $65 million for 2005 and $80 million for 2006. FOREIGN INVESTMENTS Portions of Occidentals assets outside North America are exposed to political and economic risks. Occidental conducts its financial affairs so as to mitigate its exposure against those risks. At December 31, 2004, the carrying value of Occidentals assets in countries outside North America aggregated approximately $4.1 billion, or approximately 19 percent of Occidentals total assets at that date. Of such assets, approximately $2.9 billion are located in the Middle East, approximately $972 million are located in Latin America, and substantially all of the remainder are located in Pakistan. For the year ended December 31, 2004, net sales outside North America totaled $3.1 billion, or approximately 27 percent of total net sales. 26 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The process of preparing financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the management of Occidental to make estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions. It is possible that materially different amounts could be recorded if these estimates and judgments change or if the actual results differ from these estimates and judgments. Occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve the judgment of Occidentals management. There has been no material change to these policies over the past three years. The selection and development of these critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES Occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties. Under this method, costs of acquiring properties, costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs are capitalized. The costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found. At the completion of drilling activities, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized if a determination is made that proved reserves have been found. If no proved reserves have been found, the costs of each of the related exploratory wells are charged to expense. In some cases, a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling, requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells. Occidentals practice is to expense the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a twelve month period after drilling is complete. Occidental has no oil and gas reserves for which the determination of commercial viability is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures. Annual lease rentals, exploration costs, geological, geophysical and seismic costs are expensed as incurred. Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids (NGLs) that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty can be recovered in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions considering future production and development costs. There are several factors that could change Occidentals recorded oil and gas reserves. Occidental receives a share of production from PSCs to recover its costs and an additional share for profit. Occidentals share of production from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise and increases when oil prices decline. Overall, Occidentals net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices. In other contractual arrangements, sustained lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of proved reserves becomes uneconomical. Estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond Occidentals control, such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs. These factors, in turn, could lead to a reduction in the quantity of recorded proved reserves. PSCs also affect reserves. As prices increase, Occidentals share of proved recorded reserves decreases while a decrease in price causes recorded proved reserves to increase. See the "Oil and Gas Segment Proved Reserves Additions" section above for further information. An additional factor that could result in a change of proved reserves is the reservoir decline rates being different from those assumed when the reserves were initially recorded. Overall, Occidentals revisions to proved reserves were positive for 2004, 2003 and 2002 and amounted to less than 2 percent of the total reserves for each year. Additionally, Occidental is required to perform impairment tests pursuant to SFAS No. 144 generally when prices decline and or reserve estimates change significantly. There have been no impairments of reserves over the past three years. Depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties is determined by the unit of production method and could change with revisions to estimated proved recoverable reserves. The change in the depreciation and depletion rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous reserve estimates has been immaterial. If Occidentals consolidated oil and gas reserves were to change based on the factors mentioned above, the most significant impact would be on the depreciation and depletion rate. For example, a 5 percent increase in the amount of consolidated oil and gas reserves would change the rate from $5.25 per barrel to $4.99 per barrel, which would increase pre tax income by $52 million annually. A 5 percent decrease in the oil and gas reserves would change the rate from $5.25 per barrel to $5.52 per barrel and would result in a decrease in pre tax income of $52 million annually. A portion of the carrying value of Occidentals oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties. At December 31, 2004, the costs attributable to unproved properties were approximately $500 million. These costs are not currently being depreciated or depleted. As exploration and development work progresses and the reserves on these properties are proven, capitalized costs attributable to the properties will be subject to depreciation and depletion. If the exploration and development work were to be unsuccessful, the capitalized costs of the properties related to this unsuccessful work would be expensed in the year in which the determination was made. The timing of any writedowns of these unproven properties, if warranted, depends upon the nature, timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results. Occidental believes its exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize the unproved property balance. CHEMICAL ASSETS The most critical accounting policy affecting Occidentals chemical assets is the determination of the estimated useful lives of its property, plant and equipment. Occidentals chemical plants are depreciated using either the unit of production or straight line method based upon the estimated useful life of the facilities. The estimated useful lives of Occidentals chemical assets, which range from 3 years to 50 years, are used to 27 compute depreciation expense and are also used for impairment tests. The estimated useful lives used for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that Occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained. Without these continued expenditures, the useful lives of these plants could significantly decrease. Other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of Occidentals chemical plants include higher or lower product prices, which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition, feedstock costs, energy prices, environmental regulations, competition and technological changes. Occidental is required to perform impairment tests on its assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when managements plans change with respect to those assets. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 144, Occidental must compare the undiscounted future cash flows of an asset to its carrying value. The key factors that could significantly affect future cash flows are future product prices, which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition, feedstock costs, energy costs, significantly increased regulation and remaining estimated useful life. Due to a temporary decrease in demand for some of its products, Occidental temporarily idled an EDC plant in June 2001 and a chlor alkali plant in December 2001. These idle facilities will be reactivated upon strengthening in overall economic conditions that leads to sustained improved demand and higher margins for caustic soda. Management expects that these plants will become operational in the future. The net book value of these plants was $113 million at December 31, 2004. Based on year end value, the chlor alkali plant that closed on December 1, 2001 has a 24 percent minority interest of $22 million. These facilities are periodically tested for impairment and, based on the results, no impairment is deemed necessary at this time. Occidental continues to depreciate these facilities based on their remaining estimated useful lives. Over the prior three years, the change in the depreciation rate due to changes in estimated useful lives has been immaterial. Occidentals net property, plant and equipment for chemicals is approximately $2.4 billion and its depreciation expense for 2005 is expected to be approximately $225 million. If the estimated useful lives of Occidentals chemical plants were to decrease based on the factors mentioned above, the most significant impact would be on depreciation expense. For example, a reduction in the remaining useful lives of 20 percent would increase depreciation and reduce pre tax earnings by approximately $55 million per year. ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURES Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Reserves for estimated costs that relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future revenue generation are recorded when environmental remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. In determining the reserves and the reasonably possible range of loss, Occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience, available technology, regulations in effect, the timing of remediation and cost sharing arrangements. The environmental reserves are based on managements estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred and are reviewed periodically and adjusted as additional or new information becomes available. Environmental reserves are recorded on a discounted basis only when a reserve is initially established and the aggregate amount of the estimated costs for a specific site and the timing of cash payments are reliably determinable. The reserve methodology for a specific site is not modified once it has been established. Recoveries and reimbursements are recorded in income when receipt is probable. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, Occidental has not accrued any reimbursements or indemnification recoveries for environmental remediation matters as assets. Many factors could result in changes to Occidentals environmental reserves and reasonably possible range of loss. The most significant are: >> The original cost estimate may have been inaccurate. >> Modified remedial measures might be necessary to achieve the required remediation results. Occidental generally assumes that the remedial objective can be achieved using the most cost effective technology reasonably expected to achieve that objective. Such technologies may include air sparging or phyto remediation of shallow groundwater, or limited surface soil removal or in situ treatment producing acceptable risk assessment results. Should such remedies fail to achieve remedial objectives, more intensive or costly measures may be required. >> The remedial measure might take more or less time than originally anticipated to achieve the required contaminant reduction. Site specific time estimates can be affected by factors such as groundwater capture rates, anomalies in subsurface geology, interactions between or among water bearing zones and non water bearing zones, or the ability to identify and control contaminant sources. >> The regulatory agency might ultimately reject or modify Occidentals proposed remedial plan and insist upon a different course of action. 28 Additionally, other events might occur that could affect Occidentals future remediation costs, such as: >> The discovery of more extensive contamination than had been originally anticipated. For some sites with impacted groundwater, accurate definition of contaminant plumes requires years of monitoring data and computer modeling. Migration of contaminants may follow unexpected pathways along geologic anomalies that could initially go undetected. Additionally, the size of the area requiring remediation may change based upon risk assessment results following site characterization or interim remedial measures. >> Improved remediation technology might decrease the cost of remediation. In particular, for groundwater remediation sites with projected long term operation and maintenance, the development of more effective treatment technology, or acceptance of alternative and more cost effective treatment methodologies such as bioremediation, could significantly affect remediation costs. >> Laws and regulations might change to impose more or less stringent remediation requirements. At sites involving multiple parties, Occidental provides environmental reserves based upon its expected share of liability. When other parties are jointly liable, the financial viability of the parties, the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to Occidental of their failure to participate are evaluated when estimating Occidentals ultimate share of liability. Based on these factors, Occidental believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of other potentially responsible parties, with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, in an amount that would have a material effect on Occidentals consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Most cost sharing arrangements with other parties fall into one of the following three categories: Category 1: CERCLA or state equivalent sites wherein Occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties share the cost of remediation in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations; Category 2: Oil and gas joint ventures wherein each joint venture partner pays its proportionate share of remedial cost; and Category 3: Contractual arrangements typically relating to purchases and sales of property wherein the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating the costs of environmental remediation. In all three of these categories, Occidental records as a reserve its expected net cost of remedial activities, as adjusted by recognition for any nonperforming parties. In addition to the costs of investigating and implementing remedial measures, which often take in excess of ten years at CERCLA sites, Occidentals reserves include managements estimates of the cost of operation and maintenance of remedial systems. To the extent that the remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site specific data, laws, regulations, technologies or engineering estimates, Occidental reviews and changes the reserves accordingly on a site specific basis. If the environmental reserve balance were to either increase or decrease based on the factors mentioned above, the amount of the increase or decrease would be immediately recognized in earnings. For example, if the reserve balance were to decrease by 10 percent, Occidental would record a pre tax gain of $38 million. If the reserve balance were to increase by 10 percent, Occidental would record an additional remediation expense of $38 million. OTHER LOSS CONTINGENCIES Occidental is involved with numerous lawsuits, claims, proceedings and audits in the normal course of its operations. Occidental records a loss contingency for these matters when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In addition, Occidental discloses, in aggregate, its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred. Occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis so that they are adequately reserved on the balance sheet. These reserves are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate. Managements judgments could change based on new information, changes in laws or regulations, changes in managements plans or intentions, the outcome of legal proceedings, settlements or other factors. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING CHANGES Listed below are significant changes in Occidentals accounting principles. SFAS NO. 150 In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity." SFAS No. 150 establishes accounting standards for how a company classifies and measures financial instruments that have characteristics of liabilities and equity. Occidental adopted the provisions of this statement on July 1, 2003. As a result of the adoption, Occidentals mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities were classified as a liability and the payments to the holders of the securities were recorded as interest expense. On January 20, 2004, all of the trust preferred securities were redeemed. FIN 46 AND FIN 46 R (REVISED) In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (VIE)." FIN 46 requires a company to consolidate a VIE if it is designated as the primary beneficiary of that entity even if the company does not have a majority of voting interests. A VIE is generally defined as an entity whose equity is unable to finance its activities or whose owners lack the risks and rewards of ownership. The statement also imposes disclosure requirements for all the VIEs of a company, even if the 29 company is not the primary beneficiary. The provisions of this statement apply at inception for any entity created after January 31, 2003. Occidental adopted the provisions of this Interpretation for its existing entities on April 1, 2003, which resulted in the consolidation of its OxyMar investment. As a result of the OxyMar consolidation, assets increased by $166 million and liabilities increased by $178 million. There was no material effect on net income as a result of the consolidation. In April 2004, Marubeni exercised its option to put its interest in OxyMar to Occidental by paying approximately $20 million to Occidental. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on VIEs where Occidental is not the primary beneficiary. In December 2003, the FASB revised FIN 46 to exempt certain entities from its requirements and to clarify certain issues arising during the initial implementation of FIN 46. Occidental adopted the revised interpretation in the first quarter of 2004 and it did not have a material impact on the financial statements when adopted. EITF ISSUE NO. 02 3 In the third quarter of 2002, Occidental adopted certain provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 02 3, "Issues involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities." These provisions prescribed significant changes in how revenue from energy trading is recorded. Historically, Occidental had two major types of oil and gas revenues: (1) revenues from its equity production; and (2) revenues from the sale of oil and gas produced by other companies, but purchased and resold by Occidental, referred to as revenue from trading activities. Both types of sales involve physical deliveries and had been historically recorded on a gross basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. With the adoption of EITF Issue No. 02 3, Occidental now reflects the revenue from trading activities on a net basis. There were no changes in gross margins, net income, cash flow or earnings per share for any period as a result of adopting this requirement. However, net sales and cost of sales were reduced by equal and offsetting amounts to reflect the adoption of this requirement. For the year ended December 31, 2002, net sales and cost of sales were reduced from amounts previously reported by approximately $2.2 billion (representing amounts for the first two quarters of 2002) to conform to the current presentation. From 1999 to 2002, Occidental accounted for certain energy trading contracts in accordance with EITF Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities." EITF Issue No. 98 10 required that all energy trading contracts must be marked to fair value with gains and losses included in earnings, whether the contracts were derivatives or not. In October 2002, the EITF rescinded EITF Issue No. 98 10, thus precluding mark to market accounting for all energy trading contracts that are not derivatives and fair value accounting for inventories purchased from third parties. Also, the rescission requires derivative gains and losses to be presented net on the income statement, whether or not they are physically settled, if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes. Occidental adopted this accounting change in the first quarter of 2003 and recorded an $18 million after tax charge as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles. SFAS NO. 143 In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. Under SFAS No. 143, companies are required to recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which the liability is incurred if there is a legal obligation to dismantle the asset and reclaim or remediate the property at the end of its useful life. Occidental adopted SFAS No. 143 in the first quarter of 2003. The initial adoption resulted in an after tax charge of $50 million, which was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles. The adoption increased net property, plant and equipment by $73 million, increased asset retirement obligations by $151 million and decreased deferred tax liabilities by $28 million. The pro forma asset retirement obligation, if the adoption of this statement had occurred on January 1, 2002, would have been $131 million at January 1, 2002 and $151 million at December 31, 2002. SFAS NO. 142 In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 142 changes the accounting and reporting requirements for acquired goodwill and intangible assets. The provisions of this statement are applied to companies starting with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. At December 31, 2001, the balance sheet included approximately $108 million of goodwill and intangible assets with annual amortization expense of approximately $6 million recorded in each of the years income statements for the three year period ended December 31, 2001. As a result, elimination of goodwill amortization would not have had a material impact on net income or earnings per share of any of the years presented and, as a result, the transitional disclosures of adjusted net income excluding goodwill amortization described by SFAS No. 142 have not been presented. Upon implementation of SFAS No. 142 in the first quarter of 2002, three separate specialty chemical businesses were identified as separate reporting units and tested for goodwill impairment. All three of these businesses are components of the chemical segment. The fair value of each of the three reporting units was determined through third party appraisals. The appraisals determined fair value to be the price that the assets could be sold for in a current transaction between willing parties. As a result of the impairment testing, Occidental recorded a cumulative after tax effect of changes in accounting principles reduction in net income of approximately $95 million due to the impairment of all the goodwill attributed to these reporting units. 30 DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES AND MARKET RISK GENERAL Occidentals market risk exposures relate primarily to commodity prices and, to a lesser extent, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Occidental periodically enters into derivative instrument transactions to reduce these price and rate fluctuations. A derivative is an instrument that, among other characteristics, derives its value from changes in another instrument or variable. In general, the fair value recorded for derivative instruments is based on quoted market prices, dealer quotes and the Black Scholes or similar valuation models. COMMODITY PRICE RISK GENERAL Occidentals results are sensitive to fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices. Based on current levels of production, if oil prices vary overall by $1 per barrel, it would have an estimated quarterly effect on income of approximately $29 million before U.S. income taxes. If natural gas prices vary by $0.25 per Mcf, it would have an estimated quarterly effect on income of approximately $10 million before U.S. income taxes. If production levels change in the future, the sensitivity of Occidentals results to oil and gas prices also would change. Occidentals results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices. If chlorine and caustic soda prices vary by $10/ton, it would have approximately a $12 million and $25 million, respectively, annual effect on income before U.S. income taxes. If PVC prices vary by $.01/lb, it would have approximately a $27 million annual effect on income before U.S. income taxes. If EDC prices vary by $10/ton, it would have approximately a $3 million annual effect on income before U.S. income taxes. Historically, price changes either precede or follow raw material and feedstock price changes; therefore, the margin improvement of price changes can be mitigated. According to Chemical Market Associates, Inc., December 2004 average contract prices were: chlorine $310/ton, caustic soda $305/ton, PVC $0.495/lb and EDC $460/ton. MARKETING AND TRADING OPERATIONS Occidental periodically uses different types of derivative instruments to achieve the best prices for oil and gas. Derivatives are also used by Occidental to reduce its exposure to price volatility and to mitigate fluctuations in commodity related cash flows. Occidental enters into low risk marketing and trading activities through its separate marketing organization, which operates under established policy controls and procedures. With respect to derivatives used in its oil and gas marketing operations, Occidental utilizes a combination of futures, forwards, options and swaps to offset various physical transactions. Occidentals use of derivatives in hedging marketing and trading activities relates primarily to managing cash flows from third party purchases. RISK MANAGEMENT Occidental conducts its risk management activities for energy commodities (which include buying, selling, marketing, trading, and hedging activities) under the controls and governance of its Risk Management Policy. The Chief Financial Officer and the Risk Management Committee, comprising members of Occidentals management, oversee these controls, which are implemented and enforced by the Trading Control Officer. The Trading Control Officer provides an independent and separate check on results of marketing and trading activities. Controls for energy commodities include limits on credit, limits on trading, segregation of duties, delegation of authority and a number of other policy and procedural controls. FAIR VALUE OF MARKETING AND TRADING DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS The following tables reconcile the changes in the fair value of Occidentals marketing and trading contracts during 2004 and 2003 and segregate the open contracts at December 31, 2004 by maturity periods. In millions 2004 2003 Fair value of contracts outstanding at $ 32 $ (2) beginning of year (Gains) losses on changes for contracts realized or otherwise settled during the year (94) 50 Changes in fair value attributable to changes in valuation techniques and assumptions Gains (losses) or other changes in fair value 92 (16) Fair value of contracts outstanding at end of year $ 30 $ 32 Maturity Periods Source of 2006 2008 2010 and Total Fair Value 2005 to 2007 to 2009 thereafter Fair Value Prices actively $ 16 $ 8 $ $ $ 24 quoted Prices provided by other external sources (4) 3 4 1 4 Prices based on models and other valuation methods (2) (2) 2 4 2 TOTAL $ 10 $ 9 $ 6 $ 5 $ 30 PRODUCTION HEDGES On a limited basis, Occidental uses cash flow hedges for the sale of crude oil and natural gas production. No cash flow hedges were used for the sale of production in 2003 and no material amounts were used during 2004. There were no material crude oil or gas cash flow hedges on future production at December 31, 2004. No fair value hedges were used for oil and gas production during 2004 or 2003. QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION Occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commodity based derivatives and commodity contracts used in marketing and trading activities. This method determines the maximum potential negative short term change in fair value with a 95 percent level of confidence. The Marketing and Trading Value at Risk was immaterial during all of 2004. 31 INTEREST RATE RISK GENERAL Occidentals exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to its long term debt obligations. To reduce its interest rate risk, Occidental has entered into several interest rate swaps that effectively convert approximately $1.7 billion of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt with maturities ranging from 2006 to 2009. TABULAR PRESENTATION OF INTEREST RATE RISK In millions of U.S. dollars, except rates The table below provides information about Occidentals derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, including interest rate swaps and debt obligations. Interest rate swaps are presented at fair value and by maturity date. Debt amounts represent principal payments by maturity date.

CREDIT RISK Occidentals energy contracts are spread among several counterparties. Creditworthiness is reviewed before doing business with a new counterparty and on an ongoing basis. Occidental monitors aggregated counterparty exposure relative to credit limits, and manages credit enhancement issues. Credit exposure for each customer is monitored for outstanding balances, current month activity, and forward mark to market exposure. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK Several of Occidentals foreign operations are located in countries whose currencies generally depreciate against the U.S. dollar. Typically, effective currency forward markets do not exist for these countries. Therefore, Occidental attempts to manage its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions only at levels necessary for operating purposes. Most international crude oil sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Additionally, all of Occidentals oil and gas foreign entities have the U.S. dollar as the functional currency. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, Occidental had not entered into any foreign currency derivative instruments. The effect of exchange rate transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income. SAFE HARBOR DISCUSSION REGARDING OUTLOOK AND OTHER FORWARD LOOKING DATA Portions of this report, including Items 1 and 2 and the information appearing under the caption "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," including the information under the sub captions "Strategy," "Oil and Gas Segment Industry Outlook," and "Chemical Segment Industry Outlook," contain forward looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and business prospects. Words such as "estimate," "project," "predict," "will," "anticipate," "plan," "intend," "believe," "expect" or similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes generally identify forward looking statements. Occidental expressly disclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information or otherwise. Factors that could cause results to differ materially from forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, those listed below: EXTERNAL RISKS VOLATILE GLOBAL COMMODITY PRICING FLUCTUATIONS BEYOND OCCIDENTALS CONTROL STRONGLY AFFECT ITS REVENUES, PROFITABILITY, OPERATING CASH FLOW AND FUTURE GROWTH RATE. As discussed in the section entitled "Derivative Activities and Market Risk Commodity Price Risk Production Hedges," Occidental typically does not hedge against price fluctuations in either of its businesses with the result that its financial results correlate closely to the price it obtains for its products in the global markets in which they compete. Historically, prices for Occidentals products have been volatile. In addition, a significant portion of the oil Occidental produces is sour crude, which has tended to experience lower rates of price increase because there is comparatively more sour crude oil available. Drilling and exploration activity levels, inventory levels, production disruptions, the actions of OPEC (increasing prices or limiting Occidentals production), price speculation and geophysical and technical limitations affect the global short term and long term supply of oil and gas and interact to contribute to price volatility. Because of the long lead times associated with drilling and exploration projects, Occidental may commit significant amounts of capital to oil and gas projects and cannot be certain of the level of demand that will exist when it finishes a project. The health of the global economy, alternative sources of energy, such as coal, and efforts at efficient consumption can also affect the demand for oil and gas. Demand for Occidentals chemicals products correlates most strongly with the health of the global economy. Occidental also depends on feedstocks and energy to produce chemicals, both of which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations. 32 OCCIDENTALS BUSINESSES OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. Occidentals future oil and gas production depends on its ability to acquire or find additional reserves at prices below that at which it can sell the oil and gas it produces from them, after operating costs. Occidental can acquire reserves by purchasing existing producing assets or by acquiring exploration rights and successfully drilling wells that produce hydrocarbons in commercial quantities. Industry competition for reserves may cause Occidental to shift toward higher risk exploration activity or force it to pay more for acquisitions. Rising exploration and development activity in the industry generally increases the costs of oil and gas services. Participants in the chemicals industry compete primarily based on price and the industry consists of many domestic and foreign competitors. In addition, the industry has been characterized by sporadic global expansion, often leading to overcapacity, whenever currently foreseeable prices appear to support expansion, which has often led to overcapacity. In both industries, Occidental uses nonproprietary technology and business management techniques, which limits its ability to achieve significant comparative production efficiencies. OCCIDENTALS BUSINESSES MAY EXPERIENCE CATASTROPHIC OCCURRENCES. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, occur regularly and may occasionally affect Occidentals businesses. In addition, well blowouts and oilfield fires, armed conflicts, civil unrest and industrial accidents may occur and may have an effect on Occidentals businesses. Occidental maintains insurance against a number of these risks, however, it partially self insures and insurance may not always provide the coverage expected or desired due to contractual limitations, unavailability, cost of insurance and the insurers financial health. VARIED GOVERNMENTAL AND POLITICAL ACTIONS AFFECT OCCIDENTALS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The transnational character of Occidentals oil and gas business subjects it to the decisions of many governments and political interests. As a result, Occidental faces increased risks of change in laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, those related to taxes, royalty rates, permitted production rates, import, export and use of products, and environmental protection, as well as risk of expropriation or reduction of entitlements to produce hydrocarbons. Occidental operates some of its oil and gas business in countries that occasionally experience political instability, which increases Occidentals risk of loss or delayed production associated with armed conflict, civil unrest, security problems, restrictions on production equipment imports and sanctions that prevent continued operations. Occidental may face the risk of increased costs if it is perceived not to be respecting or advancing the economic and social progress of the communities in which it operates. Since Occidentals assets are long lived, the magnitude of these risks can vary during the time it operates in a country. CERTAIN OF OCCIDENTALS MAJOR CHEMICALS PRODUCTS ARE COPRODUCED IN A FIXED RATIO, WHICH LIMITS ITS ABILITY TO EXPLOIT PRICING OPPORTUNITIES. Because chlorine and caustic soda must be produced together in a fixed ratio, an imbalance in demand between the products ultimately requires Occidental to reduce output or cut prices to restore demand balance. Either action in turn limits Occidentals profits on these commodities. TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES MAY CHANGE THE NATURE OF THE ENERGY INDUSTRY. Rising oil and gas prices create incentives to find alternative energy sources that could replace oil and gas over the long term. INTERNAL RISKS OCCIDENTAL MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN EXPLORATION OR DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS WHICH MAY PROVE UNSUCCESSFUL OR UNPROFITABLE. Occidental may misinterpret geologic or engineering data, which may result in significant losses on unsuccessful exploration or development drilling efforts. Occidental is subject to the risks of project delays and cost overruns due to unexpected geologic conditions, equipment failures and accidents, adverse weather and construction or start up delays and other associated risks. INADEQUATE COST CONTAINMENT COULD REDUCE OCCIDENTALS COMPETITIVENESS. Occidental works to minimize the costs associated with its businesses but the impact of its efforts may not be sufficient to offset any negative effects related to the main elements of cost, which consist of reserve acquisition costs for oil and gas and feedstock and energy costs for chemicals.
