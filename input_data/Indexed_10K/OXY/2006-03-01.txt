ITEM 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) (Incorporating Item 7A) In this report, the term "Occidental" refers to Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OPC) and or one or more entities in which it owns a majority voting interest (subsidiaries). Occidental is divided into two segments: oil and gas and chemical. STRATEGY General Occidental aims to generate competitive total returns to stockholders using the following strategy: Focus on large, long lived oil and gas assets with long term growth potential; Maintain financial discipline and a strong balance sheet; and Manage the chemical segment to provide cash in excess of normal capital expenditures. Occidental prefers to own large, long lived "legacy" oil and gas assets, like those in California and the Permian Basin, that tend to have moderate decline rates, enhanced secondary and tertiary recovery opportunities and economies of scale that lead to cost effective production. Management expects such assets to contribute substantial earnings and cash flow after invested capital. At Occidental, maintaining financial discipline means investing capital in projects that management expects will generate above cost of capital returns throughout the business cycle. During periods of high commodity prices, Occidental expects to use most of its cash flow after capital expenditures and dividends to improve future earnings by making such investments. 11 The chemical business is not managed with a growth strategy. Capital is expended to operate the chemical business in a safe and environmentally sound way, to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects designed to lower manufacturing costs. Asset acquisitions may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chlor alkali and PVC businesses. Historically, the chemical segment has generated cash flow exceeding its normal capital expenditure requirements. Occidental intends to invest this cash mainly in strategically attractive assets. As part of Occidentals strategy to grow its oil and gas business, any excess cash generated by the chemical segment may be used as part of the overall funding for oil and gas growth. Oil and Gas Segment Income ($ millions) The oil and gas business seeks to add new oil and natural gas reserves at a pace ahead of production while keeping costs incurred for finding and development among the lowest in the industry. The oil and gas business implements this strategy within the limits of the overall corporate strategy primarily by: Continuing to add commercial reserves through a combination of focused exploration and development programs conducted in and around Occidentals core areas, which are the United States, the Middle East/North Africa and Latin America; Pursuing commercial opportunities in core areas to enhance the development of mature fields with large volumes of remaining oil by applying appropriate technology and advanced reservoir management practices; and Maintaining a disciplined approach in buying and selling assets at attractive prices. Over the past several years, Occidental has strengthened its asset base within each of the core areas. Occidental has invested in, and disposed of, assets with the goal of raising the average performance and potential of its assets. See "Oil and Gas Segment Business Review" for a discussion of these changes. In addition, Occidental has made acquisitions and investments in the Dolphin Project in Qatar and the UAE, re entered Libya and assumed operations in the Mukhaizna field in Oman for future growth opportunities, not for current production. Occidentals overall performance during the past several years reflects the successful implementation of its strategy to enhance the development of mature fields, beginning with the acquisition of the Elk Hills oil and gas field in California followed by a series of purchases in the Permian Basin in west Texas and New Mexico. At the end of 2005, the Elk Hills and Permian Basin assets made up 70 percent of Occidentals consolidated proven oil reserves and 45 percent of its consolidated proven gas reserves. On a barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) basis, they accounted for 64 percent of Occidentals consolidated reserves. In 2005, the combined production from these assets averaged approximately 279,000 BOE per day, which represents approximately 49 percent of Occidentals total worldwide production. These assets also contributed approximately 48 percent of oil and gas segment earnings. Chemical Segment Income ($ millions) OxyChems strategy is to be a low cost producer so that it can maximize its cash flow generation. OxyChem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain where it begins with chlorine, which is coproduced with caustic soda, and then converts chlorine and ethylene, through a series of intermediate products, into PVC. OxyChems focus on chlorovinyls permits it to take advantage of economies of scale. Key Performance Indicators General Occidental seeks to ensure that it meets its strategic goals by continuously measuring its success in maintaining below average debt levels and top quartile performance compared to its peers in: Total return to stockholders; Return on equity; Return on capital employed; and 12 Other segment specific measurements such as profit per unit produced, cost to produce each unit, cash flow per unit, cost to find and develop new reserves, reserve replacement percentage and other similar measures. Debt Structure Occidentals total debt and total debt to capitalization ratios are shown in the table below: Date ($ amounts in millions) Total Debt (a) Total Debt to Capitalization Ratio 12/31/01 $ 4,890 46% 12/31/02 $ 4,759 43% 12/31/03 $ 4,570 37% 12/31/04 $ 3,905 27% 12/31/05 $ 3,019 17% (a) Includes trust preferred securities (redeemed January 20, 2004), natural gas delivery commitment (terminated in 2002), subsidiary preferred stock and capital lease obligations. As shown, Occidentals year end 2005 total debt to capitalization ratio declined to 17 percent from the 46 percent level that existed at the end of 2001. The decrease in the total debt to capitalization ratio in 2005 compared with 2001 resulted from total debt reductions of 38 percent combined with an increase in stockholders equity of 167 percent over the same period. Return on Equity Annual 2005 (a) Three Year Average 2003 2005 (b) 41% 31% (a) The Return on Equity for 2005 was calculated by dividing Occidentals 2005 earnings applicable to common stock by the average equity balance in 2005. (b) The three year average Return on Equity was calculated by dividing the average earnings applicable to common stock over the three year period 2003 2005 by the average equity balance over the same period. Occidental has focused on improving its return on equity. In 2005, Occidentals return on equity was 41 percent and the three year average return on equity was 31 percent. During the same three year period, Occidental increased its stockholders equity by 138 percent and its quarterly dividend by 38 percent and its stock price increased by 181 percent. OIL AND GAS SEGMENT Business Environment Oil and gas prices are the major variables that drive the industrys financial performance. Oil prices strengthened in 2005 over 2004 levels. During the year, Occidental experienced an increase in its price differential between the average West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price and Occidentals realized prices. However, Occidentals realized price as a percentage of WTI was 85 percent for both years. Prices and differentials can vary significantly, even on a short term basis, making forecasting realized prices difficult. The average WTI market price for 2005 was $56.56 per barrel compared with $41.40 per barrel in 2004. Occidentals average realized price for oil in 2005 was $48.20, compared with $35.09 in 2004. Average NYMEX domestic natural gas prices increased approximately 37 percent from 2004. For 2005, NYMEX gas prices averaged $8.11/Mcf compared with $5.92/Mcf for 2004. Business Review All production and reserve figures are net to Occidental unless otherwise specified. Worldwide Production (thousands BOE/day) Elk Hills Occidental operates the Elk Hills oil and gas field in the southern portion of Californias San Joaquin Valley with an approximate 78 percent interest. The field was acquired in 1998 for $3.5 billion and is the largest producer of gas in California. Oil and gas production in 2005 was approximately 90,000 BOE per day. During 2005, Occidental performed infill drilling, field extensions and recompletions identified by advanced reservoir characterization techniques. A record 291 new wells were drilled and 548 wells were worked over. In addition, a successful CO2 pilot was completed during the year. As a result of these activities, Occidental was able to maintain production at 2004 levels. Since its acquisition, total Elk Hills oil and gas production has been approximately 268 million BOE. At the end of 2005, the property had an estimated 505 million BOE of proved reserves, compared to the 425 million BOE that were recorded at the time of the acquisition. Permian Basin The Permian Basin extends throughout southwest Texas and southeast New Mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the United States, with the entire basin accounting for approximately 18 percent of total United States oil production. Occidental is the largest producer in the Permian Basin with an approximately 16 percent net share of the total Permian Basin oil production. Occidental also produces and processes natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) in the Permian Basin. Most of Occidentals Permian Basin interests were obtained through the acquisition of Altura in 2000 for approximately $3.6 billion. In 2005, Occidental made several additional acquisitions of oil and gas producing property interests for approximately $1.7 billion. This was partially offset by cash proceeds totaling $171 million from dispositions of a portion of the acquired properties. 13 Occidentals total share of Permian Basin oil, gas and NGL production averaged 189,000 BOE per day in 2005 compared to 175,000 BOE per day in 2004. At the end of 2005, Occidentals Permian Basin properties had 1.2 billion BOE in proved reserves. Occidentals Permian Basin production is diversified across a large number of producing areas. The largest producing areas in 2005 included Wasson San Andres, Slaughter, Levelland, North Cowden and Wasson Clearfork, which contributed 20 percent, 10 percent, 5 percent, 5 percent and 4 percent, respectively, to Occidentals 2005 Permian BOE production. Occidentals interests in the Permian Basin offer additional development and exploitation potential. During 2005, Occidental drilled approximately 250 wells on its operated properties and participated in wells drilled on outside operated interests. Occidental conducted significant development activity on five CO2 projects during 2005, including implementation of new floods and expansion of existing CO2 floods. Occidental also focused on improving performance of existing wells. Occidental had an average of 105 well service units working in the Permian area during 2005 performing well maintenance and workovers. Approximately 60 percent of Occidentals Permian Basin oil production is from fields that actively employ the application of carbon dioxide (CO2) flood technology, an enhanced oil recovery technique. This involves injecting CO2 into oil reservoirs where it acts as a solvent, causing the oil to flow more freely into producing wells. The size of these CO2 flood operations makes Occidental a world leader in the application of this technology. THUMS Occidental purchased THUMS, the field contractor for an oil production unit offshore Long Beach, California, in 2000. Occidentals share of production from THUMS is subject to contractual arrangements similar to a PSC, whereby Occidentals share of production varies inversely with oil prices. For 2005, production from THUMS averaged 18,000 barrels per day. Gulf of Mexico Occidental has a one third interest in the deep water Horn Mountain oil field, which is Occidentals only asset in the Gulf of Mexico. BP p.l.c. (BP) is the operator. For 2005, Occidentals production at Horn Mountain averaged 14,000 BOE per day. In the second half of 2005, the Horn Mountain field was shut down for about 47 days due to the impact of the hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. Hugoton and Other Occidental owns other oil and gas interests including a large concentration of gas reserves, production interests and royalty interests in the Hugoton area of Kansas and Oklahoma. The Hugoton field is the largest natural gas field discovered in North America. Occidentals Hugoton and other operations produced 133 MMcf of natural gas per day and 3,000 barrels of oil per day in 2005. Occidental has over 28,000 net acres in the Piceance Basin in western Colorado. During 2004 and 2005, Occidental drilled 30 development wells, installed a 50 MMcf per day gas processing facility and the infrastructure required for future field development. Occidental has acquired seismic data covering 34 square miles of the Cascade Creek field. Acquisition of Vintage Petroleum In January 2006, Occidental completed the merger of Vintage Petroleum, Inc. (Vintage) into a wholly owned Occidental subsidiary. Occidental acquired producing assets in Argentina, the United States, Yemen and Bolivia. The Argentine assets consist of 22 concessions, 19 of which Occidental will operate, located in the San Jorge Basin in Southern Argentina and the Cuyo Basin in western Argentina. Occidental paid $1.4 billion to former Vintage shareholders for the cash portion of the merger consideration and issued 28 million shares for the stock portion, which was valued at $2.1 billion. The value of Occidentals shares was determined by the average share price for the five day period beginning two days before the acquisition announcement. In addition, Occidental assumed Vintages debt, which had an estimated fair market value of $585 million at closing. Occidental intends to divest a portion of these assets. Middle East / North Africa Dolphin Project Occidentals investment in the Dolphin Project, which was acquired in 2002, consists of two separate economic interests held through two separate legal entities. One entity, OXY Dolphin E&P, LLC, owns a 24.5 percent undivided interest in the assets and liabilities associated with a Development and Production Sharing Agreement (DPSA) with the Government of Qatar to develop and produce natural gas and condensate in Qatars North Field for 25 years from the start of production, with a provision to request a 5 year extension. The purchase price of the undivided working interest in the DPSA was approximately $60 million and was recorded in Property, Plant & Equipment. This undivided interest is proportionately consolidated in Occidentals financial statements. A second entity, OXY Dolphin Pipeline, LLC, owns 24.5 percent of the stock of Dolphin Energy Limited (Dolphin Energy). The purchase price of Dolphin Energy stock totaled approximately $250 million and was recorded as an equity investment. Dolphin Energy is the operator under the DPSA on behalf of the three DPSA contractors, including Occidental. Dolphin Energy also has the rights to build, own and operate a 260 mile long, 48 inch natural gas pipeline, which will transport dry natural gas from Qatar to the UAE. The Dolphin Project is expected to cost approximately $4.0 billion in total. Occidental expects to invest approximately $1 billion of this total. The project will be financed by a combination of participant investment and project financing. During 2006, Occidental expects to spend a combined total of approximately $430 million for the gas exploration and 14 development activity and the investment in Dolphin Energy, compared to $380 million in 2005. In 2003, the Government of Qatar approved the final field development plan for the Dolphin Project. Construction of a gas processing and compression plant at Ras Laffan in Qatar, as well as two offshore gas production platforms, commenced in 2004 and is continuing. The projected start up date for production is late 2006. Based on existing supply contracts, the Dolphin Project is expected to export approximately 2 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas per day (plus associated liquids and byproducts). However, the pipeline is expected to have capacity to transport up to 3.2 Bcf of natural gas per day. Demand for natural gas in the UAE and Oman continues to grow and Dolphin Energys customers have requested additional gas supplies. To help fulfill this growing demand, Dolphin Energy will pursue an agreement to secure an additional supply of gas from Qatar. To date, Occidental has recorded 250 million BOE of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves for the Dolphin Project DPSA activity. No revenue or production costs were recorded in 2005 for the Dolphin Project gas exploration and development activity. Qatar In addition to the Dolphin Project, Occidental participates in two production projects in Qatar: Idd El Shargi North Dome (ISND) and Idd El Shargi South Dome (ISSD). Occidental is nearing completion of Phase II of full field development of ISND and is in the process of developing the ISSD field. Occidental expects to continue increasing production and recoverable reserves under its existing agreement in the ISND field. Phase II is targeting the development and recovery of additional reserves by applying advanced drilling systems and improved reservoir characterization techniques. Capital expenditures in Qatar for the ISSD and ISND projects were $343 million in 2005 and are expected to be $268 million in 2006. Occidentals net share of combined production from the two fields averaged 42,000 barrels per day in 2005. Yemen In Yemen, Occidental owns a 38 percent direct working interest in the Masila field in Block 14 and a 40.4 percent interest in the East Shabwa field, comprising a 28.6 percent direct working interest and an 11.8 percent equity interest in an unconsolidated entity. Occidentals production averaged 28,000 barrels of oil per day in 2005, with 24,000 coming from the Masila field and the remainder from East Shabwa. In addition, Occidental is the operator of Block 20, where it owns an 80 percent working interest. In July 2005, Occidental was the successful bidder for Block 75 in Yemens exploration bid round and has been invited to finalize a PSC for the block. Oman Occidentals Oman business includes Block 9 and Block 27, where it holds a 65 percent working interest in each, and Block 53, where it holds a 45 percent working interest. Occidental is the operator of all three blocks where production averaged 24,000 BOE per day in 2005, with 23,000 BOE coming from Block 9 and the remainder from Block 53. The Block 9 agreement provides for two ten year extensions and Occidental has agreed with the Government of Oman to the first ten year extension through December 7, 2015. In March 2004, Occidental began selling gas to the Government of Oman under a gas sales agreement, thereby allowing Occidental to produce previously stranded gas and condensates from Block 9. Under the agreement, Occidental (and its Block 9 partner) must supply approximately 114 MMcf per day of natural gas until December 31, 2007. Thereafter, Occidental will nominate quantities that it has available for delivery. In 2005, Occidental (and its partner) supplied an average of approximately 116 MMcf per day of natural gas to the Government under the gas sales agreement. The minimum gross quantities to be delivered under the gas sales agreement through December 31, 2007 represent approximately 93 percent of the expected average gross production of gas from Block 9 during that period. As of December 31, 2005, the gross proved gas reserves from Block 9 are approximately 373 percent of the total minimum of gas that remains to be delivered under the gas sales agreement. In October 2005, Occidental received approval for development of the Khamilah field in Block 27. The exploitation term of the agreement is 30 years beginning in September 2005. Occidental plans to develop the reserves and commence production in Block 27 through capital efficient investment and exploration. Occidental (and its Block 53 partners) signed a new PSC for the Mukhaizna field with the Government of the Sultanate of Oman in July 2005. On September 1, 2005, Occidental assumed operations of the Mukhaizna field, where it holds a 45 percent working interest. The Mukhaizna field, located in Omans south central interior, was discovered in 1975 and was brought into production in 2000. Primary production peaked in the same year at 15,000 barrels of oil per day and by September 2005, had declined to 8,500 barrels of oil per day. Occidental plans to use horizontal well steamflood technology to steadily increase production. Libya Occidental suspended all activities in Libya in 1986 as a result of economic sanctions imposed by the United States government. During the imposition of sanctions, Occidental derived no economic benefit from its Libyan interests. In 2004, the United States government lifted all of the principal economic sanctions against Libya. However, Libya continues to be designated as a country supporting international terrorism under section 6(j) of the United States Export Administration Act and, as such, continues to be subject to certain limited sanctions. 15 On August 11, 2005, the Libyan authorities approved the terms of Occidentals participation in the assets that it left in 1986, effective as of July 1, 2005. The agreement allows Occidental to return to its Libyan operations on generally the same terms in effect when activities were suspended. Those assets consist of three producing contracts in the Sirte Basin and four exploration blocks. Occidental paid approximately $133 million in re entry bonuses, capital adjustment and work in progress payments and is required to pay $10 million per year while it continues to operate in Libya, as reimbursements for past development costs associated with the historical assets. In addition, Occidental committed to spend $90 million over the next five years in the four exploration blocks. Currently, Occidentals rights in the producing fields extend through 2009 and early 2010. Occidental had its first lifting from its Libyan operations in late September and production during the fourth quarter of 2005 averaged 24,000 BOE per day. Separately, in early 2005, Occidental participated in the EPSA IV exploration bid round in Libya. Occidental successfully bid on nine of the 15 areas available. Occidental is the operator for five onshore areas and has a 90 percent exploration working interest. In addition, Occidental holds a 35 percent exploration working interest in four offshore areas. Woodside Petroleum Ltd. is the operator for the offshore areas. Occidental paid approximately $90 million in exploration lease bonuses for these nine new areas and committed to spend an additional $125 million over the next five years. Other Eastern Hemisphere Pakistan Occidental holds oil and gas working interests, that vary from 25 to 50 percent, in four Badin Blocks in Pakistan. BP is the operator. Occidentals share of production was approximately 18,000 BOE per day in 2005. Russia In Russia, Occidental owns 50 percent of a joint venture company, Vanyoganneft, that operates in the western Siberian oil basin. Production for 2005 was approximately 28,000 BOE per day. Latin America Colombia Occidental is the operator of the Cao Limn field with a 35 percent share of production, declining to 33.6 percent by mid 2006 and 31.5 percent by 2009. In mid 2006, if WTI exceeds $30 per barrel, Occidentals share of production will decline an additional amount based on a sliding scale. Occidentals share of 2005 production averaged 32,000 barrels of oil per day. Colombias national oil company, Ecopetrol, operates the Cao Limn Coveas oil pipeline and marine export terminal. The pipeline transports oil produced from the Cao Limn field for export to international markets. In September 2005, Occidental signed a new agreement with Ecopetrol for an enhanced oil recovery project in the La Cira Infantas field, located in central Colombia. If conditions warrant, upon completion of the two pilot phases, Occidental will earn a 48 percent net share of production upon further development. In November 2005, Ecopetrol approved development of the Caricare field, an exploration discovery under the Rondon Association Contract, adjacent to Cao Limn. Production from this field, where Occidental holds a 35 percent working interest, is expected to commence in May 2006. Occidental holds various working interests in two additional exploration blocks. Ecuador Occidental operates Block 15 in Ecuador in which it holds a 60 percent economic interest. Although Occidental holds legal title to 100 percent of the Block 15 Participation Contract, it farmed out 40 percent of its economic interest related to Block 15 in 2000. Occidentals share of production averaged approximately 42,000 barrels of oil per day in 2005. In addition, Occidental has a 14 percent interest in the Oleoducto de Crudos Pesados Ltd. (OCP) oil export pipeline. Development of existing fields, primarily Eden Yuturi and the Indillana Complex, continued through 2005. Drilling and the installation of new wells nearly offset the natural decline of existing wells. Foreign oil companies, including Occidental, have been paying a Value Added Tax (VAT), generally calculated on the basis of 10 to 12 percent of expenditures for goods and services used in the production of oil for export. Until 2001, oil companies, like other companies producing products for export, filed for and received reimbursement of VAT. In 2001, the Ecuador tax authority announced that the oil companies VAT payments did not qualify for reimbursement. In 2002, Occidental initiated an international arbitration proceeding against the Ecuadorian Government under the United States Ecuador bilateral investment treaty based on Occidentals belief that the Ecuadorian Government is arbitrarily and discriminatorily refusing to refund the VAT to Occidental. In July 2004, a tribunal of international arbitrators awarded Occidental compensation for VAT refunds from Occidentals Block 15 operations that were withheld by the Ecuadorian Government and indicated that similar VAT refunds should be paid going forward. The Ecuadorian Government has appealed the tribunals decision and the appeals proceedings continue at present. In the event of an unfavorable outcome, the potential effect on Occidentals financial statements would not be material. In September 2004, Occidental received formal notification that Petroecuador, the state oil company of Ecuador, was initiating proceedings to determine if Occidental had violated either its Participation Contract for Block 15 or the Ecuadorian Hydrocarbons Law and whether the alleged violations constitute grounds for terminating the Participation Contract. Block 15 operations represent approximately 7 percent of Occidentals 2005 consolidated production, 4 percent of its proved consolidated reserves, and 2 percent of its total property, plant and equipment (PP&E), net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A). In August 2005, Petroecuador issued a report 16 recommending that the Minister of Energy declare the termination of Occidentals Participation Contract for Block 15. The principal allegation stated in the notice and the Petroecuador report is an assertion that Occidental should have obtained government approval for the farmout agreement entered into in 2000. In November 2005, the Minister of Energy, following the procedure set forth in the Ecuadorian Hydrocarbons Law, requested that Occidental respond to the allegations against it. In February 2006, Occidental submitted its response to the Minister of Energy, in which Occidental confirmed its belief that it has complied with all material obligations under the Participation Contract and Ecuadorian law, and that any termination of the contract based upon the stated allegations would be unfounded and would constitute an unlawful expropriation. Occidental has been cooperating with the Ecuadorian authorities in these proceedings, and will continue to strive for an amicable resolution. Occidental currently is unable to determine the outcome of these proceedings, but if there were to be a negotiated settlement, it is probable that the terms would effectively reduce the future profitability of Block 15 operations. See also "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Ecuador" for further information about the OCP pipeline. Production Sharing Contracts Occidental conducts its operations in Qatar, Oman and Yemen under PSCs and, under such contracts, receives a share of production to recover its costs and an additional share for profit. In addition, Occidentals share of production from THUMS is subject to contractual arrangements similar to a PSC. Occidentals share of production from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise and increases when oil prices decline. Overall, Occidentals net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices. Proved Reserves Evaluation and Review Process A senior corporate officer of Occidental is responsible for the internal audit and review of its oil and gas reserves data. In addition, a Corporate Reserves Review Committee (Reserves Committee) has been established, consisting of senior corporate officers, to monitor and review Occidentals oil and gas reserves. The Reserves Committee reports to the Audit Committee of Occidentals Board of Directors periodically throughout the year. Occidental retained Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott), independent petroleum engineering consultants, to review its oil and gas reserve estimation processes in 2004 and 2005. Ryder Scott compared Occidentals methods and procedures for estimating oil and gas reserves to generally accepted industry standards and reviewed certain data, methods and procedures used in estimating reserve volumes, the economic evaluations and reserve classifications. Ryder Scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for a selection of oil and gas fields considered to be a valid representation of Occidentals total reserves portfolio. Based on this review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, Ryder Scott concluded that the methodologies used by Occidental in preparing the relevant estimates generally comply with current Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) standards. Ryder Scott was not engaged to render an opinion as to the reserves volumes presented by Occidental. Proved Reserve Additions Occidental consolidated subsidiaries had proved reserves at year end 2005 of 2,662 million BOE, as compared with the year end 2004 amount of 2,489 million BOE. Additionally, Occidentals investments in other interests had proved reserves of 45 million and 43 million BOE at year end 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the consolidated subsidiaries reserves from all sources was 380 million BOE, of which 232 million BOE were from proved developed reserves and 148 million BOE were from proved undeveloped reserves. Proved developed reserves represent approximately 74 percent of Occidentals total proved reserves. Proved Reserve Additions Consolidated Subsidiaries 2005 In Millions of BOE Proved Developed Proved Undeveloped Proved Total Revisions due to change in price 1 (27 ) (26 ) Other revisions 62 (57 ) 5 Improved Recovery 49 90 139 Extensions and Discoveries 21 102 123 Purchases 99 40 139 Total Additions 232 148 380 Proved reserves are 78 percent crude oil and condensate and 22 percent natural gas. Revisions of Previous Estimates In 2005, Occidental had net negative revisions of its proved reserves of 26 million BOE due to changes in price. The decrease was mainly due to negative revisions of 52 million BOE from the Dolphin Project, Qatar, Oman and Yemen where reserve amounts decrease when prices rise. These revisions were partially offset by positive revisions at domestic operations in Elk Hills and the Permian Basin. If oil prices increased by $5 per barrel, less oil volume is required to recover costs, and PSCs would reduce Occidentals share of proved reserves by approximately 7 million BOE. Conversely, if oil prices dropped by $5 per barrel, Occidentals share of proved reserves would increase by a similar amount. Oil price changes would also tend to affect the economic lives of proved reserves from other contracts, in a manner partially offsetting the PSC reserve volume changes. Apart from the effects of product prices, Occidentals approach to interpreting technical data regarding oil and gas reserves makes it more likely future reserve revisions will be positive rather than negative. Improved Recovery In 2005, Occidental added reserves of 139 million BOE through improved recovery, mainly in the Permian Basin, Elk Hills, and THUMS in the United States and also in Qatar. In an effort to partially mitigate the decline in oil and gas production from the Elk Hills field, 17 Occidental has successfully implemented an infill drilling program. The Elk Hills operations employ both gas flood and water flood techniques. In the Permian Basin, the increased reserves were primarily attributable to enhanced recovery techniques, such as drilling additional CO2 flood and water flood wells. Extensions and Discoveries Occidental obtains reserve additions from extensions which are dependent on successful exploitation programs. In 2005, Occidental added reserves of 123 million BOE, with 23 million BOE in the United States and 91 million BOE in the Middle East. In western Colorado, Occidental added approximately 9 million BOE from the extension of gas reserves to proved locations, most of which will require additional development capital. The success of improved recovery, extension and discovery projects depends on reservoir characteristics and technology improvements, as well as oil and gas prices, capital costs and operating costs. Many of these factors are outside of managements control, and will affect whether or not these historical sources of reserve additions continue at similar levels. Purchases of Proved Reserves In 2005, Occidental purchased reserves of 139 million BOE, of which 135 million BOE are in the United States. The reserve additions in the United States were from various acquisitions, primarily in the Permian Basin, of which 71 percent were proved developed reserves. Occidental continues to add reserves through acquisitions when properties are available at reasonable prices. Acquisitions are dependent on successful bidding and negotiating of oil and gas contracts at attractive terms. As market conditions change, the available supply of properties may increase or decrease accordingly. Proved Undeveloped Reserves In 2005, Occidentals proved undeveloped reserves increased by 148 million BOE. This net increase resulted from improved recovery, extensions, discoveries and purchases, primarily in the Elk Hills field, in the Permian Basin, in western Colorado and in the Dolphin Project. The Dolphin Project accounted for 63 percent of the 2005 increase, and the projected start up for Dolphin production is late 2006. These proved undeveloped additions were partially offset by reserve transfers to the proved developed category as a result of 2005 development programs. For details of proved reserve activity by geographic areas, see the "Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (Unaudited)" section in Item 8. Industry Outlook The petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to numerous market forces. Crude oil and natural gas prices are affected by market fundamentals such as weather, inventory levels, competing fuel prices, overall demand and the availability of supply. Worldwide oil prices in 2005 remained at or near historical highs. Continued economic growth, resulting in increased demand and concerns about supply availability, could result in continued high prices. A lower demand growth rate could result in lower crude oil prices. Historically, sustained high or low oil prices have significantly affected profitability and returns for Occidental and other upstream producers. Oil prices cannot be predicted with any certainty. The WTI price has averaged approximately $28.78 per barrel over the past ten years. However, the industry has historically experienced wide fluctuations in prices. During 2005, Occidental experienced an increase in its price differential of the average WTI price over Occidentals realized prices. See the "Oil and Gas Segment Business Environment" section above for further information. While local supply/demand fundamentals are a decisive factor affecting domestic natural gas prices over the long term, day to day prices may be more volatile in the futures markets, such as on the NYMEX and other exchanges, making it difficult to forecast prices with any degree of confidence. Over the last ten years, the NYMEX gas price has averaged $4.04 per Mcf. CHEMICAL SEGMENT Business Environment The chemical segment experienced improved results in 2005 due to sustained demand coupled with improved margins despite sharply higher feedstock costs. The widespread impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in the third quarter caused several disruptions among chlor alkali producers and their customers. This resulted in a moderate softening of product demand. Business Review Chlor alkali Demand for chlor alkali products began the year quite strong, which enabled OxyChem to realize robust margins despite escalating energy and raw material costs. While chlorine and caustic prices continued to rise throughout the year, the combination of softening demand, partly due to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and the rapid rise in energy and feedstock costs caused operating rates and profitability to fall in the latter part of the year. Key sectors, such as vinyls and pulp and paper, were operating at full capacity in the first half, resulting in a tight supply/demand balance for chlorine and caustic soda. Although demand remained relatively strong in the second half of the year, margins came under pressure as product became more available and industrial customers reduced purchases to control inventories and bolster cash flow. Domestic chlorine demand fell 7 percent compared to 2004, as several sectors experienced slowdowns late in the year, which resulted in de stocking of inventory amid the expectation of lower prices. Despite starting the year operating at near capacity, 2005 chlor alkali industry operating rates fell to 90 percent for the year, down from 99 percent in 2004. OxyChems chlor alkali operating rate for 2005 was 92 percent, slightly above the industry operating rate of 90 percent. In September 2005, OxyChem decided to permanently close its Deer Park, Texas and Delaware City, Delaware chlor alkali production facilities, and its 18 EDC facility in Ingleside, Texas. These sites were closed because they were not expected to regain an economically viable operating position in the future. Vinyls Increasing ethylene and natural gas prices led to a continuation of industry PVC price increases in 2005. Industry PVC prices increased 24 percent compared to 2004. These increases led to record high price levels in the fourth quarter of 2005. Industry wide total 2005 demand was 3 percent lower compared with 2004. OxyChem operated its PVC facilities at an average operating rate of 88 percent for 2005, compared to the North American industry average of 89 percent. In December 2005, OxyChem announced that it would permanently close its Alberta, Canada PVC manufacturing facility in the first quarter of 2006. Acquisition of Vulcan Assets In June 2005, Occidental completed the purchase of three chlor alkali chemical manufacturing facilities from Vulcan for $214 million in cash, plus contingent payments based upon the future performance of these facilities and the assumption of certain liabilities. In order to facilitate receipt of regulatory approval for this acquisition, Occidental divested one of the facilities. Exit of Vinyl Specialty Resins Business At the end of 2004, Occidental decided to exit the vinyl specialty resins business for strategic and economic reasons. This resulted in the immediate closure of the Pottstown, Pennsylvania manufacturing facility. Occidental recorded an after tax charge of $32 million in 2004 and classified this business as a discontinued operation. Industry Outlook Occidentals chemical business experienced improved profitability in 2005, 47 percent higher than 2004s earnings. The major factors that contributed to this improved performance were the continued strong United States economy, higher margins and the acquisition of certain Vulcan chemical operating assets. Continued strong performance will depend on global economic activity, the competitiveness of the United States in the world economy and the direction of the unprecedented high levels of feedstock and energy prices and their impact on margins. Reduced demand due to softening in the United States economy and continuation of the historically high levels of feedstock and energy prices could affect operating margins and reduce future profitability. Construction of LNG terminals on the United States Gulf Coast could stabilize natural gas prices at a lower than current level and thereby help improve the competitive position of efficient Gulf Coast chemical facilities. However, this construction may not occur in the immediate future. Chlor alkali Industry operating rates ended 2005 at 90 percent of capacity, which is a considerable decline from 2004s performance of 99 percent. Demand growth is expected to be moderate despite the potential positive effect of Gulf Coast rebuilding efforts. However, due to the currently high level of energy and other key raw material costs, margins are expected to remain under pressure. Moreover, a significant portion of 2005 results were due to sharply higher caustic soda prices versus 2004. This price increase has led to additional United States imports and intense competition among producers for market share. Vinyls Industry wide PVC operating rates are expected to be slightly lower in 2006 as a result of the restart of some idled capacity coupled with lower housing starts and reduced exports. VCM rates are expected to improve as Dow Chemical Company completes the announced shutdown of two production facilities. The growing cost disparity in the vinyls chain between the United States Gulf Coast and southeast Asia, as well as the growth of acetylene based PVC capacity in China, have resulted in a dramatic shift in trade flows and imports of PVC into the United States and Latin America. CORPORATE AND OTHER Corporate and Other includes the investments in Lyondell Chemical Company (Lyondell) and Premcor, Inc., (Premcor), and a leased cogeneration facility in Taft, Louisiana. The Premcor investment was sold in 2005. Beginning in 2004, Corporate and Other also included the results of a 1,300 mile oil pipeline and gathering system located in the Permian Basin, which was acquired in January 2004, and is used in corporate directed oil and gas marketing and trading operations. Lyondell In November 2004, Lyondell acquired Millennium Chemicals Inc. (Millennium) by issuing additional shares of Lyondell common stock. Under SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 51, Occidental was required to record its share of the increase in Lyondells net equity resulting from this issuance. The effect of this was an increase in the carrying value of Occidentals investment in Lyondell and a pre tax gain of $121 million. As a result of the stock issuance, Occidentals ownership percentage of Lyondell decreased from approximately 22 percent to 17 percent. 19 In 2005, Occidental sold 11 million shares of Lyondell common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $300 million. This sale resulted in a 2005 pre tax gain of $140 million. At December 31, 2005, Occidental still owned 30.3 million shares of Lyondell common stock (12 percent ownership), with a carrying value of $468 million and a fair market value of $722 million, and warrants to purchase an additional five million shares of Lyondell common stock. Occidental has no current plans to divest the remaining Lyondell shares. However, Occidental regularly reviews and analyzes its investments and other operations in order to determine how its stockholders interests are best served. Occidental continues to account for this investment on the equity method since it has the ability to exercise significant influence over Lyondell. Premcor In 2005, Valero Energy Corp. (Valero) and Premcor executed a merger agreement for Valero to acquire Premcor. Occidental tendered its 9 million shares of Premcor common stock for cash and shares of Valero common stock pursuant to the Premcor Valero agreement. Valeros acquisition of Premcor resulted in a $704 million pre tax gain and the subsequent sale of all of the Valero shares received resulted in an additional $22 million pre tax gain. SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of Occidentals two operating segments and corporate items should be read in conjunction with Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment earnings generally exclude interest income, interest expense, unallocated corporate expenses, discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment assets and results from the segments equity investments. As of January 1, 2005, Occidental revised its reporting of segment earnings to show segment earnings before income taxes. All domestic and foreign income tax expense is now reflected in the Corporate and Other column. This change has been retrospectively applied to prior period results. The following table sets forth the sales and earnings of each operating segment and corporate items: In millions, except per share amounts For the years ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 SALES Oil and Gas $ 10,416 $ 7,582 $ 6,003 Chemical 4,641 3,675 3,092 Other (a) 151 111 145 $ 15,208 $ 11,368 $ 9,240 EARNINGS(LOSS) Oil and Gas (b) $ 6,293 $ 4,290 $ 3,213 Chemical (c) 607 414 223 6,900 4,704 3,436 Unallocated corporate items Interest expense, net (d) Debt and trust preferred distributions (201 ) (240 ) (333 ) Income taxes (e) (2,020 ) (1,708 ) (1,231 ) Other (f) 593 (150 ) (271 ) Income from continuing operations 5,272 2,606 1,601 Discontinued operations, net 6 (38 ) (6 ) Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, net 3 (68 ) Net Income $ 5,281 $ 2,568 $ 1,527 Basic Earnings per Common Share $ 13.09 $ 6.49 $ 3.98 (a) The 2005 and 2004 amounts represent revenue from a Taft, Louisiana cogeneration plant and the Permian Basin pipeline and gathering system. The 2003 amount represents revenue from a Taft, Louisiana cogeneration plant. (b) The 2005 and 2004 amounts include interest income of $11 million and $18 million, respectively, from loans made to an equity investee. (c) The 2005 amount includes a $139 million charge for the write off of two previously idled chemical plants and one currently operated plant and an additional charge of $20 million for the write down of another chemical plant. (d) The 2005 amount includes $42 million of interest charges to redeem an unsecured subsidiary note and all of the outstanding 5.875 percent senior notes, 4.1 percent medium term notes and 7.65 percent senior notes and to purchase in the open market and retire various amounts of Occidental senior notes and unsecured subsidiary notes. The 2004 amount includes $17 million of interest charges to redeem or repurchase various debt issues during the year. The 2003 amount includes a $61 million interest charge to repay a $450 million senior note that had 10 years of remaining life, but was subject to remarketing on April 1, 2003. (e) The 2005 amount includes a $335 million tax benefit due to the reversal of tax reserves no longer required as United States corporate returns for tax years 1998 2000 became closed by lapsing of the statute of limitations, a $619 million tax benefit resulting from a closing agreement with the IRS resolving certain foreign tax credit issues and a $10 million charge related to a state income tax issue. The 2004 amount includes $47 million of credits related to tax settlements with the IRS. The 2005 and 2004 amounts also reflect a lower United States income tax rate resulting from the crediting of foreign income taxes. (f) The 2005 amount includes a $726 million pre tax gain from Valeros acquisition of Premcor and the subsequent sale of the Valero common shares received, a $140 million pre tax gain from the sale of 11 million shares of Lyondell common stock, which represented approximately 27 percent of Occidentals investment, $95 million of corporate equity method investment income and $62 million environmental remediation expense. The 2004 amount includes $169 million of corporate equity method investment income, $59 million of environmental remediation expense and the costs attributable to the cogeneration plant in Taft, Louisiana. The 2003 amount includes $58 million of corporate equity method investment losses and $63 million of environmental remediation expense. 20 Oil and Gas In millions, except as indicated 2005 2004 2003 Segment Sales $ 10,416 $ 7,582 $ 6,003 Segment Earnings $ 6,293 $ 4,290 $ 3,213 Core Earnings (a) $ 6,337 $ 4,290 $ 3,213 Net Production per Day United States Crude oil and liquids (MBBL) California 76 78 81 Permian 161 154 150 Horn Mountain 13 19 21 Hugoton and other 3 3 4 Total 253 254 256 Natural Gas (MMCF) California 242 237 252 Hugoton and other 133 127 138 Permian 170 130 129 Horn Mountain 8 13 13 Total 553 507 532 Latin America Crude oil & condensate (MBBL) Colombia 36 37 37 Ecuador 42 46 25 Total 78 83 62 Middle East/North Africa Crude oil & condensate (MBBL) Oman 17 13 12 Qatar 42 45 45 Yemen 28 32 35 Libya 8 Total 95 90 92 Natural Gas (MMCF) Oman 44 55 Other Eastern Hemisphere Crude oil & condensate (MBBL) Pakistan 5 7 9 Natural Gas (MMCF) Pakistan 77 75 74 Barrels of Oil Equivalent (MBOE) Subtotal Consolidated Subsidiaries 543 540 520 Colombia minority interest (4 ) (4 ) (5 ) Russia Occidental net interest 28 29 30 Yemen Occidental net interest 1 1 2 Total Worldwide Production (MBOE) 568 566 547 Oil and Gas (continued) In millions, except as indicated 2005 2004 2003 Average Sales Prices Crude Oil Prices ($ per barrel) United States $ 50.21 $ 37.72 $ 28.74 Latin America $ 45.43 $ 33.09 $ 27.21 Middle East/North Africa (b) $ 49.88 $ 34.88 $ 27.81 Other Eastern Hemisphere $ 46.84 $ 33.13 $ 26.61 Total consolidated subsidiaries $ 49.05 $ 35.95 $ 28.18 Other interests $ 36.16 $ 23.83 $ 15.95 Total worldwide $ 48.20 $ 35.09 $ 27.25 Gas Prices ($ per thousand cubic feet) United States $ 7.11 $ 5.35 $ 4.81 Middle East/North Africa (b) $ 0.96 $ 0.97 $ Other Eastern Hemisphere $ 2.44 $ 2.25 $ 2.04 Total consolidated subsidiaries $ 6.11 $ 4.56 $ 4.45 Other interests $ 0.16 $ $ Total worldwide $ 5.98 $ 4.56 $ 4.45 Expensed Exploration (c) $ 337 $ 219 $ 139 Capital Expenditures Development $ 1,856 $ 1,438 $ 1,097 Exploration $ 269 $ 102 $ 43 Acquisitions and other (d, e) $ 111 $ 109 $ 97 (a) For an explanation of core earnings, see "Significant Items Affecting Earnings." (b) These prices exclude taxes owed by Occidental but paid by governmental entities on its behalf. (c) Includes dry hole write offs and lease impairments of $242 million in 2005, $159 million in 2004 and $80 million in 2003. (d) Includes capitalized portion of injected CO2 of $59 million, $54 million and $48 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. (e) Includes mineral acquisitions but excludes significant acquisitions individually discussed in this report. Core earnings in 2005 were $6.3 billion, compared with $4.3 billion in 2004. The increase in core earnings is primarily due to higher prices and volumes for crude oil and natural gas, partially offset by higher operating expenses, higher exploration expense and increased DD&A rates. Core earnings in 2004 were $4.3 billion, compared with $3.2 billion in 2003. The increase in core earnings primarily reflects the effect of higher crude oil and natural gas prices and higher crude oil volumes, partially offset by higher operating expenses, higher exploration expense and increased DD&A rates. Average consolidated production costs for 2005 were $8.71 per BOE, compared to the average 2004 production cost of $6.95 per BOE. At least 62 percent of the increase was a result of higher energy prices, which increased utility, gas plant and CO2 costs and ad valorem taxes, and the impact of higher crude oil prices on PSCs. The remaining cost increases were the result of workover, maintenance and other costs. Occidental expects the first quarter 2006 production to be higher than the fourth quarter 2005 production. Also, see "Production Sharing Contracts" above. 21 Chemical In millions, except as indicated 2005 2004 2003 Segment Sales $ 4,641 $ 3,675 $ 3,092 Segment Earnings $ 607 $ 414 $ 223 Core Earnings (a) $ 777 $ 414 $ 223 Key Product Price Indexes (1987 through 1990 average price 1.0) Chlorine (b, c) 2.65 2.05 1.72 Caustic soda (b, c) 1.69 0.84 0.84 Ethylene dichloride (b, c) 1.44 1.56 1.16 PVC commodity resins (c) 1.32 1.08 0.89 Key Product Volumes Chlorine (thousands of tons) (b, d) 3,118 2,892 2,733 Caustic soda (thousands of tons) (b) 3,178 3,109 2,764 Ethylene dichloride (thousands of tons) (b) 682 458 546 PVC commodity resins (millions of pounds) 3,977 4,208 3,954 Capital Expenditures (e) $ 173 $ 155 $ 344 (a) For an explanation of core earnings, see "Significant Items Affecting Earnings." (b) The 2005 amounts include product volumes and prices from the Vulcan chemical operating assets. (c) Product volumes produced at former PolyOne and Vulcan facilities are excluded from the product price indexes. (d) Product volumes include those manufactured and consumed internally. (e) The 2003 amount includes $180 million for the purchase of a previously leased facility in LaPorte, Texas and $44 million related to the exercise of purchase options for certain leased railcars. Core earnings in 2005 were $777 million, compared with $414 million in 2004. The increase in core earnings is primarily due to higher margins resulting from higher prices for chlorine, caustic soda and PVC resins, partially offset by higher energy and feedstock costs. Core earnings were $414 million in 2004, compared with $223 million in 2003. The increase in core earnings reflects the impact of higher prices for most major products (PVC resins, EDC, chlorine and VCM), partially offset by higher energy and ethylene costs. SIGNIFICANT ITEMS AFFECTING EARNINGS Occidentals results of operations often include the effects of significant transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount. Therefore, management uses a measure called "core earnings," which excludes those items. This non GAAP measure is not meant to disassociate those items from managements performance, but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing Occidentals earnings performance between periods. Reported earnings are considered representative of managements performance over the long term. Core earnings is not considered to be an alternative to operating income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

TAXES Deferred tax liabilities, net of deferred tax assets of $1.1 billion, were $0.8 billion at December 31, 2005. The current portion of the deferred tax assets of $200 million is included in prepaid expenses and other. The net deferred tax assets are expected to be realized through future operating income and reversal of taxable temporary differences. 22 Worldwide Effective Tax Rate The following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for reported income from continuing operations and core earnings: In millions 2005 2004 2003 REPORTED INCOME Oil and Gas (a) $ 6,293 $ 4,290 $ 3,213 Chemical 607 414 223 Corporate and Other 392 (390 ) (604 ) Pre tax income 7,292 4,314 2,832 Income tax expense Federal and State 671 946 673 Foreign (a) 1,349 762 558 Total 2,020 1,708 1,231 Income from continuing operations $ 5,272 $ 2,606 $ 1,601 Worldwide effective tax rate 28% 40% 43% CORE INCOME Oil and Gas (a) $ 6,337 $ 4,290 $ 3,213 Chemical 777 414 223 Corporate and Other (405 ) (485 ) (543 ) Pre tax income 6,709 4,219 2,893 Income tax expense Federal and State 1,396 958 694 Foreign (a) 1,349 762 558 Total 2,745 1,720 1,252 Core income $ 3,964 $ 2,499 $ 1,641 Worldwide effective tax rate 41% 41% 43% (a) Revenues and income tax expense include taxes owed by Occidental but paid by governmental entities on its behalf. Oil and gas pre tax income includes revenue amounts for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, of $887 million, $525 million and $397 million, respectively. Occidentals 2005 worldwide effective tax rate was 28 percent for reported income and 41 percent for core income. The decrease in the United States income tax rate for reported income in 2005, compared to 2004, resulted from a $335 million tax benefit due to the reversal of tax reserves no longer required as United States corporate returns for tax years 1998 2000 became closed due to the lapsing of statutes of limitations and a $619 million tax benefit resulting from a closing agreement with the IRS resolving certain foreign tax credit issues. The lower United States income tax rate in 2005 and 2004, compared to 2003, resulted from the crediting of foreign income taxes. Previously, Occidental deducted foreign income taxes in determining United States taxable income. An annual tax election permits a taxpayer to claim either a credit or a deduction for foreign income taxes, whichever is more beneficial. Occidental expects to continue its election to credit foreign income taxes in future years. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Selected Revenue Items In millions 2005 2004 2003 Net sales $ 15,208 $ 11,368 $ 9,240 Interest, dividends and other income $ 181 $ 144 $ 89 Gain on disposition of assets, net $ 870 $ 1 $ 32 The increase in net sales in 2005, compared to 2004, reflects higher crude oil, natural gas and chemical prices. The increase in sales in 2004, compared to 2003, reflects higher crude oil, natural gas and chemical prices, higher crude oil production and higher chemical volumes, partially offset by lower domestic natural gas production volumes. The increase in interest, dividends and other income in 2005, compared to 2004, reflects interest income earned on a higher level of cash and cash equivalents. The increase in interest, dividends and other income in 2004, compared to 2003, is due to 2004 interest income earned from a loan made to an equity investee and a mark to market income adjustment for equity investee stock warrants. Gain on disposition of assets, net in 2005 includes a gain of $726 million resulting from Valeros acquisition of Premcor and the subsequent sale of all of the Valero shares received and a gain of $140 million on the sale of 11 million shares of Lyondell stock. Selected Expense Items In millions 2005 2004 2003 Cost of sales (a) $ 5,534 $ 4,509 $ 3,897 Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses $ 1,415 $ 1,008 $ 852 Depreciation, depletion and amortization $ 1,485 $ 1,303 $ 1,175 Exploration expense $ 337 $ 219 $ 139 Interest and debt expense, net $ 293 $ 260 $ 332 (a) Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization of $1,445 million in 2005, $1,263 million in 2004 and $1,137 million in 2003. Cost of sales increased in 2005, compared to 2004, mainly due to higher oil and gas production costs and higher energy and feedstock costs. Cost of sales increased in 2004, compared to 2003, due primarily to higher oil and gas production volumes and other operating costs, higher energy and feedstock costs and higher crude oil volumes. Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2005, compared to 2004, due to the chemical plant write offs and writedowns in 2005, higher costs in oil and gas, including higher production related taxes, and increases in share based compensation expense. Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2004, compared to 2003, mainly due to higher general and administrative costs for corporate infrastructure and general support areas and higher oil and gas costs, including higher production related taxes and other operating costs. 23 DD&A increased in 2005, compared to 2004, due to higher costs of new reserve additions resulting in a higher DD&A rate. The increase in DD&A in 2004, compared to 2003, was due to the increase in oil and gas production from the prior year and a higher DD&A rate. The increase in exploration expense in 2005, compared to 2004, was due mostly to higher dry hole write offs and impairment costs and higher seismic and geological and geophysical costs. The increase in exploration expense in 2004, compared to 2003, was due mostly to higher dry hole write offs and impairment costs in California and the Other Eastern Hemisphere region. Interest and debt expense in 2005, 2004 and 2003 included pre tax debt purchase charges of $42 million, $17 million and $61 million, respectively. Excluding the effects of these debt repayment charges, interest expense increased in 2005, compared to 2004, due to higher interest rates which were partially offset by lower debt levels. Interest and debt expense decreased in 2004, compared to 2003, due primarily to lower average debt levels. Other Items In millions 2005 2004 2003 Provision for income taxes $ 2,020 $ 1,708 $ 1,231 (Income) loss from equity investments $ (232 ) $ (113 ) $ 9 Gain on Lyondell stock issuance $ $ (121 ) $ The increase in the provision for income taxes in 2005, compared to 2004, was primarily due to an increase in income before taxes, partially offset by a $335 million tax benefit due to the reversal of tax reserves no longer required as United States corporate returns for tax years 1998 2000 became closed due to the lapsing of statutes of limitations and a $619 million tax benefit related to the resolution of certain IRS tax issues. The increase in the provision for income taxes in 2004, compared to 2003, was primarily due to an increase in income before taxes, partially offset by the use of a lower tax rate in 2004 resulting from the crediting of foreign income taxes. See the "Taxes" section above for further information. The increase in income from equity investments in 2005, compared to 2004, was due to improved results from the Lyondell equity investment and higher income from a Russian oil and gas equity investee. The increase in the income from equity investments in 2004, compared to results reported in 2003, was mostly attributable to improved results from Lyondell and higher income from a Russian oil and gas equity investee. The gain on Lyondell stock issuance in 2004 represents Occidentals share of the increase in Lyondells net equity resulting from Lyondells issuance of stock to purchase Millennium. CONSOLIDATED ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL POSITION The changes in the following components of Occidentals balance sheet are discussed below: Selected Balance Sheet Components In millions 2005 2004 CURRENT ASSETS Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,189 $ 1,199 Short term investments 252 250 Trade receivables, net 2,571 1,882 Receivables from joint ventures, partnerships and other 570 353 Inventories 735 545 Prepaid expenses and other 257 202 Total current assets $ 6,574 $ 4,431 Long term receivables, net $ 377 $ 239 Investments in unconsolidated entities $ 1,209 $ 1,727 Property, plant and equipment, net $ 17,534 $ 14,633 CURRENT LIABILITIES Current maturities of long term debt and capital lease liabilities $ 46 $ 459 Accounts payable 2,069 1,557 Accrued liabilities 1,635 1,034 Dividends payable 147 110 Domestic and foreign income taxes 383 263 Total current liabilities $ 4,280 $ 3,423 Long term debt, net $ 2,873 $ 3,345 Deferred credits and other liabilities income taxes $ 962 $ 1,248 Deferred credits and other liabilities other $ 2,621 $ 2,498 Stockholders equity $ 15,032 $ 10,550 The following analysis discusses increases and decreases in balance sheet items by comparing the balance at December 31, 2005, to the balance at December 31, 2004, unless otherwise indicated. Assets See Cash Flow Analysis for discussion about the increase in cash and cash equivalents. The increase in trade receivables is due to higher product prices and oil and gas sales volumes during the fourth quarter 2005 versus 2004. The increase in receivables from joint ventures, partnerships and other was due to higher mark to market adjustments on derivative financial instruments and higher account balances related to the oil and gas marketing and trading operations. The higher balance in inventories is due to higher oil and gas marketing and trading inventory due to higher prices and volumes during the fourth quarter 2005 versus 2004. The higher inventory balance is also due to an increase in chemical inventories. The increase in long term receivables reflects higher mark to market adjustments on long term derivative financial instruments. The decrease in investment in unconsolidated subsidiaries is due to the sale of all of the shares of Premcor common stock and a partial sale of the Lyondell stock during the year. The increase in property, plant and equipment reflects capital expenditures and acquisitions, partially offset by DD&A expense. 24 Liabilities and Stockholders Equity Debt to Capitalization (a) (a) This ratio is computed by dividing year end Total Debt, as shown in the MD&A Strategy Key Performance Indicators Debt Structure, by the sum of year end Total Debt plus year end Stockholders Equity. The decrease in current maturities of long term debt and capital lease liabilities reflects the 2005 payment of the 7.65 percent senior notes that were classified as current in 2004. The higher balance in accounts payable is due to higher prices and volumes for purchased oil and gas in Occidentals marketing and trading operations. The increase in accrued liabilities is primarily due to higher mark to market adjustments on derivative financial instruments and higher accruals mainly related to the Vulcan acquisition. The higher balance in domestic and foreign income taxes current reflects additional taxes payable due to higher income. The lower balance for long term debt is due to various debt redemptions and repurchases throughout the year. The decrease in deferred credits and other liabilities income taxes reflects the reduction in deferred taxes resulting from derivative activity in other comprehensive income (OCI) related to the production hedges and the sale of all of the shares of Valero common stock. The higher balance in deferred credits and other liabilities other is due to an increase in long term derivative liabilities related to crude oil production hedges, accruals related to the Permian Basin and Vulcan acquisitions and additional stock based compensation liabilities, partially offset by the reduction in liabilities related to the IRS settlement and the reversal of tax reserves no longer required due to the lapsing of the statute of limitations. The increase in stockholders equity reflects higher net income, partially offset by dividends paid and the impact of the crude oil production hedges in OCI. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At December 31, 2005, Occidental had approximately $2.4 billion in cash and short term investments on hand, an increase of almost $1 billion from 2004. Although income and cash flows are largely dependent on oil and gas prices and production, Occidental believes that cash and short term investments on hand and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its operating needs, capital expenditure requirements, dividend payments, potential acquisitions and its announced common stock repurchase program. If needed, Occidental could access its existing credit facilities. Available but unused lines of committed bank credit totaled approximately $1.5 billion at December 31, 2005. Occidentals $1.5 billion bank credit matures on June 18, 2009. None of Occidentals committed bank credits contain material adverse change (MAC) clauses or debt rating triggers that could restrict Occidentals ability to borrow under these lines. Occidentals credit facilities and debt agreements do not contain rating triggers that could terminate bank commitments or accelerate debt in the event of a ratings downgrade. At December 31, 2005, under the most restrictive covenants of certain financing agreements, Occidentals capacity for additional unsecured borrowing was approximately $34.6 billion, and the capacity for the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on, and for acquisitions of, Occidentals capital stock was approximately $13.0 billion, assuming that such dividends, distributions and acquisitions were made without incurring additional borrowing. In 2005, Occidental redeemed all of its 5.875 percent senior notes due 2007, all of its 4.101 percent medium term senior notes due 2007, all of its 7.65 percent senior notes due 2006 and three of its unsecured subsidiary notes due 2028 through 2030. In addition, Occidental purchased and retired a total of $213 million of its 6.75 percent senior notes due 2012, its 10.125 percent senior notes due 2009, its 4 percent medium term senior notes due 2007 and its 4.25 percent medium term senior notes due 2010. In January 2004, Occidental redeemed all of its outstanding 8.16 percent Trust Preferred Redeemable Securities (trust preferred securities) at par plus accrued interest, resulting in a decrease in current liabilities of $453 million. In the third quarter of 2004, Occidental redeemed all of its 6.5 percent senior notes, which reduced long term debt by approximately $157 million. In July 2004, Dolphin Energy, the operator of the Dolphin Project, entered into an agreement with banks to provide a $1.36 billion bridge loan for the Dolphin Project. Occidental guaranteed 24.5 percent of the obligations of Dolphin Energy under the bridge loan. In July 2005, Dolphin Energy entered into an agreement with banks to refinance the $1.36 billion bridge loan with a new bridge loan in an amount of $2.45 billion. The proceeds of the new bridge loan were used to pay off amounts outstanding on the $1.36 billion bridge loan and will be used to fund the construction of the Dolphin Project. The new bridge loan has a term of four years and is a revolving credit facility, which may be converted to a term loan. In September 2005, Dolphin Energy entered into an agreement with banks to provide a $1.0 billion Islamic law compliant facility to fund the construction of a certain portion of the Dolphin Project. 25 This four year financing facility is structured as a transaction in which Dolphin Energy constructs part of the midstream portion of the Dolphin Project on behalf of a group of Islamic investors and enters into a lease to use such assets upon construction completion. Occidental guarantees 24.5 percent of both of these obligations of Dolphin Energy. At December 31, 2005, Occidentals portion of the bridge loan drawdown was approximately $400 million, of which $299 million is recorded on the balance sheet. The remaining amount is discussed in Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Guarantees below. There were no draw downs on the Islamic law compliant facility at December 31, 2005. In the first quarter of 2005, Occidental filed a shelf registration statement for up to $1.5 billion of various securities. As of December 31, 2005, no securities had been issued under this shelf. In January 2006, Occidental completed the Vintage acquisition and paid $1.4 billion to former Vintage shareholders for the cash portion of the merger consideration and issued 28 million shares for the stock portion, which was valued at $2.1 billion. The value of Occidentals shares was determined by the average share price for the five day period beginning two days before the acquisition announcement. In addition, Occidental assumed Vintages debt, which had an estimated fair market value of $585 million at closing. Occidental intends to divest a portion of these assets. Cash Flow Analysis In millions 2005 2004 2003 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,337 $ 3,878 $ 3,074 The significant increase in operating cash flow in 2005, compared to 2004, resulted from several factors. The most important drivers were the significantly higher oil and natural gas prices and, to a much lesser extent, chemical prices. Although the changes in realized prices varied among the regions in which Occidental operates, in 2005, Occidentals realized oil prices were higher overall by 37 percent. Occidentals realized natural gas price increased over 33 percent in the United States, where approximately 80 percent of Occidentals natural gas was produced in 2005. Increases in the costs of producing oil and gas, such as purchased goods and services, and higher utility, gas plant and production taxes, partially offset oil and gas sales price increases, but such cost increases had a much lower effect on cash flow than the realized price increases. Other cost elements, such as labor costs and overheads, are not significant drivers of cash flow because they are mainly fixed within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term. Most major chemical prices increased in 2005 at a higher rate than the energy driven increase in feedstock and power costs, thereby improving profits and cash flow. The overall impact of the chemical price changes on cash flow was much less than for oil and gas price changes, not only because the chemical segment earnings and cash flow are significantly smaller than those for the oil and gas segment, but also because of increases in energy price driven feedstock and electric power costs, which are major elements of manufacturing cost for the chemical segments products. Sales volumes for chemical products generally were higher in 2005, but this did not have a significant effect on Occidentals earnings and cash flow. The significant increase in operating cash flow in 2004, compared to 2003, resulted from the significantly higher oil and natural gas prices and, to a much lesser extent, chemical prices. In 2004, Occidentals realized oil prices were higher overall by 29 percent and the realized United States natural gas price increased over 11 percent. Oil and gas worldwide production, on a BOE basis, increased for 2004 overall by over 3 percent on a daily basis, as compared with 2003, which also contributed to increased cash flow. Increases in sales prices realized for Occidentals major chemical product lines ranged from zero to 34 percent, compared to 2003. Chemical prices increased in 2004 at a higher rate than the energy driven increase in feedstock and power costs, thereby improving profits and cash flow. The overall impact of the chemical price changes on cash flow was much less than for oil and gas price changes. Sales volumes for chemical products generally were higher in 2004, but this did not have a significant effect on Occidentals earnings and cash flow. Increases in the costs of production partially offset sales price increases, but such cost increases had a much lower effect on cash flow than the realized price increases. Other non cash charges to income in 2005 include chemical asset write downs, deferred compensation, stock incentive plan amortization and environmental remediation accruals. Other non cash charges in 2004 include deferred compensation, stock incentive plan amortization, environmental remediation accruals and a chemical asset writedown. Other non cash charges in 2003 include deferred compensation, stock incentive plan amortization and environmental remediation accruals. In millions 2005 2004 2003 Net cash used by investing activities $ (3,161 ) $ (2,428 ) $ (2,131 ) The 2005 amount includes the cash payments for several Permian Basin acquisitions, the acquisition of the Vulcan chlor alkali manufacturing facilities and the payments to re enter Libya and to assume operations of the Mukhaizna field in Oman. These were partially offset by the cash proceeds from the sale of the Premcor Valero shares and the Lyondell shares. The 2004 amount includes the purchase of a pipeline and gathering system in the Permian Basin and a $204 million advance to the Elk Hills Power LLC (EHP) equity investment, which EHP used to repay a portion of its debt. 26 The 2003 amount includes several Permian Basin acquisitions totaling $317 million. Also, see the "Capital Expenditures" section below. In millions 2005 2004 2003 Net cash used by financing activities $ (1,186 ) $ (824 ) $ (516 ) The 2005 amount includes net debt payments of approximately $900 million. The 2004 amount includes $466 million paid to redeem the trust preferred securities in January 2004 and $159 million paid to redeem Occidentals 6.5 percent senior notes. The 2003 amount includes net debt repayments of $334 million. Occidental paid common stock dividends of $483 million in 2005, $424 million in 2004 and $392 million in 2003. Capital Expenditures In millions 2005 2004 2003 Oil and Gas $ 2,236 $ 1,649 $ 1,237 Chemical (a) 173 155 344 Corporate and Other 14 39 19 TOTAL (b) $ 2,423 $ 1,843 $ 1,600 (a) The 2003 amount includes $180 million for the purchase of a previously leased facility in LaPorte, Texas and $44 million related to the exercise of purchase options for certain leased railcars. (b) Excludes significant acquisitions individually discussed in this report. Occidentals capital spending estimate for 2006 is approximately $3.0 billion. Most of the capital spending will be allocated to oil and gas exploration, production and development activities in Elk Hills, the Permian Basin, Oman, Qatar and the Dolphin Project. Commitments at December 31, 2005, for major capital expenditures during 2006 and thereafter were approximately $804 million. Occidental will fund these commitments and capital expenditures with cash from operations. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS In the course of its business activities, Occidental pursues a number of projects and transactions to meet its core business objectives. The accounting and financial statement treatment of these transactions is a result of the varying methods of funding employed. Occidental also makes commitments on behalf of unconsolidated entities. These transactions, or groups of transactions, are recorded in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles and, unless otherwise noted, are not reflected on Occidentals balance sheets. The following is a description of the business purpose and nature of these transactions. Dolphin Project See "Oil and Gas Segment Business Review Middle East" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for further information. Ecuador In Ecuador, Occidental has a 14 percent interest in the OCP oil export pipeline. As of December 31, 2005, Occidentals net investment and advances to the project totaled $73 million. Occidental reports this investment in its consolidated statements using the equity method of accounting. The project was funded in part by senior project debt. The senior project debt is to be repaid with the proceeds of ship or pay tariffs of certain upstream producers in Ecuador, including Occidental. Under their ship or pay commitments, Occidental and the other upstream producers have each assumed their respective share of project specific risks, including operating risk, political risk and force majeure risk. Occidental would be required to make an advance tariff payment in the event of prolonged force majeure, upstream expropriation events, bankruptcy of the pipeline company or its parent company, abandonment of the project, termination of an investment guarantee agreement with Ecuador, or certain defaults by Occidental. This advance tariff would be used by the pipeline company to service or prepay project debt. At December 31, 2005, Occidentals obligation relating to the pipeline companys senior project debt totaled $100 million, and Occidentals obligations relating to performance bonds totaled $14 million. Occidentals overall obligations will decrease with the reduction of the pipeline companys senior project debt. Leases Occidental has entered into various operating lease agreements, mainly for railcars, power plants, manufacturing facilities and office space. Occidental leases assets when it offers greater operating flexibility. Lease payments are expensed mainly as cost of sales. See the Contractual Obligations table below. Guarantees Occidental has entered into various guarantees including performance bonds, letters of credit, indemnities, commitments and other forms of guarantees provided by Occidental to third parties, mainly to provide assurance that OPC and or its subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations (guarantees). At December 31, 2005, the notional amount of the guarantees was approximately $575 million. Of this amount, approximately $475 million relates to Occidentals guarantee of equity investees debt and other commitments. The debt guarantees and other commitments primarily relate to the Dolphin Energy equity investment and the investment in the Ecuador OCP pipeline, which are discussed above. The remaining $100 million relates to various indemnities and guarantees provided to third parties. 27 Contractual Obligations The table below summarizes and cross references certain contractual obligations that are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and or disclosed in the accompanying Notes. Payments Due by Year Contractual Obligations (in millions) Total 2006 2007 to 2008 2009 to 2010 2011 and thereafter Consolidated Balance Sheet Long term debt (Note 6) (a) $ 2,910 $ 46 $ 562 $ 785 $ 1,517 Capital leases (Note 7) 37 1 2 2 32 Other liabilities (b, c) 5,058 3,548 790 316 404 Other Obligations Operating leases (Note 7) (d) 1,325 131 207 162 825 Purchase obligations (e, f) 7,739 1,299 2,111 1,680 2,649 TOTAL $ 17,069 $ 5,025 $ 3,672 $ 2,945 $ 5,427 (a) Excludes unamortized interest swap net gains and unamortized debt discounts. (b) Includes obligations under postretirement benefit and deferred compensation plans. (c) Other liabilities include accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities. (d) Amounts have not been reduced for sublease rental income. (e) Includes long term purchase contracts and purchase orders and contracts for goods and services used in manufacturing and producing operations in the normal course of business. Some of these arrangements involve take or pay commitments but they do not represent debt obligations. Due to their long term nature, purchase contracts with terms greater than 5 years are discounted using a 6 percent discount rate. (f) Amounts exclude purchase obligations related to oil and gas marketing and trading activities where an offsetting sales position exists. LAWSUITS, CLAIMS COMMITMENTS CONTINGENCIES AND RELATED MATTERS OPC and certain of its subsidiaries have been named in a substantial number of lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings. These actions seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. OPC and certain of its subsidiaries also have been named in proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and similar federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws. These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages and civil penalties; however, Occidental is usually one of many companies in these proceedings and has to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, including environmental proceedings, Occidental accrues reserves when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Since April 2004, OxyChem has been served with eight lawsuits filed in Nicaragua by approximately 2,200 individual plaintiffs. These individuals allege that they have sustained several billion dollars of personal injury damages as a result of their alleged exposure to a pesticide. OxyChem is aware of, but has not been served in, 20 additional cases in Nicaragua, which Occidental understands make similar allegations. OxyChem has no assets in Nicaragua and, in the opinion of management, these claims are without merit because, among other things, OxyChem believes that none of the pesticide it manufactured was ever sold or used in Nicaragua. Under the applicable Nicaraguan statute, defendants are required to pay pre trial deposits so large as to effectively prohibit defendants from participating fully in their defense. In previous situations, involving other defendants, Nicaraguan courts have proceeded to enter significant judgments against the defendants under that statute. OxyChem has filed a response to the complaints contesting jurisdiction without posting such pre trial deposit. In December 2004, the judge in one of the cases (the "Osorio Case"), ruled the court had jurisdiction over the defendants, including OxyChem, and that the plaintiffs had waived the requirement of the pre trial deposit. OxyChem has appealed that portion of the ruling relating to the jurisdiction of the Nicaraguan courts. Thereafter, the trial court ordered defendants, including OxyChem, to file an answer. In order to preserve its jurisdictional defense, OxyChem elected not to make a substantive appearance in the case. In August 2005, the judge in the Osorio case entered judgment against several defendants, including OxyChem, for damages totaling approximately $97 million. In the opinion of management, any judgment rendered under the statute, including in the Osorio case, would be unenforceable in the United States. In September 2004, Occidental received formal notification that Petroecuador, the state oil company of Ecuador, was initiating proceedings to determine if Occidental had violated either its Participation Contract for Block 15 or the Ecuadorian Hydrocarbons Law and whether the alleged violations constitute grounds for terminating the Participation Contract. Block 15 operations represent approximately 7 percent of Occidentals 2005 consolidated production, 4 percent of its proved consolidated reserves, and 2 percent of its total PP&E, net of accumulated DD&A. In August 2005, Petroecuador issued a report recommending that the Minister of Energy declare the termination of Occidentals Participation Contract for Block 15. The principal allegation stated in the notice and the Petroecuador report is an assertion that Occidental should have obtained government approval for the farmout agreement entered into in 2000. In November 2005, the Minister of Energy, following the procedure set forth in the Ecuadorian Hydrocarbons Law, requested that Occidental respond to the allegations against it. In February 2006, Occidental submitted its response to the Minister of Energy, in which Occidental confirmed its belief that it has complied with all material obligations under the Participation Contract and Ecuadorian law, and that any termination of the contract based upon the stated allegations would be unfounded and would constitute an unlawful expropriation. Occidental has been cooperating with the Ecuadorian authorities in these proceedings, and will continue to strive for an 28 amicable resolution. Occidental currently is unable to determine the outcome of these proceedings, but if there were to be a negotiated settlement, it is probable that the terms would effectively reduce the future profitability of Block 15 operations. See also "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Ecuador" for information about the OCP pipeline. During the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions. Disputes may arise during the course of such audits as to facts and matters of law. In May 2005, Occidental entered into a closing agreement with the IRS resolving certain foreign tax credit issues as part of the IRS audit of tax years 1997 2000. The closing agreement was completed after an extensive IRS review of various complex tax issues and negotiations between Occidental and the IRS. As a result of the closing agreement, Occidental recorded a tax benefit of $619 million in 2005 for the reversal of tax reserves that were previously established for those foreign tax credit issues. In addition, Occidental recorded a tax benefit of $335 million in 2005 due to the reversal of tax reserves no longer required as United States corporate returns for tax years 1998 2000 became closed due to the lapsing of the statute of limitations. These tax benefits did not have a significant current cash effect. Occidental has entered into agreements providing for future payments to secure terminal and pipeline capacity, drilling services, electrical power, steam and certain chemical raw materials. See Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. See Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Contractual Obligations for further information. Occidental has certain other commitments under contracts, guarantees and joint ventures, including purchase commitments for goods and services at market related prices and certain other contingent liabilities. See Off Balance Sheet Arrangements for further information. Some of these commitments, although not fixed or determinable, involve capital expenditures and are part of the $3.0 billion capital expenditures estimated for 2006. Occidental has indemnified various parties against specified liabilities that those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with Occidental. These indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds. As of December 31, 2005, Occidental is not aware of circumstances that would lead to future indemnity claims against it for material amounts in connection with these transactions. It is impossible at this time to determine the ultimate liabilities that OPC and its subsidiaries may incur resulting from any lawsuits, claims and proceedings, audits, commitments, contingencies and related matters. If these matters were to be ultimately resolved unfavorably at amounts substantially exceeding Occidentals reserves, an outcome not currently anticipated, it is possible that such outcome could have a material adverse effect upon Occidentals consolidated financial position or results of operations. However, after taking into account reserves, management does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of these matters to have a material adverse effect upon Occidentals consolidated financial position or results of operations. ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURES Occidentals operations in the United States are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to improving or maintaining environmental quality. Foreign operations also are subject to environmental protection laws. Costs associated with environmental compliance have increased over time and are expected to rise in the future. Environmental expenditures related to current operations are factored into the overall business planning process and are considered an integral part of production in manufacturing quality products responsive to market demand. Environmental Remediation The laws that require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively to past waste disposal practices and releases. In many cases, the laws apply regardless of fault, legality of the original activities or current ownership or control of sites. OPC or certain of its subsidiaries are currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups under these laws at federal Superfund sites, comparable state sites and other domestic and foreign remediation sites, including Occidental facilities and previously owned sites. Also, OPC and certain of its subsidiaries have been involved in a substantial number of governmental and private proceedings involving historical practices at various sites including, in some instances, having been named in proceedings under CERCLA and similar federal, state and local environmental laws. These proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages and civil penalties. Occidental manages its environmental remediation efforts through a wholly owned subsidiary, Glenn Springs Holdings, Inc., which reports its results directly to Occidentals corporate management. The following table presents Occidentals environmental remediation reserves at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 grouped by three categories of environmental remediation sites: $ amounts in millions 2005 2004 2003 # of Sites Reserve Balance # of Sites Reserve Balance # of Sites Reserve Balance CERCLA & equivalent sites 128 $ 236 125 $ 239 131 $ 240 Active facilities 18 114 16 75 13 79 Closed or sold facilities 39 68 39 61 39 53 TOTAL 185 $ 418 180 $ 375 183 $ 372 29 The following table shows environmental reserve activity for the past three years: In millions 2005 2004 2003 Balance Beginning of Year $ 375 $ 372 $ 393 Increases to provision including interest accretion 63 60 64 Changes from acquisitions 45 6 Payments (71 ) (63 ) (83 ) Other 6 (2 ) Balance End of Year $ 418 $ 375 $ 372 Occidental expects to expend funds equivalent to about half of the current environmental reserve over the next three years and the balance over the next ten or more years. Occidental believes it is reasonably possible that it will continue to incur additional liabilities beyond those recorded for environmental remediation at these and other sites. The range of reasonably possible loss for existing environmental remediation matters could be up to $420 million beyond the amount accrued. For managements opinion, refer to the "Lawsuits, Claims, Commitments, Contingencies and Related Matters" section above. CERCLA and Equivalent Sites At December 31, 2005, OPC or certain of its subsidiaries have been named in 128 CERCLA or state equivalent proceedings, as shown below. Description ($ amounts in millions) # of Sites Reserve Balance Minimal/No Exposure (a) 105 $ 4 Reserves between $1 $10 MM 15 44 Reserves over $10 MM 8 188 TOTAL 128 $ 236 (a) Includes 28 sites for which Maxus Energy Corporation has retained the liability and indemnified Occidental, 7 sites where Occidental has denied liability without challenge, 57 sites where Occidentals reserves are less than $50,000 each, and 13 sites where reserves are between $50,000 and $1 million each. The eight sites with individual reserves over $10 million in 2005 include a former copper mining and smelting operation in Tennessee, two closed landfills in western New York, groundwater treatment facilities at four closed chemical plants (Montague, Michigan, Hicksville, New York, western New York and Tacoma, Washington) and replacement of a municipal drinking water treatment plant in western New York. Active Facilities Certain subsidiaries of OPC are currently addressing releases of substances from past operations at 18 active facilities. Five facilities a chemical plant in Louisiana, a phosphorus recovery operation in Tennessee, a chemical plant in Texas, a chemical plant in Kansas and certain oil and gas properties in the southwestern United States account for 76 percent of the reserves associated with these facilities. Closed or Sold Facilities There are 39 sites formerly owned or operated by certain subsidiaries of OPC that have ongoing environmental remediation requirements in which Occidental or its subsidiaries are involved. Four sites account for 63 percent of the reserves associated with this group. The four sites are: an active refinery in Louisiana where Occidental indemnifies the current owner and operator for certain remedial actions, a water treatment facility at a former coal mine in Pennsylvania, a closed OxyChem chemical plant in Pennsylvania and a water treatment facility at a former OxyChem chemical plant in North Carolina. Environmental Costs Occidentals costs, some of which may include estimates, relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations, are shown below for each segment: In millions 2005 2004 2003 Operating Expenses Oil and Gas $ 71 $ 54 $ 40 Chemical 67 59 55 $ 138 $ 113 $ 95 Capital Expenditures Oil and Gas $ 47 $ 48 $ 98 Chemical 21 12 15 $ 68 $ 60 $ 113 Remediation Expenses Corporate $ 62 $ 59 $ 63 Operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis. Capital expenditures relate to longer lived improvements in currently operating facilities. Remediation expenses relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and do not contribute to current or future revenue generation. Although total costs may vary in any one year, over the long term, segment operating and capital expenditures for environmental compliance generally are expected to increase. Occidental presently estimates that capital expenditures for environmental compliance will be approximately $79 million for 2006 and $77 million for 2007. FOREIGN INVESTMENTS Portions of Occidentals assets outside North America are exposed to political and economic risks. Occidental conducts its financial affairs so as to mitigate its exposure against those risks. At December 31, 2005, the carrying value of Occidentals assets in countries outside North America aggregated approximately $5.2 billion, or approximately 20 percent of Occidentals total assets at that date. Of such assets, approximately $3.9 billion are located in the Middle East/North Africa, approximately $1.0 billion are located in Latin America, and substantially all of the remainder are located in the Other Eastern Hemisphere region. For the year ended December 31, 2005, net sales outside North America totaled $4.4 billion, or approximately 29 percent of total net sales. 30 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The process of preparing financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the management of Occidental to make estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions. It is possible that materially different amounts could be recorded if these estimates and judgments change or if the actual results differ from these estimates and judgments. Occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve the judgment of Occidentals management. There has been no material change to these policies over the past three years. The selection and development of these critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Oil and Gas Properties Occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties. Under this method, costs of acquiring properties, costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs are capitalized. The costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found. At the completion of drilling activities, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized if a determination is made that proved reserves have been found. If no proved reserves have been found, the costs of each of the related exploratory wells are charged to expense. In some cases, a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling, requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells. Occidentals practice is to expense the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a twelve month period after drilling is complete. Occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of commercial viability is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures. Annual lease rentals and exploration, geological, geophysical and seismic costs are expensed as incurred. Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, can be recovered in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions considering future production and development costs. Several factors could change Occidentals recorded oil and gas reserves. Occidental receives a share of production from PSCs to recover its costs and an additional share for profit. Occidentals share of production from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise and increases when oil prices decline. Overall, Occidentals net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices. In other contractual arrangements, sustained lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of proved reserves becomes uneconomical. Estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond Occidentals control, such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs. These factors, in turn, could lead to a reduction in the quantity of recorded proved reserves. PSCs also affect reserves. As prices increase, Occidentals share of proved recorded reserves decreases while a decrease in price causes recorded proved reserves to increase. An additional factor that could result in a change of proved reserves is the reservoir decline rates being different from those assumed when the reserves were initially recorded. Occidentals revisions to proved reserves were negative for 2005 and amounted to less than 2 percent of the total reserves for the year. The negative revisions in 2005 were primarily a result of PSC price effects. In 2004 and 2003, revisions to proved reserves were positive and amounted to less than 2 percent of the total reserves for each year. Additionally, Occidental is required to perform impairment tests pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144 generally when prices decline and or reserve estimates change significantly. There have been no impairments of reserves over the past three years. If Occidentals consolidated oil and gas reserves were to change based on the factors mentioned above, the most significant impact would be on the depreciation and depletion rate. For example, a 5 percent increase in the amount of consolidated oil and gas reserves would change the rate from $6.13 per barrel to $5.82 per barrel, which would increase pre tax income by $61 million annually. A 5 percent decrease in the oil and gas reserves would change the rate from $6.13 per barrel to $6.43 per barrel and would result in a decrease in pre tax income of $61 million annually. DD&A of oil and gas producing properties is determined by the unit of production method and could change with revisions to estimated proved reserves. The change in the DD&A rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous proved reserve estimates has been immaterial. A portion of the carrying value of Occidentals oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties. At December 31, 2005, the capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties, net of accumulated valuation allowance, were $788 million. These costs are not currently being depreciated or depleted. As exploration and development work progresses and the reserves on these properties are proven, capitalized costs attributable to the properties will be subject to depreciation and depletion. If the exploration and development work were to be unsuccessful, the capitalized costs of the properties related to this unsuccessful work would be expensed in the year in which the determination was made. The timing of any writedowns of these unproven properties, if warranted, depends upon the nature, timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results. Occidental believes its exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize the unproved property balance. 31 Chemical Assets The most critical accounting policy affecting Occidentals chemical assets is the determination of the estimated useful lives of its PP&E. Occidentals chemical plants are depreciated using either the unit of production or straight line method based upon the estimated useful life of the facilities. The estimated useful lives of Occidentals chemical assets, which range from 3 years to 50 years, are used to compute depreciation expense and are also used for impairment tests. The estimated useful lives used for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that Occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained. Without these continued expenditures, the useful lives of these plants could significantly decrease. Other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of Occidentals chemical plants include sustained higher or lower product prices, which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition, feedstock costs, energy prices, environmental regulations, competition and technological changes. Over the prior three years, the change in the depreciation rate due to changes in estimated useful lives has been immaterial. Occidental performs impairment tests on its assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when managements plans change with respect to those assets. Occidental compares the undiscounted future cash flows of an asset to its carrying value. The key factors that could significantly affect future cash flows are future product prices, which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition, feedstock costs, energy costs, significantly increased regulation and remaining estimated useful life. Due to a temporary decrease in demand for some of its products, Occidental temporarily idled an EDC plant in June 2001 and a chlor alkali plant in December 2001. Subsequent to the purchase of the Vulcan chemical assets, Occidental reviewed all of its chemical assets and decided to close its least competitive plants and upgrade the remaining operations. As a result of this review, Occidental recorded a $139 million pre tax charge for the write off of these two previously idled chemical plants and one currently operated plant and a pre tax additional charge of $20 million for the writedown of another chemical plant in 2005. Occidentals net PP&E for chemicals is approximately $2.6 billion and its depreciation expense for 2006 is expected to be approximately $240 million. If the estimated useful lives of Occidentals chemical plants were to decrease based on the factors mentioned above, the most significant impact would be on depreciation expense. For example, a reduction in the remaining useful lives of one year would increase depreciation and reduce pre tax earnings by approximately $21 million per year. Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Reserves for estimated costs that relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future revenue generation are recorded when environmental remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. In determining the reserves and the reasonably possible range of loss, Occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience, available technology, regulations in effect, the timing of remediation and cost sharing arrangements. The environmental reserves are based on managements estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred and are reviewed periodically and adjusted as additional or new information becomes available. Environmental reserves are recorded on a discounted basis only when a reserve is initially established and the aggregate amount of the estimated costs for a specific site and the timing of cash payments are reliably determinable. The reserve methodology for a specific site is not modified once it has been established. Recoveries and reimbursements are recorded in income when receipt is probable. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, Occidental has not accrued any reimbursements or indemnification recoveries for environmental remediation matters as assets. Many factors could result in changes to Occidentals environmental reserves and reasonably possible range of loss. The most significant are: The original cost estimate may have been inaccurate. Modified remedial measures might be necessary to achieve the required remediation results. Occidental generally assumes that the remedial objective can be achieved using the most cost effective technology reasonably expected to achieve that objective. Such technologies may include air sparging or phyto remediation of shallow groundwater, or limited surface soil removal or in situ treatment producing acceptable risk assessment results. Should such remedies fail to achieve remedial objectives, more intensive or costly measures may be required. The remedial measure might take more or less time than originally anticipated to achieve the required contaminant reduction. Site specific time estimates can be affected by factors such as groundwater capture rates, anomalies in subsurface geology, interactions between or among water bearing zones and non water bearing zones, or the ability to identify and control contaminant sources. The regulatory agency might ultimately reject or modify Occidentals proposed remedial plan and insist upon a different course of action. 32 Additionally, other events might occur that could affect Occidentals future remediation costs, such as: The discovery of more extensive contamination than had been originally anticipated. For some sites with impacted groundwater, accurate definition of contaminant plumes requires years of monitoring data and computer modeling. Migration of contaminants may follow unexpected pathways along geologic anomalies that could initially go undetected. Additionally, the size of the area requiring remediation may change based upon risk assessment results following site characterization or interim remedial measures. Improved remediation technology might decrease the cost of remediation. In particular, for groundwater remediation sites with projected long term operation and maintenance, the development of more effective treatment technology, or acceptance of alternative and more cost effective treatment methodologies such as bioremediation, could significantly affect remediation costs. Laws and regulations might change to impose more or less stringent remediation requirements. At sites involving multiple parties, Occidental provides environmental reserves based upon its expected share of liability. When other parties are jointly liable, the financial viability of the parties, the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to Occidental of their failure to participate are evaluated when estimating Occidentals ultimate share of liability. Based on these factors, Occidental believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of other potentially responsible parties, with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, in an amount that would have a material effect on Occidentals consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Most cost sharing arrangements with other parties fall into one of the following three categories: Category 1: CERCLA or state equivalent sites wherein Occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties share the cost of remediation in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations; Category 2: Oil and gas joint ventures wherein each joint venture partner pays its proportionate share of remedial cost; and Category 3: Contractual arrangements typically relating to purchases and sales of property wherein the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating the costs of environmental remediation. In all three of these categories, Occidental records as a reserve its expected net cost of remedial activities, as adjusted by recognition for any nonperforming parties. In addition to the costs of investigating and implementing remedial measures, which often take in excess of ten years at CERCLA sites, Occidentals reserves include managements estimates of the cost of operation and maintenance of remedial systems. To the extent that the remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site specific data, laws, regulations, technologies or engineering estimates, Occidental reviews and changes the reserves accordingly on a site specific basis. If the environmental reserve balance were to either increase or decrease based on the factors mentioned above, the amount of the increase or decrease would be immediately recognized in earnings. For example, if the reserve balance were to decrease by 10 percent, Occidental would record a pre tax gain of $42 million. If the reserve balance were to increase by 10 percent, Occidental would record an additional remediation expense of $42 million. Other Loss Contingencies Occidental is involved with numerous lawsuits, claims, proceedings and audits in the normal course of its operations. Occidental records a loss contingency for these matters when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In addition, Occidental discloses, in aggregate, its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred. Occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis so that they are adequately reserved on the balance sheet. These reserves are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate. Managements judgments could change based on new information, changes in laws or regulations, changes in managements plans or intentions, the outcome of legal proceedings, settlements or other factors. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING CHANGES Listed below are significant changes in accounting principles. EITF Issue No. 04 13 In September 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) finalized the provisions of EITF Issue No. 04 13, Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty, which provides accounting guidance about whether buy/sell arrangements should be accounted for at historical cost and whether these arrangements should be reported on a gross or net basis. Buy/sell arrangements typically are contractual arrangements where the buy and sell agreements are entered into in contemplation of one another with the same counterparty. Occidental reports all buy/sell arrangements on a net basis and at historical cost. This EITF is effective in the first interim period beginning after March 15, 2006, and Occidental will prospectively adopt this statement in the second quarter of 2006. Occidental is currently assessing the effect of EITF Issue No. 04 13, but does not expect it to have a material effect on its financial statements. 33 FIN No. 47 In March 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. FIN 47 specifies the accounting treatment for conditional asset retirement obligations under the provisions of SFAS No. 143. FIN 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. Occidental has identified conditional asset retirement obligations at a certain number of its facilities that are mainly related to plant decommissioning. Under FIN 47, which Occidental adopted on December 31, 2005, Occidental is required to record the fair value of these conditional liabilities if they can be reasonably estimated. However, Occidental believes that there is an indeterminate settlement date for these asset retirement obligations because the range of time over which Occidental may settle these obligations is unknown or cannot be estimated. Therefore, Occidental cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of these liabilities. Occidental will recognize these conditional asset retirement obligations in the periods in which sufficient information becomes available to reasonably estimate their fair values. SFAS No. 123R On July 1, 2005, Occidental early adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R (SFAS 123R), Share Based Payments, under the modified prospective transition method. Since most of Occidentals existing stock based compensation was already being recorded in the income statement, Occidental decided to early adopt SFAS 123R, so that the remaining awards would be accounted for in a similar manner. Prior to July 1, 2005, Occidental applied the Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25 intrinsic value accounting method for its stock incentive plans. Under the modified prospective transition method, the fair value recognition provisions apply only to new awards or awards modified after July 1, 2005. Additionally, the fair value of existing unvested awards at the date of adoption is recorded in compensation expense over the remaining requisite service period. Results from prior periods have not been restated. As a result of adopting this statement in the third quarter of 2005, Occidental recorded a $3 million after tax credit as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. FASB Staff Position No. (FSP) FAS 19 1 In April 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. (FSP) FAS 19 1, Accounting for Suspended Well Costs. FSP FAS 19 1 provides new accounting guidance that specifies when successful efforts companies can capitalize exploratory well costs. The guidance also requires new disclosures related to these costs. FSP FAS 19 1 is effective in the first reporting period beginning after April 4, 2005, and will be applied prospectively to existing and new exploratory well costs. Occidental adopted this statement effective July 1, 2005, and there was no material effect on the financial statements upon adoption. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the new disclosures. SFAS No. 153 In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, "Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29." SFAS No. 153 specifies the criteria required to record a nonmonetary asset exchange using carryover basis. SFAS No. 153 is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring after July 1, 2005. Occidental adopted this statement in the third quarter of 2005 and there was no material effect on the financial statements upon adoption. SFAS No. 151 In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4." SFAS No. 151 clarifies the accounting treatment for various inventory costs and overhead allocations. SFAS No. 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred after July 1, 2005. Occidental adopted this statement in the third quarter of 2005 and it did not have a material effect on the financial statements when adopted. FSP FAS 106 2 In May 2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS 106 2, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003," which specifies the accounting and disclosure requirements for the prescription drug benefits that are available under this new plan. Occidental adopted the disclosure provisions of this pronouncement in the second quarter of 2004. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. FIN 46 R (Revised) In December 2003, the FASB revised FIN 46 to exempt certain entities from its requirements and to clarify certain issues arising during the initial implementation of FIN 46. Occidental adopted the revised interpretation in the first quarter of 2004 and it did not have a material impact on the financial statements when adopted. SFAS No. 143 Effective January 1, 2003 Occidental adopted SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. The initial adoption of SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003 resulted in an after tax charge of $50 million, which was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles. The adoption increased net PP&E by $73 million, increased asset retirement obligations by $151 million and decreased deferred tax liabilities by $28 million. 34 EITF Issue No. 02 3 In October 2002, Occidental adopted certain provisions of EITF Issue No. 02 3, "Issues involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities." As a result of adopting EITF Issue No. 02 3, there were no changes to gross margins, net income, cash flow, or earnings per share for any period; however, net sales and cost of sales were reduced by equal and offsetting amounts to reflect the adoption of this requirement. From 1999 to 2002, Occidental accounted for certain energy trading contracts in accordance with EITF Issue No. 98 10, "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities." EITF Issue No. 98 10 required that all energy trading contracts must be marked to fair value with gains and losses included in earnings, whether the contracts were derivatives or not. In October 2002, the EITF rescinded EITF Issue No. 98 10 thus precluding mark to market accounting for all energy trading contracts that are not derivatives and fair value accounting for inventories purchased from third parties. Also, the rescission requires derivative gains and losses to be presented net on the income statement, whether or not they are physically settled, if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes. Occidental adopted this accounting change in the first quarter of 2003 and recorded an $18 million after tax charge as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles. DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES AND MARKET RISK General Occidentals market risk exposures relate primarily to commodity prices and, to a lesser extent, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Occidental periodically enters into derivative instrument transactions to reduce these price and rate fluctuations. A derivative is an instrument that, among other characteristics, derives its value from changes in another instrument or variable. In general, the fair value recorded for derivative instruments is based on quoted market prices, dealer quotes and the Black Scholes or similar valuation models. Commodity Price Risk General Occidentals results are sensitive to fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices. Based on current levels of production, if oil prices vary overall by $1 per barrel, it would have an estimated annual effect on pre tax income of approximately $150 million. If natural gas prices vary by $0.25 per Mcf, it would have an estimated annual effect on pre tax income of approximately $42 million. If production levels change in the future, the sensitivity of Occidentals results to oil and gas prices also would change. Occidentals results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices; however, changes in cost usually offset part of the effect of price changes on margins. If chlorine and caustic soda prices vary by $10/ton, it would have approximately a $15 million and $30 million, respectively, pre tax annual effect on income. If PVC prices vary by $.01/lb, it would have approximately a $25 million pre tax annual effect on income. If EDC prices vary by $10/ton, it would have approximately a $5 million pre tax annual effect on income. Historically, price changes either precede or follow raw material and feedstock price changes; therefore, the margin improvement of price changes can be mitigated. According to Chemical Market Associates, Inc., December 2005 average contract prices were: chlorine $358/ton, caustic soda $455/ton, PVC $0.645/lb and EDC $250/ton. Marketing and Trading Operations Occidental periodically uses different types of derivative instruments to achieve the best prices for oil and gas. Derivatives are also used by Occidental to reduce its exposure to price volatility and to mitigate fluctuations in commodity related cash flows. Occidental enters into low risk marketing and trading activities through its separate marketing organization, which operates under established policy controls and procedures. With respect to derivatives used in its oil and gas marketing operations, Occidental utilizes a combination of futures, forwards, options and swaps to offset various physical transactions. Occidentals use of derivatives in marketing and trading activities relates primarily to managing cash flows from third party purchases, which includes Occidentals periodic gas storage activities. Risk Management Occidental conducts its risk management activities for energy commodities (which include buying, selling, marketing, trading, and hedging activities) under the controls and governance of its Risk Control Policy. The Chief Financial Officer and the Risk Management Committee, comprising members of Occidentals management, oversee these controls, which are implemented and enforced by the Trading Control Officer. The Trading Control Officer provides an independent and separate check on results of marketing and trading activities. Controls for energy commodities include limits on credit, limits on trading, segregation of duties, delegation of authority and a number of other policy and procedural controls. Fair Value of Marketing and Trading Derivative Contracts The following tables reconcile the changes in the net fair value of Occidentals marketing and trading contracts, a portion of which are hedges, during 2005 and 2004 and segregate the open contracts at December 31, 2005 by maturity periods. In millions 2005 2004 Fair value of contracts outstanding at beginning of year $ 30 $ 32 Losses (gains) on changes for contracts realized or otherwise settled during the year 56 (94 ) Changes in fair value attributable to changes in valuation techniques and assumptions (Losses) gains or other changes in fair value (543 ) (a) 92 Fair value of contracts outstanding at end of year $ (457 ) $ 30 (a) Primarily relates to production hedges. 35 Maturity Periods Source of Fair Value 2006 2007 to 2008 2009 to 2010 2011 and thereafter Total Fair Value Prices actively quoted $ (42 ) $ (42 ) $ 4 $ 5 $ (75 ) Prices provided by other external sources 1 (15 ) 7 (4 ) (11 ) Prices based on models and other valuation methods (a) (42 ) (133 ) (137 ) (59 ) (371 ) TOTAL $ (83 ) $ (190 ) $ (126 ) $ (58 ) $ (457 ) (a) The underlying prices utilized for the 2006 and 2007 fair value calculation of the options are based on monthly NYMEX published prices. The underlying prices for years 2008 through 2011 are based on the year end NYMEX published prices, as published monthly prices are not available. These prices are input into an industry standard options pricing model to determine fair value. Production Hedges During the first quarter of 2005, Occidental entered into a series of fixed price swaps and costless collar agreements that qualify as cash flow hedges for the sale of its crude oil production. These hedges, which began in July 2005 and continue to the end of 2011, hedge less than 4 percent of Occidentals 2005 crude oil production. Information about these cash flow hedges, which are included in the total fair value of ($457) million in the table above, is presented in a tabular presentation below. Crude Oil Fixed Price Swaps Crude Oil Costless Collars (Volumes in MBL/day) Daily Volume Average Price Daily Volume Average Floor Average Cap 2006 10 $41.61 6 $41.33 $48.05 2007 8 $40.04 7 $40.43 $45.21 2008 14 $34.07 $47.47 2009 13 $33.15 $47.41 2010 12 $33.00 $46.35 2011 12 $32.92 $46.27 ($ millions) Crude Oil Fixed Price Swaps Crude Oil Costless Collars Total Fair Value Liability (a) ($142) ($362) ($504) (a) Fair value at December 31, 2005 Quantitative Information Occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commodity based derivatives and commodity contracts used in marketing and trading activities. This method determines the maximum potential negative short term change in fair value with a 95 percent level of confidence. The marketing and trading value at risk was immaterial during all of 2005. Interest Rate Risk General Occidentals exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to its long term debt obligations. In 2005, Occidental terminated all of its interest rate swaps that were accounted for as fair value hedges. These hedges had effectively converted approximately $1.7 billion of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. The fair value of the swaps at termination resulted in a gain of approximately $20 million, which is being amortized into income over the remaining life of the previously hedged debt. The amount of interest expense recorded in the income statement was lower, as a result of the swaps and amortization of the deferred gain, by approximately $21 million, $56 million and $58 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Occidental was a party to a series of forward interest rate locks, which qualified as cash flow hedges. The hedges were related to the construction of a cogeneration plant leased by Occidental that was completed in December 2002. The unamortized loss on the hedges at December 31, 2005 was approximately $19 million after tax, which is recorded in accumulated OCI and is being recognized in earnings over the lease term of 26 years on a straight line basis. Certain of Occidentals equity investees have entered into additional derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges. Occidental reflects its proportionate share of these cash flow hedges in OCI. Tabular Presentation of Interest Rate Risk In millions of U.S. dollars, except rates The table below provides information about Occidentals debt obligations which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Debt amounts represent principal payments by maturity date.

Creditworthiness is reviewed before doing business with a new counterparty and on an ongoing basis. Occidental monitors aggregated counterparty exposure relative to credit limits, and manages credit enhancement issues. Credit exposure for each customer is monitored for outstanding balances, current month activity, and forward mark to market exposure and losses associated with credit risk have been immaterial. Foreign Currency Risk A few of Occidentals foreign operations have currency risk. Occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions only at levels necessary for operating purposes. Most international crude oil sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Additionally, all of Occidentals oil and gas consolidated foreign entities have the U.S. dollar as the functional currency. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, Occidental had not entered into any foreign currency derivative instruments. The effect of exchange rate transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income and is immaterial.
