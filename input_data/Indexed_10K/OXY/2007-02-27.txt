ITEM 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) (Incorporating Item 7A) In this report, the term "Occidental" refers to Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OPC) and or one or more entities in which it owns a majority voting interest (subsidiaries). Occidentals business is divided into two segments conducted through oil and gas subsidiaries and their affiliates and chemical subsidiaries and their affiliates (OxyChem). STRATEGY General Occidental aims to generate superior total returns to stockholders using the following strategy: &Oslash; Focus on large, long lived oil and gas assets with long term growth potential; &Oslash; Maintain financial discipline and a strong balance sheet; and &Oslash; Manage the chemical segment to provide cash in excess of normal capital expenditures. Occidental prefers to own large, long lived "legacy" oil and gas assets, like those in California and the Permian Basin, that tend to have moderate decline rates, enhanced secondary and tertiary recovery opportunities and economies of scale that lead to cost effective production. Management expects such assets to contribute substantially to earnings and cash flow after invested capital. At Occidental, maintaining financial discipline means investing capital in projects that management expects will generate above cost of capital returns throughout the business cycle. During periods of high commodity prices, Occidental expects to use most of its cash flow after capital expenditures and dividends to improve the potential for future earnings by making such investments. The chemical business is not managed with a growth strategy. Capital is expended to operate the chemical business in a safe and environmentally sound way, to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects 9 designed to lower manufacturing costs. Asset acquisitions may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chlor alkali and PVC businesses. Historically, the chemical segment has generated cash flow exceeding its normal capital expenditure requirements. Occidental intends to invest this cash mainly in strategically attractive assets. Oil and Gas Segment Income ($ millions) The oil and gas business seeks to add new oil and natural gas reserves at a pace ahead of production while keeping costs incurred for finding and development among the lowest in the industry. The oil and gas business implements this strategy within the limits of the overall corporate strategy primarily by: &Oslash; Continuing to add commercial reserves through a combination of focused exploration and development programs conducted in and around Occidentals core areas, which are the United States, the Middle East/North Africa and Latin America; &Oslash; Pursuing commercial opportunities in core areas to enhance the development of mature fields with large volumes of remaining oil by applying appropriate technology and advanced reservoir management practices; and &Oslash; Maintaining a disciplined approach in buying and selling assets at attractive prices. Over the past several years, Occidental has strengthened its asset base within each of the core areas. Occidental has invested in, and disposed of, assets with the goal of raising the average performance and potential of its assets. See "Oil and Gas Segment Business Review" for a discussion of these changes. In addition, Occidental has continued to make capital contributions and investments in the Dolphin Project in Qatar and the UAE and in Libya, and assumed operations in the Mukhaizna field in Oman for future growth opportunities, not for current production. In 2006, Occidental acquired Vintage Petroleum, Inc. (Vintage) which it expects to provide growth in production, primarily from the Vintage Argentina assets. Occidentals overall performance during the past several years reflects the successful implementation of its strategy to enhance the development of mature fields, beginning with the acquisition of the Elk Hills oil and gas field in California, followed by a series of purchases in the Permian Basin in west Texas and New Mexico and the integration of the Vintage and Plains Exploration and Production Company (Plains) operations acquired in 2006. At the end of 2006, the Elk Hills and Permian assets made up 64 percent of Occidentals consolidated proven oil reserves and 43 percent of its consolidated proven gas reserves. On a barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) basis, they accounted for 59 percent of Occidentals consolidated reserves. In 2006, the combined production from these assets averaged approximately 290,000 BOE per day. Chemical Segment Income ($ millions) OxyChems strategy is to be a low cost producer so that it can maximize its cash flow generation. OxyChem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain beginning with chlorine, which is coproduced with caustic soda, and then chlorine and ethylene are converted, through a series of intermediate products, into polyvinyl chloride (PVC). OxyChems focus on chlorovinyls permits it to take advantage of economies of scale. Key Performance Indicators General Occidental seeks to ensure that it meets its strategic goals by continuously measuring its success in maintaining below average debt levels and top quartile performance compared to its peers in: &Oslash; Total return to stockholders; &Oslash; Return on equity; &Oslash; Return on capital employed; and &Oslash; Other segment specific measurements such as profit per unit produced, cost to produce each unit, cash flow per unit, cost to find and develop new reserves, reserve replacement percentage and other similar measures. 10 Debt Structure Occidentals total debt and total debt to capitalization ratios are shown in the table below: Date ($ amounts in millions) Total Debt (a) Total Debt to Capitalization Ratio 12/31/02 $ 4,759 43% 12/31/03 $ 4,570 37% 12/31/04 $ 3,905 27% 12/31/05 $ 3,019 17% 12/31/06 $ 2,890 13% (a) Includes trust preferred securities (redeemed January 20, 2004), natural gas delivery commitment (terminated in 2002), subsidiary preferred stock and capital lease obligations. As shown, Occidentals year end 2006 total debt to capitalization ratio declined to 13 percent from the 43 percent level that existed at the end of 2002. The decrease in the total debt to capitalization ratio in 2006 compared with 2002 resulted from total debt reductions of 39 percent combined with an increase in stockholders equity of 204 percent over the same period. Since the second quarter of 2005, Occidentals long term senior unsecured debt has been rated A by Standard and Poors Corporation, A3 by Moodys Investors Service, A by Fitch Ratings and A(Low) by Dominion Bond Rating Service. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Return on Equity Annual 2006 (a) Three Year Average 2004 2006 (b) 24% 30% (a) The Return on Equity for 2006 was calculated by dividing Occidentals 2006 earnings applicable to common stock by the average equity balance in 2006. (b) The three year average Return on Equity was calculated by dividing the average earnings applicable to common stock over the three year period 2004 2006 by the average equity balance over the same period. Occidental has focused on achieving top quartile return on equity. In 2006, Occidentals return on equity was 24 percent and the three year average return on equity was 30 percent. During the same three year period, Occidental increased its stockholders equity by 142 percent and its quarterly dividend by 60 percent while its stock price increased by 131 percent. OIL AND GAS SEGMENT Business Environment Oil and gas prices are the major variables that drive the industrys short and intermediate term financial performance. Average yearly oil prices strengthened in 2006 over 2005 levels but ended the year even with 2005 year end levels. During the year, Occidental experienced an increase in its price differential between the average West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price and Occidentals realized prices. Occidentals realized price as a percentage of WTI was approximately 85 percent and 87 percent for 2006 and 2005, respectively. Prices and differentials can vary significantly, even on a short term basis, making it difficult to forecast realized prices. The average WTI market price for 2006 was $66.23 per barrel compared with $56.56 per barrel in 2005. Occidentals average realized price for oil in 2006 was $56.57, compared with $49.18 in 2005. The average NYMEX domestic natural gas prices decreased approximately 4 percent from 2005. For 2006, NYMEX gas prices averaged $7.82/Mcf compared with $8.11/Mcf for 2005. Business Review All production and reserve figures are net to Occidental unless otherwise specified. Worldwide Production (thousands BOE/day) Acquisitions In January 2006, Occidental completed the merger of Vintage into a wholly owned Occidental subsidiary. As a result, Occidental acquired assets in Argentina, California, Yemen, Bolivia and the Permian Basin in Texas. See the applicable sections below for further information. Occidental paid $1.3 billion in cash to former Vintage shareholders, issued approximately 56 million shares of Occidental common stock, which were valued at $2.1 billion, and assumed Vintages debt, which had an estimated fair value of $585 million at closing. During 2006, Occidental divested a portion of Vintages assets for consideration of approximately $1.0 billion. In September 2006, Occidental acquired oil and gas assets from Plains for $859 million. The principal properties acquired are adjacent to Occidentals existing operations in California and the Permian Basin in west Texas. Occidentals production from the Vintage acquisition averaged 53,000 BOE per day in 2006. During the fourth quarter of 2006, production from the Plains assets averaged 6,000 BOE per day. Elk Hills Occidental operates the Elk Hills oil and gas field in the southern portion of Californias San Joaquin Valley with an approximate 78 percent interest. The field was acquired in 1998 for $3.5 billion and is the largest producer of gas in California. In 2006, Occidental made additional acquisitions of oil and gas producing properties near the field for approximately $434 million. Most of these properties were obtained as part of the acquisition from Plains discussed above. Oil and gas production in 2006 from these properties and the field was approximately 91,000 BOE per day. During 2006, Occidental performed infill drilling, field extensions and recompletions identified by advanced reservoir characterization techniques resulting in 277 new wells being drilled and 479 wells being worked over. In addition, an air separation unit was installed to enhance 11 oil recovery with nitrogen injection. As a result of these activities and acquisitions, Occidental was able to maintain production at 2005 levels. Since its acquisition, total Elk Hills oil and gas production has been approximately 301 million BOE. At the end of 2006, the property had an estimated 484 million BOE of proved reserves, compared to the 425 million BOE that were recorded at the time of the acquisition. Permian Basin The Permian Basin extends throughout southwest Texas and southeast New Mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the United States, with the entire basin accounting for approximately 18 percent of the total United States oil production. Occidental is the largest producer in the Permian Basin with an approximate 16 percent net share of the total Permian Basin oil production. Occidental also produces and processes natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) in the Permian Basin. Most of Occidentals Permian Basin interests were obtained through the acquisition of Altura in 2000 for approximately $3.6 billion. In 2005 and 2006, Occidental made several additional acquisitions of oil and gas producing property interests for approximately $1.7 billion and $290 million (including approximately $175 million related to the acquisition of Vintage and the property acquisitions from Plains), respectively. Occidentals total share of Permian Basin oil, gas and NGL production averaged 199,000 BOE per day in 2006 compared to 189,000 BOE per day in 2005. At the end of 2006, Occidentals Permian Basin properties had 1.2 billion BOE in proved reserves. Occidentals Permian Basin production is diversified across a large number of producing areas. The largest producing areas in 2006 included Wasson San Andres, Slaughter, Levelland, North Cowden, Wasson Clearfork and Salt Creek, which contributed 20 percent, 9 percent, 5 percent, 4 percent, 4 percent and 4 percent, respectively, to Occidentals 2006 Permian BOE production. Occidentals interests in the Permian Basin offer additional development and exploitation potential. During 2006, Occidental drilled approximately 260 wells on its operated properties and participated in wells drilled on outside operated interests. Occidental conducted significant development activity on eight carbon dioxide (CO2) projects during 2006, including implementation of new floods and expansion of existing CO2 floods. Occidental also focused on improving the performance of existing wells. Occidental had an average of 122 well service units working in the Permian area during 2006 performing well maintenance and workovers. Approximately 60 percent of Occidentals Permian Basin oil production is from fields that actively employ the application of CO2 flood technology, an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technique. This involves injecting CO2 into oil reservoirs where it acts as a solvent, causing the oil to flow more freely into producing wells. These CO2 flood operations make Occidental a world leader in the application of this technology. Vintage California In 2006, Occidental combined its California properties acquired from Vintage and Plains with existing California properties (excluding the Elk Hills, THUMS and Tidelands Oil Production Company (Tidelands) properties). The combined properties produce oil and gas from more than 50 fields, spread over 500 miles mainly in the Ventura, San Joaquin and Sacramento basins. Oil and gas average production in 2006 was approximately 17,000 BOE per day. At the end of 2006, the combined properties had an estimated 128 million BOE of proved reserves. THUMS Occidental purchased THUMS, the field contractor for an oil production unit offshore Long Beach, California, in 2000. Since then, Occidental has implemented a successful development plan. Occidentals share of production from THUMS is subject to contractual arrangements similar to a production sharing contract (PSC), whereby Occidentals share of production varies inversely with oil prices. For 2006, production from THUMS averaged 19,000 BOE per day. Gulf of Mexico Occidental has a one third interest in the deep water Horn Mountain oil field, which is Occidentals only property in the Gulf of Mexico. BP p.l.c. (BP) is the operator. For 2006, Occidentals production at Horn Mountain averaged 13,000 BOE per day. Hugoton and Other Occidental owns a large concentration of gas reserves, production interests and royalty interests in the Hugoton area of Kansas and Oklahoma. Also, Occidental has over 28,000 net acres in the Piceance Basin in western Colorado. During 2006, Occidental drilled 43 development wells and started operation of a newly constructed gas processing facility. Occidental acquired Tidelands in 2006. Tidelands is the field contractor for an onshore oil production unit in Long Beach, California. Occidentals share of production from Tidelands is subject to contractual arrangements similar to a PSC, whereby Occidentals share of production varies inversely with oil prices. Tidelands also is subject to cost plus contracts. Occidentals Hugoton and other operations produced 26,000 BOE per day. Middle East/North Africa Dolphin Project Occidentals investment in the Dolphin Project, which was acquired in 2002, consists of two separate economic interests held through two separate legal entities. One entity, OXY Dolphin E&P, LLC, owns a 24.5 percent undivided interest in the assets and liabilities associated with a Development and Production Sharing Agreement (DPSA) with the Government of Qatar to develop and produce natural gas and condensate in Qatars North Field for 25 years from the start of production, with a provision to request a 5 year extension. The purchase price of the undivided working interest in the DPSA was approximately $60 million and was recorded in property, plant & equipment (PP&E). This undivided interest is proportionately consolidated in Occidentals financial statements. A second entity, OXY Dolphin Pipeline, LLC, owns 24.5 percent of the stock of Dolphin Energy Limited (Dolphin Energy). The purchase price of Dolphin Energy stock totaled approximately $250 million and was recorded as an equity investment. 12 Dolphin Energy is the operator under the DPSA on behalf of the three DPSA participants, including Occidental. Dolphin Energy also has the rights to build, own and operate a 260 mile long, 48 inch natural gas pipeline, which will transport dry natural gas from Qatar to the UAE. The Dolphin Project is expected to cost approximately $4.8 billion in total, including investments in the local UAE eastern gas distribution system and the Al Ain Fujairah pipelines, which were added to improve the natural gas distribution system but were not contained in the original scope of the Dolphin Project. Occidental expects to invest approximately $1.2 billion of this total. The project is being financed by a combination of participant investment and project financing. During 2007, Occidental expects to spend a combined total of approximately $185 million for the gas exploration and development activity and the investment in Dolphin Energy, compared to $361 million in 2006. In 2003, the Government of Qatar approved the final field development plan for the Dolphin Project. Construction of an onshore gas processing and compression plant at Ras Laffan in Qatar commenced in 2004 and is continuing. The pipeline is projected to start up with temporary third party gas volumes in the first quarter of 2007. The gas volumes produced under the Dolphin DPSA are expected to replace the temporary third party gas commencing with the start up of the onshore gas plant in mid 2007. Based on existing supply contracts, the Dolphin Project is expected to export approximately 2.0 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas per day (plus associated liquids and byproducts). However, the pipeline is expected to have capacity to transport up to 3.2 Bcf of natural gas per day. Demand for natural gas in the UAE and Oman continues to grow and Dolphin Energys customers have requested additional gas supplies. To help fulfill this growing demand, Dolphin Energy will continue to pursue an agreement to secure an additional supply of gas from Qatar. To date, Occidental has recorded 265 million BOE of proved oil and gas reserves for the Dolphin Project DPSA activity. Proved developed, non producing oil and gas reserves are 133 million BOE, with the rest included in proved undeveloped reserves. No revenue or production costs were recorded in 2006 for the Dolphin Project gas exploration and development activity. Qatar In addition to the Dolphin Project, Occidental participates in two production projects in Qatar: Idd El Shargi North Dome (ISND) and Idd El Shargi South Dome (ISSD). Occidental continues to target the development and recovery of additional reserves in both the ISND and ISSD fields by applying advanced drilling systems and improved reservoir management techniques. Capital expenditures in Qatar for the ISSD and ISND projects were $257 million in 2006. Occidentals net share of combined production from the two fields averaged 43,000 barrels per day in 2006. Yemen Occidental owns interests in four blocks in Yemen, including a 38 percent direct working interest in the Masila fields, a 40.4 percent interest in the East Shabwa field, comprising a 28.6 percent direct working interest and an 11.8 percent equity interest in an unconsolidated entity, and a 75 percent interest in Block S 1, which was part of the Vintage acquisition. Average production was 30,000 barrels of oil per day in 2006, with 19,000 coming from Masila, 6,500 from East Shabwa and the remainder from Block S 1. In addition, Occidental owns and operates an 80 percent working interest in Block 20 and is finalizing the PSC for Block 75, which was acquired in an exploration bid round. Oman Occidentals Oman business includes Block 9 and Block 27, where it holds a 65 percent working interest in each, Block 53, where it holds a 45 percent working interest and Block 54, where it holds a 70 percent working interest. Occidental is the operator of all four blocks where production averaged 23,000 BOE per day in 2006, with 19,000 BOE coming from Block 9, 3,000 BOE from Block 53 and the remainder from Block 27. The Block 9 agreement provides for two ten year extensions and Occidental has agreed with the Government of Oman to the first ten year extension through December 7, 2015. Occidental (and its Block 53 partners) signed a new PSC for the Mukhaizna field with the Government of Oman in 2005. In September 2005, Occidental assumed operations of the Mukhaizna field, where it holds a 45 percent working interest. The Mukhaizna field, located in Omans south central interior, was discovered in 1975 and was brought into production in 2000. Primary production peaked in the same year at 15,000 barrels of oil per day and by September 2005, had declined to 8,500 barrels of oil per day. By the end of 2006, Occidental had increased gross production to 11,000 barrels of oil per day. Occidental plans to use horizontal well steamflood technology to steadily increase production. In October 2005, Occidental received approval for development of the Khamilah field in Block 27. The exploitation term of the agreement is 30 years beginning in September 2005. Occidental began production in June 2006, well ahead of the planned start up timing of October 2006. Occidental (and its Block 54 partners) signed a new PSC for Block 54 with the Government of Oman in June 2006. The initial exploration phase is four years beginning in July 2006. In March 2004, Occidental began selling gas from Block 9 to the Government of Oman under a gas sales agreement. Under the agreement, Occidental (and its Block 9 partner) must supply approximately 114 MMcf per day of natural gas until December 31, 2007. Occidentals minimum delivery obligation is approximately 89 percent of the expected average gross production. In 2006, Occidental (and its partner) supplied an average of approximately 116 MMcf per day of natural gas under the agreement. As of December 31, 2006, the gross proved gas reserves from Block 9 comprise approximately 590 percent of the minimum gas still to be delivered under the agreement. Libya Occidental suspended all activities in Libya in 1986 as a result of economic sanctions imposed by the United States government. During the imposition of sanctions, Occidental derived no economic benefit from its Libyan interests. In 2004, the United States government lifted all of the principal economic sanctions against Libya. 13 In 2006, the United States effectively eliminated the last of the economic sanctions. In 2005, the Libyan authorities approved the terms of Occidentals participation in the assets that it left in 1986. This re entry agreement allowed Occidental to return to its Libyan operations on generally the same terms in effect when activities were suspended. Those assets consist of three producing contracts in the Sirte Basin and four exploration blocks. Occidental paid approximately $133 million in re entry bonuses, capital adjustment and work in progress payments and is required to pay $10 million per year while it continues to operate in Libya, as reimbursements for past development costs associated with these assets. In addition, Occidental committed to spend $90 million over the next five years in the four exploration blocks. Currently, Occidentals rights in the producing fields extend through 2009 and early 2010. Occidental had its first lifting from its Libyan operations in September 2005 and production during 2006 averaged 23,000 BOE per day. Separately, in early 2005, Occidental participated in the EPSA IV exploration bid round in Libya. Occidental successfully bid on nine of the 15 areas available. Occidental is the operator for five onshore areas and has a 90 percent exploration working interest in each area. In addition, Occidental holds a 35 percent exploration working interest in four offshore areas. Woodside Petroleum Ltd. is the operator for the offshore areas. Occidental paid approximately $90 million in exploration lease bonuses for these nine new areas and committed to perform a minimum exploration work program valued at $125 million over the commitment period. In 2006, approximately 10,000 kilometers of seismic data was acquired for the onshore areas which will provide the basis for analysis and selection of the initial exploration prospects to be drilled by Occidental. Onshore seismic acquisition and analysis activity is planned to continue into 2007. In the offshore areas, the operator acquired approximately 9,400 kilometers of seismic data in preparation for the planned 2007 drilling program. In November 2006, Occidental commenced drilling of the first exploration well in the onshore program, which is undergoing evaluation. A second rig is expected to begin drilling in the first quarter of 2007 and a substantial portion of the exploration drilling obligations is expected to be completed during the next 18 month period. Other Eastern Hemisphere Pakistan Occidental holds oil and gas working interests, that vary from 25 to 50 percent, in four Badin Blocks in Pakistan. BP is the operator. Occidentals share of production was approximately 17,000 BOE per day in 2006. Russia In January 2007, Occidental sold its 50 percent interest in the Vanyoganneft joint venture to TNK BP for approximately $485 million. At year end, Occidentals proved Vanyoganneft reserves were an estimated 33 million BOE and its production was approximately 27,000 BOE per day in 2006. Occidental recorded a gain of approximately $400 million resulting from the sale in the first quarter of 2007. Latin America Argentina Substantially all of Occidentals Argentina assets were obtained as part of the acquisition of Vintage in 2006. The assets consist of 22 concessions, 19 of which Occidental operates with a 100 percent working interest, located in the San Jorge Basin in Southern Argentina and the Cuyo Basin and Neuqun Basin in Western Argentina. During 2006, Occidental drilled 135 new wells and performed a number of recompletions and well repairs. Occidental expects to significantly increase production over the next five years through aggressive drilling, waterflooding and EOR projects. Occidental is planning to drill 190 wells and implement a number of waterflood projects in 2007. Occidentals share of production from Argentina averaged 36,000 BOE per day in 2006. Bolivia In 2006, Occidentals operating subsidiary acquired working interests in four Blocks located in the Tarija, Chuquisaca and Santa Cruz regions of Bolivia as part of the Vintage acquisition. Production for 2006 was approximately 3,000 BOE per day. In 2006, Bolivia initiated a nationalization process pursuant to which Occidentals operating subsidiary entered into two new operations contracts with commercial terms that, among other things, provide Bolivia greater operational control and control over the commercialization of hydrocarbons. Colombia Occidental is the operator of the Cao Limn field where its share of production averaged 28,000 barrels of oil per day in 2006. Colombias national oil company, Ecopetrol, operates the Cao Limn Coveas oil pipeline and marine export terminal. The pipeline transports oil produced from the Cao Limn field for export to international markets. In 2005, Ecopetrol approved development of the Caricare field, an exploration discovery under the Rondon Association Contract, adjacent to Cao Limn. Production from this field, where Occidental holds a 35 percent working interest, commenced in May 2006. Production from the field and two adjacent fields was 4,000 BOE per day in 2006. In 2005, Occidental signed a new agreement with Ecopetrol for an EOR project in the La Cira Infantas field, located in central Colombia. In December 2006, Occidental completed the second pilot phase and agreed with Ecopetrol to enter into a third and commercial phase of the project. In 2006, Occidentals share of production was 1,000 BOE per day. Production from La Cira Infantas is transported by the Ecopetrol pipeline and sold to an Ecopetrol refinery. Additionally, Occidental holds various working interests in eight exploration blocks. 14 Ecuador In May 2006, Ecuador terminated Occidentals contract for the operation of Block 15, which comprised all of its oil producing operations in the country, and seized Occidentals Block 15 assets. The process resulting in this action began shortly after Occidental prevailed, by unanimous decision of an international arbitration panel subsequently upheld by a London court, in a legal dispute over tax refunds that Ecuador wrongfully withheld. Occidental immediately filed an arbitration claim against Ecuador, seeking redress for illegal confiscation of the Block 15 operations with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes in Washington, D.C., invoking the protections of the U.S. Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty. As a result of the seizure, Occidental classified its Block 15 operations as discontinued operations. In 2006, Occidental recorded a net after tax charge of $296 million in discontinued operations. This amount consists of after tax charges for the write off of the investment in Block 15 in Ecuador, as well as ship or pay obligations entered into with respect to the Oleoducto de Crudos Pesados, Ltd. (OCP) pipeline in Ecuador to ship oil produced in Block 15, partially offset by $109 million after tax income from operations for the first five months of 2006. Occidentals Block 15 assets and liabilities are classified as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheets on a retrospective basis. In addition, Occidental has a 14 percent interest in the OCP oil export pipeline. See also "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Ecuador" for further information about the OCP pipeline. Production Sharing Contracts Occidental conducts its operations in Qatar, Oman and Yemen under PSCs and, under such contracts, receives a share of production to recover its costs and an additional share for profit. In addition, Occidentals share of production from THUMS and Tidelands are subject to contractual arrangements similar to a PSC. Occidentals share of production from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise and increases when oil prices decline. Overall, Occidentals net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices. Proved Reserves Evaluation and Review Process A senior corporate officer of Occidental is responsible for the internal audit and review of its oil and gas reserves data. In addition, a Corporate Reserves Review Committee (Reserves Committee) has been established, consisting of senior corporate officers, to monitor and review Occidentals oil and gas reserves. The Reserves Committee reports to the Audit Committee of Occidentals Board of Directors periodically throughout the year. Occidental has retained Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott), independent petroleum engineering consultants, to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes since 2004. Again in 2006, Ryder Scott has compared Occidentals methods and procedures for estimating oil and gas reserves to generally accepted industry standards and has reviewed certain data, methods and procedures used in estimating reserves volumes, the economic evaluations and reserves classifications. Ryder Scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for a selection of oil and gas fields considered to be a valid representation of Occidentals total reserves portfolio. In 2006, Ryder Scott reviewed 10.5 percent of Occidentals oil and gas reserves. Since being engaged in 2004, Ryder Scott has reviewed Occidentals reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately 49 percent of Occidentals oil and gas reserves. Based on this review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, Ryder Scott has concluded that the methodologies used by Occidental in preparing the relevant estimates generally comply with current Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) standards. Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reserves volumes reported by Occidental. Proved Reserve Additions Occidental consolidated subsidiaries had proved reserves at year end 2006 of 2,869 million BOE, as compared with the year end 2005 amount of 2,566 million BOE. Additionally, Occidentals investments in other interests had proved reserves of 30 million and 45 million BOE at year end 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in the consolidated subsidiaries reserves from all sources was 518 million BOE, of which 289 million BOE were from proved developed reserves and 229 million BOE were from proved undeveloped reserves. Proved developed reserves represent approximately 78 percent of Occidentals total proved reserves at year end 2006 compared to 74 percent at year end 2005. Proved Reserve Additions Consolidated Subsidiaries 2006 In Millions of BOE Proved Developed Proved Undeveloped Proved Total Revisions of previous estimates (5 ) 22 17 Improved Recovery 40 101 141 Extensions and Discoveries 22 12 34 Purchases 232 94 326 Total Additions 289 229 518 Proved reserves consist of 78 percent crude oil and condensate and 22 percent natural gas. Revisions of Previous Estimates In 2006, Occidental added net reserves of 17 million BOE through revisions of previous estimates, primarily in Libya, the Dolphin Project and Argentina, partially offset by negative revisions in the United States reflecting a reduction in gas prices. Oil price changes would affect proved reserves recorded by Occidental. For example, if oil prices increased by $5 per barrel, less oil volume is required to recover costs, and PSCs would reduce Occidentals share of proved reserves by approximately 9 million BOE. Conversely, if oil prices dropped by $5 per barrel, Occidentals share of proved reserves would increase by a similar amount. Oil price changes would also tend to affect the economic lives of proved reserves from other contracts, in a manner partially offsetting the PSC reserve volume changes. Apart from the effects of product prices, Occidentals approach to interpreting technical data regarding oil and gas reserves makes it more likely future reserve revisions will be positive rather than negative. 15 Improved Recovery In 2006, Occidental added reserves of 141 million BOE through improved recovery. In the United States, improved recovery additions were 43 million BOE in the Permian Basin and 28 million BOE in the Elk Hills field. Foreign additions included 23 million BOE in Argentina and 11 million BOE in Colombia. The Elk Hills operations employ infill drilling and both gas flood and water flood techniques. In the Permian Basin, the increased reserves were primarily attributable to enhanced recovery techniques, such as drilling additional CO2 flood and water flood wells. Extensions and Discoveries Occidental obtains reserve additions from extensions and discoveries, which are dependent on successful exploitation programs. In 2006, as a result of such programs, Occidental added reserves of 34 million BOE, consisting of 13 million BOE in the United States, 14 million BOE in the Middle East/North Africa and 7 million BOE in Argentina. In western Colorado, Occidental added approximately 4 million BOE from the extension of gas reserves, most of which will require additional development capital. The success of improved recovery, extension and discovery projects depends on reservoir characteristics and technology improvements, as well as oil and gas prices, capital costs and operating costs. Many of these factors are outside of managements control, and will affect whether or not these historical sources of reserve additions continue at similar levels. Purchases of Proved Reserves In 2006, Occidental purchased reserves of 326 million BOE, of which 143 million BOE were in the United States and 178 million BOE were in Latin America. The Vintage acquisition added proved reserves of 160 million BOE in Argentina and 8 million BOE in Bolivia with the remainder in the United States and Yemen, of which 66 percent were proved developed reserves. Occidental continues to add reserves through acquisitions when properties are available at reasonable prices. Acquisitions are dependent on successful bidding and negotiating of oil and gas contracts at attractive terms. As market conditions change, the available supply of properties may increase or decrease accordingly. Proved Undeveloped Reserves Occidental had proved undeveloped reserve additions of 207 million BOE resulting from improved recovery, extensions and discoveries and purchases, primarily in Argentina, the Permian Basin and the Elk Hills field. Argentina provided 46 percent of this increase. These proved undeveloped reserve additions were offset by reserve transfers of 275 million BOE to the proved developed category as a result of 2006 development programs. The Dolphin Project transferred 133 million BOE to the proved developed category during 2006. This transfer, along with other revisions, reduced the Dolphin Projects proved undeveloped reserves to 132 million BOE at December 31, 2006 from 250 million BOE at December 31, 2005. Overall, Occidentals proved undeveloped reserves decreased by 47 million BOE in 2006. Industry Outlook The petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to numerous market forces. Crude oil and natural gas prices are affected by market fundamentals such as weather, inventory levels, competing fuel prices, overall demand and the availability of supply. Worldwide oil prices in 2006 remained at or near historical highs during the first three quarters of the year, but fell in the fourth quarter. Continued economic growth, resulting in increased demand, and concerns about supply availability, could result in continued high prices. A lower demand growth rate could result in lower crude oil prices. Oil prices have significantly affected profitability and returns for Occidental and other upstream producers. Oil prices cannot be predicted with any certainty. The WTI price has averaged approximately $33 per barrel over the past ten years. However, the industry has historically experienced wide fluctuations in prices. During 2006, Occidental experienced an increase in its price differential of the average WTI price over Occidentals realized prices. See the "Oil and Gas Segment Business Environment" section above for further information. While local supply/demand fundamentals are a decisive factor affecting domestic natural gas prices over the long term, day to day prices may be more volatile in the futures markets, such as on the NYMEX and other exchanges, making it difficult to forecast prices with any degree of confidence. Over the last ten years, the NYMEX gas price has averaged approximately $4.60 per Mcf. CHEMICAL SEGMENT Business Environment The chemical segment results improved in 2006 due to better margins despite higher feedstock costs. OxyChem also benefited from the mid year 2005 acquisition of two basic chemical manufacturing facilities from Vulcan Materials Company (Vulcan) and realized substantial synergies and higher sales volumes. Business Review Basic Chemicals During 2006, demand and pricing for basic chemical products generally remained strong while energy costs fell, which enabled OxyChem to realize above average margins. OxyChems chlor alkali operating rate for 2006 was 91 percent, just slightly above the industry average operating rate of 90 percent. Industry demand for liquid caustic soda in 2006 was virtually flat compared to the prior year. Demand increased in the refining industry but was offset by reduced demand primarily in the organics and inorganics chemical market segments. Industry pricing for caustic soda started the year strong, but subsequently softened throughout the first three quarters of 2006. Caustic soda supply tightened in the fourth quarter due to lower chlorine demand resulting from a weakening vinyls sector and lower imports of caustic soda. This led to caustic soda price stabilization in the fourth quarter. 16 Vinyls The PVC industry realized record level pricing and margins for 2006. Ethylene cost increases of 9 percent were partially offset by lower natural gas prices. Total PVC industry wide demand in 2006 was 3 percent lower as compared with 2005. OxyChem operated its PVC facilities at an average operating rate of 82 percent for 2006, compared to the North American industry average of 87 percent. Industry Outlook In 2006, Occidentals chemical business core earnings increased by 16 percent compared to 2005, primarily due to the continued strong United States economy, higher sales volumes, largely due to the full year impact of the Vulcan operating assets, and improving margins. Future performance will depend on global economic activity, the competitiveness of the United States in the world economy, feedstock and energy pricing, and the impact of additional production capacity entering the market place. Basic Chemicals Forecasts of a slowing economy offset by a stabilizing residential construction market in 2007 are expected to result in demand levels similar to average 2006 levels. Despite first quarter pressure on pricing from a weak vinyls market, margins in 2007 are expected to remain strong, but could weaken in the fourth quarter due to the anticipated impact of capacity additions in late 2007. Vinyls Industry wide PVC operating rates are expected to be lower in 2007 as a result of weak demand in the first quarter coupled with the start up of new capacity later in the year. Lower cost Far East Asian PVC production has resulted in a significant increase in imports of PVC and finished goods into the Western Hemisphere. CORPORATE AND OTHER Corporate and Other includes the investments in Lyondell Chemical Company (Lyondell) and Premcor, Inc., (Premcor), a leased cogeneration facility in Taft, Louisiana and a 1,300 mile oil pipeline and gathering system located in the Permian Basin, which is used in corporate directed oil and gas marketing and trading operations. It also includes a cogeneration facility at Ingleside, Texas, in which Occidental held a 50 percent interest, and acquired the remaining 50 percent interest in October 2006. The Premcor investment was sold in 2005. Since December 31, 2006, Occidental has resolved certain legal disputes that it expects will result in a gain of approximately $108 million in the first quarter of 2007. On August 1, 2006, Occidental effected a two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend to shareholders of record as of that date with distribution of the shares on August 15, 2006. All share and per share amounts discussed and disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10 K reflect the effect of the stock split. Lyondell In May 2006, Occidental lost significant influence over Lyondell and classified its Lyondell shares as an available for sale investment. In October 2006, Occidental sold 10 million shares of Lyondells common stock in a registered public offering for a pre tax gain of $90 million and gross proceeds of $250 million. At December 31, 2006, Occidental owned 20.3 million Lyondell shares of common stock (8 percent ownership), with a carrying value of $519 million, and warrants to purchase an additional five million shares of Lyondell common stock. In February 2007, Occidental exercised these warrants and received approximately 700,000 shares of Lyondell stock. Following this transaction, Occidental owned approximately 21 million shares of Lyondell common stock. Premcor Valero Energy Corp.s (Valero) acquisition of Premcor resulted in a $704 million pre tax gain and the subsequent sale of all of the Valero shares received resulted in an additional $22 million pre tax gain in 2005. SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of Occidentals two operating segments and corporate items should be read in conjunction with Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment earnings generally exclude income taxes, interest income, interest expense, environmental remediation expenses, unallocated corporate expenses, discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment assets and results and other earnings from the segments equity investments. 17 The following table sets forth the sales and earnings of each operating segment and corporate items: In millions, except per share amounts For the years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 SALES Oil and Gas $ 12,676 $ 9,805 $ 7,093 Chemical 4,815 4,641 3,675 Other (a) 170 151 111 $ 17,661 $ 14,597 $ 10,879 EARNINGS(LOSS) Oil and Gas (b) $ 7,239 $ 5,968 $ 4,021 Chemical (c) 901 607 414 8,140 6,575 4,435 Unallocated corporate items Interest expense, net (d) (131 ) (201 ) (240 ) Income taxes (e) (3,466 ) (1,927 ) (1,639 ) Other (f) (108 ) 593 (150 ) Income from continuing operations 4,435 5,040 2,406 Discontinued operations, net (g) (253 ) 238 162 Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, net 3 Net Income $ 4,182 $ 5,281 $ 2,568 Basic Earnings per Common Share $ 4.90 $ 6.55 $ 3.24 (a) These amounts represent revenue from a Taft, Louisiana cogeneration plant and the Permian Basin pipeline and gathering system.

(d) The 2006, 2005 and 2004 amounts include $31 million, $42 million and $17 million, respectively, of interest charges to redeem or purchase and retire various debt issues. (e) As a result of changes in compensation programs in 2006, Occidental wrote off approximately $40 million of the related deferred tax asset that had been recognized in the financial statements prior to the changes. The 2005 amount includes a $335 million tax benefit due to the reversal of tax reserves no longer required, a $619 million tax benefit resulting from a closing agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service resolving certain foreign tax credit issues and a $10 million charge related to a state income tax issue. The 2004 amount includes $47 million of credits related to tax settlements with the IRS. (f) The 2006 amount includes a $90 million pre tax gain from the sale of 10 million shares of Lyondell, a $108 million pre tax gain related to litigation settlements, $54 million of corporate equity method investment income and $47 million of environmental remediation expenses. The 2005 amount includes a $726 million pre tax gain from Valeros acquisition of Premcor and the subsequent sale of the Valero shares received, a $140 million pre tax gain from the sale of 11 million shares of Lyondell common stock, $71 million of corporate equity method investment income and $62 million of environmental remediation expense. The 2004 amount includes a $121 million pre tax gain on the issuance of Lyondell common stock, $12 million of corporate equity method investment income and $59 million of environmental remediation expense. (g) In the second quarter of 2006, Ecuadors Minister of Energy terminated Occidentals contract for the operation of Block 15 and the Government of Ecuador seized Occidentals Block 15 assets shortly thereafter. As a result of the seizure, Occidental has classified its Block 15 operations as discontinued operations on a retrospective application basis. The 2006 discontinued operations amount also includes income from Vintage properties that were held for sale. The 2004 amount also includes the specialty resins business that was classified as a discontinued operation in 2004.

(b) Natural gas volumes have been converted to equivalent BOE based on energy content of 6,000 cubic feet (one thousand cubic feet is referred to as a Mcf) of gas to one barrel of oil. (c) Sold in January 2007. (d) Occidental has classified its Ecuador Block 15 operations as discontinued operations on a retrospective application basis and excluded them from this table. Excluded production from the Block 15 operations averaged 43,000 BOE per day for the first five months of 2006, 42,000 BOE per day in 2005 and 46,000 BOE per day in 2004. (e) These prices exclude the impact of taxes owed by Occidental but paid by governmental entities on its behalf. (f) Includes dry hole write offs and lease impairments of $114 million in 2006, $220 million in 2005 and $155 million in 2004. (g) Includes capitalized portion of injected CO2 of $64 million, $59 million and $54 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Excludes acquisitions. Core earnings in 2006 were $7.2 billion, compared to $6.0 billion in 2005. The increase in core earnings is primarily due to higher crude oil prices and oil and gas production, partially offset by higher operating expenses, including a depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) increase, which was driven by higher volumes and rates. Core earnings in 2005 were $6.0 billion, compared with $4.0 billion in 2004. The increase in core earnings is primarily due to higher prices and volumes for crude oil and natural gas, partially offset by higher operating expenses, higher exploration expense and increased DD&A rates. Average consolidated production costs for 2006 were $11.23 per BOE, compared to the average 2005 production cost of $8.81 per BOE. At least 41 percent of the increase was a result of higher energy prices pushing up utility costs, gas plant costs and ad valorem and export taxes, and the impact on Occidentals PSCs of lower volumes due to higher energy prices. These cash operating cost increases included $0.57 per barrel for taxes and $0.33 per barrel for higher energy costs. The remaining increase of $1.52 per barrel was the result of higher workover, maintenance and lifting costs. Maintenance costs increased by $116 million, while workovers, ad valorem taxes and utilities each accounted for approximately $55 million in higher costs during 2006. Also, see "Production Sharing Contracts" above. Chemical In millions 2006 2005 2004 Segment Sales $ 4,815 $ 4,641 $ 3,675 Segment Earnings $ 901 $ 607 $ 414 Core Earnings (a) $ 901 $ 777 $ 414 Capital Expenditures $ 251 $ 173 $ 155 (a) For an explanation of core earnings and reconciliation to net income, see "Significant Items Affecting Earnings." Core earnings in 2006 were $901 million, compared to $777 million in 2005. The increase in core earnings is primarily due to higher margins in chlorine, caustic soda and PVC. Core earnings in 2005 were $777 million, compared with $414 million in 2004. The increase in core earnings is primarily due to higher margins resulting from higher prices for chlorine, caustic soda and PVC, partially offset by higher energy and feedstock costs. SIGNIFICANT ITEMS AFFECTING EARNINGS Occidentals results of operations often include the effects of significant transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount. Therefore, management uses a measure called "core earnings," which excludes those items. This non Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) measure is not meant to disassociate those items from managements performance, but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing Occidentals earnings performance between periods. Reported earnings are considered representative of managements performance over the long term. Core earnings is not considered to be an alternative to operating income in accordance with GAAP. 19 Significant Items Affecting Earnings Benefit (Charge) (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 NET INCOME $ 4,182 $ 5,281 $ 2,568 OIL AND GAS Segment Earnings $ 7,239 $ 5,968 $ 4,021 Less: Contract settlement (26 ) Hurricane insurance charge (18 ) Segment Core Earnings $ 7,239 $ 6,012 $ 4,021 CHEMICAL Segment Earnings $ 901 $ 607 $ 414 Less: Write off of plants (159 ) Hurricane insurance charge (11 ) Segment Core Earnings $ 901 $ 777 $ 414 TOTAL SEGMENT CORE EARNINGS $ 8,140 $ 6,789 $ 4,435 CORPORATE Results (a) $ (3,958 ) $ (1,294 ) $ (1,867 ) Less: Debt purchase expense (31 ) (42 ) Trust preferred redemption charge (11 ) Gain on sale of Lyondell shares 90 140 Gain on sale of Premcor Valero shares 726 Gain on Lyondell stock issuance 121 State tax issue charge (b) (10 ) Settlement of federal tax issue (b) 619 47 Reversal of tax reserves (b) 335 Deferred tax write off due to compensation program changes (b) (40 ) Equity investment impairment (15 ) Equity investment hurricane insurance charge (2 ) Hurricane insurance charge (10 ) (15 ) Litigation settlements 108 Tax effect of pre tax adjustments (41 ) (219 ) (35 ) Discontinued operations, net of tax (b) (253 ) 238 162 Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, net of tax (b) 3 CORPORATE CORE RESULTS $ (3,791 ) $ (3,057 ) $ (2,136 ) TOTAL CORE EARNINGS $ 4,349 $ 3,732 $ 2,299 (a) Includes net interest expense, income taxes, general and administrative and other expense, and certain non core items. (b) Amounts shown after tax. TAXES Deferred tax liabilities, net of deferred tax assets of $1.4 billion, were $2.1 billion at December 31, 2006. The current portion of the deferred tax assets of $190 million is included in prepaid expenses and other. The net deferred tax assets are expected to be realized through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences. Worldwide Effective Tax Rate The following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for reported income from continuing operations and core earnings: In millions 2006 2005 2004 REPORTED INCOME Oil and Gas (a) $ 7,239 $ 5,968 $ 4,021 Chemical 901 607 414 Corporate and Other (239 ) 392 (390 ) Pre tax income 7,901 6,967 4,045 Income tax expense Federal and State 1,713 665 941 Foreign (a) 1,753 1,262 698 Total 3,466 1,927 1,639 Income from continuing operations $ 4,435 $ 5,040 $ 2,406 Worldwide effective tax rate 44% 28% 41% CORE INCOME Oil and Gas (a) $ 7,239 $ 6,012 $ 4,021 Chemical 901 777 414 Corporate and Other (406 ) (405 ) (485 ) Pre tax income 7,734 6,384 3,950 Income tax expense Federal and State 1,632 1,390 953 Foreign (a) 1,753 1,262 698 Total 3,385 2,652 1,651 Core income $ 4,349 $ 3,732 $ 2,299 Worldwide effective tax rate 44% 42% 42% (a) Revenues, oil and gas pre tax income and income tax expense include taxes owed by Occidental but paid by governmental entities on its behalf of $1.1 billion, $887 million and $525 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Occidentals 2006 worldwide effective tax rate was 44 percent for both reported and core income. The lower income tax rate for reported income in 2005, compared to 2006, resulted from a $335 million 2005 tax benefit due to the reversal of tax reserves no longer required and a $619 million 2005 tax benefit resulting from a closing agreement with the IRS resolving certain foreign tax credit issues. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Selected Revenue Items In millions 2006 2005 2004 Net sales $ 17,661 $ 14,597 $ 10,879 Interest, dividends and other income $ 381 $ 181 $ 144 Gain on disposition of assets, net $ 118 $ 870 $ 1 The increase in net sales in 2006, compared to 2005, reflects higher crude oil prices and oil and gas production and higher chemical prices, partially offset by lower natural gas prices. The increase in net sales in 2005, compared to 2004, reflects higher crude oil, natural gas and chemical prices. 20 The increase in interest, dividends and other income in 2006, compared to 2005, is primarily due to a $108 million gain related to litigation settlements and interest income earned on a higher level of cash and cash equivalents. The increase in interest, dividends and other income in 2005, compared to 2004, reflects higher interest income earned on a higher level of cash and cash equivalents. Gains on disposition of assets, net in 2006, includes a gain of $90 million from the sale of 10 million shares of Lyondell stock. Gain on disposition of assets, net in 2005 includes a gain of $726 million resulting from Valeros acquisition of Premcor and the subsequent sale of all of the Valero shares received and a gain of $140 million on the sale of 11 million shares of Lyondell stock. Selected Expense Items In millions 2006 2005 2004 Cost of sales (a) $ 6,284 $ 5,425 $ 4,418 Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses $ 1,371 $ 1,324 $ 936 Depreciation, depletion and amortization $ 2,042 $ 1,422 $ 1,251 Exploration expense $ 295 $ 314 $ 214 Interest and debt expense, net $ 291 $ 293 $ 260 (a) Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization of $2,011 million in 2006, $1,383 million in 2005 and $1,213 million in 2004. Cost of sales increased in 2006, compared to 2005, due to higher oil and gas production, maintenance, workover and utility costs and higher ad valorem and export taxes. Cost of sales increased in 2005, compared to 2004, mainly due to higher oil and gas production costs and higher energy and feedstock costs. Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2006, compared to 2005, due to higher oil and gas production taxes and increases in share based and incentive compensation expense. Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2005, compared to 2004, due to the chemical plant write offs and writedowns in 2005, higher costs in oil and gas, including higher production related taxes, and increases in share based compensation expense. DD&A increased in 2006, compared to 2005, due to increased production, mainly from the Vintage acquisition and higher costs of new reserve additions resulting in a higher DD&A rate. DD&A increased in 2005, compared to 2004, due to higher costs of new reserve additions resulting in a higher DD&A rate. The increase in exploration expense in 2005, compared to 2004, was due mostly to higher dry hole write offs and impairment costs and higher seismic and geological and geophysical costs. Interest and debt expense in 2006, 2005 and 2004 included pre tax debt repayment expenses of $35 million, $42 million and $17 million, respectively. Excluding the effects of these debt repayment charges, interest expense increased in 2005, compared to 2004, due to higher interest rates which were partially offset by lower debt levels. Selected Other Items In millions 2006 2005 2004 Provision for income taxes $ 3,466 $ 1,927 $ 1,639 Income from equity investments $ (182 ) $ (232 ) $ (113 ) Gain on Lyondell stock issuance $ $ $ (121 ) The increase in the provision for income taxes in 2006, compared to 2005, was due to an increase in income before taxes in 2006, a $335 million 2005 tax benefit due to the reversal of tax reserves no longer required, and a $619 million 2005 tax benefit related to the resolution of certain IRS tax issues. The decrease in income from equity investments in 2006, compared to 2005, is mainly due to the change in Occidentals accounting for its Lyondell shares from equity method to available for sale investment in May 2006. The increase in income from equity investments in 2005, compared to 2004, was due to improved results from the Lyondell equity investment and higher income from a Russian oil and gas equity investee. The gain on Lyondell stock issuance in 2004 represents Occidentals share of the increase in Lyondells net equity resulting from Lyondells issuance of stock to purchase Millennium. CONSOLIDATED ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL POSITION The changes in the following components of Occidentals balance sheet are discussed below: Selected Balance Sheet Components In millions 2006 2005 CURRENT ASSETS Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,339 $ 2,188 Short term investments 240 252 Trade receivables, net 2,825 2,531 Receivables from joint ventures, partnerships and other 499 568 Inventories 825 716 Prepaid expenses and other 256 255 Assets of discontinued operations 22 427 Total current assets $ 6,006 $ 6,937 Long term receivables, net $ 231 $ 377 Investments in unconsolidated entities $ 1,344 $ 1,209 Property, plant and equipment, net $ 24,316 $ 17,171 CURRENT LIABILITIES Current maturities of long term debt and capital lease liabilities $ 171 $ 46 Accounts payable 2,263 2,046 Accrued liabilities 1,575 1,569 Dividends payable 188 147 Domestic and foreign income taxes 396 326 Liabilities of discontinued operations 131 138 Total current liabilities $ 4,724 $ 4,272 Long term debt, net $ 2,619 $ 2,873 Deferred credits and other liabilities income taxes $ 2,326 $ 970 Deferred credits and other liabilities other $ 2,966 $ 2,621 Long term liabilities of discontinued operations $ 195 $ Stockholders equity $ 19,184 $ 15,032 21 Assets See Cash Flow Analysis for discussion about the change in cash and cash equivalents. The increase in trade receivables is due to higher worldwide oil prices and higher oil and gas production volumes during the fourth quarter of 2006 versus 2005. The increase in inventories is due to an increase in materials and supplies, mainly in Oman and Colombia, and increases in chemical inventory volumes during the fourth quarter of 2006 versus 2005. The decrease in assets of discontinued operations is due to the write off of the investment in Block 15 in Ecuador during the second quarter of 2006. The decrease in long term receivables reflects lower mark to market adjustments on long term derivative financial instruments. The increase in investments in unconsolidated entities is due to mark to market adjustments on the Lyondell investment, which became an available for sale investment in May 2006 and additional capital investments made on the Dolphin Project during 2006, partially offset by the sale of 10 million shares of Lyondell common stock. The increase in PP&E is due to the acquisitions of Vintage and properties from Plains completed in the first and third quarters of 2006, respectively, and oil and gas capital expenditures during 2006. Liabilities and Stockholders Equity Debt to Capitalization (a) (a) This ratio is computed by dividing year end Total Debt, as shown in the "MD&A Strategy Key Performance Indicators Debt Structure," by the sum of year end Total Debt plus year end Stockholders Equity. The increase in current maturities of long term debt and capital leases is due to the 4.0 percent medium term notes, which were reclassified from long term to current since they mature in 2007. The increase in accounts payable is due to the Vintage acquisition, higher prices and volumes for purchased oil in the marketing and trading operations, and higher chemical volume and feedstock price increases during 2006. The decrease in long term debt, net is due to various debt redemptions and repurchases throughout 2006, offset by the debt assumed in the Vintage acquisition. The increase in deferred credits and other liabilities income taxes is due to the additional deferred taxes recorded as part of the Vintage acquisition purchase accounting. The increase in deferred credits and other liabilities other is due to additional pension liabilities recorded in connection with Occidentals adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 158. The increase in long term liabilities of discontinued operations was due to accruing the OCP ship or pay obligations in Ecuador. The increase in stockholders equity reflects the stock issued as consideration for the Vintage acquisition and net income for 2006, partially offset by treasury stock repurchases and dividend payments. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At December 31, 2006, Occidental had approximately $1.6 billion in cash and short term investments on hand. Although income and cash flows are largely dependent on oil and gas prices and production, Occidental believes that cash and short term investments on hand and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its operating needs, capital expenditure requirements, dividend payments, potential acquisitions, its announced common stock repurchase program and debt repurchases. If needed, Occidental could access its existing credit facilities. Available but unused lines of committed bank credit totaled approximately $1.5 billion at December 31, 2006. In September 2006, Occidental amended and restated its $1.5 billion bank credit (Credit Facility) to, among other things, lower the interest rate and extend the term to September 2011. The Credit Facility provides for the termination of the loan commitments and requires immediate repayment of any outstanding amounts if certain events of default occur or if Occidental files for bankruptcy. Occidental had not drawn down any amounts on the Credit Facility at December 31, 2006. None of Occidentals committed bank credits contain material adverse change (MAC) clauses or debt rating triggers that could restrict Occidentals ability to borrow under these lines. Occidentals credit facilities and debt agreements do not contain rating triggers that could terminate bank commitments or accelerate debt in the event of a ratings downgrade. At December 31, 2006, under the most restrictive covenants of certain financing agreements, Occidentals capacity for additional unsecured borrowing was approximately $44.8 billion, and the capacity for the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on, and for acquisitions of, Occidentals capital stock was approximately $17.2 billion, assuming that such dividends, distributions and acquisitions were made without incurring additional borrowing. In January 2006, Occidental completed the Vintage acquisition and paid $1.3 billion in cash to former Vintage shareholders and issued approximately 56 million shares of Occidental common stock, which were valued at $2.1 billion. In addition, Occidental assumed Vintages debt, which had an estimated fair market value of $585 million at closing. In 2006, Occidental redeemed or repurchased $274 million of this newly acquired debt, including all of its 7.875 percent Vintage senior subordinated notes due 2011 and $74 million of its 8.25 percent Vintage senior notes due 2012. Additionally, Occidental redeemed all of its 7.375 percent senior notes due 2008 and purchased and retired a total of $120 million of its 4 percent medium term notes due 2007, its 4.25 percent medium term notes due 2010, its 6.75 percent senior notes due 2012, its 9.25 percent senior debentures due 2019, its 8.75 percent senior notes due 2023 and its 8.45 percent senior notes due 2029. 22 In 2005, Occidental redeemed all of its 5.875 percent senior notes due 2007, all of its 4.101 percent medium term senior notes due 2007, all of its 7.65 percent senior notes due 2006 and three of its unsecured subsidiary notes due 2028 through 2030. In addition, Occidental purchased and retired a total of $213 million of its 6.75 percent senior notes due 2012, its 10.125 percent senior notes due 2009, its 4 percent medium term senior notes due 2007 and its 4.25 percent medium term senior notes due 2010. In July 2005, Dolphin Energy entered into a bridge loan in an amount of $2.45 billion. The proceeds of the new bridge loan were used to pay off amounts outstanding on a previous bridge loan and are being used to fund the construction of the Dolphin Project. The new bridge loan has a term of four years, is a revolving credit facility for the first two years and may be converted to a term loan thereafter. In September 2005, Dolphin Energy entered into an agreement with banks to provide a $1.0 billion Islamic law compliant facility to fund the construction of a certain portion of the Dolphin Project. This four year financing facility is structured as a transaction in which Dolphin Energy constructs part of the midstream portion of the Dolphin Project on behalf of a group of Islamic investors and enters into a lease to use such assets upon construction completion. Occidental guarantees 24.5 percent of both of these obligations of Dolphin Energy. At December 31, 2006, Occidentals portion of the bridge loan and Islamic law compliant facility draw downs were $469 million and $184 million, respectively. Occidental had recorded $473 million on the balance sheet at December 31, 2006, for the combined bridge loan and Islamic law compliant facility. The remaining amounts of the bridge loan and Islamic law compliant facility draw downs are included in guarantees discussed in Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Guarantees below. In the first quarter of 2005, Occidental filed a shelf registration statement for up to $1.5 billion of various securities. As of December 31, 2006, no securities had been issued under this shelf. In January 2007, Occidental completed a cash tender offer for its 10.125 percent senior debentures due 2009, 9.25 percent senior debentures due 2019, 8.75 percent senior notes due 2023, 7.2 percent senior debentures due 2028 and 8.45 percent senior notes due 2029, resulting in the repurchase of a portion of these debt instruments totaling $659 million. The repurchases were funded with Occidentals cash on hand and resulted in debt repurchase expenses of $165 million. Cash Flow Analysis In millions 2006 2005 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 6,353 $ 5,337 $ 3,878 The significant increase in operating cash flow in 2006, compared to 2005, resulted from several factors. The most important drivers were higher crude oil prices, higher oil and gas production and, to a much lesser extent, higher chemical margins, partially offset by the effects of lower gas prices and reduced cash flow from discontinued operations. In 2006, Occidentals realized crude oil prices increased by 15 percent and its oil and gas production increased by over 14 percent compared to 2005. The increase in production was mainly due to the 11 months of production from the Vintage acquisition. Increases in the costs of producing oil and gas, such as purchased goods and services, and higher utility costs, gas plant costs and ad valorem and export taxes, partially offset the effect of oil price increases. Other cost elements, such as labor costs and overheads, are not significant drivers of cash flow because they are mainly fixed within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term. The cost increases had a smaller effect on cash flow than the higher crude oil prices and the higher crude oil and natural gas production. Most major chemical prices increased in 2006, compared to 2005, at a higher rate than ethylene costs, thereby improving chemical margins. The overall impact of the chemical price changes on cash flow was much less than for oil and gas price changes because the chemical segment earnings and cash flow are significantly smaller than those for the oil and gas segment. Sales volumes for certain chemical products were slightly lower in 2006, however, this did not have a significant effect on Occidentals earnings and cash flow. The significant increase in operating cash flow in 2005, compared to 2004, resulted from several factors. The most important drivers were the significantly higher oil and natural gas prices and, to a much lesser extent, chemical prices. Although the changes in realized prices varied among the regions in which Occidental operates, in 2005, Occidentals realized oil prices were higher overall by 37 percent. Occidentals realized natural gas price increased over 33 percent in the United States, where approximately 80 percent of Occidentals natural gas was produced in 2005. Increases in the costs of producing oil and gas, such as purchased goods and services, and higher utility, gas plant and production taxes, partially offset oil and gas sales price increases, but such cost increases had a much lower effect on cash flow than the realized price increases. Other cost elements, such as labor costs and overheads, are not significant drivers of cash flow because they are mainly fixed within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term. Most major chemical prices increased in 2005 at a higher rate than the energy driven increase in feedstock and power costs, thereby improving profits and cash flow. The overall impact of the chemical price changes on cash flow was much less than for oil and gas price changes, not only because the chemical segment earnings and cash flow are significantly smaller than those for the oil and gas segment, but also because of increases in energy price driven feedstock and electric power costs, which are major elements of manufacturing cost for the chemical segments products. Sales volumes for chemical products generally were higher in 2005, but this did not have a significant effect on Occidentals earnings and cash flow. Other non cash charges to income in 2006 included stock incentive plan amortization, deferred compensation and environmental remediation accruals. Other non cash charges to income in 2005 included chemical asset write downs, deferred compensation, stock incentive plan amortization and environmental remediation accruals. Other non cash charges in 2004 included deferred compensation, stock incentive plan amortization, environmental remediation accruals and a chemical asset write down. 23 In millions 2006 2005 2004 Net cash used by investing activities $ (4,383 ) $ (3,161 ) $ (2,428 ) The 2006 amount includes the cash payments associated with the acquisition of Vintage and the property acquisition from Plains, partially offset by cash proceeds from the Vintage assets subsequently sold and from the sale of Lyondell shares. The 2005 amount includes the cash payments for several Permian Basin acquisitions, the acquisition of the Vulcan chlor alkali manufacturing facilities and the payments to re enter Libya and to assume operations of the Mukhaizna field in Oman. These were partially offset by the cash proceeds from the sale of the Premcor Valero shares and the Lyondell shares. The 2004 amount includes the purchase of a pipeline and gathering system in the Permian Basin and a $204 million advance to the Elk Hills Power LLC (EHP) equity investment, which EHP used to repay a portion of its debt. Also, see the "Capital Expenditures" section below. In millions 2006 2005 2004 Net cash used by financing activities $ (2,819 ) $ (1,187 ) $ (821 ) The 2006 amount consists of $1.5 billion of cash paid for Occidentals stock repurchase plan and net debt payments of approximately $900 million. The 2005 amount includes net debt payments of approximately $900 million. The 2004 amount includes $466 million paid to redeem the trust preferred securities in January 2004 and $159 million paid to redeem Occidentals 6.5 percent senior notes. Occidental paid common stock dividends of $646 million in 2006, $483 million in 2005 and $424 million in 2004. Capital Expenditures In millions 2006 2005 2004 Oil and Gas $ 2,721 $ 2,137 $ 1,526 Chemical 251 173 155 Corporate and Other 33 14 39 Total (a) $ 3,005 $ 2,324 $ 1,720 (a) Excludes acquisitions. Amounts are included in net cash used by investing activities discussed above. Occidentals capital spending estimate for 2007 is approximately $3.3 to $3.4 billion. Most of the capital spending will be allocated to oil and gas exploration, production and development activities for the Oman Mukhaizna project, the Vintage properties in Argentina and California, Libya, Qatar, the Permian Basin and Elk Hills. Commitments at December 31, 2006, for major capital expenditures during 2007 and thereafter were approximately $787 million. Occidental will fund these commitments and capital expenditures with cash from operations. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS In the course of its business activities, Occidental pursues a number of projects and transactions to meet its core business objectives. The accounting and financial statement treatment of these transactions is a result of the varying methods of funding employed. Occidental also makes commitments on behalf of unconsolidated entities. These transactions, or groups of transactions, are recorded in compliance with GAAP and, unless otherwise noted, are not reflected on Occidentals balance sheets. The following is a description of the business purpose and nature of these transactions. Dolphin Project See "Oil and Gas Segment Business Review Middle East/North Africa Dolphin Project" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for further information. Ecuador In Ecuador, Occidental has a 14 percent interest in the OCP oil export pipeline. As of December 31, 2006, Occidentals net investment in and advances to the project totaled $72 million. Occidental reports this investment in its consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. The project was funded in part by senior project debt. The senior project debt is to be repaid with the proceeds of ship or pay tariffs of certain upstream producers in Ecuador. In May 2006, Ecuador terminated Occidentals contract for the operation of Block 15, which comprised all of its oil producing operations in the country, and seized Occidentals Block 15 assets. Occidentals guarantee of its share of the ship or pay obligations provides the lenders the right to require Occidental to make an advance tariff payment as a result of the expropriation. At December 31, 2006, the total pre tax advance tariff payment of approximately $95 million was accrued in Occidentals consolidated financial statements, and was included in the net after tax charge of $296 million discussed in the Business Review Latin America Ecuador section. This advance tariff would be used by the pipeline company to service or prepay project debt. At December 31, 2006, Occidental also had obligations relating to performance bonds totaling $14 million. Leases Occidental has entered into various operating lease agreements, mainly for railcars, power plants, manufacturing facilities and office space. Occidental leases assets when it offers greater operating flexibility. Lease payments are expensed mainly as cost of sales. See the Contractual Obligations table below. Guarantees Occidental has entered into various guarantees including performance bonds, letters of credit, indemnities, commitments and other forms of guarantees provided by Occidental to third parties, mainly to provide assurance that OPC or its subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations (guarantees). 24 At December 31, 2006, the notional amount of the guarantees that are subject to the reporting requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. (FIN) 45 was approximately $270 million, which consists of Occidentals guarantee of equity investees debt, primarily from the Dolphin Project equity investment, and other commitments. Contractual Obligations The table below summarizes and cross references certain contractual obligations that are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2006 and or disclosed in the accompanying Notes. Payments Due by Year Contractual Obligations (in millions) Total 2007 2008 to 2009 2010 to 2011 2012 and thereafter Consolidated Balance Sheet Long term debt (Note 5) (a) $ 2,774 $ 171 $ 705 $ 307 $ 1,591 Capital leases (Note 6) 38 1 2 2 33 Other liabilities (b) 5,353 3,754 620 347 632 Other Obligations Operating leases (Note 6) (c) 1,418 175 271 187 785 Purchase obligations (d, e) 6,637 1,660 1,969 1,613 1,395 Total $ 16,220 $ 5,761 $ 3,567 $ 2,456 $ 4,436 (a) Excludes unamortized debt premiums and interest expense on the debt. As of December 31, 2006, interest on long term debt totaling $1.8 billion is payable in the following years: 2007 $174 million, 2008 to 2009 $317 million, 2010 to 2011 $258 million and 2012 and thereafter $1,053 million. In January 2007, Occidental completed a cash tender offer and repurchased $659 million of long term debt included in the table, which will reduce future interest payments by approximately $880 million over the original maturities of the repurchased debt. (b) Includes accounts payable, certain accrued liabilities and obligations under postretirement benefit and deferred compensation plans. (c) Amounts have not been reduced for sublease rental income. (d) Includes long term purchase contracts and purchase orders and contracts for goods and services used in manufacturing and producing operations in the normal course of business. Some of these arrangements involve take or pay commitments but they do not represent debt obligations. Due to their long term nature, purchase contracts with terms greater than 5 years are discounted using a 7 percent discount rate. (e) Amounts exclude purchase obligations related to oil and gas marketing and trading activities where an offsetting sales position exists. LAWSUITS, CLAIMS, COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND RELATED MATTERS OPC or certain of its subsidiaries have been named in many lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings. These actions seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. OPC or certain of its subsidiaries also have been named in proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and similar federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws. These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages and civil penalties; however, Occidental is usually one of many companies in these proceedings and has to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, including environmental proceedings, Occidental accrues reserves when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Since 2004, Occidental Chemical Corporation (OCC) has been served with ten lawsuits filed in Nicaragua by approximately 2,600 individual plaintiffs. These individuals allege that they have sustained several billion dollars of personal injury damages as a result of their alleged exposure to a pesticide. OCC is aware of, but has not been served in, 24 additional cases in Nicaragua, which Occidental understands make similar allegations. In the opinion of management, the claims against OCC are without merit because, among other things, OCC believes that none of the pesticide it manufactured was ever sold or used in Nicaragua. Under the applicable Nicaraguan statute, defendants are required to pay pre trial deposits so large as to effectively prohibit defendants from participating fully in their defense. OCC filed a response to the complaints contesting jurisdiction without posting such pre trial deposit. In 2004, the judge in one of the cases (Osorio Case), ruled the court had jurisdiction over the defendants, including OCC, and that the plaintiffs had waived the requirement of the pre trial deposit. In order to preserve its jurisdictional defense, OCC elected not to make a substantive appearance in the Osorio Case. In 2005, the judge in the Osorio Case entered judgment against several defendants, including OCC, for damages totaling approximately $97 million. In December 2006, the court in a second case in Nicaragua (Rios Case) entered a judgment against several defendants, including OCC, for damages totaling approximately $800 million. While preserving its jurisdictional defenses, OCC has appealed the judgments in the Osorio and Rios Cases. OCC has no assets in Nicaragua and, in the opinion of management, any judgment rendered under the statute, including in the Osorio and Rios Cases, would be unenforceable in the United States. During the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions. Taxable years prior to 2001 are generally closed for U.S. federal corporate income tax purposes. Corporate tax returns for taxable years 2001 through 2003 are in various stages of audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Disputes may arise during the course of such audits as to facts and matters of law. Occidental has entered into agreements providing for future payments to secure terminal and pipeline capacity, drilling services, electrical power, steam and certain chemical raw materials. At December 31, 2006, the net present value of the fixed and determinable portion of the obligations under these agreements, which were used to collateralize financings of the respective suppliers, aggregated $16 million, which was payable as follows (in millions): 2007 $12 and 2008 $4. Fixed payments under these agreements were $18 million in 2006, $17 million in 2005 and $19 million in 2004. See "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Contractual Obligations" for further information. Occidental has certain other commitments under contracts, guarantees and joint ventures, including purchase commitments for goods and services at market related prices and certain other contingent liabilities. See "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements" for further information. Some of these commitments, 25 although not fixed or determinable, involve capital expenditures and are part of the $3.3 to $3.4 billion in capital expenditures estimated for 2007. Occidental has indemnified various parties against specified liabilities that those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with Occidental. These indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds. As of December 31, 2006, Occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to future indemnity claims against it in connection with these transactions that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves. It is impossible at this time to determine the ultimate liabilities that OPC and its subsidiaries may incur resulting from any lawsuits, claims and proceedings, audits, commitments, contingencies and related matters or the timing of these liabilities. If these matters were to be ultimately resolved unfavorably at amounts substantially exceeding Occidentals reserves, an outcome not currently anticipated, it is possible that such outcome could have a material adverse effect upon Occidentals consolidated financial position or results of operations. However, after taking into account reserves, management does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of these matters to have a material adverse effect upon Occidentals consolidated financial position or results of operations. ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURES Occidentals operations are subject to stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to improving or maintaining environmental quality. Costs associated with environmental compliance have increased over time and are expected to rise in the future. Environmental expenditures related to current operations are factored into the overall business planning process and are considered an integral part of production in manufacturing quality products responsive to market demand. Environmental Remediation The laws that require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively to past waste disposal practices and releases of substances to the environment. In many cases, the laws apply regardless of fault, legality of the original activities or current ownership or control of sites. OPC or certain of its subsidiaries are currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups under these laws at federal Superfund sites, comparable state sites and other domestic and foreign remediation sites, including currently owned facilities and previously owned sites. Also, OPC or certain of its subsidiaries have been involved in a substantial number of governmental and private proceedings involving historical practices at various sites including, in some instances, having been named in proceedings under CERCLA and similar federal, state and local environmental laws. These proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages and civil penalties. Occidental manages its environmental remediation efforts through a wholly owned subsidiary, Glenn Springs Holdings, Inc., which reports its results directly to Occidentals corporate management. The following table presents Occidentals environmental remediation reserves at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, grouped by three categories of environmental remediation sites: $ amounts in millions 2006 2005 2004 # of Sites Reserve Balance # of Sites Reserve Balance # of Sites Reserve Balance CERCLA & equivalent sites 105 $ 226 128 $ 236 125 $ 239 Active facilities 21 116 18 114 16 75 Closed or sold facilities 40 70 39 68 39 61 Total 166 $ 412 185 $ 418 180 $ 375 The following table shows environmental reserve activity for the past three years: In millions 2006 2005 2004 Balance Beginning of Year $ 418 $ 375 $ 372 Remediation expense and interest accretion 48 63 60 Changes from acquisitions 17 45 6 Payments (71 ) (71 ) (63 ) Other 6 Balance End of Year $ 412 $ 418 $ 375 Occidental expects to expend funds equivalent to about half of the current environmental reserve over the next three years and the balance over the next ten or more years. Occidental believes it is reasonably possible that it will continue to incur additional liabilities beyond those recorded for environmental remediation at these sites. The range of reasonably possible loss for existing environmental remediation matters could be up to $430 million beyond the amount accrued. For managements opinion, refer to the "Lawsuits, Claims, Commitments, Contingencies and Related Matters" section above. CERCLA and Equivalent Sites As of December 31, 2006, OPC or certain of its subsidiaries have been named in 105 CERCLA or state equivalent proceedings, as shown below. Description ($ amounts in millions) # of Sites Reserve Balance Minimal/No exposure (a) 85 $ 6 Reserves between $1 10 MM 14 55 Reserves over $10 MM 6 165 Total 105 $ 226 (a) Includes 32 sites for which Maxus Energy Corporation has retained the liability and indemnified Occidental, 5 sites where Occidental has denied liability without challenge, 15 sites where Occidentals reserves are less than $50,000 each, and 33 sites where reserves are between $50,000 and $1 million each. The six sites with individual reserves over $10 million in 2006 include a former copper mining and smelting operation in Tennessee, two closed landfills in western New York and groundwater treatment facilities at three closed chemical plants (Montague, Michigan, western New York and Tacoma, Washington). 26 Active Facilities Certain subsidiaries of OPC are currently addressing releases of substances from past operations at 21 active facilities. Five facilities a chemical plant in Louisiana, a phosphorus recovery operation in Tennessee, a chemical plant in Texas, a chemical plant in Kansas and certain oil and gas properties in the southwestern United States account for 69 percent of the reserves associated with these facilities. Closed or Sold Facilities There are 40 sites formerly owned or operated by certain subsidiaries of OPC that have ongoing environmental remediation requirements in which OPC or its subsidiaries are involved. Five sites account for 70 percent of the reserves associated with this group. The five sites are: an active refinery in Louisiana where Occidental indemnifies the current owner and operator for certain remedial actions, a water treatment facility at a former coal mine in Pennsylvania, a closed OCC chemical plant in Pennsylvania, a closed landfill in western New York and a water treatment facility at a former OCC chemical plant in North Carolina. Environmental Costs Occidentals costs, some of which may include estimates, relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations, are shown below for each segment: In millions 2006 2005 2004 Operating Expenses Oil and Gas $ 95 $ 65 $ 51 Chemical 73 67 59 $ 168 $ 132 $ 110 Capital Expenditures Oil and Gas $ 55 $ 43 $ 44 Chemical 25 21 12 $ 80 $ 64 $ 56 Remediation Expenses Corporate $ 47 $ 62 $ 59 Operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis. Capital expenditures relate to longer lived improvements in currently operating facilities. Remediation expenses relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and do not contribute to current or future revenue generation. Although total costs may vary in any one year, over the long term, segment operating and capital expenditures for environmental compliance generally are expected to increase. Occidental presently estimates that capital expenditures for environmental compliance will be approximately $94 million for 2007 and $100 million for 2008. FOREIGN INVESTMENTS Portions of Occidentals assets are located outside of North America. Occidental conducts its financial affairs so as to mitigate its exposure against risks associated with the locations of these assets. At December 31, 2006, the carrying value of Occidentals assets in countries outside North America aggregated approximately $9.2 billion, or approximately 28 percent of Occidentals total assets at that date. Of such assets, approximately $5.0 billion are located in the Middle East/North Africa, approximately $3.9 billion are located in Latin America, and substantially all of the remainder are located in the Other Eastern Hemisphere region. For the year ended December 31, 2006, net sales outside North America totaled $5.6 billion, or approximately 31 percent of total net sales. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The process of preparing financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the management of Occidental to make estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions. It is possible that materially different amounts could be recorded if these estimates and judgments change or if the actual results differ from these estimates and judgments. Occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve the judgment of Occidentals management. There has been no material change to these policies over the past three years. The selection and development of these critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Oil and Gas Properties Occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties. Under this method, costs of acquiring properties, costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs are capitalized. The costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found. At the completion of drilling activities, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized if a determination is made that proved reserves have been found. If no proved reserves have been found, the costs of each of the related exploratory wells are charged to expense. In some cases, a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling, requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells. Occidentals practice is to expense the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a twelve month period after drilling is complete. Occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of commercial viability is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures. Annual lease rentals and geological, geophysical and seismic costs are expensed as incurred. Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, can be recovered in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions considering future production and development costs. Several factors could change Occidentals recorded oil and gas reserves. Occidental receives a share of production from PSCs to recover its costs and an additional share for profit. Occidentals share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise and increases when oil prices decline. Overall, Occidentals net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices. In other contractual arrangements, sustained lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of proved reserves becomes uneconomical. Estimation of 27 future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond Occidentals control, such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs. These factors, in turn, could lead to changes in the quantity of recorded proved reserves. An additional factor that could result in a change of proved reserves is the reservoir decline rates being different from those estimated when the reserves were initially recorded. Occidentals revisions to proved reserves were positive for 2006 and amounted to less than 1 percent of the total reserves for the year. In 2005, revisions to proved reserves were negative and amounted to less than 1 percent of the total reserves for the year. In 2004, revisions to proved reserves were positive and amounted to approximately 2 percent of the total reserves. Additionally, Occidental is required to perform impairment tests pursuant to SFAS No. 144, generally when prices decline and or reserve estimates change significantly. There have been no SFAS No. 144 impairments of oil and gas assets over the past three years. If Occidentals consolidated oil and gas reserves were to change based on the factors mentioned above, the most significant impact would be on the DD&A rate. For example, a 5 percent increase in the amount of consolidated oil and gas reserves would change the rate from $8.35 per barrel to $7.94 per barrel, which would increase pre tax income by $88 million annually. A 5 percent decrease in the oil and gas reserves would change the rate from $8.35 per barrel to $8.77 per barrel and would result in a decrease in pre tax income of $88 million annually. DD&A of oil and gas producing properties is determined by the unit of production method and could change with revisions to estimated proved reserves. The change in the DD&A rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous proved reserve estimates has been immaterial. A portion of the carrying value of Occidentals oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties. At December 31, 2006, the capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties, net of accumulated valuation allowance, were $1.7 billion. The acquisition of Vintage resulted in an addition of $1.3 billion of unproved properties in 2006. No goodwill was recorded on this transaction. During 2006, approximately $300 million of the unproved property amount was moved to proved properties. The unproved amounts are not subject to DD&A or impairment until a determination is made as to the existence of proven reserves. As exploration and development work progresses, if reserves on these properties are proven, capitalized costs attributable to the properties will be subject to depreciation and depletion. If the exploration and development work were to be unsuccessful, the capitalized costs of the properties related to this unsuccessful work would be expensed in the year in which the determination was made. The timing of any writedowns of these unproven properties, if warranted, depends upon the nature, timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results. Occidental believes its exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize the unproved property balance. Chemical Assets The most critical accounting policy affecting Occidentals chemical assets is the determination of the estimated useful lives of its PP&E. Occidentals chemical plants are depreciated using either the unit of production or straight line method, based upon the estimated useful life of the facilities. The estimated useful lives of Occidentals chemical assets, which range from 3 years to 50 years, are used to compute depreciation expense and are also used for impairment tests. The estimated useful lives used for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that Occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained. Without these continued expenditures, the useful lives of these plants could significantly decrease. Other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of Occidentals chemical plants include sustained higher or lower product prices, which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition, feedstock costs, energy prices, environmental regulations and technological changes. Over the prior three years, the change in the depreciation rate due to changes in estimated useful lives has been immaterial. Occidental performs impairment tests on its assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when managements plans change with respect to those assets. Occidental compares the undiscounted future cash flows of an asset to its carrying value. The key factors that could significantly affect future cash flows are future product prices, which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition, feedstock costs, energy costs, regulations and remaining estimated useful life. Impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values. Subsequent to the purchase of the Vulcan chemical assets, Occidental reviewed all of its chemical assets and decided to close its least competitive plants and upgrade the remaining operations. As a result of this review, Occidental recorded a $139 million pre tax charge for the write off of two previously idled chemical plants and one operating plant and a pre tax additional charge of $20 million for the write down of another chemical plant in 2005. Occidentals net PP&E for chemicals is approximately $2.6 billion and its depreciation expense for 2007 is expected to be approximately $256 million. If the estimated useful lives of Occidentals chemical plants were to decrease based on the factors mentioned above, the most significant impact would be on depreciation expense. For example, a reduction in the remaining useful lives of one year would increase depreciation and reduce pre tax earnings by approximately $17 million per year. 28 Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Reserves for estimated costs that relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future revenue generation are recorded when environmental remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. In determining the reserves and the reasonably possible range of loss, Occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience, available technology, regulations in effect, the timing of remediation and cost sharing arrangements. The environmental reserves are based on managements estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred and are reviewed periodically and adjusted as additional or new information becomes available. Environmental reserves are recorded on a discounted basis only when a reserve is initially established and the aggregate amount of the estimated costs for a specific site and the timing of cash payments are reliably determinable. The reserve methodology for a specific site is not modified once it has been established. Recoveries and reimbursements are recorded in income when receipt is probable. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, Occidental has not accrued any reimbursements or indemnification recoveries for environmental remediation matters as assets. Many factors could result in changes to Occidentals environmental reserves and reasonably possible range of loss. The most significant are: &Oslash; The original cost estimate may have been inaccurate. &Oslash; Modified remedial measures might be necessary to achieve the required remediation results. Occidental generally assumes that the remedial objective can be achieved using the most cost effective technology reasonably expected to achieve that objective. Such technologies may include air sparging or phyto remediation of shallow groundwater, or limited surface soil removal or in situ treatment producing acceptable risk assessment results. Should such remedies fail to achieve remedial objectives, more intensive or costly measures may be required. &Oslash; The remedial measure might take more or less time than originally anticipated to achieve the required contaminant reduction. Site specific time estimates can be affected by factors such as groundwater capture rates, anomalies in subsurface geology, interactions between or among water bearing zones and non water bearing zones, or the ability to identify and control contaminant sources. &Oslash; The regulatory agency might ultimately reject or modify Occidentals proposed remedial plan and insist upon a different course of action. Additionally, other events might occur that could affect Occidentals future remediation costs, such as: &Oslash; The discovery of more extensive contamination than had been originally anticipated. For some sites with impacted groundwater, accurate definition of contaminant plumes requires years of monitoring data and computer modeling. Migration of contaminants may follow unexpected pathways along geologic anomalies that could initially go undetected. Additionally, the size of the area requiring remediation may change based upon risk assessment results following site characterization or interim remedial measures. &Oslash; Improved remediation technology might decrease the cost of remediation. In particular, for groundwater remediation sites with projected long term operation and maintenance, the development of more effective treatment technology, or acceptance of alternative and more cost effective treatment methodologies such as bioremediation, could significantly affect remediation costs. &Oslash; Laws and regulations might change to impose more or less stringent remediation requirements. At sites involving multiple parties, Occidental provides environmental reserves based upon its expected share of liability. When other parties are jointly liable, the financial viability of the parties, the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to Occidental of their failure to participate are evaluated when estimating Occidentals ultimate share of liability. Based on these factors, Occidental believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of other potentially responsible parties, with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, in an amount that would have a material effect on Occidentals consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Most cost sharing arrangements with other parties fall into one of the following three categories: Category 1: CERCLA or state equivalent sites wherein Occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties share the cost of remediation in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations; Category 2: Oil and gas joint ventures wherein each joint venture partner pays its proportionate share of remedial cost; and Category 3: Contractual arrangements typically relating to purchases and sales of property wherein the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating the costs of environmental remediation. In all three of these categories, Occidental records as a reserve its expected net cost of remedial activities, as adjusted by recognition for any nonperforming parties. In addition to the costs of investigating and implementing remedial measures, which often take in excess of ten years at CERCLA sites, Occidentals reserves include managements estimates of the cost of operation and maintenance of remedial systems. To the extent that the remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site specific data, laws, regulations, technologies or engineering estimates, Occidental reviews and changes the reserves accordingly on a site specific basis. If the environmental reserve balance were to either increase or decrease based on the factors mentioned above, the amount of the increase or decrease would be immediately recognized in earnings. For example, if the reserve balance were to decrease by 10 percent, Occidental would record a pre tax gain of $41 million. If the reserve balance were to increase by 10 percent, Occidental would record an additional remediation expense of $41 million. 29 Other Loss Contingencies Occidental is involved with numerous lawsuits, claims, proceedings and audits in the normal course of its operations. Occidental records a loss contingency for these matters when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In addition, Occidental discloses, in aggregate, its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred. Occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis so that they are adequately reserved on the balance sheet. These reserves are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate. Managements judgments could change based on new information, changes in laws or regulations, changes in managements plans or intentions, the outcome of legal proceedings, settlements or other factors. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING CHANGES Listed below are significant changes in accounting principles. SFAS No. 158 In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). This statement requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded amounts of its defined benefit pension and postretirement plans as an asset or liability and recognize changes in the funded status of these plans in the year in which the changes occur through other comprehensive income (OCI), if they are not recognized in the income statement. The statement also requires a company to use the date of its fiscal year end to measure the plans. The recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. The requirement to use the fiscal year end as the measurement date is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. Occidental adopted this statement on December 31, 2006, and recorded an additional liability of $233 million and a reduction of accumulated OCI, deferred tax liabilities, other assets and minority interest of $168 million, $104 million, $42 million and $3 million, respectively. SAB 108 In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 108, Financial Statements Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements. SAB 108 requires quantification of the impact of all prior year misstatements from both an income statement and a balance sheet perspective to determine if the misstatements are material. SAB 108 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. Occidental adopted SAB 108 effective December 31, 2006 and there was no material effect on the financial statements upon adoption. FIN 48 In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. This interpretation specifies that benefits from tax positions should be recognized in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position meeting the more likely than not recognition threshold should be measured at the largest amount of benefit for which the likelihood of realization upon ultimate settlement exceeds 50 percent. It also requires additional disclosures related to these tax positions. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Occidental will adopt FIN 48 in the first quarter of 2007 and expects there will not be a material effect on the financial statements upon adoption. SFAS No. 157 In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This statement establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Occidental is currently assessing the effect of SFAS No. 157 on its financial statements. FSP AUG AIR 1 In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) AUG AIR 1, Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities. This FSP prohibits the use of the accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities in annual and interim financial reporting periods. FSP AUG AIR 1 is effective for the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2006. Occidental will adopt FSP AUG AIR 1 in the first quarter of 2007 and expects there will not be a material effect on the financial statements upon adoption. EITF Issue No. 06 4 In September 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) finalized the provisions of EITF Issue No. 06 4, Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements. This EITF Issue provides accounting guidance for endorsement split dollar life insurance arrangements and require employers to recognize liability for future benefits in accordance with SFAS 106 or Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 12. The recognition and disclosure provisions of EITF Issue No. 06 4 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2007. Occidental is currently assessing the effect of this EITF Issue on its financial statements. EITF Issue No. 06 5 In September 2006, the EITF finalized the provisions of EITF Issue No. 06 5, Accounting for Purchase of Life Insurance Determining the Amount That Could Be Realized in Accordance with FASB Technical bulletin No. 85 4. This EITF Issue provides accounting guidance for 30 life insurance policies and requires employers to consider and account for any additional amounts or restrictions under the terms of such policies. The recognition and disclosure provisions of EITF Issue No. 06 5 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Occidental will adopt this EITF Issue in the first quarter of 2007 and expects there will not be a material effect on the financial statements upon adoption. SFAS No. 123(R) On July 1, 2005, Occidental early adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), "Share Based Payments", under the modified prospective transition method. Since most of Occidentals existing stock based compensation was already being recorded in the income statement, Occidental decided to early adopt SFAS 123(R) so that the remaining awards would be accounted for in a similar manner. Prior to July 1, 2005, Occidental applied the APB Opinion No. 25 intrinsic value accounting method for its stock incentive plans. Under the modified prospective transition method, the fair value recognition provisions apply only to new awards or awards modified after July 1, 2005. Additionally, the fair value of existing unvested awards at the date of adoption is recorded in compensation expense over the remaining requisite service period. Results from prior periods have not been restated. As a result of adopting this statement in the third quarter of 2005, Occidental recorded a $3 million after tax credit as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles. EITF Issue No. 04 13 In September 2005, the EITF finalized the provisions of EITF Issue No. 04 13, "Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty", which provides accounting guidance about whether buy/sell arrangements should be accounted for at historical cost and whether these arrangements should be reported on a gross or net basis. Buy/sell arrangements typically are contractual arrangements where the buy and sell agreements are entered into in contemplation of one another with the same counterparty. Occidental reports all buy/sell arrangements on a net basis and at historical cost. This Issue was effective in the first interim period beginning after March 15, 2006. Occidental prospectively adopted this Issue in the second quarter of 2006 and there was no material effect on the financial statements upon adoption. DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES AND MARKET RISK General Occidentals market risk exposures relate primarily to commodity prices and, to a lesser extent, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Occidental has entered into derivative instrument transactions to reduce these price and rate fluctuations. A derivative is an instrument that, among other characteristics, derives its value from changes in another instrument or variable. In general, the fair value recorded for derivative instruments is based on quoted market prices, dealer quotes and the Black Scholes or similar valuation models. Commodity Price Risk General Occidentals results are sensitive to fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices. Based on current levels of production, if oil prices vary overall by $1 per barrel, it would have an estimated annual effect on pre tax income of approximately $150 million. If natural gas prices vary by $0.25 per Mcf, it would have an estimated annual effect on pre tax income of approximately $51 million. If production levels change in the future, the sensitivity of Occidentals results to oil and gas prices also would change. Occidentals results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices; however, changes in cost usually offset part of the effect of price changes on margins. If chlorine and caustic soda prices vary by $10/ton, it would have approximately a $15 million and $30 million pre tax annual effect on income, respectively. If PVC prices vary by $.01/lb, it would have approximately a $25 million pre tax annual effect on income. If ethylene dichloride (EDC) prices vary by $10/ton, it would have approximately a $5 million pre tax annual effect on income. Historically, price changes either precede or follow raw material and feedstock price changes; therefore, the margin improvement of price changes can be mitigated. According to Chemical Market Associates, Inc., December 2006 average contract prices were: chlorine $318/ton, caustic soda $338/ton, PVC $0.55/lb and EDC $310/ton. Marketing and Trading Operations Occidental periodically uses different types of derivative instruments to achieve the best prices for oil and gas. Derivatives have been used by Occidental to reduce its exposure to price volatility and to mitigate fluctuations in commodity related cash flows. Occidental enters into low risk marketing and trading activities through its separate marketing organization, which operates under established policy controls and procedures. With respect to derivatives used in its oil and gas marketing operations, Occidental utilizes a combination of futures, forwards, options and swaps to offset various physical transactions. Occidentals use of derivatives in marketing and trading activities relates primarily to managing cash flows from third party purchases, which includes Occidentals periodic gas storage activities. Risk Management Occidental conducts its risk management activities for energy commodities (which include buying, selling, marketing, trading, and hedging activities) under the controls and governance of its Risk Control Policy. The Chief Financial Officer and the Risk Management Committee, comprising members of Occidentals management, oversee these controls, which are implemented and enforced by the Trading Control Officer. The Trading Control Officer provides an independent and separate check on results of marketing and trading activities. Controls for energy commodities include limits on value at risk, limits on credit, limits on trading, segregation of duties, delegation of authority and a number of other policy and procedural controls. 31 Fair Value of Marketing and Trading Derivative Contracts The following tables reconcile the changes in the net fair value of Occidentals marketing and trading contracts, a portion of which are hedges, during 2006 and 2005 and segregate the open contracts at December 31, 2006 by maturity periods. In millions 2006 2005 Fair value of contracts outstanding at beginning of year unrealized (losses) gains $ (457 ) $ 30 Losses on changes for contracts realized or otherwise settled during the year 106 56 Changes in fair value attributable to changes in valuation techniques and assumptions Losses or other changes in fair value (4 ) (543 )(a) Fair value of contracts outstanding at end of year unrealized losses $ (355 ) $ (457 ) (a) Primarily relates to production hedges.

The underlying prices for years 2012 and thereafter are based on the year end NYMEX published prices, as published monthly prices are not available. These prices are entered into an industry standard options pricing model to determine fair value. Production Hedges In 2005, Occidental entered into a series of fixed price swaps and costless collar agreements that qualify as cash flow hedges for the sale of a portion of its crude oil production. Additionally, Occidental acquired oil and gas fixed price and basis swaps with the Vintage acquisition. These hedges continue to the end of 2011. The 2006 volume that was hedged was less than 4 percent of Occidentals 2006 crude oil and natural gas production. Information about these cash flow hedges, which are included in the total fair value of ($355) million in the table above, is presented in a tabular presentation below as of December 31, 2006 (volumes in thousands of barrels): Crude Oil Fixed Price Swaps Costless Collars Daily Volume Average Price Daily Volume Average Floor Average Cap 2007 9 $39.67 7 $40.43 $45.21 2008 14 $34.07 $47.47 2009 13 $33.15 $47.41 2010 12 $33.00 $46.35 2011 12 $32.92 $46.27 Natural Gas Swaps Fixed Price Basis (MMBTU/Day) (a) Daily Volume Average Price Daily Volume Average Price 2007 2,500 $6.00 2,500 $0.03 (a) One MMBTU is one million British thermal units, which equals approximately 1 MCF. Crude Oil Natural Gas Swaps ($ millions) Fixed Price Swaps Costless Collars Fixed Price Basis Total Fair value liability ($81) ($392) ($1) ($1) ($475) Quantitative Information Occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commodity based derivatives and commodity contracts used in marketing and trading activities. This method determines the maximum potential negative short term change in fair value with a 95 percent level of confidence. The marketing and trading value at risk was immaterial during all of 2006. Interest Rate Risk General Occidentals exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to its long term debt obligations. In 2005, Occidental terminated all of its interest rate swaps that were accounted for as fair value hedges. These hedges had effectively converted approximately $1.7 billion of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. The fair value of the swaps at termination resulted in a gain of approximately $20 million, which was recorded into income when the debt was paid in 2005 and 2006. The amount of interest expense recorded in the income statement was lower, as a result of the swaps and recognition of the gain, by approximately $13 million, $21 million and $56 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Occidental was a party to a series of forward interest rate locks, which qualified as cash flow hedges. The hedges were related to the construction of a cogeneration plant leased by Occidental that was completed in December 2002. The unamortized loss on the hedges at December 31, 2006 was approximately $18 million after tax, which is recorded in accumulated OCI and is being recognized in earnings over the lease term of 26 years on a straight line basis. Tabular Presentation of Interest Rate Risk In millions of U.S. dollars, except rates The table below provides information about Occidentals debt obligations which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Debt amounts represent principal payments by maturity date.

Creditworthiness is reviewed before doing business with a new counterparty and on an ongoing basis. Occidental monitors aggregated counterparty exposure relative to credit limits. Credit exposure for each customer is monitored for outstanding balances, current month activity, and forward mark to market exposure. Losses associated with credit risk have been immaterial for all years presented. Foreign Currency Risk A few of Occidentals foreign operations have currency risk. Occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions only at levels necessary for operating purposes. Most international crude oil sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Additionally, all of Occidentals consolidated foreign oil and gas subsidiaries have the U.S. dollar as the functional currency. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, Occidental had not entered into any foreign currency derivative instruments. The effect of exchange rate transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income and is immaterial.
