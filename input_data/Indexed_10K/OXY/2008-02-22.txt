ITEM 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) (Incorporating Item 7A) STRATEGY General In this report, "Occidental" refers to Occidental Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation (OPC), and or one or more entities in which it owns a majority voting interest (subsidiaries). Occidentals business is divided into two segments conducted through oil and gas subsidiaries and their affiliates and chemical subsidiaries and their affiliates. Occidental aims to generate superior total returns to stockholders using the following strategy: &Oslash; Focus on large, long lived oil and gas assets with long term growth potential; &Oslash; Maintain financial discipline and a strong balance sheet; and &Oslash; Manage the chemical segment to provide cash in excess of normal capital expenditures. Occidental prefers to own large, long lived "legacy" oil and gas assets, like those in California and the Permian Basin, that tend to have moderate decline rates, enhanced secondary and tertiary recovery opportunities and economies of scale that lead to cost effective production. Management expects such assets to contribute substantially to earnings and cash flow after invested capital. At Occidental, maintaining financial discipline means investing capital in projects that management expects will generate above cost of capital returns throughout the business cycle. During periods of high commodity prices, Occidental expects to use most of its cash flow after capital expenditures to enhance stockholders returns by continuing its program for evaluating dividend increases and potential stock repurchases. 9 The chemical business is not managed with a growth strategy. Capital is expended to operate the chemical business in a safe and environmentally sound way, to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects designed to improve the competitiveness of these assets. Asset acquisitions may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chlor alkali and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) businesses. Historically, the chemical segment has generated cash flow exceeding its normal capital expenditure requirements. Oil and Gas Segment Income ($ millions) The oil and gas business seeks to add new oil and natural gas reserves at a pace ahead of production while keeping costs incurred for finding and development among the lowest in the industry. The oil and gas business implements this strategy within the limits of the overall corporate strategy primarily by: &Oslash; Continuing to add commercial reserves through a combination of focused exploration and development programs conducted in and around Occidentals core areas, which are the United States, the Middle East/North Africa and Latin America; &Oslash; Pursuing commercial opportunities in core areas to enhance the development of mature fields with large volumes of remaining oil by applying appropriate technology and advanced reservoir management practices; and &Oslash; Maintaining a disciplined approach in buying and selling assets at attractive prices. Over the past several years, Occidental has strengthened its asset base within each of the core areas. Occidental has invested in, and disposed of, assets with the goal of raising the average performance and potential of its assets. See "Oil and Gas Segment Business Review" for a discussion of these changes. In addition, Occidental has continued to make capital contributions and investments in the Dolphin Project in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the Mukhaizna project in Oman, and Libya for continued growth opportunities. Occidentals overall performance during the past several years reflects the successful implementation of its strategy to enhance the development of mature fields, beginning with the acquisition of the Elk Hills oil and gas field in California in 1998, followed by a series of purchases in the Permian Basin in west Texas and New Mexico and the integration of Vintage Petroleum, Inc. (Vintage) and Plains Exploration and Production Company (Plains) operations acquired in 2006. At the end of 2007, the Elk Hills and Permian assets made up 66 percent of Occidentals consolidated proven oil reserves and 44 percent of its consolidated proven gas reserves. On a barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) basis, these assets accounted for 61 percent of Occidentals consolidated reserves. In 2007, the combined production from these assets averaged approximately 286,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day. Chemical Segment Income ($ millions) OxyChems strategy is to be a low cost producer in order to maximize its cash flow generation. OxyChem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain beginning with chlorine, which is coproduced with caustic soda, after which chlorine and ethylene are converted through a series of intermediate products into PVC. OxyChems focus on chlorovinyls permits it to take advantage of economies of scale. Key Performance Indicators General Occidental seeks to ensure that it meets its strategic goals by continuously measuring its success in maintaining below average debt levels and top quartile performance compared to its peers in: &Oslash; Total return to stockholders; &Oslash; Return on equity; &Oslash; Return on capital employed; and &Oslash; Other segment specific measurements such as profit per unit produced, cost to produce each unit, cash flow per unit, cost to find and develop new reserves, reserves replacement percentage and other similar measures. 10 Debt Structure Occidentals year end 2007 total debt to capitalization ratio declined to 7 percent from 36 percent at the end of 2003. During that time, Occidental has reduced its debt over 60 percent while increasing its stockholders equity by 186 percent. Since the second quarter of 2005, Occidentals long term senior unsecured debt has been rated A by Standard and Poors Corporation, A3 by Moodys Investors Service (Moodys), and A(Low) by Dominion Bond Rating Service. In July 2007, Fitch Ratings upgraded Occidentals long term senior unsecured debt rating from A to A. In December 2007, Moodys and Standard and Poors raised their outlook on Occidentals credit ratings from stable to positive. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Return on Equity Annual 2007 (a) Three Year Average 2005 2007 (b) 26% 29% (a) The Return on Equity for 2007 was calculated by dividing Occidentals 2007 net income by the average equity balance in 2007. (b) The three year average Return on Equity was calculated by dividing the average net income over the three year period 2005 2007 by the average equity balance over the same period. Occidental has focused on achieving top quartile return on equity. In 2007, Occidentals return on equity was 26 percent and the three year average return on equity was 29 percent. During the same three year period, Occidental increased its stockholders equity by 115 percent and its annual dividend by 82 percent while its stock price increased by 164 percent. OIL AND GAS SEGMENT Business Environment Oil and gas prices are the major variables that drive the industrys short and intermediate term financial performance. Average yearly oil prices strengthened in 2007 over 2006 levels and ended the year higher than 2006 year end levels. During 2007, Occidental experienced an improvement in its price differential between the average West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price and Occidentals realized prices. Occidentals realized price as a percentage of WTI was approximately 90 percent and 87 percent for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Prices and differentials can vary significantly, even on a short term basis, making it difficult to forecast realized prices. The average WTI market price for 2007 was $72.32 per barrel compared with $66.23 per barrel in 2006. Occidentals average realized price for oil in 2007 was $64.77 per barrel, compared with $57.81 per barrel in 2006. The average New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) domestic natural gas prices decreased approximately 9 percent from 2006. For 2007, NYMEX gas prices averaged $7.12/Mcf compared with $7.82/Mcf for 2006. Business Review All production and reserves figures are net to Occidental unless otherwise specified. Worldwide Production (thousands BOE/day) Acquisitions and Dispositions In June 2007, Occidental completed a fair value exchange in which BP p.l.c. (BP) acquired Occidentals oil and gas interests in Horn Mountain and received cash. Occidental acquired oil and gas interests in the Permian Basin and a gas processing plant in Texas from BP. Occidental also sold its oil and gas interests in Pakistan to BP. As a result of these transactions, both the Horn Mountain and Pakistan operations were classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The twelve months of 2007 include after tax gains of $230 million related to these transactions. In January 2007, Occidental sold its 50 percent joint venture interest in Russia for an after tax gain of approximately $412 million. Permian Basin The Permian Basin extends throughout southwest Texas and southeast New Mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the United States, with the entire basin accounting for approximately 19 percent of the total United States oil production. Occidental is the largest producer in the Permian Basin with an approximate 16 percent net share of the total Permian Basin oil production. Occidental also produces and processes natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) in the Permian Basin. A significant portion of Occidentals Permian Basin interests were obtained through the acquisition of Altura Energy Ltd. in 2000. Additional acquisitions of oil and gas producing property interests were subsequently made. Occidentals total share of Permian Basin oil, gas and NGL production averaged approximately 198,000 BOE per day in 2007. At the end of 2007, Occidentals Permian Basin properties had 1.2 billion BOE in proved reserves. Occidentals Permian Basin production is diversified across a large number of producing areas. In 2007, Wasson San Andres was Occidentals largest Permian producing field with an average of approximately 38,000 BOE per day of production and with 311 million BOE of proved reserves at year end. This field represents 19 percent of Occidentals 2007 daily Permian Basin production and 26 percent of its year end Permian Basin proved reserves. 11 Occidentals interests in the Permian Basin offer additional development and exploitation potential. During 2007, Occidental drilled approximately 225 wells on its operated properties and participated in additional wells drilled on outside operated interests. Occidental conducted significant development activity on nine carbon dioxide (CO2) projects during 2007, including implementation of new floods and expansion of existing CO2 floods. Occidental also focused on improving the performance of existing wells. Occidental had an average of 127 well service units working in the Permian area during 2007 performing well maintenance and workovers. Approximately 60 percent of Occidentals Permian Basin oil production is from fields that actively employ the application of CO2 flood technology, an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technique. This involves injecting CO2 into oil reservoirs where it acts as a solvent, causing the oil to flow more freely into producing wells. These CO2 flood operations make Occidental a world leader in the application of this technology. California Elk Hills Occidentals interest at Elk Hills includes the Elk Hills oil and gas field in the southern portion of Californias San Joaquin Valley, which it operates with an approximately 78 percent interest, and other non unit properties. The Elk Hills field is the largest producer of gas in California. Oil and gas production in 2007 from the Elk Hills properties was approximately 88,000 BOE per day. During 2007, Occidental continued to perform infill drilling, field extensions and recompletions identified by advanced reservoir characterization techniques, resulting in 246 new wells being drilled and 507 wells being worked over. At the end of 2007, the Elk Hills properties had an estimated 519 million BOE of proved reserves. Vintage Production California In 2006, Occidental combined its California properties acquired from Vintage and Plains with existing California properties (excluding the Elk Hills, THUMS and Tidelands Oil Production Company (Tidelands) properties). The combined properties produce oil and gas from more than 50 fields, located mainly in the Ventura, San Joaquin and Sacramento basins. Oil and gas production from Vintage Production California in 2007 averaged approximately 22,000 BOE per day. At the end of 2007, the combined properties had an estimated 138 million BOE of proved reserves. THUMS and Tidelands Occidental owns THUMS, which conducts the field operations for an oil production unit offshore Long Beach, California. Occidental acquired Tidelands in 2006. Tidelands is the contract operator for an onshore oil production unit in Long Beach, California. Occidentals share of production and reserves from both properties is subject to contractual arrangements similar to a production sharing contract (PSC), whereby Occidentals share of production and reserves vary inversely with oil prices. These contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to Occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on Occidentals economic interest as defined in the contracts. For 2007, Occidentals production from THUMS averaged 20,000 BOE per day and proved reserves totaled 97 million BOE at year end. Hugoton and Other Occidental owns a large concentration of gas reserves, production interests and royalty interests in the Hugoton area of Kansas and Oklahoma. Occidental also has over 29,000 net acres in the Piceance Basin in western Colorado. During 2007, Occidental drilled 56 wells in the basin. In 2007, Occidentals Hugoton and other operations produced approximately 30,000 BOE per day. At December 31, 2007, proved reserves totaled 154 million BOE from Hugoton and other operations. Middle East/North Africa Dolphin Project Occidentals investment in the Dolphin Project, which was acquired in 2002, consists of two separate economic interests held through two separate legal entities. One entity, OXY Dolphin E&P, LLC, owns a 24.5 percent undivided interest in the assets and liabilities associated with a Development and Production Sharing Agreement (DPSA) with the Government of Qatar to develop and produce natural gas and NGLs in Qatars North Field for 25 years from the start of production, with a provision to request a 5 year extension. This undivided interest is proportionately consolidated in Occidentals financial statements. A second entity, OXY Dolphin Pipeline, LLC, owns 24.5 percent of the stock of Dolphin Energy Limited (Dolphin Energy), and is recorded as an equity investment. Dolphin Energy is the operator under the DPSA on behalf of the three DPSA participants, including Occidental. Dolphin Energy owns and operates a 230 mile long, 48 inch natural gas pipeline, which transports dry natural gas from Qatar to the UAE. The transportation of gas through the pipeline started in the first quarter of 2007 using third party natural gas and production under the DPSA began in July 2007 from Qatars North Field replacing the third party natural gas. These contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to Occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on Occidentals economic interest as defined in the contracts. Occidentals share of production was approximately 36,000 BOE per day in the fourth quarter of 2007 with production expected to increase to approximately 55,000 BOE per day in 2008. At December 31, 2007, Occidentals share of proved oil and gas reserves from the Dolphin Project was 234 million BOE. The Dolphin Project is expected to cost approximately $5.7 billion in total, including investments in the local UAE eastern gas distribution system, the Al Ain Fujairah and Taweelah Fujairah pipelines, which were added to improve the natural gas distribution 12 system but were not contained in the original scope of the Dolphin Project. Occidental expects to invest approximately $1.4 billion of this total, with $1.1 billion invested as of December 31, 2007. At the end of 2007, all offshore facilities within the original scope of the project have been completed along with construction of three of the four trains in the onshore gas processing and compression plant at Ras Laffan. The fourth train is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2008. The pipeline has a capacity to transport up to 3.2 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas per day. Demand for natural gas in the UAE and Oman continues to grow and Dolphin Energys customers have requested additional gas supplies. To help fulfill this growing demand, Dolphin Energy will continue to pursue an agreement to secure an additional supply of gas from Qatar. Qatar In addition to the Dolphin Project, Occidental participates in two production projects in Qatar: Idd El Shargi North Dome (ISND) and Idd El Shargi South Dome (ISSD). In 2007, Occidental continued development of the ISND and ISSD fields to recover additional reserves through advanced drilling techniques and waterflood expansion. Capital expenditures in Qatar for the ISND and ISSD projects were $237 million in 2007. In October 2007, Occidental acquired Anadarko Petroleum Corporations 92.5 percent interest in an exploration and production sharing agreement covering Blocks 12 and 13 located offshore Qatar. Block 13 is an exploration block. These projects do not transfer any right of ownership to Occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on Occidentals economic interest as defined in the contracts. Occidentals production from Block 12, ISND and ISSD averaged 48,000 BOE in 2007. Proved reserves reported for these properties totaled 128 million BOE at December 31, 2007. Yemen Occidental owns contractual interests in three producing blocks in Yemen, including a 38 percent direct working interest in the Masila field, a 40.4 percent interest in the East Shabwa field, comprising a 28.6 percent direct working interest and an 11.8 percent equity interest in an unconsolidated entity, and a 75 percent interest in Block S 1, which was part of the Vintage acquisition. In addition, Occidental owns an 80 percent working interest in Block 20 and is currently awaiting final approval from the Yemen government for a 75 percent working interest in Block 75. These contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to Occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on Occidentals economic interest as defined in the contracts. At December 31, 2007, production from the Yemen properties was 27,000 BOE per day and proved reserves totaled 24 million BOE. Oman In Oman, Occidental is the operator of Block 9 and Block 27, with a 65 percent working interest in each, Block 53, with a 45 percent working interest, and Block 54, with a 70 percent working interest. Occidentals share of production from Blocks 9, 27 and 53 averaged 25,000 BOE per day in 2007. The Block 9 agreement provides for two 10 year extensions and Occidental and its partner agreed with the Government of Oman to the first 10 year extension through December 7, 2015. Occidental and its partners signed a 30 year PSC for the Mukhaizna field (Block 53) with the Government of Oman in 2005. In September 2005, Occidental assumed operations of the Mukhaizna field. The Mukhaizna field, located in Omans south central interior, was discovered in 1975 and was brought into production in 2000. By the end of 2007, Occidental had drilled over 175 new wells and continued implementation of a major pattern steam flood project. As of year end 2007, the exit rate of gross daily production had nearly tripled from the production rate of September 2005. Occidental plans to steadily increase production through continued expansion of the steam flood project. The exploitation term for Block 27 is 30 years beginning in September 2005. Occidental and its partners began production in June 2006. Occidental and its partners signed a new PSC for Block 54 with the Government of Oman in June 2006 with an initial exploration phase of four years. These contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to Occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on Occidentals economic interest as defined in the contracts. Occidentals proved reserves for all the Oman properties totaled 65 million BOE at December 31, 2007. Libya In 2005, Occidental signed an agreement with the Libya National Oil Corporation (NOC) which allowed it to re enter the country and participate in exploration and production operations in the Sirte Basin, which it left in 1986 pursuant to United States law. This re entry agreement allowed Occidental to return to its Libyan operations on generally the same terms in effect when activities were suspended. Occidentals rights in the producing fields extend through 2009 and early 2010. These contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to Occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on Occidentals economic interest as defined in the contracts. Production during 2007 averaged 22,000 BOE per day. At year end 2007, proved reserves reported for Occidentals Libya assets totaled 16 million BOE. In November 2007, Occidental announced that it had reached an agreement with NOC on new 30 year contracts for major field redevelopment and exploration in the Sirte Basin. The new contracts are subject to approval of the Libyan government. Total expected capital investment is estimated to be $5 billion over the next five years, of which Occidentals portion will be approximately $1.9 billion. Under the new 13 contracts, Occidental (which has a 75 percent working interest) and its partner would pay a signature bonus of $1 billion, of which Occidentals share is $750 million and which is payable over a three year period. Occidental and its partner would also contribute 50 percent of the development capital to the project and receive approximately 10 to 12 percent of the gross production, depending on the specific field. Latin America Argentina Substantially all of Occidentals Argentina assets were obtained as part of the acquisition of Vintage in 2006. The assets consist of 23 concessions located in the San Jorge Basin in southern Argentina and the Cuyo Basin and Neuqun Basin in western Argentina. Occidental operates 20 of the concessions with a 100 percent working interest. During 2007, Occidental drilled 153 new wells and performed a number of recompletions and well repairs. Occidental expects to increase production significantly over the next four years through aggressive drilling, waterflooding and EOR projects. In 2008, Occidental plans to drill 220 wells, complete the eight waterflood projects initiated in 2007 and implement a number of new waterflood projects. Occidentals share of production from Argentina averaged 36,000 BOE per day in 2007. Proved reserves from these assets totaled 177 million BOE at December 31, 2007. Bolivia In 2006, Occidentals operating subsidiary acquired working interests in four blocks located in the Tarija, Chuquisaca and Santa Cruz regions of Bolivia as part of the Vintage acquisition. At the end of 2006, Occidental signed two new operation contracts with commercial terms that provide Bolivia with greater operational control and control over the commercialization of hydrocarbons. These contracts went into effect in May 2007. Colombia Occidental is the operator under four contracts within the Llanos Norte Basin: the Cravo Norte, Rondn, Cosecha, and Chipirn Association Contracts. Occidentals working interests under the four contracts are 42 percent, 44 percent, 53 percent and 61 percent, respectively. Colombias national oil company, Ecopetrol, operates the Cao Limn Coveas oil pipeline and marine export terminal. The pipeline transports oil produced from the Llanos Norte Basin for export to international markets. In the Middle Magdalena Basin, Occidental signed an agreement with Ecopetrol in 2005 for an EOR project in the La Cira Infantas (LCI) field, in which Occidental holds a 48 percent working interest. In December 2006, Occidental entered into the commercial phase of the project. Production from the field is transported by Ecopetrol through its pipeline and sold to Ecopetrol refineries. Additionally, Occidental holds various working interests in five exploration blocks. Occidentals share of 2007 production from its Colombia operations was 37,000 BOE per day and proved reserves reported for these interests totaled 57 million BOE at the end of 2007. Production Sharing Contracts Occidental conducts its operations in Qatar, Oman and Yemen under PSCs and, under such contracts, receives a share of production and reserves to recover its costs and an additional share for profit. In addition, Occidentals share of production and reserves from THUMS and Tidelands are subject to contractual arrangements similar to a PSC. These contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to Occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on Occidentals economic interest as defined in the contracts. Occidentals share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise and increases when oil prices decline. Overall, Occidentals net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices. Proved Reserves Proved Reserves Evaluation and Review Process A senior corporate officer of Occidental is responsible for the internal audit and review of its oil and gas reserves data. In addition, a Corporate Reserves Review Committee (Reserves Committee) has been established, consisting of senior corporate officers, to monitor and review Occidentals oil and gas reserves. The Reserves Committee reports to the Audit Committee of Occidentals Board of Directors periodically throughout the year. Occidental has retained Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott), independent petroleum engineering consultants, to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes since 2003. Again in 2007, Ryder Scott has compared Occidentals methods and procedures for estimating oil and gas reserves to generally accepted industry standards and has reviewed certain data, methods and procedures used in estimating reserves volumes, the economic evaluations and reserves classifications. Ryder Scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for a selection of oil and gas fields considered to be a valid representation of Occidentals total reserves portfolio. In 2007, Ryder Scott reviewed approximately 10 percent of Occidentals oil and gas reserves. Since being engaged in 2003, Ryder Scott has reviewed Occidentals reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately 57 percent of Occidentals reported oil and gas reserves. Based on this review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, Ryder Scott has concluded that the methodologies used by Occidental in preparing the relevant estimates generally comply with current Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) standards. Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reserves volumes reported by Occidental. Proved Reserve Additions Occidentals consolidated subsidiaries had proved reserves at year end 2007 of 2,866 million BOE, as compared with the year end 2006 amount of 2,833 million BOE. The increase in the consolidated subsidiaries reserves from all sources was 242 million BOE, which was comprised of an increase of 297 million BOE from proved developed reserves, partially offset by a decrease of 55 million BOE from proved undeveloped reserves. 14 Proved developed reserves represented approximately 80 percent of Occidentals total proved reserves at year end 2007 compared to 78 percent at year end 2006. Proved Reserve Additions Consolidated Subsidiaries 2007 In Millions of BOE Revisions of previous estimates (95 ) Improved Recovery 253 Extensions and Discoveries 24 Purchases 60 Total Additions 242 Proved reserves consisted of 78 percent crude oil and condensate and 22 percent natural gas. Revisions of Previous Estimates In 2007, Occidental experienced a reduction of 95 million BOE of proved reserves through negative revisions of previous estimates, primarily in the Dolphin Project, Qatar, Elk Hills, THUMS and Argentina, partially offset by positive revisions in Permian and Hugoton. Oil price changes affect proved reserves recorded by Occidental. For example, if oil prices increased by $5 per barrel, less oil volume is required to recover costs, and PSCs would reduce Occidentals share of proved reserves by approximately 8 million BOE. Conversely, if oil prices dropped by $5 per barrel, Occidentals share of proved reserves would increase by a similar amount. Oil price changes also tend to affect the economic lives of proved reserves from other contracts, in a manner partially offsetting the PSC reserve volume changes. Apart from the effects of product prices, Occidental believes its approach to interpreting technical data regarding oil and gas reserves makes it more likely future reserve revisions will be positive rather than negative. Improved Recovery In 2007, Occidental added reserves of 253 million BOE through improved recovery. In the United States, improved recovery additions were 64 million BOE in the Elk Hills field, 52 million BOE in the Permian Basin and 29 million BOE in western Colorado. Foreign additions included 32 million BOE in Oman, 17 million BOE in Colombia and 15 million BOE in Qatar. The Elk Hills operations employ infill drilling and both gas flood and water flood techniques. In the Permian Basin, the increased reserves were primarily attributable to enhanced recovery techniques, such as drilling additional CO2 flood and water flood wells. Extensions and Discoveries Occidental obtains reserve additions from extensions and discoveries, which are dependent on successful exploitation programs. In 2007, as a result of such programs, Occidental added reserves of 24 million BOE, including 15 million BOE in Argentina, 3 million BOE in Oman and 2 million BOE in the Permian Basin. The success of improved recovery, extension and discovery projects depends on reservoir characteristics and technology improvements, as well as oil and gas prices, capital costs and operating costs. Many of these factors are outside of managements control, and will affect whether or not these historical sources of reserve additions continue at similar levels. Purchases of Proved Reserves In 2007, Occidental purchased reserves of 60 million BOE, of which 50 million BOE were in the United States and 10 million BOE were in the Middle East/North Africa. Occidental continues to add reserves through acquisitions when properties are available at prices it deems reasonable. Acquisitions are dependent on successful bidding and negotiating of oil and gas contracts at attractive terms. As market conditions change, the available supply of properties may increase or decrease accordingly. Proved Undeveloped Reserves Occidental had proved undeveloped reserve additions of 202 million BOE resulting from improved recovery, extensions and discoveries and purchases, primarily in the Elk Hills field, the Permian Basin, Oman and Argentina. Elk Hills provided 19 percent of this increase. These proved undeveloped reserve additions were offset by reserve transfers to the proved developed category as a result of 2007 development programs. The Dolphin Project transferred 101 million BOE to the proved developed category during 2007, with no remaining undeveloped reserves at year end. In the United States, the Elk Hills field and the Permian Basin each transferred 21 million BOE into proved developed reserves from proved undeveloped reserves. Industry Outlook The petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to numerous market forces. Crude oil and natural gas prices are affected by market fundamentals such as weather, inventory levels, competing fuel prices, overall demand and the availability of supply. Worldwide oil prices rose throughout 2007 and reached historical highs during the last half of the year. Continued economic growth, resulting in increased demand, and concerns about supply availability, could result in continued high prices. A lower demand growth rate could result in lower crude oil prices. Oil prices have significantly affected profitability and returns for Occidental and other upstream producers. Oil prices cannot be predicted with any certainty. The WTI price has averaged approximately $38 per barrel over the past ten years. However, the industry has historically experienced wide fluctuations in prices. See the "Oil and Gas Segment Business Environment" section above for further information. While local supply/demand fundamentals are a decisive factor affecting domestic natural gas prices over the long term, day to day prices may be more volatile in the futures markets, such as on the NYMEX and other exchanges, making it difficult to forecast prices with any degree of confidence. Over the last ten years, the NYMEX gas price has averaged approximately $5.03 per Mcf. 15 CHEMICAL SEGMENT Business Environment The chemical segment results decreased in 2007 due to the softening United States housing market and continued high feedstock costs, which led to lower margins in the PVC business. This was partially offset by an increase in demand for United States products in export markets in 2007 aided by expanding international economies along with favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Business Review Basic Chemicals During 2007, demand and pricing for basic chemical products generally remained strong, although demand for domestic chlorine slightly weakened compared to 2006 due to a slowdown in the United States housing sector. Domestic industry demand for liquid caustic soda in 2007 was virtually flat compared to the prior year; however, industry export demand increased over 2006. Export demand was supported by increasing alumina capacity in South America as well as favorable currency exchange rates. Margins in 2007 continued at 2006 levels as pricing and feedstock costs remained relatively unchanged. Pricing for liquid caustic soda started the year strong and increased every quarter of 2007 aided by unplanned global supply disruptions and a strong export market. OxyChems chlor alkali operating rate for 2007 was 92 percent, which was the same as the industry average operating rate for 2007. Vinyls Domestic demand for PVC in 2007 was 5 percent below 2006 as a result of the significant slump in housing. This was partially offset by exports from the United States, which were up 40 percent in 2007 over 2006, resulting in overall demand for PVC being down 2 percent in 2007. Compared to 2006, margins in 2007 decreased as price increases were not able to compensate for raw material cost increases. From early 2007 to the end of the year, industry PVC prices increased by 31 percent while the cost of ethylene increased by 56 percent. OxyChem operated its PVC facilities at an average operating rate of 78 percent for 2007, compared to the North American industry average of 85 percent. Industry Outlook In 2007, Occidentals chemical business earnings were lower than 2006, primarily due to the weakening of the United States housing market. Future performance will depend on the recovery of United States construction activity, global economic activity, the competitiveness of the United States in the world economy, feedstock and energy pricing, and the impact of additional production capacity entering the market place. Basic Chemicals Forecasts of a slowing United States economy offset by a continued strong export market in 2008 are expected to result in demand levels similar to 2007 levels. Despite continued pressure on the vinyls market, margins in 2008 are expected to remain similar to 2007, but could weaken in the second half due to the anticipated impact of capacity additions in mid 2008. Vinyls Industry wide PVC operating rates are expected to be lower in 2008 as a result of weak demand, especially in housing, coupled with the start up of new capacity in the first half of the year. Exports of United States produced products are expected to maintain their competitive advantage due to the weak United States dollar. Cost pressures are also expected to continue due to high feedstock costs. CORPORATE AND OTHER Corporate and Other includes investments in two cogeneration facilities in Taft, Louisiana and Ingleside, Texas and two common carrier pipelines in the Permian Basin, one of which was purchased in 2007, which are used in corporate directed activities. In 2007, Occidental resolved certain legal disputes that resulted in a gain of approximately $112 million. On August 1, 2006, Occidental effected a two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend to stockholders of record as of that date with distribution of the shares on August 15, 2006. All share and per share amounts discussed and disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10 K reflect the effect of the stock split. In October 2006, Occidental sold 10 million shares of Lyondell Chemical Companys (Lyondell) common stock in a registered public offering for a pre tax gain of $90 million and gross proceeds of $250 million. In 2007, Occidental sold all of its remaining shares of Lyondell common stock (approximately 21 million shares) for a pre tax gain of $326 million and gross proceeds of $672 million. SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of Occidentals two operating segments and corporate items should be read in conjunction with Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment earnings generally exclude income taxes, interest income, interest expense, environmental remediation expenses, unallocated corporate expenses, discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment assets and results and other earnings from the segments equity investments. 16 The following table sets forth the sales and earnings of each operating segment and corporate items: In millions, except per share amounts For the years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 NET SALES Oil and Gas $ 13,918 $ 12,190 $ 9,361 Chemical 4,664 4,815 4,641 Other (a) 202 170 151 $ 18,784 $ 17,175 $ 14,153 EARNINGS(LOSS) Oil and Gas (b) $ 8,318 $ 6,880 $ 5,662 Chemical (c) 601 906 614 8,919 7,786 6,276 Unallocated corporate items Interest expense, net (d) (199 ) (131 ) (201 ) Income taxes (e) (3,507 ) (3,354 ) (1,841 ) Other (f) (135 ) (99 ) 604 Income from continuing operations 5,078 4,202 4,838 Discontinued operations, net (g) 322 (11 ) 452 Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, net 3 Net Income $ 5,400 $ 4,191 $ 5,293 Basic Earnings per Common Share $ 6.47 $ 4.92 $ 6.56 (a) These amounts represent revenue from cogeneration plants and common carrier pipelines.

(b) Occidental has classified its Pakistan, Horn Mountain and Ecuador operations as discontinued operations on a retrospective application basis and excluded them from this table. Excluded production from Pakistan operations averaged 17,000 BOE per day in 2006 and 18,000 BOE per day in 2005. Excluded production from Horn Mountain operations averaged 13,000 BOE per day in 2006 and 14,000 BOE per day in 2005. Excluded production from Ecuador operations averaged 43,000 BOE per day for the first five months of 2006 and 42,000 BOE per day in 2005. Also excluded is production from a Russian joint venture (sold in January 2007), which averaged 27,000 BOE per day and 28,000 BOE per day in 2006 and 2005, respectively. (c) These prices exclude the impact of taxes owed by Occidental but paid by governmental entities on its behalf. (d) Includes dry hole write offs and lease impairments of $247 million in 2007, $115 million in 2006 and $216 million in 2005. Oil and gas segment earnings in 2007 were $8.3 billion, compared to $6.9 billion in 2006. Oil and gas segment earnings in 2007 include an after tax gain of $412 million from the sale of Occidentals interest in a Russian joint venture, an after tax gain of $112 million from certain litigation settlements, a pre tax gain of $103 million from the sale of exploration properties, a pre tax gain of $35 million from the sale of miscellaneous domestic oil and gas interests and a $74 million pre tax loss from the impairment of properties. In addition to the matters discussed above, oil and gas segment earnings for 2007, compared to 2006, reflected higher crude oil prices and higher oil and gas production, partially offset by increased depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) rates and higher operating and exploration expenses. Oil and gas segment earnings in 2006 were $6.9 billion, compared to $5.7 billion in 2005. The increase in oil and gas segment earnings was primarily due to higher crude oil prices and oil and gas production, partially offset by higher operating expenses, including increased DD&A, which was driven by higher volumes and rates. Average consolidated production costs for 2007 were $12.87 per BOE, compared to the average 2006 production cost of $11.70 per BOE. The increases resulted from higher field operating and maintenance costs. Chemical In millions 2007 2006 2005 Segment Sales $ 4,664 $ 4,815 $ 4,641 Segment Earnings $ 601 $ 906 $ 614 Capital Expenditures $ 251 $ 251 $ 173 Chemical segment earnings in 2007 were $601 million, compared to $906 million in 2006. The decrease in segment earnings is primarily due to lower margins in PVC. Chemical segment earnings in 2006 were $906 million, compared to $614 million in 2005. The increase in chemical segment earnings is primarily due to higher margins in chlorine, caustic soda and PVC. SIGNIFICANT ITEMS AFFECTING EARNINGS The following table sets forth the effects of significant transactions and events affecting Occidentals earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005: Significant Items Affecting Earnings Benefit (Charge) (in millions) 2007 2006 2005 OIL AND GAS Gain on sale of a Russian joint venture (a) $ 412 $ $ Legal settlements (a) 112 Gain on sale of exploration properties 103 Gain on sale of oil and gas interests 35 Impairments (74 ) Contract settlement (26 ) Hurricane insurance charge (18 ) Total Oil and Gas $ 588 $ $ (44 ) CHEMICAL Write off of plants $ $ $ (159 ) Hurricane insurance charge (11 ) Total Chemical $ $ $ (170 ) CORPORATE Gain on sale of Lyondell shares $ 326 $ 90 $ 140 Debt purchase expense (167 ) (31 ) (42 ) Facility closure (47 ) Severance charge (25 ) Deferred tax write off due to compensation program changes (a) (40 ) Litigation settlements 108 Gain on sale of Premcor Valero shares 726 State tax issue charge (a) (10 ) Settlement of federal tax issue (a) 619 Reversal of tax reserves (a) 335 Equity investment impairment (15 ) Equity investment hurricane insurance charge (2 ) Hurricane insurance charge (10 ) Tax effect of pre tax adjustments (2 ) (41 ) (219 ) Discontinued operations, net of tax (a) 322 (11 ) 452 Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, net of tax (a) 3 Total Corporate and Other $ 407 $ 75 $ 1,977 (a) Amounts shown after tax. 18 TAXES Deferred tax liabilities, net of deferred tax assets of $1.7 billion, were $2.1 billion at December 31, 2007. The current portion of the deferred tax assets of $230 million is included in prepaid expenses and other. The net deferred tax assets are expected to be realized through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences. Worldwide Effective Tax Rate The following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for income from continuing operations: In millions 2007 2006 2005 EARNINGS Oil and Gas (a) $ 8,318 $ 6,880 $ 5,662 Chemical 601 906 614 Corporate and Other (b) (334 ) (230 ) 403 Pre tax income (a) 8,585 7,556 6,679 Income tax expense Federal and State 1,558 1,625 592 Foreign (a) 1,949 1,729 1,249 Total 3,507 3,354 1,841 Income from continuing operations $ 5,078 $ 4,202 $ 4,838 Worldwide effective tax rate 41% 44% 28% (a) Revenues, oil and gas pre tax income and income tax expense include taxes owed by Occidental but paid by governmental entities on its behalf of $1.3 billion, $1.1 billion and $887 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. (b) The 2005 amount includes a $726 million pre tax gain from Valeros acquisition of Premcor Inc. (Premcor) and the subsequent sale of all of the Valero shares received. Occidentals 2007 worldwide effective tax rate was 41 percent. The decrease in the income tax rate in 2007, compared to 2006, resulted from lower taxes on the 2007 sale of certain properties. Occidentals 2006 worldwide effective tax rate was 44 percent. The lower income tax rate for reported income in 2005, compared to 2006, resulted from a $335 million 2005 tax benefit due to the reversal of tax reserves no longer required and a $619 million 2005 tax benefit resulting from a closing agreement with the IRS resolving certain foreign tax credit issues. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Selected Revenue Items In millions 2007 2006 2005 Net sales $ 18,784 $ 17,175 $ 14,153 Interest, dividends and other income $ 355 $ 381 $ 181 Gains on disposition of assets, net $ 874 $ 118 $ 870 The increase in net sales in 2007, compared to 2006, reflects higher crude oil prices and increased oil and gas production, including production from the start up of the Dolphin Project in the third quarter of 2007. The increase in net sales in 2006, compared to 2005, reflects higher crude oil prices and oil and gas production and higher chemical prices, partially offset by lower natural gas prices. Interest, dividends and other income of 2007 includes $112 million of gains from litigation settlements. The increase in interest, dividends and other income in 2006, compared to 2005, is primarily due to a $108 million gain related to litigation settlements and interest income earned on a higher level of cash and cash equivalents. Gains on disposition of assets, net in 2007, includes a $326 million gain from the sale of 21 million shares of Lyondell, a $412 million gain from the sale of Occidentals interest in a Russian joint venture and a gain of $103 million from the sale of exploration properties in West Africa. Gains on disposition of assets, net in 2006, includes a gain of $90 million from the sale of 10 million shares of Lyondell stock. Gains on disposition of assets, net in 2005 include a gain of $726 million resulting from Valeros acquisition of Premcor and the subsequent sale of all of the Valero shares received and a gain of $140 million on the sale of 11 million shares of Lyondell stock. Selected Expense Items In millions 2007 2006 2005 Cost of sales (a) $ 6,627 $ 6,192 $ 5,336 Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses $ 1,561 $ 1,356 $ 1,310 Depreciation, depletion and amortization $ 2,379 $ 2,008 $ 1,372 Exploration expense $ 422 $ 296 $ 310 Interest and debt expense, net $ 339 $ 291 $ 293 (a) Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization of $2,338 million in 2007, $1,978 million in 2006 and $1,334 million in 2005. Cost of sales increased in 2007, compared to 2006, due to higher crude oil and natural gas production and maintenance costs and higher chemicals feedstock costs. Cost of sales increased in 2006, compared to 2005, due to higher crude oil and natural gas production, maintenance, workover and utility costs and higher ad valorem and export taxes. Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2007, compared to 2006, due to 2007 severance charges, higher production taxes and higher stock based and incentive compensation expense. The increase in stock based and incentive compensation expense in 2007, compared to 2006, resulted from a 58 percent increase in Occidentals stock price and higher net income, which increased the performance measures used to value certain of the existing stock based awards, partially offset by a decrease in the value of awards granted in 2007. Selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2006, compared to 2005, due to higher crude oil and natural gas production taxes and increases in stock based and incentive compensation expense. DD&A increased in 2007, compared to 2006, due to increased production, mainly from the Dolphin Project, and higher costs of new reserve additions resulting in a higher DD&A rate. 19 DD&A increased in 2006, compared to 2005, due to increased production, mainly from the Vintage acquisition and higher costs of new reserve additions resulting in a higher DD&A rate. The increase in exploration expense in 2007, compared to 2006, was due to increases in the Colombia and Middle East/North Africa exploration programs and impairments in California. Interest and debt expense in 2007, 2006 and 2005 included pre tax debt repayment expenses of $167 million, $35 million and $42 million, respectively. Excluding the effect of these debt repayment charges, interest expense decreased in 2007, compared to 2006, due to lower debt levels and lower effective interest rates. Selected Other Items In millions 2007 2006 2005 Provision for income taxes $ 3,507 $ 3,354 $ 1,841 Income from equity investments $ (82 ) $ (183 ) $ (232 ) Discontinued operations, net $ 322 $ (11 ) $ 452 The increase in the provision for income taxes in 2007, compared to 2006, was due to an increase in income before taxes in 2007. The increase in the provision for income taxes in 2006, compared to 2005, was due to an increase in income before taxes in 2006, a $335 million 2005 tax benefit due to the reversal of tax reserves no longer required, and a $619 million 2005 tax benefit related to the resolution of certain IRS tax issues. The decrease in income from equity investments in 2007, compared to 2006, was due to the sale of Occidentals interest in Lyondell and a Russian joint venture. The decrease in income from equity investments in 2006, compared to 2005, is mainly due to the change in Occidentals accounting for its Lyondell shares from equity method to available for sale investment in May 2006. Discontinued operations in 2007 include after tax income of $326 million for the operations of Horn Mountain and Pakistan that were sold as part of a series of transactions with BP as well as the results of operations of these assets before disposal. Discontinued operations in 2006 include a $296 million after tax loss for Ecuador after Occidentals contract for its Block 15 operations was terminated in May 2006. The 2006 amount also includes $285 million after tax income for the operations of Horn Mountain and Pakistan as well as the Vintage assets that were held for sale. Discontinued operations in 2005 include after tax income from Ecuador, Horn Mountain and Pakistan operations. CONSOLIDATED ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL POSITION The changes in the following components of Occidentals balance sheet are discussed below: Selected Balance Sheet Components In millions 2007 2006 CURRENT ASSETS Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,964 $ 1,339 Short term investments 240 Trade receivables, net 4,973 2,825 Receivables from joint ventures, partnerships and other 416 499 Inventories 910 825 Prepaid expenses and other 332 257 Assets of discontinued operations 184 Total current assets $ 8,595 $ 6,169 Investments in unconsolidated entities $ 783 $ 1,344 Property, plant and equipment, net $ 26,278 $ 24,138 CURRENT LIABILITIES Current maturities of long term debt and notes payable $ 47 $ 171 Accounts payable 4,263 2,263 Accrued liabilities 1,399 1,532 Dividends payable 212 188 Domestic and foreign income taxes 227 396 Liabilities of discontinued operations 118 145 Total current liabilities $ 6,266 $ 4,695 Long term debt, net $ 1,741 $ 2,619 Deferred credits and other liabilities income taxes $ 2,324 $ 2,366 Deferred credits and other liabilities other $ 3,156 $ 2,952 Long term liabilities of discontinued operations $ 174 $ 195 Minority interest $ 35 $ 352 Stockholders equity $ 22,823 $ 19,252 Assets See "Cash Flow Analysis" for discussion about the change in cash and cash equivalents. The decrease in short term investments was due to the sale of Occidentals investments in auction rate securities. The increase in trade receivables, net was due to higher crude oil and natural gas prices and volumes during the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to 2006. The decrease in receivables from joint ventures, partnerships and other was due to mark to market adjustments on derivative instruments. The increase in inventories was due to an increase in materials and supplies, mainly in Colombia and Libya, and higher purchases from third parties in the marketing and trading operations. The increase in prepaid expense and other was due to increases in current deferred tax assets and higher prepaid insurance premiums. The decrease in assets of discontinued operations was due to the sale of Pakistan operations and an exchange involving the Horn Mountain operations with BP during 2007. The decrease in investments in unconsolidated entities was due to the sale of 21 million shares of Lyondell and the sale of Occidentals interest in a Russian joint venture. The increase in property, plant and equipment (PP&E), net was due to capital expenditures in 2007 and various oil and gas acquisitions, offset by 2007 DD&A and sales of various oil and gas assets. 20 Liabilities and Stockholders Equity The increase in accounts payable was due to higher prices and volumes for purchased crude oil and natural gas in the marketing and trading operations. In 2007, the decrease in accrued liabilities was due to contract bonus payments in Oman, contingent payments related to acquisitions and 2006 accruals for interest that were paid for in the debt tender offers. The decrease in domestic and foreign income taxes was due to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation (FIN) 48. The decrease in long term debt, net was due to the January 2007 debt repurchases under cash tender offers, the May 2007 redemption of the Vintage senior notes due 2012 and required debt payments. The increase in deferred credits and other liabilities other was due to an increase in asset retirement obligations and higher mark to market adjustments on derivative instruments. The decrease in minority interest was due to Occidentals purchase of the minority interest in a chemical operation from a third party. The increase in stockholders equity reflects net income for 2007 partially offset by treasury stock repurchases of approximately 20.6 million shares in 2007 and dividend payments. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At December 31, 2007, Occidental had approximately $2.0 billion in cash on hand. Although income and cash flows are largely dependent on oil and gas prices and production, Occidental believes that cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its operating needs, capital expenditure requirements, dividend payments, anticipated acquisitions, debt payments and purchases under its announced common stock repurchase program. If needed, Occidental could access its existing credit facilities. In September 2006, Occidental amended and restated its $1.5 billion bank credit (Credit Facility) to, among other things, lower the interest rate and extend the term to September 2011. In September 2007, participating lenders extended the maturity date on $1.4 billion of aggregate loan commitments under the Credit Facility to September 2012. The Credit Facility provides for the termination of the loan commitments and requires immediate repayment of any outstanding amounts if certain events of default occur or if Occidental files for bankruptcy. Occidental did not draw down any amounts under the Credit Facility during 2007. Available but unused lines of committed bank credit totaled approximately $1.5 billion at December 31, 2007. None of Occidentals committed bank credits contain material adverse change (MAC) clauses or debt rating triggers that could restrict Occidentals ability to borrow under these lines. Occidentals credit facilities and debt agreements do not contain rating triggers that could terminate bank commitments or accelerate debt in the event of a ratings downgrade. At December 31, 2007, under the most restrictive covenants of certain financing agreements, Occidentals capacity for additional unsecured borrowing was approximately $54.8 billion, and the capacity for the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on, and for acquisitions of, Occidentals capital stock was approximately $20.8 billion, assuming that such dividends, distributions and acquisitions were made without incurring additional borrowing. In May 2007, Occidental redeemed all $276 million of the outstanding principal amount of its 8.25 percent Vintage Petroleum, LLC (Vintage) senior notes due 2012. In January 2007, Occidental completed cash tender offers for its 10.125 percent senior debentures due 2009, 9.25 percent senior debentures due 2019, 8.75 percent medium term notes due 2023, 7.2 percent senior debentures due 2028 and 8.45 percent senior notes due 2029, resulting in the repurchase of a portion of these debt instruments totaling $659 million in principal amount. The redemption and repurchases resulted in a pre tax interest expense of $167 million. In the first quarter of 2005, Occidental filed a shelf registration statement for up to $1.5 billion of various securities. As of December 31, 2007, no securities had been issued under this shelf. Cash Flow Analysis In millions 2007 2006 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 6,798 $ 6,353 $ 5,337 The increase in operating cash flow in 2007, compared to 2006, resulted from higher crude oil prices and higher oil and gas production partially offset by the effects of lower chemical margins, particularly PVC, and reduced cash flow from discontinued operations. In 2007, Occidentals realized crude oil prices increased 12 percent and its oil and gas production increased by over 4 percent compared to 2006. The increase in production was mainly due to the start up of the Dolphin Project production in the third quarter of 2007. Increases in the costs of producing oil and gas, such as purchased goods and services, and higher utility, maintenance and gas plant costs, partially offset the effect of increases in realized crude oil prices. Other cost elements, such as labor costs and overhead, are not significant drivers of cash flow because they are mainly fixed within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term. These cost increases had a much smaller effect on cash flow than the higher crude oil prices and higher crude oil and natural gas production. Most major chemical prices, especially PVC, decreased in 2007, compared to 2006, which reduced chemical margins. The overall impact of the chemical price decreases on cash flow was much less significant than the increase in crude oil prices because the chemical segment earnings and cash flow are significantly smaller that those for the oil and gas segment. The significant increase in operating cash flow in 2006, compared to 2005, resulted from several factors. The most important drivers were higher crude oil prices, higher oil and gas production and, to a much lesser extent, higher chemical margins, partially offset by the effects of lower gas prices and reduced cash flow from 21 discontinued operations. In 2006, Occidentals realized crude oil prices increased by 15 percent and its oil and gas production increased by over 17 percent compared to 2005. The increase in production was mainly due to the 11 months of production from the Vintage acquisition. Increases in the costs of producing oil and gas, such as purchased goods and services, and higher utility costs, gas plant costs and ad valorem and export taxes, partially offset the effect of oil price increases. The cost increases had a smaller effect on cash flow than the higher crude oil prices and the higher crude oil and natural gas production. Most major chemical prices increased in 2006, compared to 2005, at a higher rate than ethylene costs, thereby improving chemical margins. The overall impact of the chemical price changes on cash flow was much less than for oil and gas price changes because the chemical segment earnings and cash flow are significantly smaller than those for the oil and gas segment. Other non cash charges to income in 2007 included deferred compensation, stock incentive plan amortization and environmental remediation accruals. Other non cash charges to income in 2006 included stock incentive plan amortization, deferred compensation and environmental remediation accruals. Other non cash charges to income in 2005 included chemical asset write downs, deferred compensation, stock incentive plan amortization and environmental remediation accruals. In millions 2007 2006 2005 Net cash used by investing activities $ (3,128 ) $ (4,383 ) $ (3,161 ) The 2007 amount includes cash proceeds of $672 million from the sale of 21 million shares of Lyondell, $485 million received from the sale of Occidentals interest in a Russian joint venture, $509 million from the sale of other businesses and properties, and $250 million from the sale of auction rate securities. The 2007 amount also includes the cash paid for the acquisitions of various oil and gas and chemical interests, a Permian Basin common carrier pipeline system and a gas processing plant in Texas totaling $1.4 billion. The 2006 amount includes the cash payments associated with the acquisition of Vintage and the property acquisition from Plains, partially offset by cash proceeds from the Vintage assets subsequently sold and from the sale of Lyondell shares. The 2005 amount includes the cash payments for several Permian Basin acquisitions, the acquisition of the Vulcan chlor alkali manufacturing facilities and the payments to re enter Libya and to assume operations of the Mukhaizna field in Oman. These were partially offset by the cash proceeds from the sale of the Premcor Valero shares and the Lyondell shares. Also, see the "Capital Expenditures" section below. In millions 2007 2006 2005 Net cash used by financing activities $ (3,045 ) $ (2,819 ) $ (1,187 ) The 2007 amount includes net debt payments of $1.2 billion, including the repurchase of various debt issues under cash tender offers and the redemption of the Vintage senior notes due 2012. The 2007 amount also included $1.1 billion of cash paid for repurchases of 20.6 million shares of Occidentals common stock at an average price of $54.75 per share. The 2006 amount consists of $1.5 billion of cash paid for Occidentals stock repurchase plan and net debt payments of approximately $900 million. The 2005 amount includes net debt payments of approximately $900 million. Occidental paid common stock dividends of $765 million in 2007, $646 million in 2006 and $483 million in 2005. Capital Expenditures In millions 2007 2006 2005 Oil and Gas $ 3,206 $ 2,703 $ 2,108 Chemical 251 251 173 Corporate and Other 40 33 14 Total (a) $ 3,497 $ 2,987 $ 2,295 (a) Excludes acquisitions. Amounts are included in net cash used by investing activities discussed above. Occidentals capital spending estimate for 2008 is approximately $3.8 to $3.9 billion. Most of the capital spending increase will be allocated to oil and gas exploration, production and development activities for the Colombia LCI project and the Vintage properties in Argentina and California. Commitments at December 31, 2007, for major capital expenditures during 2008 and thereafter were approximately $330 million. Occidental will fund these commitments and capital expenditures with cash from operations. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS In the course of its business activities, Occidental pursues a number of projects and transactions to meet its core business objectives. The accounting and financial statement treatment of these transactions is a result of the varying methods of funding employed. Occidental also makes commitments on behalf of unconsolidated entities. These transactions, or groups of transactions, are recorded in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and, unless otherwise noted, are not reflected on Occidentals balance sheets. The following is a description of the business purpose and nature of these transactions. Dolphin Project See "Oil and Gas Segment Business Review Middle East/North Africa Dolphin Project" for further information about the structure of the Dolphin Project. In July 2005, Dolphin Energy entered into a bridge loan in an amount of $2.45 billion. The proceeds of the new bridge loan were used to pay off amounts outstanding on a previous bridge loan and are being used to fund the construction of the Dolphin Project. 22 The new bridge loan has a term of four years, is a revolving credit facility through April 2008 and may be converted to a term loan thereafter. In September 2005, Dolphin Energy entered into an agreement with banks to provide a $1.0 billion facility to fund the construction of a certain portion of the Dolphin Project. Occidental guarantees 24.5 percent of both of these obligations of Dolphin Energy. At December 31, 2007, Occidentals portion of the bridge loan and financing facility was $816 million. Occidental had recorded $588 million on the balance sheet at December 31, 2007, for the combined bridge loan and financing facility. The remaining amounts of the bridge loan and financing facility drawdowns are discussed in the "Guarantees" section below. Ecuador In Ecuador, Occidental has a 14 percent interest in the Oleoducto de Crudos Pesados Ltd. (OCP) oil export pipeline. As of December 31, 2007, Occidentals net investment in and advances to the project totaled $69 million. Occidental reports this investment in its consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. The project was funded in part by senior project debt, which is to be repaid with the proceeds of ship or pay tariffs of certain upstream producers in Ecuador. In May 2006, Ecuador terminated Occidentals contract for the operation of Block 15, which comprised all of its oil producing operations in the country, and seized Occidentals Block 15 assets. Occidentals guarantee of its share of the ship or pay obligations provides the lenders the right to require Occidental to make an advance tariff payment as a result of the expropriation, which has not been exercised to date. At December 31, 2007, the total pre tax advance tariff of approximately $89 million was accrued in Occidentals consolidated financial statements. This advance tariff would be used by the pipeline company to service or prepay project debt. At December 31, 2007, Occidental also had obligations relating to performance bonds totaling $14 million. Leases Occidental has entered into various operating lease agreements, mainly for railcars, power plants, manufacturing facilities and office space. Occidental leases assets when it offers greater operating flexibility. Lease payments are expensed mainly as cost of sales. For more information, see the Contractual Obligations table below. Guarantees Occidental has entered into various guarantees including performance bonds, letters of credit, indemnities, commitments and other forms of guarantees provided by Occidental to third parties, mainly to provide assurance that OPC or its subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations (guarantees). At December 31, 2007, the notional amount of the guarantees that are subject to the reporting requirements of FIN 45 was approximately $250 million, which consists of Occidentals guarantee of equity investees debt, primarily from the Dolphin Project equity investment, and other commitments. Contractual Obligations The table below summarizes and cross references certain contractual obligations that are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2007 and or disclosed in the accompanying Notes. Payments Due by Year Contractual Obligations (in millions) Total 2008 2009 to 2010 2011 to 2012 2013 and thereafter Consolidated Balance Sheet Long term debt (Note 5) (a) $ 1,777 $ 35 $ 923 $ 436 $ 383 Capital leases (Note 6) 37 1 2 2 32 Other liabilities (b) 7,468 5,618 713 412 725 Other Obligations Operating leases (Note 6) (c) 1,305 207 229 151 718 Purchase obligations (d, e) 6,980 2,145 2,253 1,430 1,152 Total $ 17,567 $ 8,006 $ 4,120 $ 2,431 $ 3,010 (a) Excludes unamortized debt discount and interest expense on the debt. As of December 31, 2007, interest on long term debt totaling $767 million is payable in the following years (in millions): 2008 $105, 2009 to 2010 $149, 2011 to 2012 $112 and 2013 and thereafter $401. (b) Includes accounts payable, certain accrued liabilities and obligations under postretirement benefit and deferred compensation plans. (c) Amounts have not been reduced for sublease rental income. (d) Includes long term purchase contracts and purchase orders and contracts for goods and services used in manufacturing and producing operations in the normal course of business. Some of these arrangements involve take or pay commitments but they do not represent debt obligations. Long term material purchase contracts are discounted using a 6.4 percent discount rate. (e) Amounts exclude purchase obligations related to oil and gas marketing and trading activities where an offsetting sales position exists. LAWSUITS, CLAIMS, COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND RELATED MATTERS OPC or certain of its subsidiaries have been named in many lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings. These actions seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. OPC or certain of its subsidiaries also have been named in proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and similar federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws. These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages and civil penalties; however, Occidental is usually one of many companies in these proceedings and has to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, including environmental proceedings, Occidental accrues reserves when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. 23 Since 2004, Occidental Chemical Corporation (OCC) has been served with ten lawsuits filed in Nicaragua by approximately 2,600 individual plaintiffs. These individuals allege that they have sustained several billion dollars of personal injury damages as a result of their alleged exposure to a pesticide. OCC is aware of, but has not been served in, 23 additional cases in Nicaragua, which Occidental understands make similar allegations. In the opinion of management, the claims against OCC are without merit because, among other things, OCC believes that none of the pesticide it manufactured was ever sold or used in Nicaragua. Under the applicable Nicaraguan statute, defendants are required to pay pre trial deposits so large as to effectively prohibit defendants from participating fully in their defense. OCC filed a response to the complaints contesting jurisdiction without posting such pre trial deposit. In 2004, the judge in one of the cases (Osorio case) ruled the court had jurisdiction over the defendants, including OCC, and that the plaintiffs had waived the requirement of the pre trial deposit. In order to preserve its jurisdictional defense, OCC elected not to make a substantive appearance in the Osorio case. In 2005, the judge in the Osorio case entered judgment against several defendants, including OCC, for damages totaling approximately $97 million. In December 2006, the court in a second case in Nicaragua (Rios case) entered a judgment against several defendants, including OCC, for damages totaling approximately $800 million. While preserving its jurisdictional defenses, OCC has appealed the judgments in the Osorio and Rios cases. In September 2007, the plaintiffs in the Osorio case filed an action in state court in Florida seeking to enforce the Nicaraguan judgment. That action was removed to and is presently pending in federal court. OCC has no assets in Nicaragua and, in the opinion of management, any judgment rendered under the statute, including in the Osorio and Rios cases, would be unenforceable in the United States. During the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions. Taxable years prior to 2001 are generally closed for U.S. federal and state corporate income tax purposes. Corporate tax returns for taxable years 2001 through the current year are in various stages of audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Disputes may arise during the course of such audits as to facts and matters of law. Occidental has entered into agreements providing for future payments to secure terminal and pipeline capacity, drilling services, electrical power, steam and certain chemical raw materials. At December 31, 2007, the net present value of the fixed and determinable portion of the obligations under these agreements, which were used to collateralize financings of the respective suppliers, aggregated $52 million, which was payable as follows (in millions): 2008 $12, 2009 $10, 2010 $10, 2011 $9, 2012 $8 and thereafter $3. Fixed payments under these agreements were $18 million in 2007, $18 million in 2006 and $17 million in 2005. See "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Contractual Obligations" for further information. Occidental has certain other commitments under contracts, guarantees and joint ventures, including purchase commitments for goods and services at market related prices and certain other contingent liabilities. See "Off Balance Sheet Arrangements" for further information. Some of these commitments, although not fixed or determinable, involve capital expenditures and are part of the $3.8 to $3.9 billion in capital expenditures estimated for 2008. Occidental has indemnified various parties against specified liabilities that those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with Occidental. These indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds. As of December 31, 2007, Occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to future indemnity claims against it in connection with these transactions that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves. It is impossible at this time to determine the ultimate liabilities that OPC and its subsidiaries may incur resulting from any lawsuits, claims and proceedings, audits, commitments, contingencies and related matters or the timing of these liabilities. If these matters were to be ultimately resolved unfavorably at amounts substantially exceeding Occidentals reserves, an outcome not currently anticipated, it is possible that such outcome could have a material adverse effect upon Occidentals consolidated financial position or results of operations. However, after taking into account reserves, management does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of these matters to have a material adverse effect upon Occidentals consolidated financial position or results of operations. ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURES Occidentals operations are subject to stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to improving or maintaining environmental quality. Costs associated with environmental compliance have increased over time and are expected to rise in the future. Environmental expenditures related to current operations are factored into the overall business planning process and are considered an integral part of production in manufacturing quality products responsive to market demand. Environmental Remediation The laws that require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively to past waste disposal practices and releases of substances to the environment. In many cases, the laws apply regardless of fault, legality of the original activities or current ownership or control of sites. OPC or certain of its subsidiaries participate in environmental assessments and cleanups under these laws at currently owned facilities, previously owned sites and third party sites. Also, OPC or certain of its subsidiaries have been involved in a substantial number of governmental and private proceedings involving historical practices at various sites including, in some instances, having been named in proceedings under CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws. These proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages and civil penalties. 24 As of December 31, 2007, Occidental, through a wholly owed subsidiary, participated in or monitored ongoing or recent assessments, remediation, proceedings or information requests at 163 sites. Thirty nine of those sites are currently listed or proposed for listing by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on the National Priorities List. The following table presents Occidentals environmental remediation reserves at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, grouped by three categories of environmental remediation sites: $ amounts in millions 2007 2006 2005 # of Sites Reserve Balance # of Sites Reserve Balance # of Sites Reserve Balance CERCLA & equivalent sites 105 $ 225 105 $ 226 128 $ 236 Active facilities 17 99 21 116 18 114 Closed or sold facilities 41 133 40 70 39 68 Total 163 $ 457 166 $ 412 185 $ 418 The following table shows environmental reserve activity for the past three years: In millions 2007 2006 2005 Balance Beginning of Year $ 412 $ 418 $ 375 Remediation expenses and interest accretion 108 48 63 Changes from acquisitions 5 17 45 Payments (68 ) (71 ) (71 ) Other 6 Balance End of Year $ 457 $ 412 $ 418 Occidental expects to expend funds equivalent to about half of the current environmental reserve over the next four years and the balance over the next ten or more years. Occidental believes it is reasonably possible that it will continue to incur additional liabilities beyond those recorded for environmental remediation at these sites. The range of reasonably possible loss for existing environmental remediation matters could be up to $400 million beyond the amount accrued. For managements opinion with respect to environmental matters, refer to the "Lawsuits, Claims, Commitments, Contingencies and Related Matters" section above. CERCLA and Equivalent Sites As of December 31, 2007, OPC or certain of its subsidiaries have been named in 105 CERCLA or equivalent proceedings, as shown below. Description ($ amounts in millions) # of Sites Reserve Balance Minimal/No exposure (a) 85 $ 7 Reserves between $1 10 MM 14 47 Reserves over $10 MM 6 171 Total 105 $ 225 (a) Includes 30 sites for which Maxus Energy Corporation has retained the liability and indemnified Occidental, 6 sites where Occidental has denied liability without challenge, 31 sites where Occidentals reserves are less than $50,000 each, and 18 sites where reserves are between $50,000 and $1 million each. The six sites with individual reserves over $10 million in 2007 include a former copper mining and smelting operation in Tennessee, two closed landfills in western New York and groundwater treatment facilities at three closed chemical plants (Montague, Michigan, western New York and Tacoma, Washington). Active Facilities Certain subsidiaries of OPC are currently addressing releases of substances from past operations at 17 active facilities. Four assets a chemical plant in Louisiana, a chemical plant in Kansas and certain oil and gas properties and pipeline systems in the southwestern United States account for 69 percent of the reserves associated with these facilities. Closed or Sold Facilities There are 41 other sites formerly owned or operated by certain subsidiaries of OPC that have ongoing environmental remediation requirements in which OPC or its subsidiaries are involved. Four sites account for 70 percent of the reserves associated with this group. The four sites are: an active refinery in Louisiana where Occidental indemnifies the current owner and operator for certain remedial actions, a water treatment facility at a former coal mine in Pennsylvania, a closed chemical plant in Pennsylvania and a former phosphorous processing and recovery facility in Tennessee. Environmental Costs Occidentals costs, some of which may include estimates, relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations, are shown below for each segment: In millions 2007 2006 2005 Operating Expenses Oil and Gas $ 108 $ 95 $ 65 Chemical 80 73 67 $ 188 $ 168 $ 132 Capital Expenditures Oil and Gas $ 59 $ 55 $ 43 Chemical 14 25 21 $ 73 $ 80 $ 64 Remediation Expenses Corporate $ 107 $ 47 $ 62 Operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis. Capital expenditures relate to longer lived improvements in currently operating facilities. Remediation expenses relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and do not contribute to current or future revenue generation. Although total costs may vary in any one year, over the long term, segment operating and capital expenditures for environmental compliance generally are expected to increase. Occidental presently estimates that capital expenditures for environmental compliance will be approximately $91 million for 2008 and $93 million for 2009. 25 FOREIGN INVESTMENTS Portions of Occidentals assets are located outside of North America. At December 31, 2007, the carrying value of Occidentals assets in countries outside North America aggregated approximately $10.0 billion, or approximately 28 percent of Occidentals total assets at that date. Of such assets, approximately $5.9 billion are located in the Middle East/North Africa and approximately $4.1 billion are located in Latin America. For the year ended December 31, 2007, net sales outside North America totaled $6.3 billion, or approximately 33 percent of total net sales. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The process of preparing financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the management of Occidental to make estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions. It is possible that materially different amounts could be recorded if these estimates and judgments change or if the actual results differ from these estimates and judgments. Occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve the judgment of Occidentals management. There has been no material change to these policies over the past three years. The selection and development of these critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Oil and Gas Properties Occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties. Under this method, costs of acquiring properties, costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs are capitalized. The costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found. At the completion of drilling activities, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized if a determination is made that proved reserves have been found. If no proved reserves have been found, the costs of each of the related exploratory wells are charged to expense. In some cases, a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling, requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells. Occidentals practice is to expense the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a twelve month period after drilling is complete. Occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of commercial viability is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures. Annual lease rentals and geological, geophysical and seismic costs are expensed as incurred. Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, can be recovered in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions considering future production and development costs. Several factors could change Occidentals recorded oil and gas reserves. Occidental receives a share of production from PSCs to recover its costs and an additional share for profit. Occidentals share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise and increases when oil prices decline. Overall, Occidentals net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices. In other contractual arrangements, sustained lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of proved reserves becomes uneconomical. Estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond Occidentals control, such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs. These factors, in turn, could lead to changes in the quantity of recorded proved reserves. An additional factor that could result in a change of proved reserves is the reservoir decline rates differing from those estimated when the reserves were initially recorded. Occidentals revisions to proved reserves were negative for 2007 and amounted to approximately 3 percent of the total reserves for the year. Occidentals revisions to proved reserves were positive for 2006 and amounted to less than 1 percent of the total reserves for the year. In 2005, revisions to proved reserves were negative and amounted to less than 1 percent of the total reserves for the year. Occidentals revisions to proved reserves have been positive for seven of the last ten years. Additionally, Occidental is required to perform impairment tests pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, generally when prices decline other than temporarily, reserve estimates change significantly or other significant events occur that may impact the ability to realize the recorded asset amounts. If Occidentals consolidated oil and gas reserves were to change based on the factors mentioned above, the most significant impact would be on the DD&A rate. For example, a 5 percent increase in the amount of consolidated oil and gas reserves would change the rate from $9.61 per barrel to $9.13 per barrel, which would increase pre tax income by $100 million annually. A 5 percent decrease in the oil and gas reserves would change the rate from $9.61 per barrel to $10.09 per barrel and would result in a decrease in pre tax income of $100 million annually. DD&A of oil and gas producing properties is determined by the unit of production method and could change with revisions to estimated proved reserves. The change in the DD&A rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous proved reserve estimates has been immaterial. A portion of the carrying value of Occidentals oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties. At December 31, 2007, the capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties, net of accumulated valuation allowance, were $1.4 billion. The unproved amounts are not subject to DD&A or impairment until a determination is made as to the existence of proven reserves. As exploration and development work progresses, if reserves on these properties are proven, capitalized costs attributable to the properties will be subject to depreciation and depletion. If the exploration and development work were to be unsuccessful, the capitalized costs of the properties related to this unsuccessful work would be expensed in the year in which the determination was made. The timing of any 26 writedowns of these unproven properties, if warranted, depends upon the nature, timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results. Occidental believes its exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize the unproved property balance. Chemical Assets The most critical accounting policy affecting Occidentals chemical assets is the determination of the estimated useful lives of its PP&E. Occidentals chemical plants are depreciated using either the unit of production or straight line method, based upon the estimated useful life of the facilities. The estimated useful lives of Occidentals chemical assets, which range from 3 years to 50 years, are used to compute depreciation expense and are also used for impairment tests. The estimated useful lives used for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that Occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained. Without these continued expenditures, the useful lives of these plants could significantly decrease. Other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of Occidentals chemical plants include sustained higher or lower product prices, which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition, feedstock costs, energy prices, environmental regulations and technological changes. Occidental performs impairment tests on its assets, per SFAS No. 144, whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when managements plans change with respect to those assets. Occidentals net PP&E for chemicals is approximately $2.6 billion and its depreciation expense for 2008 is expected to be approximately $320 million. If the estimated useful lives of Occidentals chemical plants were to decrease based on the factors mentioned above, the most significant impact would be on depreciation expense. For example, a reduction in the remaining useful lives of one year would increase depreciation and reduce pre tax earnings by approximately $16 million per year. Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Reserves for estimated costs that relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future revenue generation are recorded when environmental remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. In determining the reserves and the reasonably possible range of loss, Occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience, available technology, regulations in effect, the timing of remediation and cost sharing arrangements. The environmental reserves are based on managements estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred and are reviewed periodically and adjusted as additional or new information becomes available. Environmental reserves are recorded on a discounted basis only when a reserve is initially established and the aggregate amount of the estimated costs for a specific site and the timing of cash payments are reliably determinable. The reserve methodology for a specific site is not modified once it has been established. Recoveries and reimbursements are recorded in income when receipt is probable. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, Occidental has not accrued any reimbursements or indemnification recoveries for environmental remediation matters as assets. Many factors could result in changes to Occidentals environmental reserves and reasonably possible range of loss. The most significant are: &Oslash; The original cost estimate may have been inaccurate. &Oslash; Modified remedial measures might be necessary to achieve the required remediation results. Occidental generally assumes that the remedial objective can be achieved using the most cost effective technology reasonably expected to achieve that objective. Such technologies may include air sparging or phyto remediation of shallow groundwater, or limited surface soil removal or in situ treatment producing acceptable risk assessment results. Should such remedies fail to achieve remedial objectives, more intensive or costly measures may be required. &Oslash; The remedial measure might take more or less time than originally anticipated to achieve the required contaminant reduction. Site specific time estimates can be affected by factors such as groundwater capture rates, anomalies in subsurface geology, interactions between or among water bearing zones and non water bearing zones, or the ability to identify and control contaminant sources. &Oslash; The regulatory agency might ultimately reject or modify Occidentals proposed remedial plan and insist upon a different course of action. Additionally, other events might occur that could affect Occidentals future remediation costs, such as: &Oslash; The discovery of more extensive contamination than had been originally anticipated. For some sites with impacted groundwater, accurate definition of contaminant plumes requires years of monitoring data and computer modeling. Migration of contaminants may follow unexpected pathways along geologic anomalies that could initially go undetected. Additionally, the size of the area requiring remediation may change based upon risk assessment results following site characterization or interim remedial measures. &Oslash; Improved remediation technology might decrease the cost of remediation. In particular, for groundwater remediation sites with projected long term operation and maintenance, the development of more effective treatment technology, or acceptance of alternative and more cost effective treatment methodologies such as bioremediation, could significantly affect remediation costs. &Oslash; Laws and regulations might change to impose more or less stringent remediation requirements. 27 At sites involving multiple parties, Occidental provides environmental reserves based upon its expected share of liability. When other parties are jointly liable, the financial viability of the parties, the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to Occidental of their failure to participate are evaluated when estimating Occidentals ultimate share of liability. Based on these factors, Occidental believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of other potentially responsible parties, with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, in an amount that would have a material effect on Occidentals consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Most cost sharing arrangements with other parties fall into one of the following three categories: Category 1: CERCLA or equivalent sites wherein Occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties share the cost of remediation in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations; Category 2: Oil and gas joint ventures wherein each joint venture partner pays its proportionate share of remedial cost; or Category 3: Contractual arrangements typically relating to purchases and sales of property wherein the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating the costs of environmental remediation. In all three of these categories, Occidental records as a reserve its expected net cost of remedial activities, as adjusted by recognition for any nonperforming parties. In addition to the costs of investigating and implementing remedial measures, which often take in excess of ten years at CERCLA sites, Occidentals reserves include managements estimates of the cost of operation and maintenance of remedial systems. To the extent that the remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site specific data, laws, regulations, technologies or engineering estimates, Occidental reviews and changes the reserves accordingly on a site specific basis. If the environmental reserve balance were to either increase or decrease based on the factors mentioned above, the amount of the increase or decrease would be immediately recognized in earnings. For example, if the reserve balance were to decrease by 10 percent, Occidental would record a pre tax gain of $46 million. If the reserve balance were to increase by 10 percent, Occidental would record an additional remediation expense of $46 million. Other Loss Contingencies Occidental is involved with numerous lawsuits, claims, proceedings and audits in the normal course of its operations. Occidental records a loss contingency for these matters when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In addition, Occidental discloses, in aggregate, its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred. Occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis so that they are adequately reserved on the balance sheet. These reserves are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate. Managements judgments could change based on new information, changes in laws or regulations, changes in managements plans or intentions, the outcome of legal proceedings, settlements or other factors. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING CHANGES Listed below are significant changes in accounting principles. Future Accounting Changes SFAS No. 157 In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements." This statement establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Occidental is currently assessing the effect of SFAS No. 157 on its financial statements. SFAS No. 159 In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities." This statement provides entities the option to measure certain financial instruments at fair value. SFAS No. 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Occidental is currently assessing the effect of SFAS No. 159 on its financial statements. EITF Issue No. 07 1 In December 2007, the FASB finalized the provisions of the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 07 1, "Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements." This EITF Issue provides guidance and requires financial statement disclosures for collaborative arrangements. EITF Issue No. 07 1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Occidental is currently assessing the effect of EITF Issue No. 07 1 on its financial statements but it is not expected to be material. SFAS No. 141(R) In December 2007, FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), "Business Combinations." This statement provides new accounting guidance and disclosure requirements for business combinations. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for business combinations which occur in the first fiscal year beginning on or after December 15, 2008. SFAS No. 160 In December 2007, FASB issued SFAS No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51." This statement provides new accounting guidance and disclosure and presentation requirements for noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary. SFAS No. 160 is effective for the first fiscal year beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Occidental is currently assessing the effect of SFAS No. 160 on its financial statements. 28 Recently Adopted Accounting Changes FIN No. 48 In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109." This interpretation specifies that benefits from tax positions should be recognized in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position meeting the more likely than not recognition threshold should be measured at the largest amount of benefit for which the likelihood of realization upon ultimate settlement exceeds 50 percent. Occidental adopted FIN No. 48 on January 1, 2007. The following table shows the effect of adopting FIN No. 48 on the consolidated balance sheet at January 1, 2007 (in millions): Debit/(Credit) Domestic and foreign income taxes Current $ 140 Deferred and other domestic and foreign income taxes $ (8 ) Deferred credits and other liabilities Other $ 100 Minority interest $ (13 ) Retained earnings $ (219 ) FSP AUG AIR 1 In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) AUG AIR 1, "Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities," which is effective for the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2006. This FSP prohibits the use of the accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities, which was used by certain operations of Occidental. When Occidental adopted FSP AUG AIR 1 on January 1, 2007, those operations changed to the deferral method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities. The adoption of FSP AUG AIR 1 was retrospectively applied to all periods presented and the impact to the income statements for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was immaterial. The following table shows the effects of adopting FSP AUG AIR 1 on the consolidated balance sheet at January 1, 2007 (in millions): Debit/(Credit) Prepaid expenses and other $ 1 Property, plant and equipment, net $ (16 ) Other assets $ 91 Accrued liabilities $ 43 Deferred and other domestic and foreign income taxes $ (40 ) Minority interest $ (11 ) Retained earnings $ (68 ) SFAS No. 158 In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)." This statement requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded amounts of its defined benefit pension and postretirement plans as an asset or liability and recognize changes in the funded status of these plans in the year in which the changes occur through other comprehensive income (OCI), if they are not recognized in the income statement. The statement also requires a company to use the date of its fiscal year end to measure the plans. The recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. The requirement to use the fiscal year end as the measurement date is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. Occidental adopted this statement on December 31, 2006, and recorded an additional liability of $233 million and a reduction of accumulated OCI, deferred tax liabilities, other assets and minority interest of $168 million, $104 million, $42 million and $3 million, respectively. DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES AND MARKET RISK General Occidentals market risk exposures relate primarily to commodity prices. Occidental has entered into derivative instrument transactions to reduce these price fluctuations. A derivative is an instrument that, among other characteristics, derives its value from changes in another instrument or variable. In general, the fair value recorded for derivative instruments is based on quoted market prices, dealer quotes and the Black Scholes or similar valuation models. Commodity Price Risk General Occidentals results are sensitive to fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices. Based on current levels of production, if oil prices vary overall by $1 per barrel, it would have an estimated annual effect on pre tax income of approximately $151 million. If domestic natural gas prices vary by $0.50 per Mcf, it would have an estimated annual effect on pre tax income of approximately $96 million. If production levels change in the future, the sensitivity of Occidentals results to oil and gas prices also would change. Occidentals results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices; however, changes in cost usually offset part of the effect of price changes on margins. If chlorine and caustic soda prices vary by $10/ton, it would have a pre tax annual effect on income of approximately $15 million and $30 million, respectively. If PVC prices vary by $.01/lb, it would have a pre tax annual effect on income of approximately $30 million. If ethylene dichloride (EDC) prices vary by $10/ton, it would have a pre tax annual effect on income of approximately $5 million. Historically, product price changes either precede or follow raw material and feedstock product price changes; therefore, the margin improvement of price changes can be mitigated. According to Chemical Market Associates, Inc., December 2007 average contract prices were: chlorine $323/ton, caustic soda $498/ton, PVC $0.67/lb and EDC $310/ton. Marketing and Trading Operations Occidental periodically uses different types of derivative instruments to achieve the best prices for oil and gas. Derivatives have been used by Occidental to reduce its exposure to price volatility and to mitigate fluctuations in commodity related cash flows. Occidental enters into low risk marketing and trading activities through its separate marketing organization, which operates under established policy controls and procedures. With respect to derivatives used in its oil and gas marketing operations, Occidental utilizes a 29 combination of futures, forwards, options and swaps to offset various physical transactions. Occidentals use of derivatives in marketing and trading activities relates primarily to managing cash flows from third party purchases, which includes Occidentals periodic gas storage activities. Risk Management Occidental conducts its risk management activities for energy commodities (which include buying, selling, marketing, trading, and hedging activities) under the controls and governance of its Risk Control Policy. The President and Chief Financial Officer and the Risk Management Committee, comprising members of Occidentals management, oversee these controls, which are implemented and enforced by the Trading Control Officer. The Trading Control Officer provides an independent and separate check on results of marketing and trading activities. Controls for energy commodities include limits on value at risk, limits on credit, limits on trading, segregation of duties, delegation of authority and a number of other policy and procedural controls. Fair Value of Marketing and Trading Derivative Contracts The following tables reconcile the changes in the net fair value of Occidentals marketing and trading contracts, a portion of which are hedges, during 2007 and 2006, and segregate the open contracts at December 31, 2007 by maturity periods. In millions 2007 2006 Fair value of contracts outstanding at beginning of year unrealized losses $ (355 ) $ (457 ) Losses on contracts realized or otherwise settled during the year 106 106 Changes in fair value attributable to changes in valuation techniques and assumptions Losses or other changes in fair value (327 ) (a) (4 ) Fair value of contracts outstanding at end of year unrealized losses $ (576 ) $ (355 ) (a) Primarily relates to price changes on existing production hedges. Maturity Periods Source of Fair Value unrealized (losses) gains 2008 2009 to 2010 2011 to 2012 2013 and thereafter Total Fair Value Prices actively quoted $ 131 $ 7 $ 4 $ 2 $ 144 Prices provided by other external sources 1 3 (3 ) (2 ) (1 ) Prices based on models and other valuation methods (a) (233 ) (337 ) (149 ) (719 ) Total $ (101 ) $ (327 ) $ (148 ) $ $ (576 ) (a) The underlying prices utilized for the fair value calculations of the options are based on monthly NYMEX published prices. These prices are entered into an industry standard options pricing model to determine fair value. Production Hedges In 2005, Occidental entered into a series of fixed price swaps and collar agreements that qualify as cash flow hedges for the sale of a portion of its crude oil production. Additionally, Occidental acquired oil and gas fixed price and basis swaps with the Vintage acquisition. The fixed price swaps and the basis swaps expired in 2007. The collar agreements continue to the end of 2011. The 2007 volume that was hedged was less than 3 percent of Occidentals 2007 crude oil and natural gas production. Information about these cash flow hedges, which are included in the total fair value of ($576) million in the table above, is presented in a tabular presentation below as of December 31, 2007 (volumes in thousands of barrels): Crude Oil Collars Daily Volume Average Floor Average Cap 2008 14 $34.07 $47.47 2009 13 $33.15 $47.41 2010 12 $33.00 $46.35 2011 12 $32.92 $46.27 ($ millions) Crude Oil Collars Fair value liability ($715) Quantitative Information Occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commodity based derivatives and commodity contracts used in marketing and trading activities. This method determines the maximum potential negative short term change in fair value with a 95 percent level of confidence. The marketing and trading value at risk was immaterial during all of 2007. Interest Rate Risk General Occidentals exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to its long term debt obligations. In 2005, Occidental terminated all of its interest rate swaps that were accounted for as fair value hedges. These hedges had effectively converted approximately $1.7 billion of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. The fair value of the swaps at termination resulted in a gain of approximately $20 million, which was recorded into income when the debt was paid in 2005 and 2006. The amount of interest expense recorded in the income statement was lower, as a result of the swaps and recognition of the gain, by approximately $13 million and $21 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 30 Tabular Presentation of Interest Rate Risk In millions of U.S. dollars, except rates The table below provides information about Occidentals debt obligations which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Debt amounts represent principal payments by maturity date. Year of Maturity U.S. Dollar Fixed Rate Debt U.S. Dollar Variable Rate Debt Grand Total (a) 2008 $ 35 $ $ 35 2009 96 588 684 2010 239 239 2011 68 68 2012 368 368 2013 Thereafter 337 46 383 Total $ 1,075 $ 702 $ 1,777 Average interest rate 7.10% 5.35% 6.41% Fair Value $ 1,189 $ 702 $ 1,891 (a) Excludes unamortized net discounts of $1 million. Credit Risk Occidentals energy contracts are spread among several counterparties. Creditworthiness is reviewed before doing business with a new counterparty and on an ongoing basis. Occidental monitors aggregated counterparty exposure relative to credit limits. Credit exposure for each customer is monitored for outstanding balances, current month activity, and forward mark to market exposure. Losses associated with credit risk have been immaterial for all years presented. Foreign Currency Risk A few of Occidentals foreign operations have currency risk. Occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions in foreign currencies only at levels necessary for operating purposes. Most international crude oil sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Additionally, all of Occidentals consolidated foreign oil and gas subsidiaries have the U.S. dollar as the functional currency. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, Occidental had not entered into any foreign currency derivative instruments. The effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income and is immaterial.
