Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations reviews the Companys operating results for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended May 31, 2003 (fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001), and its financial condition at May 31, 2003. This review should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Forward looking statements in this review are qualified by the cautionary statement under the heading Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 contained at the beginning of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K discusses the significant accounting policies of Paychex, Inc. The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Companys management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, fixed assets, goodwill and intangible assets, potential losses resulting from its clients inability to meet their payroll obligations, allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes, and contingencies. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under the 10 circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates. Certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to the Companys results of operations or financial position are discussed below. Revenue Recognition: Service revenues are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual service period. Professional Employer Organization (PEO) revenues are included in service revenues and are reported net of direct costs billed and incurred, which include wages, taxes, benefit premiums, and claims of PEO worksite employees. Direct costs billed and incurred for PEO worksite employees were $1,460.7 million, $1,056.9 million, and $865.7 million for fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Paychex provides delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports. The revenue earned from delivery service is included in service revenues and the costs for delivery are included in operating costs on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected before due dates from clients for payroll tax filing and payment services and employee payment services and invested (funds held for clients) until remittance to the applicable tax agencies or client employees. These collections from clients are typically remitted between 1 and 30 days after receipt, with some items extending to 90 days. The interest earned on these funds is included in total revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income because the collection, holding, and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services. Interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sale of available for sale securities. Valuation of Investments: The Companys investments in debt securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in comprehensive income as reported on the Companys Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity. However, changes in the fair value of investments impacts the Companys net income only when such investments are sold or permanent impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the securitys cost basis. Realized gains and losses from funds held for clients are included in interest on funds held for clients whereas realized gains and losses from corporate investments are included in investment income, net. The Company is exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the bonds. The Company periodically reviews its investment portfolio for potential write down due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns. Goodwill: During fiscal 2003, Paychex acquired Advantage Payroll Services, Inc. (Advantage) and InterPay, Inc. (InterPay). As a result of these purchases, the Company has recorded $393.7 million of goodwill on its Consolidated Balance Sheet at May 31, 2003. The value of this goodwill is based on an allocation of the purchase prices to assets acquired and liabilities assumed according to estimated fair values. Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill not be amortized, but instead tested for impairment on an annual basis and at interim periods if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit. Impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. Since the Companys business is largely homogeneous, the Company has determined it will be evaluated as a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing. Intangible Assets: The Companys intangible assets are primarily comprised of client list acquisitions and license agreements with independently owned associate offices. Intangible assets are amortized over periods ranging from 7 to 12 years using accelerated or straight line methods. The Company periodically reviews its intangible assets for potential impairment. Fixed Assets: The carrying value of fixed assets, including costs for software developed for internal use, reflects estimates, assumptions, and judgments relative to capitalized costs, useful lives, utilization, and salvage value. For software developed for internal use, all external direct costs for materials and services and certain payroll and related fringe costs are capitalized in accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) 98 1, 11 Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. The Company reviews the carrying value of fixed assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Accrual for Client Fund Losses: The Company maintains an accrual for estimated losses associated with its clients inability to meet their payroll obligations. As part of providing payroll, tax filing and payment services, and employee payment services, Paychex is authorized by the client to initiate money transfers from the clients account for the amount of tax obligations and employees direct deposits. Electronic money funds transfers from client bank accounts are subject to potential risk of losses resulting from clients insufficient funds to cover such transfers. The Company evaluates uncollected amounts on a specific basis and analyzes historical experience for amounts not specifically reviewed to determine the likelihood of recovery from the clients. Results of Operations For fiscal 2003, the Company completed its thirteenth consecutive year of record total revenues and net income and now services approximately 490,000 clients. The Companys financial growth continues to be adversely impacted by the effect of lower interest rates on its funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios and difficult economic conditions. In response to economic conditions, the Federal Reserve lowered the Federal Funds rate twelve times from January 2001 through May 2003 to 1.25%, for a cumulative 525 basis point reduction. In addition to the effects of interest rates, the difficult economic conditions have resulted in a lower number of checks per client as existing clients reduce their work forces. The Company experienced a .5% year over year decline in checks per client (excluding Advantage and InterPay) in fiscal 2003 compared with a year over year decline of 3.0% in fiscal 2002. The Companys results of operations for fiscal 2003 were impacted by the acquisitions of two comprehensive payroll service providers servicing small to medium sized businesses in the United States. On September 20, 2002, Paychex acquired Advantage for $314 million in cash including the redemption of preferred stock and the repayment of outstanding debt of Advantage. On April 1, 2003, Paychex acquired InterPay for $182 million in cash. These two acquisitions provided Paychex with over 82,000 new clients. The integration of Advantage and InterPay is in process. By the end of fiscal 2003, the sales forces of these companies were combined with the Paychex sales force, and the responsibility for their operations and corporate support had been integrated into the management structure of Paychex. In addition, certain branch operations were combined into existing Paychex locations, with more consolidation expected to occur in fiscal year 2004. The Companys focus has been on client service and retention. Approximately 2,000 Advantage clients have been converted to Paychex software platforms since the acquisition. The majority of these clients were not using Advantages core payroll system. The Advantage core system will be retained to service clients affiliated with independently owned associate offices and Advantage co branded products. For InterPay, it is anticipated that clients will be converted to the Paychex software platforms by the end of November 2004. The results of operations for fiscal 2003, which are summarized in the following table, include the results of Advantage and InterPay since their respective dates of acquisition. The two acquisitions contributed $61.9 million in revenues in fiscal 2003, including $58.0 million of service revenues and $3.9 million of interest on funds held for clients. Operating, selling, general, and administrative expenses for Advantage and InterPay totaled $55.2 million, including $6.7 million for amortization of intangible assets. In the second quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company realized approximately $7.0 million of gains from the sale of corporate investments 12 to fund the acquisition of Advantage. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, approximately $3.5 million of gains were realized from the sale of corporate investments to fund the acquisition of InterPay.

Payroll service revenues are earned primarily from payroll processing, tax filing and payment services, employee payment services, and other ancillary services. Human Resource and Benefits service revenues are earned primarily from Retirement Services, Workers Compensation Insurance Administration, Section 125 Plan Administration, and Paychex Administrative Services and Professional Employer Organization bundled services. The increase in Payroll service revenues in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 is due to the acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay, organic client base growth, increased utilization of ancillary services by both new and existing clients, and price increases. The increase in Payroll service revenues in fiscal 2002 compared with fiscal 2001 is attributable to organic client base growth, increased utilization of ancillary services by both new and existing clients, and price increases. Organic client growth was slightly less than 5% in fiscal 2003 and slightly less than 4% in fiscal 2002. Payroll service revenues continue to be impacted by year over year 14 changes in checks per client. The year over year changes in checks per client (excluding Advantage and InterPay) are as follows: Fiscal 2003 Fiscal 2002 First quarter (1.7 )% (1.9 )% Second quarter (.3 )% (3.8 )% Third quarter (.1 )% (4.1 )% Fourth quarter .3 % (2.6 )% Full fiscal year (.5 )% (3.0 )% As of May 31, 2003, 87% of all clients utilized the Companys tax filing and payment services, compared with 85% at the end of 2002 and 83% at the end of 2001. The Company believes the client utilization percentage of the tax filing and payment services is near maturity. The Companys employee payment services were utilized by 60% of its clients at May 31, 2003 compared with 57% at the end of 2002 and 53% at the end of 2001. More than 90% of new clients purchase the Companys tax filing and payment services and more than 70% of new clients purchase employee payment services. Major Market Services revenues totaled $101.7 million, $71.7 million, and $47.4 million for fiscal years 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. This represents year over year revenue growth of 42% for fiscal 2003 and 51% for fiscal 2002. Approximately one third of new Major Market Services clients are conversions from the Companys Core Payroll service. The increases in Human Resource and Benefits service revenues in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 are primarily related to increases in the number of clients utilizing Retirement Services products and increases in Paychex Administrative Services (PAS) and Professional Employer Organization (PEO) client employees serviced. The increase in Retirement Services clients reflects the continuing interest of small to medium sized businesses in offering retirement savings benefits to their employees. Retirement Services revenues totaled $66.7 million, $56.5 million, and $43.3 million in fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. This represents year over year revenue growth of 18% for fiscal 2003 and 30% for fiscal 2002. The Company serviced over 26,000 and over 23,000 Retirement Services clients at May 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Paychex Administrative Services (PAS) product is a combined package of payroll, employer compliance, employee benefit administration, and risk management outsourcing services designed to make it easier for small businesses to manage their payroll and benefit costs. The Companys PEO product provides primarily the same bundled services as the PAS product, but with Paychex acting as a co employer of the clients employees. The PEO service is available primarily in the states of Florida and Georgia, where PEOs are more prevalent. Sales of the PAS and PEO products have been strong, with administrative fee revenues from these products increasing 40% and 41% for fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively. The PAS and PEO products serviced over 103,000 and over 80,000 client employees as of May 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decline in interest on funds held for clients in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 is the result of lower average interest rates earned and a decrease in net realized gains on the sale of available for sale securities, offset somewhat by higher average portfolio balances. In fiscal 2002, interest on funds held for clients declined when compared to fiscal 2001 due to lower average interest rates earned offset by higher net realized gains and higher average portfolio balances. The higher average portfolio balances were driven by the acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay in fiscal 2003 and from the growth in the utilization of the Companys tax filing and payment services and employee payment services in both fiscal 2003 and 2002. The increase in consolidated operating, selling, general, and administrative expenses in fiscal 2003 is due in part to the acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay. The remaining increase in fiscal 2003 and the increase in fiscal 2002 are due to investments in personnel, information technology, and facility costs to support the organic growth of the Company. At May 31, 2003, the Company had approximately 8,850 employees compared with approximately 7,400 at the end of fiscal 2002. Investment income, net primarily represents earnings from the Companys cash and cash equivalents and investments in available for sale investment securities. Investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients, which is included in total revenues. The decrease in investment income in fiscal 2003 15 compared with fiscal 2002 is primarily due to a decrease in average daily invested balances and lower average interest rates earned, offset by higher net realized gains on sales of available for sale securities. The increase in investment income in fiscal 2002 compared with fiscal 2001 is primarily due to net realized gains on the sale of available for sale securities and the increase in average daily invested balances, offset by lower average interest rates earned. The decrease in average daily invested balances and higher realized gains in fiscal 2003 are primarily the result of the sale of corporate investments to fund the Advantage and InterPay acquisitions. The Company estimates the use of corporate investments to fund the two acquisitions reduced investment income by approximately $7.6 million in fiscal 2003. The effective income tax rate was 32.0% in fiscal 2003 compared with 30.5% in fiscal 2002 and 30.0% in fiscal 2001. The increases in the effective income tax rate are primarily the result of lower levels of tax exempt income, which is derived primarily from municipal debt securities in the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios. Fiscal 2004s effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 32.5%. Despite the impact of lower interest rates and difficult economic conditions, income before taxes was 39% of total revenues during fiscal 2003, compared with 41% in fiscal 2002 and 42% in fiscal 2001. Operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) increased 16% in fiscal 2003 and 19% in fiscal 2002 to $348.0 million and $301.0 million, respectively. Outlook The Company has based its fiscal 2004 expectations on current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. For fiscal 2004, the Company projects Payroll service revenue growth in the range of 15% to 17%, reflecting the full year benefits of the acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay, and Human Resource and Benefits service revenue growth in the range of 21% to 23%. Total service revenue growth is anticipated to be in the range of 16% to 18%. The Company expects interest on funds held for clients (including realized gains) to be flat in fiscal 2004 and corporate investment income to be down approximately 45% primarily due to the sale of investments to fund the acquisitions in fiscal 2003. Taking the factors mentioned above into consideration, the Company anticipates achieving record total revenues and net income for fiscal 2004. Total revenue growth is estimated to be in the range of 15% to 17% (10% to 12% without Advantage and InterPay) accompanied by net income growth of approximately 10%. The impact of lower interest rates will continue to moderate year over year growth. In addition, the Company estimates that growth in operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) will be in the range of 15% to 20% for fiscal 2004. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company has historically funded its operations, capital purchases, purchases of corporate investments, and dividend payments primarily through cash generated from its operating activities. The acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay in fiscal 2003 were funded entirely by the Companys cash and corporate investments. At May 31, 2003, the Company had $381 million in available cash and corporate investments. Current cash and corporate investments and projected operating cash flows are expected to support normal business operations, purchases of property and equipment, and current dividend payments. The Company has two available, uncommitted, unsecured lines of credit from various banks totaling $140 million at market rates of interest. The Company also has an available, uncommitted, secured line of credit from a bank totaling $350 million at a market rate of interest. No amounts were outstanding against these lines of credit during fiscal 2003 or at May 31, 2003. At May 31, 2003, the Company had a letter of credit outstanding totaling $7.1 million required by certain PEO workers compensation insurance policies. 16 As of May 31, 2003, the Company has contractual obligations under operating lease agreements. Future minimum lease payments under various non cancelable operating leases with terms of more than one year are as follows: In thousands Fiscal year ended May 31, Minimum lease payments 2004 $ 34,753 2005 $ 30,345 2006 $ 24,117 2007 $ 18,801 2008 $ 15,122 Thereafter $ 22,139 At May 31, 2003, the Company had outstanding commitments to purchase $6.7 million of capital assets. The Company enters into various purchase commitments with vendors in the ordinary course of business. Operating activities In thousands 2003 Change 2002 Change 2001 Change Operating cash flows $ 373,708 23.0 % $ 303,821 $ 304,938 22.5 % The increase in operating cash flows in fiscal 2003 reflects higher net income and cash provided by working capital. Operating cash flows in fiscal 2002 were comparable with fiscal 2001 as higher net income was offset by higher uses of working capital. The fluctuations in working capital between periods were primarily related to the timing of payments for payroll related, income tax, and other liabilities, and the timing of payments for PEO and PAS payroll liabilities. Investing activities In thousands 2003 Change 2002 Change 2001 Change Net funds held for clients and corporate investment activities $ 358,207 $ (94,728 ) 34.3 % $ (144,270 ) Purchases of property and equipment (60,212 ) 10.7 % (54,378 ) 20.2 % (45,250 ) 32.5 % Proceeds from the sale of property and equipment 17 14 32 Acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired (492,594 ) Purchases of other assets (3,874 ) 78.9 % (2,166 ) 73.9 % (8,290 ) 19.0 % Net cash used in investing activities $ (198,456 ) 31.2 % $ (151,258 ) 23.5 % $ (197,778 ) 7.4 % Funds held for clients and corporate investments: Funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short term funds and available for sale debt securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of available for sale debt securities. The portfolio of funds held for clients and corporate investments is detailed in Note D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of collecting client funds, and the related remittance of funds to tax authorities for tax filing and payment service clients and employees of clients utilizing employee payment services. Fluctuations in net funds held for clients and corporate investment activities primarily relate to timing of purchases, sales, or maturities of corporate investments. During fiscal 2003, corporate investments were sold to fund the acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay. Additional discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in Item 7A of this Form 10 K. 17 Purchases of property and equipment: To support the Companys continued client and ancillary product growth, purchases of property and equipment were made for data processing equipment and software, and for the expansion and upgrade of various operating facilities. In fiscal 2003, the Company made purchases of property and equipment of $60.2 million, compared with $54.4 million of purchases in fiscal 2002 and $45.3 million in fiscal 2001. Purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2004 are expected to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million. Fiscal 2004 depreciation expense is projected to be in the range of $40 million to $42 million. The capital expenditures in fiscal 2003 include the purchase of a 220,000 square foot facility in Rochester, New York. In the second quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company placed into service a consolidated data center to enhance data processing and disaster recovery capabilities. Purchases of data processing equipment, software, and building improvements in fiscal 2003 and 2002 for the data center were approximately $12.2 million and $18.3 million, respectively. During fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002, the Company purchased approximately $2.6 million and $11.2 million, respectively, of data processing equipment and software from EMC Corporation, whose President and Chief Executive Officer is a member of the Board of Directors of Paychex. Financing activities In thousands, except per share amounts 2003 Change 2002 Change 2001 Change Dividends paid $ (165,448 ) 5.1 % $ (157,481 ) 27.9 % $ (123,112 ) 50.9 % Proceeds from exercise of stock options 8,170 61.2 % 21,031 44.0 % 14,600 29.9 % Net cash used in financing activities $ (157,278 ) 15.3 % $ (136,450 ) 25.7 % $ (108,512 ) 54.1 % Cash dividends per common share $ .44 4.8 % $ .42 27.3 % $ .33 50.0 % Dividends paid: In October 2001, the Board of Directors approved a 22.2% increase in the quarterly dividend payment to $.11 per share from $.09 per share. In October 2000, the Board of Directors approved a 50% increase in the quarterly dividend payment to $.09 per share from $.06 per share. The dividends paid as a percentage of net income totaled 56%, 57%, and 48% in fiscal 2003, fiscal 2002, and fiscal 2001, respectively. Future dividends are dependent on the Companys future earnings and cash flow and are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. Proceeds from exercise of stock options: The decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in fiscal 2003 is primarily due to the decrease in number of shares exercised. The increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in fiscal 2002 is due to an increase in the number of shares exercised and an increase in the comparable average exercise price per share. Shares exercised in fiscal 2003 were 839,000 compared with 2,212,000 shares in fiscal 2002 and 1,878,000 shares in fiscal 2001. The Company has recognized a tax benefit from the exercise of stock options of $5.5 million, $24.1 million, and $26.4 million for fiscal 2003, fiscal 2002, and fiscal 2001, respectively. This tax benefit reduces the accrued income tax liability and increases additional paid in capital, with no impact on the expense amount for income taxes. See Note G of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for additional disclosure on the Companys stock option plans. Other New accounting pronouncements: In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires companies to record a liability at fair value for asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset. This Statement is effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning June 1, 2003. The Company does not 18 believe adoption of this Statement will result in a material impact to its results of operations or financial position. In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, which provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of. The Company adopted this Statement in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 with no material impact to its results of operations or financial position. In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections. SFAS No. 145 clarifies guidance related to the reporting of gains and losses from extinguishment of debt and resolves inconsistencies related to the required accounting treatment of certain lease modifications. This Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. The Company adopted this Statement in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 with no material impact to its results of operations or financial position. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity, under which a liability is recognized solely based on an entitys commitment to a plan. SFAS No. 146 requires a liability for these costs to be recognized and measured at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred. This statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, establishes accounting and reporting standards for stock based employee compensation plans. As permitted by SFAS No. 123, the Company accounts for such arrangements under Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. Accordingly, no compensation expense is recognized for stock option grants because the exercise price of the stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the previous disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported financial results and requires these disclosures in interim financial information. The Company continues to account for stock based employee compensation under APB Opinion 25, but has adopted the new disclosure requirements of SFAS 148 beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market Risk Factors Interest rate risk: Funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short term funds and available for sale debt securities, whereas corporate investments are primarily comprised of available for sale debt securities. The Companys available for sale debt securities are exposed to interest rate risk as interest rate volatility will cause fluctuations in the market value of held investments and the earnings potential of future investments. Increases in interest rates normally decrease the market value of the available for sale securities, while decreases in interest rates increase the market value of the available for sale securities. The Companys available for sale securities and short term funds are exposed to earnings risk from changes in interest rates, as rate volatility will cause fluctuations in the earnings potential of future investments. Increases in interest rates quickly increase earnings from short term funds, and over time increase earnings from the available for sale securities portfolio. Decreases in interest rates have the opposite earnings effect on the available for sale securities and short term funds. Earnings from the available for sale securities do not reflect changes in rates until the investments are sold or mature, and the proceeds are reinvested at current rates. The immediate impact of changing interest rates on earnings from short term funds may be temporarily offset by realized gains or losses from transactions in the Companys available for sale portfolio. 19 The Company directs investments towards high credit quality, tax exempt securities to mitigate the risk that earnings from the portfolio could be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates in the near term. The Company invests in short to intermediate term, fixed rate municipal and government securities, which typically have lower interest rate volatility, and normally manages the securities portfolio to a benchmark duration of 2.5 to 3.0 years. The Company does not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. The following table summarizes the changes in the Federal Funds rate over the last three fiscal years: 2003 2002 2001 Federal Funds rate beginning of fiscal year 1.75 % 4.00 % 6.50 % Rate decrease: First quarter (.50 ) Second quarter (.50 ) (1.50 ) Third quarter (.25 ) (1.00 ) Fourth quarter (1.50 ) Federal Funds rate end of fiscal year 1.25 % 1.75 % 4.00 % Three year AAA municipal securities yields end of fiscal year 1.40 % 2.75 % 3.44 % On June 25, 2003, the Federal Funds rate was decreased by .25% to 1.00%. Calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, daily interest rate changes, seasonal variations in investment balances, actual duration of short and intermediate term investments, the proportional mix of taxable and tax exempt investments, and changes in tax exempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates, which are not synchronized or simultaneous. Subject to these factors, a 25 basis point change generally affects the Companys tax exempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points. The total investment portfolio is expected to average approximately $2.90 billion in fiscal 2004. The Companys normal and anticipated allocation is approximately 50% invested in short term securities with a duration of less than 30 days and 50% invested in intermediate term municipal securities with an average duration of three years. The Company estimates that the earnings effect of a 25 basis point change in interest rates (17 basis points for tax exempt investments) at this point in time would be approximately $3.0 million for fiscal 2004. The combined funds held for clients and corporate available for sale investment portfolios reflected unrealized gains of $45.0 million at May 31, 2003 compared with $26.7 million at May 31, 2002 and $20.5 million at May 31, 2001. During fiscal 2003, the unrealized gain position ranged from approximately $22.3 million to $49.7 million. The range of unrealized gains in fiscal 2002 was $7.5 million to $35.9 million. The unrealized gain position of the Companys investment portfolios was approximately $24.9 million at July 30, 2003. As of May 31, 2003 and May 31, 2002, the Company had $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, invested in available for sale securities at fair value, with weighted average yields to maturity of 3.1% and 3.6%, respectively. Assuming a hypothetical increase in both short term and intermediate term interest rates of 25 basis points, the resulting potential decrease in fair value for the portfolio of securities at May 31, 2003 would be approximately $8.0 million. Conversely, a corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable increase in fair value. This hypothetical decrease or increase in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolios recorded value, with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders equity, and with no related or immediate impact to the results of operations. Credit risk: The Company is exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the bonds. The Company attempts to limit credit risk by investing primarily in AAA and AA rated securities and A 1 rated short term securities, and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single instrument. At May 31, 2003, available for sale and short term securities held at least an A 1 or equivalent rating, with approximately 99% of available for sale securities holding an AA rating or better. 20
