Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations reviews the operating results of Paychex, Inc. (we, our, or us) for each of the three fiscal years ended May 31, 2006 (fiscal 2006), May 31, 2005 (fiscal 2005), and May 31, 2004 (fiscal 2004), and our financial condition at May 31, 2006. This review should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K (Form 10 K) and the Risk Factors discussed in Item 1A of this Form 10 K. Forward looking statements in this review are qualified by the cautionary statement under the heading Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 contained at the beginning of Part I of this Form 10 K. 12 Table of Contents Overview We are a leading provider of comprehensive payroll and integrated human resource and employee benefits outsourcing solutions for small to medium sized businesses. Our Payroll and Human Resource Services product lines offer a portfolio of products and services that allow our clients to meet their diverse payroll and human resource needs. Our Payroll services are provided through either our Core Payroll or Major Market Services (MMS) and include: payroll processing; payroll tax administration services; employee payment services; and other payroll related services including regulatory compliance (new hire reporting and garnishment processing). MMS is utilized by clients that have more complex payroll and benefits needs. While MMS is focused on the more than fifty employees market segment, MMS has many clients with less than fifty employees that have more complex payroll requirements. Our Human Resource Services primarily include: comprehensive human resource administrative services, which include Paychex Premiersm Human Resources (Paychex Premier) and our Professional Employer Organization (PEO); retirement services administration; workers compensation insurance administration; employee benefits administration; time and attendance solutions; and other human resource products and services. We earn revenue primarily through recurring fees for services performed related to our products. Service revenue is primarily driven by the number of clients, utilization of ancillary services, and checks or transactions per client per pay period. We also earn interest on funds held for clients between the time of collection from our clients and remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees. Our strategy is focused on achieving strong long term financial performance while providing high quality, timely, accurate, and affordable services, growing our client base, increasing utilization of our ancillary services, and leveraging our technological and operating infrastructure. Fiscal 2006 was our sixteenth consecutive year of record total revenue, net income, and diluted earnings per share. Our financial results for fiscal 2006 included the following highlights: Net income increased 26% to $464.9 million. We achieved $1.22 diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2006, an increase of 26%. Total revenue increased 16% to $1,674.6 million. Payroll service revenue increased 10% to $1,248.9 million. Human Resource Services revenue increased 29% to $324.9 million. Operating income increased 22% to $649.6 million. Operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients increased 16% to $548.8 million. Cash flow from operations increased 22% to $569.2 million. Dividends of $231.5 million were paid to stockholders, representing 50% of net income. 13 Table of Contents Our financial performance in fiscal 2006 was largely due to strong service revenue growth of 14%. This growth in service revenue was attributable to growth in client base, check volume, and utilization of ancillary services. Our financial performance was also positively impacted by the effects of increases in interest rates earned on our funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios. The Federal Reserve increased the Federal Funds rate by 200 basis points in fiscal 2005 and by another 200 basis points in fiscal 2006 to a rate of 5.00% at May 31, 2006. Our combined interest on funds held for clients and corporate investment income increased 73% for fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2006, our combined portfolios earned an average rate of return of 3.2%, increased from 2.2% in fiscal 2005 and 1.8% in fiscal 2004. The impact of changing interest rates and related risks is discussed in more detail in the Market Risk Factors section in Item 7A of this Form 10 K. We continue to make investments in our business as part of our growth strategy. Some of these investments include the following: Growing the client base and increasing utilization of ancillary services: Our client base increased to approximately 543,000 clients at May 31, 2006. This compares with approximately 522,000 clients at May 31, 2005, and approximately 505,000 clients at May 31, 2004. Client growth was approximately 4.0% for fiscal 2006, compared with approximately 3.5% for fiscal 2005. We have continued to invest in our direct sales force, as we believe there is opportunity for growth within our target market of small to medium sized businesses. The approximate composition of our direct sales force is summarized in the following table: Expected For fiscal year ended May 31, 2007 Change 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 Core Payroll (including international) 1,190 7 % 1,115 6 % 1,050 7 % 985 MMS payroll 225 15 % 195 15 % 170 13 % 150 Human Resources/ Retirement Services 285 19 % 240 9 % 220 10 % 200 Paychex Premier and PEO 190 19 % 160 14 % 140 33 % 105 Licensed agents for workers compensation and health and benefits 110 57 % 70 40 % 50 25 % 40 Time and attendance solutions 35 40 % 25 25 % 20 100 % Total sales representatives 2,035 13 % 1,805 9 % 1,650 12 % 1,480 We believe there are opportunities for growth within our current client base, as well as with new clients, through increased utilization of our payroll related and human resource ancillary services. Ancillary services effectively leverage payroll processing data and, therefore, are beneficial to our operating margin. Penetration of our payroll tax administration services has continued to increase, and was 92% at May 31, 2006, compared with 90% at May 31, 2005, and 89% at May 31, 2004. Employee payment services penetration has increased to 68% at May 31, 2006, compared with 65% at May 31, 2005, and 63% at May 31, 2004. Our client bases in the Human Resource Services areas have continued to grow, as shown in the following table: As of May 31, 2006 2005 2004 Retirement Services clients 38,000 33,000 29,000 Workers compensation insurance clients 52,000 44,000 37,000 Paychex Premier worksite employees 236,000 171,000 106,000 PEO worksite employees 59,000 54,000 51,000 Product and service initiatives: During fiscal 2006, we made investments to broaden our portfolio of products and services and expand into new markets, and: Enhanced our 401(k) recordkeeping service, allowing our clients use of our recordkeeping with significantly expanded investment choices. 14 Table of Contents Developed an online time and labor management tool to be added to our suite of time and attendance solutions to better serve our MMS clients. Continued our expansion within Germany. Expanded our health benefits nationwide, simplifying the process for our clients in obtaining coverage through our network of national and regional insurers. Released our Health Savings Account product, which serves as a tax savings tool for employers and employees, allowing individuals to save money tax free to pay for qualified medical expenses now and in the future. This provides a means to manage rising insurance premiums. Business acquisitions: We will supplement our growth through strategic acquisition when opportunities arise. In the fiscal year ended May 31, 2003, we expanded our client base through the acquisitions of Advantage Payroll Services, Inc. (Advantage) and InterPay, Inc. (InterPay). In fiscal 2004, the acquisition of substantially all the assets and certain liabilities of Stromberg LLC (Stromberg) along with the acquisition of Strombergs Time In A Box product, allowed us to expand our product offering to include time and attendance solutions and thus offer value added products and services to payroll and non payroll clients. We currently have no definitive agreements or current plans with respect to any material prospective acquisition. Focus on customer service: We have always focused on customer service and the maximization of client retention. Fiscal 2006 client retention is at record levels of slightly less than 80% of our beginning client base. The most significant factor contributing to client losses is companies going out of business. In fiscal 2006, we reduced the number of clients per payroll specialist due to our commitment to continuously improve client service. Financial position: At May 31, 2006, we maintained a strong financial position with total cash and corporate investments of $577.4 million. We also had $384.5 million in long term corporate investments at May 31, 2006. Our primary source of cash is our ongoing operations. Cash flow from operations was $569.2 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $466.6 million in fiscal 2005. Historically, we have funded our operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments from our operating activities. It is anticipated that current cash and corporate investment balances, along with projected operating cash flows, will support our normal business operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments for the foreseeable future. For further analysis of our results of operations for fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004, and our financial position at May 31, 2006, refer to the tables and analysis in the Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources sections of this Item 7 and the discussion in the Critical Accounting Policies section of this Item 7. Outlook Our current outlook for the full fiscal year ended May 31, 2007 (fiscal 2007) is based upon current economic conditions and interest rate levels as of May 31, 2006, and is summarized as follows: Payroll service revenue growth is projected to be in the range of 9% to 11%. Human Resource Services revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 20% to 23%. Total service revenue growth is projected to be in the range of 11% to 13%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to increase approximately 28% to 30%. Total revenue growth is estimated to be in the range of 12% to 14%. Corporate investment income is anticipated to increase approximately 45% to 50%. Stock based compensation costs will be primarily included in selling, general and administrative expenses and are expected to impact pre tax and net income in the range of 4% to 5%. 15 Table of Contents The effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 31.0%. Net income growth is expected to be in the range of 12% to 14%. Purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2007 are expected to be in the range of $85 million to $90 million, in line with our growth rates. Fiscal 2007 depreciation expense is projected to be approximately $55 million, and we project amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2007 to be approximately $14 million. Our projections are based on current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. We estimate that the earnings effect of a 25 basis point change in interest rates (17 basis points for tax exempt investments) at the beginning of fiscal 2007 would be in the range of $4.5 million to $5.0 million for fiscal 2007. The total investment portfolio (funds held for clients and corporate investments) is expected to average approximately $4.5 billion in fiscal 2007. Given current accounting interpretations, in order to preserve the accounting treatment on available for sale securities of recording market value fluctuations through comprehensive income instead of through the income statement, we do not expect to realize any losses in the investment portfolios in fiscal 2007.

Revenue: The increases in Payroll service revenue in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005, and in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004, were primarily attributable to growth in clients, check volume, and utilization of our ancillary services. As of May 31, 2006, 92% of all clients utilized our payroll tax administration services, compared with 90% at May 31, 2005, and 89% at May 31, 2004. We believe our client utilization percentage of these services is near maturity. Our employee payment services were utilized by 68% of our clients at May 31, 2006, compared with 65% at May 31, 2005, and 63% at May 31, 2004. More than 95% of new clients purchase our payroll tax administration services and more than 75% of new clients purchase our employee payment services. MMS revenue increased 27% for both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 to $225.0 million and $176.9 million, respectively. Approximately one third of our new MMS clients are conversions from our Core Payroll service. We had over 33,000 MMS clients at May 31, 2006. Human Resource Services revenue increased 29% in fiscal 2006 and 26% in fiscal 2005 as a result of higher revenue from the following services: We have continued to see growth in the number of clients utilizing our Retirement Services product. Retirement Services revenue increased 16% for fiscal 2006 and 17% for fiscal 2005 to $106.1 million and $91.4 million, respectively. We serviced over 38,000 and over 33,000 Retirement Services clients at May 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 17 Table of Contents Sales of our Paychex Premier product, a comprehensive payroll and integrated human resource and employee benefits outsourcing solution for small to medium sized businesses, have been strong, as administrative fee revenue from this product increased 57% for fiscal 2006 and 66% for fiscal 2005 to $52.6 million and $33.6 million, respectively. The increases in administrative fee revenue were driven primarily by client growth. Administrative fee revenue in fiscal 2006 also benefited from the implementation of initial enrollment fees, effective May 1, 2005. As of May 31, 2006, our Paychex Premier product serviced over 236,000 client employees, as compared with over 171,000 client employees at May 31, 2005. Revenue from the PEO product increased 25% for fiscal 2006 and 14% for fiscal 2005 to $67.1 million and $53.7 million, respectively. This was the result of growth in clients and client employees served, price increases, and favorable fluctuations in workers compensation claims experience. As of May 31, 2006, our PEO product serviced approximately 59,000 client employees, as compared with over 54,000 client employees at May 31, 2005. Our PEO product provides essentially the same services as Paychex Premier, except we serve as a co employer of the clients employees, assume the risks and rewards of workers compensation insurance, and provide more sophisticated health care offerings to PEO clients. The PEO product is available primarily for clients domiciled in Florida and Georgia, where the utilization of PEOs is more prevalent than other areas of the United States (U.S.). Due to the characteristics of the PEO product, the revenue and profits from this product can fluctuate significantly between quarters. These fluctuations primarily relate to the assumption of the risks and rewards of workers compensation insurance and, to a lesser extent, the other offerings unique to the PEO product. The risks and rewards of workers compensation insurance are derived from actuarial changes in estimated losses under workers compensation policies as the result of actual claims experience under our workers compensation policies and changes in workers compensation legislation by the state of Florida. Revenue from other Human Resource Services increased 36% for fiscal 2006 and 33% for fiscal 2005 to $99.0 million and $72.5 million, respectively. This was the result of increases in revenue from time and attendance solutions, state unemployment services, and employee handbooks. Other Human Resource Services revenue growth in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 also reflected the benefit of revenue from the April 2004 acquisition of Stromberg time and attendance solutions. The increase in interest on funds held for clients in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 is the result of higher average interest rates earned in fiscal 2006 and higher average portfolio balances. The increase in interest on funds held for clients in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 is the result of higher average interest rates earned in fiscal 2005 and higher average portfolio balances, offset by lower net realized gains on the sales of available for sale securities. The higher average portfolio balances in both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 were driven by client base growth, wage inflation, check volume growth within our current client base, and increased utilization of our payroll tax administration services and employee payment services. See the Market Risk Factors section, contained in Item 7A of this Form 10 K, for more information on changing rates. 18 Table of Contents Combined Operating and SG&A Expenses: The following table summarizes total combined operating and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the fiscal year ended May 31: In millions 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 Compensation related expenses $ 656.8 15 % $ 571.4 12 % $ 510.2 Facilities (excluding depreciation) expenses 48.3 10 % 44.1 3 % 45.3 Depreciation of property and equipment 51.6 12 % 46.2 18 % 39.2 Amortization of intangible assets 14.9 6 % 15.8 5 % 16.6 Other expenses 253.4 8 % 233.8 9 % 213.9 1,025.0 12 % 911.3 10 % 825.2 Expense charge to increase legal reserve 0 % 100 % 35.8 Total operating and SG&A expenses $ 1,025.0 12 % $ 911.3 6 % $ 861.0 As a % of total service revenue 65.1 % 65.8 % 69.4 % Combined operating and SG&A expenses increased 12% in fiscal 2006 and 10% in fiscal 2005, excluding the expense charge to increase the legal reserve in fiscal 2004. The increases in both fiscal 2006 and in fiscal 2005 were the result of our continued investment in information technology to create more efficient processes and systems as well as investment in personnel and other costs to support organic growth. During fiscal 2006, total expenses were affected by a strong sales year as our sales force exceeded its targets resulting in higher than normal levels of sales expense, continued investments in new products and services, geographic expansion within Germany, and other expenditures to continually improve client service. Fiscal 2005 growth was impacted by additional expenses as a result of our April 2004 acquisition of Stromberg. At May 31, 2006, we had approximately 10,900 employees compared with approximately 10,000 at May 31, 2005 and 9,400 at May 31, 2004. Depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings, furniture and fixtures, data processing equipment, and software. Depreciation expense increased in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 due to the purchase in May 2005 of a 127,000 square foot building in Rochester, New York and higher levels of capital expenditures. Amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client lists obtained from previous acquisitions, which are amortized using accelerated methods. Other expenses include items such as delivery, forms and supplies, communications, travel and entertainment, professional services, and other costs incurred to support our business. Operating Income: Operating income year over year growth was 22% for fiscal 2006 and 23% for fiscal 2005. The increases in operating income in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 are attributable to the factors previously discussed. Investment Income, Net: Investment income, net primarily represents earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and investments in available for sale securities. Investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients, which is included in total revenue. The increase in investment income in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 is mainly due to higher average interest rates earned in fiscal 2006 and higher average portfolio balances resulting from investment of cash generated from ongoing operations. The decrease in investment income in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 is mainly due to lower net realized gains on sales of available for sale securities and lower average interest rates earned on longer term investments, offset by an increase in average daily balances. Income Taxes: Our effective income tax rate was 31.1% in fiscal 2006, compared with 32.5% in fiscal 2005, and 32.6% in fiscal 2004. The decrease in our effective income tax rate in fiscal 2006 was primarily the result of higher levels of tax exempt income, which is derived primarily from municipal debt securities in the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios and a lower effective state income tax rate. See Note H of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, for additional disclosures on income taxes. 19 Table of Contents Net Income: Net income growth was 26% for fiscal 2006 and 22% for fiscal 2005. The increases in net income for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 are attributable to the factors previously discussed. Liquidity and Capital Resources At May 31, 2006, our principal source of liquidity was $577.4 million of cash and corporate investments. We also had $384.5 million in long term corporate investments at May 31, 2006. Current cash and corporate investments and projected operating cash flows are expected to support our normal business operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments for the foreseeable future. Commitments and Contractual Obligations We have unused borrowing capacity available under four uncommitted, secured, short term lines of credit with financial institutions at market rates of interest as follows: Financial institution Amount available Expiration date JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. $ 350 million February 2007 Fleet National Bank, a Bank of America company $ 250 million February 2007 PNC Bank, National Association $ 150 million February 2007 Wells Fargo Bank, National Association $ 150 million February 2007 Our credit facilities are evidenced by Promissory Notes and are secured by separate Pledge Security Agreements by and between Paychex, Inc. and each of the financial institutions (the Lenders), pursuant to which we have granted each of the Lenders a security interest in certain of our investment securities accounts. The collateral is maintained in a pooled custody account pursuant to the terms of a Control Agreement and is to be administered under an Intercreditor Agreement among the Lenders. Under certain circumstances, individual Lenders may require that collateral be transferred from the pooled account into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual Lenders. The primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet short term funding requirements related to deposit account overdrafts and client fund deposit obligations arising from electronic payment transactions on behalf of our clients in the ordinary course of business, if necessary. No amounts were outstanding against these lines of credit during fiscal 2006 or at May 31, 2006. We had standby letters of credit outstanding totaling $53.4 million at May 31, 2006, required to secure commitments for certain of our insurance policies. These letters of credit expire at various dates between July 2006 and December 2008 and are secured by securities held in our corporate investment portfolios, including a $44.2 million letter of credit for which funds have been segregated into a separate account. Effective June 28, 2006, this $44.2 million letter of credit was increased to $50.9 million, bringing the total letters of credit outstanding to $60.2 million. No amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during fiscal 2006 or at May 31, 2006. We have entered into various operating leases and purchase obligations that, under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at May 31, 2006. The table below summarizes our estimated annual payment obligations under these commitments, as well as other contractual obligations shown as other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at May 31, 2006: Payments due by period Less than More than In millions Total 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years 5 years Operating leases(1) $ 134.2 $ 37.6 $ 60.1 $ 31.6 $ 4.9 Other purchase obligations(2) 77.0 40.4 18.0 14.5 4.1 Other liabilities(3) 1.5 0.3 0.6 0.4 0.2 Total $ 212.7 $ 78.3 $ 78.7 $ 46.5 $ 9.2 20 Table of Contents (1) Operating leases are primarily for office space and equipment used in our branch operations. These amounts do not include future payments under redundant leases related to the acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay, which are included in the table above with other liabilities. (2) Purchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum outstanding commitments under purchase orders to buy goods and services and legally binding contractual arrangements with future payment obligations. Included in the total purchase obligations is $8.2 million of commitments to purchase capital assets. Amounts actually paid under certain of these arrangements may be higher due to variable components of these agreements. (3) The obligations shown as other liabilities represent business acquisition reserves and are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at May 31, 2006, with $0.3 million in other current liabilities and $1.2 million in other long term liabilities. Certain deferred compensation plan obligations and other long term liabilities amounting to $39.4 million are excluded because the timing of actual payments cannot be specifically or reasonably determined due to the variability in assumptions required to project the timing of future payments. Advantage has license agreements with fifteen independently owned associate offices (Associates), which are responsible for selling and marketing Advantage payroll services and performing certain operational functions, while Paychex, Inc. and Advantage provide all centralized back office payroll processing and payroll tax administration services. In addition, Advantage has a relationship with New England Business Services, Inc. (NEBS) whereby Advantage performs all client functions other than sales and marketing. Under these arrangements, Advantage pays the Associates and NEBS commissions based on processing activity for the related clients. Since the actual amounts of future payments are uncertain, obligations under these arrangements are not included in the table above. Commission expense for the Associates and NEBS in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 was $19.0 million and $16.7 million, respectively. We guarantee performance of service on annual maintenance contracts for clients who financed their service contracts through a third party. In the normal course of business, we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, which require us to defend and, if necessary, indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services to Paychex and our subsidiaries. Historically, there have been no material losses related to such guarantees and indemnifications. We currently self insure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain of our employee benefit plans. Our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities. Historically, the amounts accrued have not been material. We have insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability, errors and omissions, warranty liability, and acts of terrorism, and capacity for deductibles and self insured retentions through our captive insurance company. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities such as special purpose entities or structured finance entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. We do maintain investments as a limited partner in low income housing projects that are not considered part of our ongoing operations. These investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. 21 Table of Contents Operating Cash Flow Activities Year ended May 31, In millions 2006 2005 2004 Net income $ 464.9 $ 368.8 $ 303.0 Non cash adjustments to net income 99.5 106.7 105.6 Cash provided by/(used in) changes in operating assets and liabilities 4.8 (8.9 ) (19.6 ) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 569.2 $ 466.6 $ 389.0 The increase in our operating cash flows in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 was driven by higher net income, impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities. The fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between periods were primarily related to the timing of accounts receivable billing and collection, and timing of payments for compensation, PEO payroll, income tax, and other liabilities.

Corporate investments are primarily comprised of available for sale securities. The portfolio of funds held for clients and corporate investments is detailed in Note D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of collecting client funds, and the related remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services. Fluctuations in net funds held for clients and corporate investment activities primarily relate to timing of purchases, sales, or maturities of corporate investments. Additional discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in the Market Risk Factors section, contained in Item 7A of this Form 10 K. Acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired: In fiscal 2004, we paid approximately $12.6 million in cash for the acquisition of Stromberg and $0.6 million of additional purchase price related to the InterPay acquisition. Purchases of property and equipment: To support our continued client and ancillary product growth, purchases of property and equipment were made for data processing equipment and software, and for the expansion and upgrade of various operating facilities. In fiscal 2006, we made purchases of property and equipment of $81.1 million, compared with $70.7 million of purchases in fiscal 2005 and $50.6 million of purchases in fiscal 2004. In May 2005, we purchased a 127,000 square foot facility in Rochester, New York for $10.5 million. Construction in progress totaled $36.3 million and $29.5 million at May 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Of these costs, $29.4 million and $18.9 million represent software being developed for internal use at May 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Capitalization of costs ceases when the software is ready for its intended use, at which time we will begin amortization of the costs. 22 Table of Contents During fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005, and fiscal 2004, we purchased approximately $4.6 million, $2.5 million, and $1.2 million, respectively, of data processing equipment and software from EMC Corporation, whose Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer is a member of our Board of Directors. Financing Cash Flow Activities Year ended May 31, In millions, except per share amounts 2006 2005 2004 Dividends paid $ (231.5 ) $ (193.0 ) $ (177.4 ) Proceeds from exercise of stock options 32.1 9.0 18.3 Net cash used in financing activities $ (199.4 ) $ (184.0 ) $ (159.1 ) Cash dividends per common share $ 0.61 $ 0.51 $ 0.47 Dividends paid: In October 2005, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend payment to $0.16 per share from $0.13 per share. In October 2004, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend payment to $0.13 per share from $0.12 per share. The dividends paid as a percentage of net income totaled 50%, 52%, and 59% in fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005, and fiscal 2004, respectively. Future dividends are dependent on our future earnings and cash flow and are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors. Proceeds from exercise of stock options: The increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 is primarily due to an increase in the number of stock options exercised and an increase in the average exercise price per share. The decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 is primarily due to a decrease in the number of stock options exercised. Common shares acquired through exercise of stock options in fiscal 2006 were 1.7 million shares compared with 0.7 million shares in fiscal 2005 and 1.3 million shares in fiscal 2004. We have recognized a tax benefit from the exercise of stock options of $11.6 million, $4.5 million, and $10.2 million for fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005, and fiscal 2004, respectively. This tax benefit reduces the accrued income tax liability and increases additional paid in capital, with no impact on the expense amount for income taxes. See Note G to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, for additional disclosures on our stock option plans. Other New accounting pronouncements: In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (APB 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. This statement requires that all stock based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized as compensation costs in the financial statements based on their fair values measured at the date of grant. Prior to June 1, 2006, we had accounted for grants of employee stock options under the intrinsic value method allowed under APB 25 and related interpretations, and therefore had not recognized any compensation costs for stock based awards. As permitted by SFAS No. 123, we presented pro forma financial results including the effects of share based compensation costs in the footnotes to the financial statements. Refer to Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, under the heading Stock based compensation costs, for the pro forma results for fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004. 23 Table of Contents SFAS No. 123(R) is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005 and permits adoption using one of the following two methods: Modified prospective method, in which compensation costs will be recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements for all awards granted after the date of adoption as well as for the unvested portion of existing awards as of the date of adoption (the Existing Awards), and requires that prior periods not be restated. Modified retrospective method, which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above for new awards and Existing Awards, but also permits entities to restate prior periods based on amounts previously determined under SFAS No. 123 for pro forma disclosures. We will adopt this standard beginning June 1, 2006, using the modified prospective method. Accordingly, the results of operations for future periods will not be comparable to our historical results of operations. We anticipate the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) will negatively impact net income in the range of 4% to 5% in fiscal 2007, increasing our operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. Unrecognized stock based compensation costs related to Existing Awards as of May 31, 2006 were approximately $38.3 million and are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.4 years. We cannot yet estimate what the compensation cost impact will be on our Consolidated Financial Statements for the awards that we issue after June 1, 2006, as it will depend on the terms of any future grants approved by the Board of Directors and the underlying assumptions used in calculating the fair value at the time of any such future grants. The calculation of fair value is very sensitive to changes in the underlying assumptions, especially volatility and expected option term life. In addition, SFAS No. 123(R) will impact how income taxes are recorded to our Consolidated Financial Statements, as tax deductions for certain tax qualified option grants (incentive stock options) are allowed only at the time a taxable disposition occurs. This may result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the early periods after adoption and it could cause variability in our effective tax rate throughout a fiscal year as these events occur. SFAS No. 123(R) also amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows, to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than a reduction of taxes paid in operating cash flows. We cannot estimate what the amount of excess tax deductions will be in future periods. However, the amounts of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for excess tax deductions were $11.6 million, $4.5 million, and $10.2 million for fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Our pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123 utilized a Black Scholes option pricing model for valuing employee stock options and allocated the expense using an accelerated method. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we will continue to use a Black Scholes option pricing model, but will begin to allocate the expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period as we believe this better aligns the cost with the employee services provided. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we will be required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest. In our pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123, we have accounted for forfeitures as they occurred. Our assumptions for forfeitures will be determined based on factors including type of award and historical experience, and will be reevaluated regularly as an award vests. We currently offer an Employee Stock Purchase Plan to all employees, under which stock can be purchased through a payroll deduction with no discount to the market price and no look back provision. We have determined that this plan is non compensatory and is not subject to the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). Therefore, no compensation costs will be recognized related to this plan. 24 Table of Contents The following FASB Staff Positions (FSP) issued during our fiscal year ended May 31, 2006 and related to SFAS No. 123(R) will be applied upon adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) for our fiscal year beginning June 1, 2006: FAS 123(R) 1, Classification and Measurement of Freestanding Financial Instruments Originally Issued in Exchange for Employee Services under FASB Statement No. 123(R); FAS 123(R) 2, Practical Accommodation to the Application of Grant Date as Defined in FASB Statement 123(R); FAS 123(R) 3, Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share Based Payment Awards; and FAS 123(R) 4, Classification of Options and Similar Instruments Issued as Employee Compensation That Allow for Cash Settlement upon the Occurrence of a Contingent Event. In October 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 13 1, Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred During a Construction Period. This FSP provides that rental costs associated with operating leases that are incurred during a construction period should be recognized as rental expense and included in income from continuing operations. The guidance in this FSP was effective in the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005. We have historically expensed rental costs incurred during a construction period, and therefore, the adoption of this FSP did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position. In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. This FSP provides guidance on determining if an investment is considered to be impaired, if the impairment is other than temporary, and the measurement of an impairment loss. It also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments. The guidance in this FSP amends SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities and was effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. We account for investments in accordance with this guidance, and therefore, the adoption of this FSP did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position. In February and March 2006, the FASB issued the following statements amending SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities a Replacement of FASB Statement No. 125: SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments an Amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140; and SFAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 140. The guidance in these statements is effective in the first fiscal year beginning after September 15, 2006. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments and currently do not have any servicing assets or servicing liabilities that would fall under the guidance of either statement, and therefore, the adoption of these statements will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. Critical Accounting Policies Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, discusses the significant accounting policies of Paychex, Inc. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, future expectations, 25 Table of Contents and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates. Certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below. Revenue recognition: Service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual service period. Our service revenue is largely attributable to payroll related processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed. The revenue earned on delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue, and the costs for delivery are included in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. PEO revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of direct costs billed and incurred, which include wages, taxes, benefit premiums, and claims of PEO worksite employees. Direct costs billed and incurred for PEO worksite employees were $2,414.5 million, $2,230.8 million, and $1,846.1 million for fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Revenue from certain time and attendance solutions is recognized using the residual method when all of the following are present: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, typically a non cancelable sales order; delivery is complete for the software and hardware; the fee is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Maintenance contracts are generally purchased by our clients in conjunction with their purchase of certain time and attendance solutions. Revenue from these maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contract. Interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services, and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees. These collections from clients are typically remitted between one and thirty days after receipt, with some items extending to ninety days. The interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income because the collection, holding, and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services. Interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sales of available for sale securities. PEO workers compensation insurance: Workers compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims underwritten by us. These reserves include estimates for reported losses, plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims. In establishing the workers compensation insurance reserves, we utilize an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims. Estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections, and is subject to change due to multiple factors, including social and economic trends, changes in legal liability law, and damage awards, all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from our present estimates, particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future. We regularly review the adequacy of our estimated workers compensation insurance reserves. Adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the operating results of the period in which the adjustment is identified. Such adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends. In fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, workers compensation insurance for PEO worksite employees was provided based on claims paid as incurred. Our maximum individual claims liability was $750,000 under the fiscal 2006 policy and $500,000 under the fiscal 2005 policy. 26 Table of Contents We had recorded the following amounts on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for workers compensation claims as of May 31: Prepaid Current Long term In thousands expense liability liability 2006 $ 3,150 $ 7,061 $ 18,374 2005 $ 3,702 $ 7,164 $ 13,963 Valuation of investments: Our investments in available for sale securities are reported at market value. Unrealized gains related to increases in the market value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the market value are included in comprehensive income, net of tax, as reported on our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity. However, changes in the market value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the securitys cost basis. On our Consolidated Statements of Income, realized gains and losses from funds held for clients are included in interest on funds held for clients, whereas realized gains and losses from corporate investments are included in investment income, net. We are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available for sale securities from the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds. We attempt to mitigate this risk by investing primarily in high credit quality securities, AAA and AA rated securities, and A 1 rated short term securities. We periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other than temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration and extent to which the market value of an investment is less than its cost, the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment, and our ability and intent to hold the investment until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity. Our assessment that an investment is not other than temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumption related to any particular investment. Goodwill and intangible assets: For business combinations, we assign estimated fair values to all assets and liabilities acquired, including intangible assets, such as customer lists, certain license agreements, trade names, and non compete agreements. The assignment of fair values to acquired assets and liabilities and the determination of useful lives for depreciable and amortizable assets requires significant estimates, judgments, and assumptions. For certain fixed assets, including software and intangible assets, we utilize the assistance of independent valuation consultants. The remaining purchase price of the acquired business not assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. We have $405.8 million of goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at May 31, 2006, resulting from acquisitions in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004. SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill not be amortized, but instead tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit. Impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. We perform our annual review at the beginning of the fourth fiscal quarter. Our business is largely homogeneous and, as a result, substantially all of the goodwill is associated with one reporting unit. Based on the results of our goodwill impairment review, no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal 2006 or fiscal 2005. Subsequent to this review, there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of our goodwill balance. We also test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Accrual for client fund losses: We maintain an accrual for estimated losses associated with our clients inability to meet their payroll obligations. As part of providing payroll, payroll tax administration services, and employee payment services, we are authorized by the client to initiate money transfers from the clients 27 Table of Contents account for the amount of tax obligations and employees direct deposits. Electronic money fund transfers from client bank accounts are subject to potential risk of loss resulting from clients insufficient funds to cover such transfers. We evaluate certain uncollected amounts on a specific basis and analyze historical experience for amounts not specifically reviewed to determine the likelihood of recovery from the clients. Contingent liabilities: We are subject to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course of business. At May 31, 2006, we had approximately $15.6 million of reserves for pending legal matters. Based on the application of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, which requires us to record a reserve if we believe an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the probable loss can be reasonably estimated, we deem this amount adequate. The determination of whether any particular matter involves a probable loss or if the amount of a probable loss can be reasonably estimated requires considerable judgment. This reserve may change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular matter. In light of the legal reserve recorded, we currently believe that resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. However, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and our results of operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded. For additional information regarding pending legal matters, refer to Note L in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Income taxes: We account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We account for the tax benefit from the exercise of non qualified stock options by reducing our accrued income tax liability and increasing additional paid in capital. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market Risk Factors Changes in interest rates and interest rate risk: Funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short term funds and available for sale securities and corporate investments are primarily comprised of available for sale securities. As a result of our operating and investing activities, we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially affect our results of operations and financial position. Changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the market value of our longer term available for sale securities. In seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities, we generally direct investments towards high credit quality, fixed rate municipal and government securities and manage the available for sale securities to a benchmark duration of two and one half to three years. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk. Our investment portfolios and the earnings from these portfolios have been impacted by the fluctuations in interest rates. The Federal Funds rate has increased to 5.00% as of May 31, 2006. During fiscal 2006, the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was 3.2% compared with 2.2% for fiscal 2005 and 1.8% for fiscal 2004. Short term rates rose steadily throughout fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2005, longer term rates, on average, were basically unchanged from fiscal 2004, but have risen steadily in fiscal 2006. While short term and long term interest rates generally move in the same direction, there are certain economic and liquidity conditions that will affect this relationship. While interest rates are rising, the full benefit of higher interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of long and short term interest rate changes as discussed below. The Federal Funds rate decreased from 6.50% at May 31, 2000 to 1.00% at May 31, 2004. The decreasing interest rate environment experienced through fiscal 2004 negatively affected net income growth. During fiscal 2004, the decreasing rate environment generated significant unrealized gains for our longer term available for sale securities and we were able to mitigate some of the impact of lower interest rates on earnings by realizing gains from sales of our investments. 28 Table of Contents Increases in interest rates increase earnings from our short term investments, and over time will increase earnings from our longer term available for sale securities. Earnings from the available for sale securities, which currently have an average duration of 2.0 years excluding the impact of auction rate securities and VRDNs that are tied to short term interest rates, will not reflect increases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at higher rates. An increasing interest rate environment will generally result in a decrease in the market value of our investment portfolio. The cost and market value of available for sale securities that have stated maturities at May 31, 2006 are shown below by contractual maturity. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties. May 31, 2006 In thousands Cost Market value Maturity date: Due in one year or less $ 545,046 $ 542,178 Due after one year through three years 688,411 678,728 Due after three years through five years 282,107 276,241 Due after five years 2,356,196 2,352,513 Total available for sale securities $ 3,871,760 $ 3,849,660 VRDNs and auction rate securities are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities is typically twenty to thirty years. Although these securities are issued as long term securities, both are priced and traded as short term instruments because of the liquidity provided through the auction or tender feature. The following table summarizes the changes in the Federal Funds rate over the past three fiscal years: 2006 2005 2004 Federal Funds rate beginning of fiscal year 3.00 % 1.00 % 1.25 % Rate increase/(decrease): First quarter 0.50 0.50 (0.25 ) Second quarter 0.50 0.50 Third quarter 0.50 0.50 Fourth quarter 0.50 0.50 Federal Funds rate end of fiscal year 5.00 % 3.00 % 1.00 % Three year AAA municipal securities yields end of fiscal year 3.65 % 2.85 % 2.50 % The Federal Funds rate was increased to 5.25% on June 29, 2006. Calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, daily interest rate changes, seasonal variations in investment balances, actual duration of short term and available for sale securities, the proportional mix of taxable and tax exempt investments, and changes in tax exempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates, which are not synchronized or simultaneous. Subject to these factors, a 25 basis point change in taxable interest rates generally affects our tax exempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points. Our total investment portfolio (funds held for clients and corporate investments) averaged approximately $3.9 billion for the full year ended May 31, 2006. Our normal and anticipated allocation is approximately 60% invested in short term securities and available for sale securities that are priced and traded as short term securities (auction rate securities and VRDNs) with an average duration of thirty five days, and 40% invested in other available for sale securities with an average duration of two and one half to three years. Based on these current assumptions, we estimate that the earnings effect of a 25 basis point change in interest rates 29 Table of Contents (17 basis points for tax exempt investments) at the beginning of fiscal 2007 would be approximately $4.5 million to $5.0 million for fiscal 2007. The combined funds held for clients and corporate available for sale securities reflected a net unrealized loss of $22.0 million at May 31, 2006, compared with a net unrealized loss of $9.9 million at May 31, 2005, and a net unrealized loss of $4.2 million at May 31, 2004. During fiscal 2006, the net unrealized gain or loss position ranged from a net unrealized loss of $25.2 million to $6.1 million. During fiscal 2005, the net unrealized gain or loss position ranged from approximately $14.4 million net unrealized loss to $10.6 million net unrealized gain. The net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolios was approximately $23.9 million at July 20, 2006. As of May 31, 2006 and May 31, 2005, we had $3.9 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively, invested in available for sale securities at market value. Excluding auction rate securities and VRDNs classified as available for sale securities which are tied to short term interest rates, the weighted average yields to maturity were 3.0% and 2.6%, as of May 31, 2006 and May 31, 2005, respectively. Assuming a hypothetical increase in both short term and longer term interest rates of 25 basis points, the resulting potential decrease in market value for our portfolio of securities at May 31, 2006, would be approximately $8.5 million. Conversely, a corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable increase in market value. This hypothetical decrease or increase in the market value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolios recorded value, with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders equity and with no related or immediate impact on the results of operations. Credit risk: We are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the bonds. We attempt to limit credit risk by investing primarily in AAA and AA rated securities and A 1 rated short term securities, and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single issuer. 30 Table of Contents
