Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations reviews the operating results of Paychex, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (Paychex, we, our, or us) for each of the three fiscal years ended May 31, 2011 (fiscal 2011), May 31, 2010 (fiscal 2010), and May 31, 2009 (fiscal 2009), and our financial condition as of May 31, 2011. This review should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K (Form 10 K) and the Risk Factors discussed in Item 1A of this Form 10 K. Forward looking statements in this review are qualified by the cautionary statement under the heading Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 contained at the beginning of Part I of this Form 10 K. Overview We are a leading provider of payroll, human resource, and benefits outsourcing solutions for small to medium sized businesses. Our Payroll and Human Resource Services offer a portfolio of services and products that allow our clients to meet their diverse payroll and human resource needs. Our payroll services are the foundation of our service portfolio. They are provided through either our core payroll or Major Market Services (MMS), which is utilized by clients that have more sophisticated payroll and benefits needs, and include: payroll processing; payroll tax administration services; employee payment services; and regulatory compliance services (new hire reporting and garnishment processing). In addition to the above, our software as a service option through our MMS platform provides human resource management, employee benefits management, time and attendance systems, online expense reporting, and applicant tracking. 12 Table of Contents Our Human Resource Services primarily include: Paychex HR Solutions, under which we offer our administrative services organization (ASO) and our professional employer organization (PEO). We also offer Paychex HR Essentials, our new ASO product that provides support to our clients over the phone or online to help manage employee related topics; retirement services administration; insurance services; eServices; and other human resource services and products. We earn revenue mainly through recurring fees for services performed. Service revenue is primarily driven by the number of clients, checks or transactions per client per pay period, and utilization of ancillary services. We also earn interest on funds held for clients between the time of collection from our clients and remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees. Our business strategy is focused on achieving strong long term financial performance by providing high quality, timely, accurate, and affordable services; growing our client base; increasing utilization of our ancillary services; leveraging our technology and operating infrastructure; and expanding our service offerings. Our financial results for fiscal 2011 reflected year over year growth. We continued to see improvement in many of our key business indicators, especially in checks per client. Checks per client increased 2.1% for fiscal 2011, compared to a decline of 2.6% for fiscal 2010. Checks per client began to show year over year growth in the three months ending May 31, 2010 with 1.1% growth for that quarter and continued to improve throughout fiscal 2011, reflecting increases of 1.2%, 2.5%, 2.8%, and 2.0% for each of the sequential quarters. Our revenue growth has been modest, as new sales units were relatively flat compared to the prior year, largely due to lack of growth in new business starts. Our financial results continue to be adversely impacted by the interest rate environment. The equity markets hit a low in March 2009, with interest rates available on high quality financial instruments remaining low since that time. The Federal Funds rate has been at a range of zero to 0.25% since December 2008. Our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios earned an average rate of return of 1.3% for fiscal 2011, compared to 1.5% for fiscal 2010 and 2.1% for fiscal 2009. We continue to manage our headcount and expenses while investing in our business, particularly in areas related to selling and servicing our clients, product development, and the technology required to support these areas. We believe these investments are critical to our success. Looking to the future, we continue to focus on investing in our products, people, and service capabilities, positioning ourselves to capitalize on opportunities for long term growth. Highlights of our financial results for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 are as follows: Payroll service revenue increased 2% to $1.4 billion. Human Resource Services revenue increased 10% to $597.4 million. Interest on funds held for clients decreased 13% to $48.1 million. Total revenue increased 4% to $2.1 billion. Operating income increased 8% to $786.4 million, and operating income, net of certain items, increased 7% to $738.3 million. Refer to the Non GAAP Financial Measure discussion on page 14 for further information on operating income, net of certain items. Operating income for fiscal 2010 reflected an expense charge of $18.7 million to increase the litigation reserve related to the Rapid Payroll court decision, which reduced diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2010 by $0.03 per share. Net income and diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $515.3 million and $1.42 per share, respectively. 13 Table of Contents Cash flow from operations increased 17% to $715.3 million, primarily related to the increase in net income and fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities. Dividends of $448.8 million were paid to stockholders, representing 87% of net income. During fiscal 2011, we completed the acquisition of two software as a service companies, opening up additional areas of the markets we serve. SurePayroll, Inc. (SurePayroll), a provider of payroll processing for small businesses, was acquired on February 8, 2011 for $114.9 million, net of cash acquired. SurePayroll serves small businesses with its easy to use, online payroll product and mobile application. This acquisition allows us entry into a new area of the online payroll market, and provides our clients with a mobile self service alternative. The acquisition of SurePayroll was dilutive to fiscal 2011 by less than $0.01 per share. ePlan Services, Inc. (ePlan), a provider of recordkeeping and administrative solutions to the defined contribution marketplace, was acquired on May 3, 2011 for $15.2 million, net of cash acquired. Both entities now operate as wholly owned subsidiaries of Paychex. Our financial results include the results of these entities from their respective dates of acquisition. Neither acquisition is significant to our consolidated financial statements. Non GAAP Financial Measure In addition to reporting operating income, a United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP) measure, we present operating income, net of certain items, which is a non GAAP measure. We believe operating income, net of certain items, is an appropriate additional measure, as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period. It is also the basis of the measure used internally for establishing the following years targets and measuring managements performance in connection with certain performance based compensation payments and awards. Operating income, net of certain items, excludes interest on funds held for clients and the expense charge in fiscal 2010 to increase the litigation reserve. Interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates, which are not within the control of management. The expense charge to increase the litigation reserve is also an adjustment to operating income due to its unusual and infrequent nature. It is outside the normal course of our operations and obscures the comparability of performance period over period. Operating income, net of certain items, is not calculated through the application of GAAP and is not the required form of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission. As such, it should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of operating income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction with the GAAP measure. The use of any non GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non GAAP measure used by other companies. Operating income, net of certain items, increased 7% to $738.3 million for fiscal 2011, compared to $688.5 million for fiscal 2010 and $729.7 million for fiscal 2009. Business Outlook Our client base was approximately 564,000 clients as of May 31, 2011, compared to approximately 536,000 clients as of May 31, 2010, and approximately 554,000 clients as of May 31, 2009. Our client base increased 5.2% for fiscal 2011, compared to declines of 3.2% for fiscal 2010 and 3.1% for fiscal 2009. Excluding the impact of 33,000 SurePayroll clients, our client base would have declined 0.9% for fiscal 2011. This reduction reflects the impact of lack of growth in new business starts on our client base, as our new sales units were relatively flat compared to fiscal 2010. On a positive note, our sales to clients who previously utilized the services of local and regional competitors improved for fiscal 2011. For fiscal 2011, payroll services client retention was approximately 79% of our beginning client base, a two percentage point improvement over the prior year, as clients lost decreased 9% for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. The decrease in client losses was largely attributable to fewer clients going out of business or having no employees for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. In addition, we lost fewer clients to local and regional competitors for fiscal 2011. Through our focus on providing high quality service to our customers to maximize client retention, we received the highest client satisfaction results in the past several years. 14 Table of Contents Ancillary services effectively leverage payroll processing data and, therefore, are beneficial to our operating margin. The following statistics demonstrate the growth in our ancillary service offerings: As of May 31, 2011 2010 2009 Paychex HR Solutions client employees(1) 567,000 502,000 453,000 Paychex HR Solutions clients(1) 21,000 19,000 18,000 Insurance services clients(2) 100,000 92,000 86,000 Health and benefits services applicants 99,000 80,000 58,000 Retirement services clients(3) 57,000 51,000 50,000 (1) Includes Paychex HR Essentials as of May 31, 2011. (2) Includes workers compensation insurance services clients and health and benefits services clients. (3) Includes ePlan clients as of May 31, 2011. Continued investment in our business is critical to our success. In fiscal 2011, we made investments in our sales force and product development. Our sales force increased 2% to 2,380 sales representatives for fiscal 2011, and is expected to grow 1% to 2,400 sales representatives for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2012 (fiscal 2012). This growth is driven primarily by increases in insurance services and other Human Resource Services offerings. We have continued to expand our enhanced payroll processing platform to include additional service offerings. This new platform allows us to leverage efficiencies in our processes and continue to provide excellent customer service to our clients. Our enhanced platform has led to improved productivity within our operations, contributing to the increase in our operating income, net of certain items, as a percentage of service revenue to 36.3% for fiscal 2011, compared to 35.4% for the prior year. Over the next few years, we will continue to invest in our product development, as we believe it is critical to our success. We have introduced new product offerings to add value for our clients. In fiscal 2011, we introduced Paychex HR Essentials, an ASO offering that provides support to our clients over the phone or online to help manage employee related topics. We also introduced Paychex SmartTimetm time clocks for small businesses. This self contained system offers small businesses an economical, easy to use time and attendance solution that automatically collects and calculates employee hours, and integrates with Paychex payroll. We continued the expansion of our insurance services nationwide, simplifying the process required to obtain coverage through our network of national and regional insurers. We now service over 100,000 clients through our subsidiary, Paychex Insurance Agency, Inc. We believe insurance services is an area that continues to offer significant opportunities for future growth. We strengthened our position as an expert in our industry by serving as a source of education and information to clients and other interested parties. We provide free webinars, white papers, and other information on our website to aid existing and prospective clients with the impact of regulatory changes. In addition, the Paychex Insurance Agency, Inc. website, www.paychexinsurance.com, helps small business owners navigate the area of insurance coverage. Financial position and liquidity The volatility in the global financial markets that began in September 2008 continues to curtail available liquidity and limit investment choices. Despite this macroeconomic environment, as of May 31, 2011, our financial position remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of $671.3 million and no debt. Our investment strategy focuses on optimizing liquidity and protecting principal. Yields on high quality financial instruments remain low, negatively impacting our income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments. We invest predominately in municipal bonds general obligation bonds; pre refunded bonds, which are secured by a U.S. government escrow; and essential services revenue bonds. Our primary short term investment vehicle has been U.S. agency discount notes. Starting in November 2009, we began to invest in select A 1/P 1 rated variable rate demand notes (VRDNs) and have gradually increased our investment in VRDNs to $828.3 million as of May 31, 2011. During fiscal 2011, we earned an after tax rate of approximately 0.23% for VRDNs compared to approximately 0.06% for U.S. agency discount notes. 15 Table of Contents We invest primarily in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short term securities with A 1/P 1 ratings. We limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest in short to intermediate term instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes. We believe that our investments as of May 31, 2011 were not other than temporarily impaired, nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date that would indicate any other than temporary impairment. All investments held as of May 31, 2011 were traded in active markets. Our primary source of cash is our ongoing operations. Cash flow from operations was $715.3 million for fiscal 2011. Historically, we have funded our operations, capital purchases, business acquisitions, and dividend payments from our operating activities. Our positive cash flows in fiscal 2011 allowed us to support our business growth and to pay substantial dividends to our stockholders. During fiscal 2011, dividends paid to stockholders were 87% of net income. It is anticipated that cash and total corporate investments as of May 31, 2011, along with projected operating cash flows, will support our normal business operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments for the foreseeable future. For further analysis of our results of operations for fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009, and our financial position as of May 31, 2011, refer to the tables and analysis in the Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources sections of this Item 7 and the discussion in the Critical Accounting Policies section of this Item 7. Outlook Our outlook for fiscal 2012 is based upon current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. Consistent with our policy regarding guidance, our projections do not anticipate or speculate on future changes to interest rates. Our fiscal 2012 guidance reflects anticipated results for SurePayroll and ePlan. The anticipated service revenue impact is approximately 2% and the earnings dilution is expected to be approximately $0.01 per share, mainly due to amortization of acquired intangible assets. Our fiscal 2012 guidance is as follows: Low High Payroll service revenue 5 % 7 % Human Resource Services revenue 12 % 15 % Total service revenue 7 % 9 % Interest on funds held for clients (14 )% (12 )% Investment income, net 2 % Net income 5 % 7 % Operating income, net of certain items, as a percentage of service revenue is expected to range from 35% to 36% for fiscal 2012. The effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 35% for fiscal 2012. Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2012 are expected to be impacted by the continuing low interest rate environment. The average rate of return on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios is expected to be 1.2% for fiscal 2012. As of May 31, 2011, the long term investment portfolio had an average yield to maturity of 2.6% and an average duration of 2.4 years. In the next twelve months, slightly more than 20% of this portfolio will mature, and it is currently anticipated that these proceeds will be reinvested at a lower average interest rate of approximately 1.0%. Investment income is expected to benefit from ongoing investment of cash generated from operations, though at a lower growth rate as a result of cash outlays in fiscal 2011 for business acquisitions. Under normal financial market conditions, the impact to our earnings from a 25 basis point increase or decrease in short term interest rates would be in the range of $3.5 million to $4.0 million, after taxes, for a twelve month period. Such a basis point change may or may not be tied to changes in the Federal Funds rate. Purchases of property and equipment for fiscal 2012 are expected to be in the range of $90 million to $95 million. This includes costs for internally developed software as we continue to invest in our product development. Fiscal 2012 depreciation expense is projected to be in the range of $75 million to $80 million, and we project amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2012 to be in the range of $20 million to $25 million. Intangible assets acquired from SurePayroll and ePlan are expected to increase amortization expense for fiscal 2012, partially offset by the impact of fully amortized intangibles. 16 Table of Contents Results of Operations Summary of Results of Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended May 31: In millions, except per share amounts 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Revenue: Payroll service revenue $ 1,438.8 2 % $ 1,404.9 (5 )% $ 1,483.7 Human Resource Services revenue 597.4 10 % 540.9 3 % 523.6 Total service revenue 2,036.2 5 % 1,945.8 (3 )% 2,007.3 Interest on funds held for clients 48.1 (13 )% 55.0 (27 )% 75.5 Total revenue 2,084.3 4 % 2,000.8 (4 )% 2,082.8 Combined operating and SGA expenses 1,297.9 2 % 1,276.0 1,277.6 Operating income 786.4 8 % 724.8 (10 )% 805.2 As a % of total revenue 38 % 36 % 39 % Investment income, net 5.8 29 % 4.5 (34 )% 6.9 Income before income taxes 792.2 9 % 729.3 (10 )% 812.1 As a % of total revenue 38 % 36 % 39 % Income taxes 276.9 10 % 252.3 (9 )% 278.6 Effective income tax rate 35.0 % 34.6 % 34.3 % Net income $ 515.3 8 % $ 477.0 (11 )% $ 533.5 As a % of total revenue 25 % 24 % 26 % Diluted earnings per share $ 1.42 8 % $ 1.32 (11 )% $ 1.48 We invest in highly liquid, investment grade fixed income securities and do not utilize derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk. As of May 31, 2011, we had no exposure to high risk or illiquid investments. Details regarding our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios are as follows: Year ended May 31, $ in millions 2011 2010 2009 Average investment balances: Funds held for clients $ 3,350.3 $ 3,167.9 $ 3,323.3 Corporate investments 662.4 653.8 538.2 Total $ 4,012.7 $ 3,821.7 $ 3,861.5 Average interest rates earned (exclusive of net realized gains): Funds held for clients 1.4 % 1.6 % 2.2 % Corporate investments 0.9 % 0.8 % 1.4 % Combined funds held for clients and corporate investments 1.3 % 1.5 % 2.1 % Net realized gains: Funds held for clients $ 1.3 $ 3.2 $ 1.1 Corporate investments Total $ 1.3 $ 3.2 $ 1.1 17 Table of Contents $ in millions As of May 31, 2011 2010 2009 Net unrealized gains on available for sale securities(1) $ 59.3 $ 66.6 $ 66.7 Federal Funds rate(2) 0.25 % 0.25 % 0.25 % Three year AAA municipal securities yield 0.80 % 0.99 % 1.35 % Total fair value of available for sale securities $ 2,737.2 $ 2,151.8 $ 1,780.9 Weighted average duration of available for sale securities in years(3) 2.4 2.5 2.5 Weighted average yield to maturity of available for sale securities(3) 2.6 % 2.9 % 3.3 % (1) The net unrealized gain of our investment portfolios was approximately $57.5 million as of July 11, 2011. (2) The Federal Funds rate was a range of zero to 0.25% as of May 31, 2011, May 31, 2010, and May 31, 2009. (3) These items exclude the impact of VRDNs held as of May 31, 2011 and May 31, 2010, as they are tied to short term interest rates. We did not hold any VRDNs as of May 31, 2009. Payroll service revenue: Payroll service revenue increased 2% to $1.4 billion for fiscal 2011, compared to a 5% decline for fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011 revenue benefited from an increase in checks per client and revenue per check. Checks per client increased 2.1% for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. Revenue per check was positively impacted by lower discounting within our overall client base and price increases. Our client base, excluding the impact of SurePayroll, declined 0.9% during fiscal 2011. This was largely attributable to the adverse impact on the sales of new units from lack of growth in new business starts. Client retention improved for fiscal 2011, with client losses that were 9% lower than for fiscal 2010, largely a result of fewer clients going out of business or having no employees. In addition, fiscal 2011 new sales units and client losses related to local and regional competitors improved compared to the prior year. The decrease in payroll service revenue for fiscal 2010 was as a result of the cumulative adverse effects of weak economic conditions on our client base and check volume. Our client base decreased 3.2% during fiscal 2010 and checks per client decreased 2.6% for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. Human Resource Services revenue: Human Resource Services revenue increased 10% for fiscal 2011 and 3% for fiscal 2010 to $597.4 million and $540.9 million, respectively. Human Resource Services revenue growth for both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 was impacted by the revenue earned from Stromberg time and attendance operations (Stromberg), an immaterial component of Paychex, prior to its sale in October 2009. In addition, retirement services revenue growth for fiscal 2010 was impacted by billings in fiscal 2009 related to restatements of clients retirement plans required by statute, which are not expected to recur for approximately six years. This favorably impacted retirement services revenue growth for fiscal 2009 by $12.4 million and did not recur in fiscal 2010. Excluding the impact of Stromberg in both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, and the impact of retirement plan restatement billings for fiscal 2010, Human Resource Services revenue growth would have been as follows: % Change 2011 2010 Human Resource Services revenue, as reported 10 % 3 % Human Resource Services revenue excluding Stromberg revenue and retirement plan restatement billings 12 % 8 % 18 Table of Contents This growth was generated from the following: $ in billions As of May 31, 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Paychex HR Solutions client employees(1) 567,000 13 % 502,000 11 % 453,000 Paychex HR Solutions clients(1) 21,000 9 % 19,000 8 % 18,000 Insurance services clients(2) 100,000 8 % 92,000 7 % 86,000 Health and benefits services applicants 99,000 23 % 80,000 38 % 58,000 Retirement services clients(3) 57,000 12 % 51,000 3 % 50,000 Asset value of retirement services client employees funds(3) $ 15.3 35 % $ 11.3 33 % $ 8.5 (1) Includes Paychex HR Essentials as of May 31, 2011. (2) Includes workers compensation insurance services clients and health and benefits services clients. (3) Includes ePlan as of May 31, 2011. Excluding ePlan clients, retirement services clients would have increased 5% for fiscal 2011. Human Resource Services revenue growth for fiscal 2011 reflects modest improvements in economic conditions, the client growth noted above, and price increases. Paychex HR Solutions revenue for fiscal 2011 was positively impacted by increases in both clients and client employees. Contributing to this growth in clients and client employees is our new product offering, Paychex HR Essentials. Growth in certain products that are primarily beneficial to our MMS clients contributed positively to Human Resource Services revenue growth for both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010. Also, insurance services revenue continued to grow as a result of increases in both health and benefits services and workers compensation insurance services revenue. Health and benefits services revenue continued its accelerated growth since inception, increasing 29% for fiscal 2011 and 49% for fiscal 2010, driven primarily by the number of applicants. Somewhat offsetting these positive factors, fluctuations in our PEO revenue had an adverse impact on Human Resource Services revenue growth for fiscal 2011. PEO net service revenue is more variable quarter to quarter than our other revenue streams due to fluctuations in adding and retaining client employees as healthcare rates change. For fiscal 2010, client growth as noted above positively impacted Human Resource Services Revenue; however, the rates of growth were adversely affected by the cumulative impact of weak economic conditions on our client base. This particularly affected retirement services, although client growth for retirement services rebounded somewhat late in fiscal 2010 as client losses improved compared to the prior year. In fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, the 35% and 33% increases in the asset value of retirement services client employees funds were driven by recovery in the financial markets and increased levels of larger plans converting to Paychex. For both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, retirement services revenue growth was adversely impacted by a shift in the mix of assets in the retirement services client employees funds to investments earning lower fees from external fund managers. Total service revenue: Total service revenue increased 5% for fiscal 2011 and declined 3% for fiscal 2010, attributable to the factors previously discussed. Interest on funds held for clients: The decrease of 13% in interest on funds held for clients for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was the result of lower average interest rates earned, offset somewhat by an increase in average investment balances. The decrease of 27% in interest on funds held for clients for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was the result of lower average interest rates earned and lower average investment balances, offset somewhat by higher net realized gains on sales of available for sale securities. Average investment balances for funds held for clients increased 6% for fiscal 2011 and decreased 5% for fiscal 2010. The increase in average investment balances for fiscal 2011 was the result of increases in state unemployment insurance rates for the 2011 calendar year and the increase in checks per client, offset somewhat by the lingering effects of the difficult economic conditions on our client base. The decline in average investment balances for fiscal 2010 was the result of the cumulative adverse effect of weak economic conditions on our client 19 Table of Contents base and lower tax withholdings for client employees resulting from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the economic stimulus package). In the second half of fiscal 2010, the impact of these factors was partially offset by increases in state unemployment insurance rates for the 2010 calendar year. The economic stimulus package went into effect in April 2009, and its impact on year over year comparisons of average investment balances had abated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. This factor, along with the increases in state unemployment insurance rates, resulted in average investment balances for funds held for clients growing 3% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 compared to the same period in fiscal 2009. Refer to the Market Risk Factors section, contained in Item 7A of this Form 10 K, for more information on changing interest rates. Combined operating and SGA expenses: The following table summarizes total combined operating and selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses for fiscal years: In millions 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Compensation related expenses $ 877.7 3 % $ 854.9 (1 )% $ 860.8 Facilities expenses 60.0 (1 )% 60.4 1 % 59.6 Depreciation and amortization 88.7 3 % 86.5 1 % 85.8 Other expenses 271.5 6 % 255.5 (6 )% 271.4 1,297.9 3 % 1,257.3 (2 )% 1,277.6 Expense charge to increase the litigation reserve (100 )% 18.7 100 % Total operating and SGA expenses $ 1,297.9 2 % $ 1,276.0 $ 1,277.6 During fiscal 2010, we recorded an expense charge of $18.7 million to increase our litigation reserve. Refer to Note M of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, for additional information on legal matters. Excluding the aforementioned $18.7 million expense charge, combined operating and SGA expenses increased 3% for fiscal 2011 and decreased 2% for fiscal 2010. The increase for fiscal 2011 was primarily driven by personnel related costs, in part due to reinstatement of salary increases and 401(k) match as indicated below. In addition, we continued to invest in our product development and supporting technology. Improvements in productivity with related lower headcount in operations have moderated this increase. Fiscal 2011 compensation related expenses include one time costs related to the separation agreement entered into during the three months ended August 31, 2010 with Jonathan J. Judge, our former President and Chief Executive Officer. Expenses of SurePayroll and ePlan, which are included in our results since their respective acquisition dates, further impacted the growth in operating and SGA expenses. The decline in combined operating and SGA expenses for fiscal 2010 was generated from cost control measures and lower headcount, offset slightly by costs related to continued investment in our sales force, customer service, and product development and supporting technology. In fiscal 2010, we saved approximately $30.0 million from a freeze on salary increases and providing no matching contributions to our 401(k) plan. We reinstituted salary increases beginning March 1, 2010 and reinstated a 401(k) match effective January 1, 2011. As of May 31, 2011, we had approximately 12,400 employees compared with approximately 12,200 employees as of May 31, 2010 and 12,500 employees as of May 31, 2009. Depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings, furniture and fixtures, data processing equipment, and software. Increases in depreciation expense were due to capital expenditures as we invested in technology and continued to grow our business. Amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client list acquisitions, which are amortized using either straight line or accelerated methods. Depreciation and amortization increased in fiscal 2011 due to the acquisitions of SurePayroll and ePlan. Other expenses include items such as delivery, forms and supplies, communications, travel and entertainment, professional services, and other costs incurred to support our business. The increase in other expenses for fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to the largely fourth quarter impact from our two acquisitions. 20 Table of Contents Operating income: Operating income increased 8% for fiscal 2011 and declined 10% for fiscal 2010. The fluctuations in operating income were attributable to the factors previously discussed. Operating income, net of certain items, is as follows for fiscal years: In millions 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Operating income $ 786.4 8 % $ 724.8 (10 )% $ 805.2 Excluding: Interest on funds held for clients (48.1 ) (13 )% (55.0 ) (27 )% (75.5 ) Expense charge to increase the litigation reserve (100 )% 18.7 100 % Operating income, net of certain items $ 738.3 7 % $ 688.5 (6 )% $ 729.7 Operating income, net of certain items, as a % of total service revenue 36.3 % 35.4 % 36.4 % Refer to the previous discussion of operating income, net of certain items, in the Non GAAP Financial Measure section on page 14. Investment income, net: Investment income, net, primarily represents earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and investments in available for sale securities. Investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients, which is included in total revenue. The increase of 29% in investment income for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was the result of higher average invested balances and a slight increase in average interest rates earned. The 1% increase in average investment balances for fiscal 2011 was the result of investment of cash generated from operations, partially offset by cash utilized to fund the acquisitions of SurePayroll and ePlan during the second half of fiscal 2011. The increase in average interest rates earned on corporate investments was primarily driven by higher yields on funds invested into our longer term investment portfolio compared to the prior year. The decrease of 34% in investment income for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was the result of lower average interest rates earned offset somewhat by higher average investment balances resulting from investment of cash generated from operations. Income taxes: Our effective income tax rate was 35.0% for fiscal 2011, compared to 34.6% for fiscal 2010, and 34.3% for fiscal 2009. The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to lower tax exempt income on available for sale securities during fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. The increase in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of higher state income tax rates from state legislative changes. Refer to Note I of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, for additional disclosures on income taxes. Net income and earnings per share: Net income increased 8% to $515.3 million for fiscal 2011 and decreased 11% to $477.0 million for fiscal 2010. Diluted earnings per share increased 8% to 1.42 per share for fiscal 2011 and decreased 11% to $1.32 per share for fiscal 2010. These fluctuations were attributable to the factors previously discussed. In particular, the $18.7 million expense charge to increase the litigation reserve reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.03 per share for fiscal 2010. Combined interest on funds held for clients and corporate investment income for fiscal 2010 decreased 28% or $22.8 million, reducing diluted earnings per share by $0.04 per share. Liquidity and Capital Resources The volatility in the global financial markets that began in September 2008 continues to curtail available liquidity and limit investment choices. Despite this macroeconomic environment, our financial position as of May 31, 2011 remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of $671.3 million and no debt. We also believe that our investments as of May 31, 2011 were not other than temporarily impaired, nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date that would indicate any other than temporary impairment. We anticipate that cash and total corporate investments as of May 31, 2011, along with projected operating cash flows will support our normal business operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments for the foreseeable future. 21 Table of Contents Commitments and Contractual Obligations Lines of credit: As of May 31, 2011, we had unused borrowing capacity available under four uncommitted, secured, short term lines of credit at market rates of interest with financial institutions as follows: Financial institution Amount available Expiration date JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. $ 350 million February 2012 Bank of America, N.A. $ 250 million February 2012 PNC Bank, National Association $ 150 million February 2012 Wells Fargo Bank, National Association $ 150 million February 2012 Our credit facilities are evidenced by promissory notes and are secured by separate pledge security agreements by and between Paychex and each of the financial institutions (the Lenders), pursuant to which we have granted each of the Lenders a security interest in certain of our investment securities accounts. The collateral is maintained in a pooled custody account pursuant to the terms of a control agreement and is to be administered under an intercreditor agreement among the Lenders. Under certain circumstances, individual Lenders may require that collateral be transferred from the pooled account into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual Lenders. The primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet short term funding requirements related to deposit account overdrafts and client fund obligations arising from electronic payment transactions on behalf of our clients in the ordinary course of business, if necessary. No amounts were outstanding against these lines of credit during fiscal 2011 or as of May 31, 2011. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Bank of America, N.A. are also parties to our irrevocable standby letters of credit, which are discussed below. Letters of credit: As of May 31, 2011, we had irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding totaling $47.4 million, required to secure commitments for certain of our insurance policies. The letters of credit expire at various dates between July 2011 and December 2011, and are collateralized by securities held in our investment portfolios. No amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during fiscal 2011 or as of May 31, 2011. Subsequent to May 31, 2011, the letter of credit expiring in July 2011 was renewed and will expire in July 2012. Other commitments: We have entered into various operating leases and purchase obligations that, under GAAP, are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2011. The table below summarizes our estimated annual payment obligations under these commitments as of May 31, 2011: Payments due by period Less than More than In millions Total 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years 5 years Operating leases(1) $ 150.0 $ 39.4 $ 56.6 $ 33.5 $ 20.5 Purchase obligations(2) 72.4 44.2 21.3 5.8 1.1 Total $ 222.4 $ 83.6 $ 77.9 $ 39.3 $ 21.6 (1) Operating leases are primarily for office space and equipment used in our branch operations. (2) Purchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum outstanding commitments under purchase orders to buy goods and services and legally binding contractual arrangements with future payment obligations. Included in the total purchase obligations is $6.0 million of commitments to purchase capital assets. Amounts actually paid under certain of these arrangements may be higher due to variable components of these agreements. The liability for uncertain tax positions was approximately $34.4 million as of May 31, 2011. Refer to Note I of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, for more information on income taxes. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to this liability and have excluded it from the table above. We are currently under a state income tax audit for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2004 through 2009. On July 14, 2010, we received a summary of proposed tax adjustments from the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, which was in excess of the reserve recorded as of May 31, 2011. The outcome 22 Table of Contents of the audit and the timing of settlement, if any, are subject to significant uncertainty. It is not possible to reasonably estimate the impact, if any, if resolution is ultimately unfavorable to us. Certain deferred compensation plan obligations and other long term liabilities amounting to $52.1 million are excluded from the table above because the timing of actual payments cannot be specifically or reasonably determined due to the variability in assumptions required to project the timing of future payments. Advantage Payroll Services Inc. (Advantage) has license agreements with independently owned associate offices (Associates), which are responsible for selling and marketing Advantage payroll services and performing certain operational functions, while Paychex and Advantage provide all centralized back office payroll processing and payroll tax administration services. Under these arrangements, Advantage pays the Associates commissions based on processing activity for the related clients. When we acquired Advantage, there were fifteen Associates. Over the past few years, some arrangements with various Associates have been discontinued, and there are currently fewer than ten Associates. Since the actual amounts of future payments are uncertain, obligations under these arrangements are not included in the table above. Commission expense for the Associates for fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009 was $10.4 million, $9.9 million, and $12.3 million, respectively. In the normal course of business, we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients. Historically, there have been no material losses related to such guarantees. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, which require us to defend and, if necessary, indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to us. We guarantee performance of service on annual maintenance contracts for clients who financed their service contracts through a third party. We currently self insure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain employee benefit plans. Our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, the amounts accrued have not been material. We also maintain insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability, errors and omissions, warranty liability, theft and embezzlement, and acts of terrorism; and capacity for deductibles and self insured retentions through our captive insurance company. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. We do maintain investments as a limited partner in low income housing projects that are not considered part of our ongoing operations. These investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are less than 1% of our total assets as of May 31, 2011. Operating Cash Flow Activities Year ended May 31, In millions 2011 2010 2009 Net income $ 515.3 $ 477.0 $ 533.5 Non cash adjustments to net income 166.5 161.3 134.4 Cash provided by/(used in) changes in operating assets and liabilities 33.5 (27.4 ) 20.9 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 715.3 $ 610.9 $ 688.8 The increase in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2011 resulted mainly from an increase in net income and fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities. The decrease in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2010 related primarily to lower net income adjusted for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in non cash adjustments to net income in fiscal 2010 is primarily due to the $18.7 million expense charge to increase the litigation reserve, partially offset by the related increase in deferred tax benefit. The fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between periods for both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 were primarily related to the timing of collections from clients and payments for compensation, PEO payroll, income tax, and other liabilities. 23 Table of Contents Investing Cash Flow Activities Year ended May 31, In millions 2011 2010 2009 Net change in funds held for clients and corporate investment activities $ (179.8 ) $ (341.2 ) $ 491.4 Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment (100.5 ) (61.3 ) (64.1 ) (Acquisition)/sale of businesses (126.4 ) 13.1 (6.4 ) Purchases of other assets (2.8 ) (11.9 ) (16.4 ) Net cash (used in)/provided by investing activities $ (409.5 ) $ (401.3 ) $ 404.5 Funds held for clients and corporate investments: Funds held for clients consist of short term funds and available for sale securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of available for sale securities. The portfolio of funds held for clients and corporate investments is detailed in Note E of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The fluctuations in the net change in funds held for clients and corporate investment activities reflect the changing mix of investments. As a result of volatility in the financial markets, in September 2008 we divested of any VRDN securities held and began to utilize U.S. agency discount notes as our primary short term investment vehicle. U.S. agency discount notes are cash equivalents. VRDNs, although priced and traded as short term securities, are classified as available for sale securities and the cash paid and proceeds received for these securities are included in investing activities. As a result of the divestiture, the proceeds from sales of available for sale securities exceeded the purchases of available for sale securities in fiscal 2009. Much of these proceeds were held as cash equivalents in the funds held for clients portfolio. In November 2009, we began to again invest in select A 1/P 1 rated VRDNs, although at considerably lower levels than in the prior year. We utilized some of our cash equivalents to purchase these VRDNs, and in fiscal 2010 these purchases of available for sale securities were in excess of funds received from any sales of available for sale securities. Also in fiscal 2010, more corporate funds have been invested in longer term municipal bonds. In fiscal 2011, we continued to increase our investment in VRDNs and the amounts of purchases and sales for available for sale securities increased. However, partially offsetting this impact was the related liquidation of cash equivalents and the impact on cash equivalents from timing within the funds held for clients portfolio of remittances versus collections. See further discussion of this timing in the financing cash flows discussion of net change in client fund obligations. In general, fluctuations in net funds held for clients and corporate investment activities primarily relate to timing of purchases, sales, or maturities of investments. The amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of collection of client funds, and the related remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services. Additional discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in the Market Risk Factors section, contained in Item 7A of this Form 10 K. Purchases of long lived assets: To support our continued client and ancillary product growth, purchases of property and equipment were made for data processing equipment and software, and for the expansion and upgrade of various operating facilities. During fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009, we purchased approximately $5.7 million, $3.2 million, and $4.5 million, respectively, of data processing equipment and software from EMC Corporation. The Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of EMC Corporation is a member of our Board of Directors (the Board). During fiscal 2011, we paid $126.4 million for the acquisitions of SurePayroll and ePlan. During fiscal 2010, we received $13.1 million from the sale of Stromberg, an immaterial component of the Company. The purchases of other assets were for customer lists. 24 Table of Contents Financing Cash Flow Activities Year ended May 31, In millions, except per share amounts 2011 2010 2009 Net change in client fund obligations $ (34.9 ) $ 42.3 $ (346.0 ) Dividends paid (448.8 ) (448.6 ) (447.7 ) Proceeds from exercise and excess tax benefit related to stock based awards 12.6 8.2 9.0 Net cash used in financing activities $ (471.1 ) $ (398.1 ) $ (784.7 ) Cash dividends per common share $ 1.24 $ 1.24 $ 1.24 Net change in client fund obligations: The client fund obligations liability will vary based on the timing of collecting client funds, and the related required remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services. Collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with some items extending to 90 days. The outflow of funds for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 is the result of timing of collections and remittances surrounding the Federal holiday on May 31, 2010, offset by an increase in client fund obligations for higher withholdings for state unemployment insurance related to rate increases for calendar year 2011. As a result of May 31, 2010 being a Federal holiday, client fund obligations were higher as collections were made on Friday, May 28, 2010 that were not remitted to client employees and tax or regulatory agencies until June 2010. This resulted in a positive cash flow impact for fiscal 2010. Also, for fiscal 2010 there was an increase in client fund obligations as a result of higher withholdings for state unemployment insurance related to rate increases for the 2010 calendar year. May 31, 2011 did not fall on a Federal holiday, so we did not have the same level of client fund holdings at the end of fiscal 2011. Dividends paid: A quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share was paid to stockholders of record during fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009. The dividends paid as a percentage of net income totaled 87%, 94%, and 84% for those respective fiscal years. The payment of future dividends is dependent on our future earnings and cash flow and is subject to the discretion of our Board. Exercise of stock options: Proceeds from exercise and excess tax benefit related to stock based awards increased for fiscal 2011 and decreased for fiscal 2010 as compared to the respective prior years. Common shares acquired through exercise of stock options were 0.4 million shares for each of fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009. The increase for fiscal 2011 was the result of a higher average exercise price than for fiscal 2010. Refer to Note D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, for additional disclosures on our stock based compensation incentive plans. Other Recently adopted accounting pronouncements: Refer to Note A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently issued accounting pronouncements: At this time, we do not anticipate that recently issued accounting guidance that has not yet been adopted will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. Critical Accounting Policies Note A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, discusses the significant accounting policies of Paychex. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on 25 Table of Contents historical experience, future expectations, and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates. Certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below. Revenue recognition: Service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual service period. Our service revenue is largely attributable to payroll related processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed. The revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue, and the costs for delivery are included in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. PEO revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of direct costs billed and incurred, which include wages, taxes, benefit premiums, and claims of PEO worksite employees. Direct costs billed and incurred were $3.9 billion for fiscal 2011, $3.1 billion for fiscal 2010, and $2.6 billion for fiscal 2009. Revenue from Stromberg time and attendance solutions was recognized during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 until the date of disposition, when all of the following were present: persuasive evidence that an arrangement existed, typically a non cancelable sales order; delivery was complete for the software and hardware; the fee was fixed or determinable and free of contingencies; and collectibility was reasonably assured. Maintenance contracts were generally purchased by our clients in conjunction with their purchase of certain time and attendance solutions. Revenue from these maintenance contracts was recognized ratably over the term of the contract. Interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services, and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees. These collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with some items extending to 90 days. The interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income because the collecting, holding, and remitting of these funds are critical components of providing these services. Interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sales of available for sale securities. PEO workers compensation insurance: Workers compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims underwritten by us. These reserves include estimates for reported losses, plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims. In establishing the workers compensation insurance reserves, we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims. Estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections, and is subject to change due to multiple factors, including economic trends, changes in legal liability law, and damage awards, all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from our present estimates, particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future. We regularly review the adequacy of our estimated workers compensation insurance reserves. Adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified. Such adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends. Our maximum individual claims liability was $1.0 million under both the fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 policies. As of May 31, 2011 and May 31, 2010, we had recorded current liabilities of $7.3 million and $5.8 million, respectively, and long term liabilities of $20.6 million and $20.1 million, respectively, for workers compensation claims. Goodwill and other intangible assets: We have $513.7 million and $421.6 million of goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2011 and May 31, 2010, respectively, resulting from acquisitions of 26 Table of Contents businesses. The increase in goodwill was due to the acquisition in fiscal 2011 of two software as a service companies, whose results are immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit. Impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. Our business is largely homogeneous and, as a result, substantially all of the goodwill is associated with one reporting unit. We perform our annual impairment testing in our fiscal fourth quarter. Based on the results of our reviews, no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal year 2011, 2010 or 2009. Subsequent to this review, there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of our goodwill balance. We also test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Stock based compensation costs: All stock based awards to employees, including grants of stock options, are recognized as compensation costs in our consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant. We estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a Black Scholes option pricing model. This model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the Paychex stock price and expected option life. We estimate volatility based on a combination of historical volatility using weekly stock prices over a period equal to the expected option life and implied market volatility. Expected option life is estimated based on historical exercise behavior. We are required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest. Our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience. Forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified with any adjustment recorded in the period of change, and the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures. The assumptions of volatility, expected option life, and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior, stock price trends, and changes to type or provisions of stock based awards. Any change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of an award and on stock based compensation costs recognized in our results of operations. We have determined that the Black Scholes option pricing model, as well as the underlying assumptions used in its application, is appropriate in estimating the fair value of stock option grants. We periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model, and will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value, or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change. Income taxes: We account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We record a deferred tax asset related to the stock based compensation costs recognized for certain stock based awards. At the time of exercise of non qualified stock options or vesting of stock awards, we account for the resulting tax deduction by reducing our accrued income tax liability with an offset to the deferred tax asset and any excess tax benefit increasing additional paid in capital. We currently have a sufficient pool of excess tax benefits in additional paid in capital to absorb any deficient tax benefits related to stock based awards. We maintain a reserve for uncertain tax positions. We evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for recognition in our consolidated financial statements. Prior to recording the related tax benefit in our consolidated financial statements, we must conclude that tax positions must be more likely than not to be sustained, assuming those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information. The benefit recognized in our consolidated financial statements is the amount we expect to realize after 27 Table of Contents examination by taxing authorities. If a tax position drops below the more likely than not standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized. Assumptions, judgment, and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more likely than not standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes and in determining the expected benefit. A change in the assessment of the more likely than not standard could materially impact our results of operations or financial position. Our reserve for uncertain tax positions was $34.4 million as of May 31, 2011 and $27.5 million as of May 31, 2010. Refer to Note I of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, for further discussion of our reserve for uncertain tax positions. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market Risk Factors Changes in interest rates and interest rate risk: Funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short term funds and available for sale securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of available for sale securities. As a result of our operating and investing activities, we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially affect our results of operations and financial position. Changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the fair value of our longer term available for sale securities. We follow an investment strategy of optimizing liquidity and protecting principal. We invest primarily in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short term securities with A 1/P 1 ratings, with more than 95% of our portfolio rated AA or better. We invest predominately in municipal bonds general obligation bonds; pre refunded bonds, which are secured by a U.S. government escrow; and essential services revenue bonds. We limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest in short to intermediate term instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes. We manage the available for sale securities to a benchmark duration of two and one half to three years. All investments held as of May 31, 2011 were traded in active markets. Starting in November 2009 we began to invest in select A 1/P 1 rated VRDNs and have gradually increased our investment in VRDNs to $828.3 million as of May 31, 2011, up from $226.3 million as of May 31, 2010. During fiscal 2011, we earned an after tax rate of approximately 0.23% for VRDNs compared to approximately 0.06% for U.S. agency discount notes, which have been our primary short term investment vehicle. We have no exposure to high risk or illiquid investments such as auction rate securities, sub prime mortgage securities, asset backed securities or asset backed commercial paper, collateralized debt obligations, enhanced cash or cash plus mutual funds, or structured investment vehicles (SIVs). We have not and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk. During fiscal 2011, the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was 1.3%, compared with 1.5% for fiscal 2010 and 2.1% for fiscal 2009. When interest rates are falling, the full impact of lower interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of short and long term interest rate changes. During a falling interest rate environment, the decreases in interest rates decrease earnings from our short term investments, and over time decrease earnings from our longer term available for sale securities. Earnings from the available for sale securities, which as of May 31, 2011 had an average duration of 2.4 years, would not reflect decreases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at lower rates. In the next twelve months, slightly more than 20% of our available for sale portfolio will mature, and it is currently anticipated that these proceeds will be reinvested at a lower average interest rate of approximately 1.0%. 28 Table of Contents The amortized cost and fair value of available for sale securities that had stated maturities as of May 31, 2011 are shown below by contractual maturity. Expected maturities can differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties. May 31, 2011 Amortized Fair In millions cost value Maturity date: Due in one year or less $ 408.7 $ 412.3 Due after one year through three years 603.0 626.9 Due after three years through five years 570.8 592.7 Due after five years 1,095.4 1,105.3 Total $ 2,677.9 $ 2,737.2 VRDNs are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities are typically 20 to 30 years. Although these securities are issued as long term securities, they are priced and traded as short term instruments because of the liquidity provided through the tender feature. The following table summarizes the changes in the Federal Funds rate over the past three fiscal years: 2011 2010 2009 Federal Funds rate beginning of fiscal year 0.25 % 0.25 % 2.00 % Rate decrease: First quarter Second quarter (1.00 ) Third quarter (0.75 ) Fourth quarter Federal Funds rate end of fiscal year(1) 0.25 % 0.25 % 0.25 % Three year AAA municipal securities yields end of fiscal year 0.80 % 0.99 % 1.35 % (1) The Federal Funds rate was a range of zero to 0.25% as of May 31, 2011, May 31, 2010, and May 31, 2009. Calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to: daily interest rate changes; seasonal variations in investment balances; actual duration of short term and available for sale securities; the proportional mix of taxable and tax exempt investments; changes in tax exempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates, which are not synchronized or simultaneous; and financial market volatility and the resulting effect on benchmark and other indexing interest rates. Subject to these factors and under normal financial market conditions, a 25 basis point change in taxable interest rates generally affects our tax exempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points. Our total investment portfolio (funds held for clients and corporate investments) averaged approximately $4.0 billion for fiscal 2011. Our anticipated allocation is approximately 50% invested in short term securities and available for sale securities with an average duration of less than 30 days, and 50% invested in available for sale securities with an average duration of two and one half to three years. 29 Table of Contents The combined funds held for clients and corporate available for sale securities reflected a net unrealized gain of $59.3 million as of May 31, 2011, compared with an unrealized gain of $66.6 million as of May 31, 2010. In determining fair value, we utilize the Interactive Data Pricing Service. During fiscal 2011, the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from $41.4 million to $86.2 million. During fiscal 2010, the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from $55.1 million to $82.4 million. The net unrealized gain of our investment portfolios was approximately $57.5 million as of July 11, 2011. As of May 31, 2011 and May 31, 2010, we had $2.7 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, invested in available for sale securities at fair value. The weighted average yield to maturity was 2.6% and 2.9% as of May 31, 2011 and May 31, 2010, respectively. The weighted average yield to maturity excludes available for sale securities tied to short term interest rates such as the VRDNs held as of May 31, 2011 and May 31, 2010. Assuming a hypothetical decrease in both short term and longer term interest rates of 25 basis points, the resulting potential increase in fair value for our portfolio of available for sale securities as of May 31, 2011, would be approximately $11.5 million. Conversely, a corresponding increase in interest rates would result in a comparable decrease in fair value. This hypothetical increase or decrease in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolios recorded value, with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders equity. These fluctuations in fair value would have no related or immediate impact on the results of operations, unless any declines in fair value were considered to be other than temporary and an impairment loss recognized. Credit risk: We are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds. We regularly review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is other than temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns. We believe that the investments we held as of May 31, 2011 were not other than temporarily impaired. While $51.7 million of our available for sale securities had fair values that were below amortized cost, we believe that it is probable that the principal and interest will be collected in accordance with the contractual terms, and that the unrealized loss of $0.1 million was due to changes in interest rates and was not due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns. All of the securities in an unrealized loss position as of May 31, 2011 and May 31, 2010 held an AA rating or better. We intend to hold these investments until the recovery of their amortized cost basis or maturity, and further believe that it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these investments prior to that time. Our assessment that an investment is not other than temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment. 30
