Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Peoples Bank (Peoples) is a federally chartered stock savings bank headquartered in Bridgeport, Connecticut with $10.7 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2006. Peoples was organized in 1842 as a mutual savings bank and converted to stock form in 1988. In August 2006, Peoples converted from a Connecticut chartered stock savings bank to a federally chartered stock savings bank. Deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Peoples regulator is the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). Peoples offers a full range of financial services to individual, corporate and municipal customers. Traditional banking activities are conducted primarily within the state of Connecticut and include extending secured and unsecured commercial and consumer loans, originating mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial properties, and accepting consumer, commercial and municipal deposits. In addition to traditional banking activities, Peoples provides specialized services tailored to specific markets including: personal, institutional and employee benefit trust; cash management; and municipal banking and finance. Through its subsidiaries, Peoples offers: brokerage, financial advisory services, investment management services and life insurance through Peoples Securities, Inc. (PSI); equipment financing through Peoples Capital and Leasing Corp. (PCLC); and other insurance services through R.C. Knox and Company, Inc. (RC Knox). This full range of financial services is delivered through a network of 77 traditional branches, 74 full service Stop & Shop supermarket branches that provide customers with seven day a week banking, seven limited service branches, 23 investment and brokerage offices (22 of which are located within branch offices), five wealth management and trust offices, eight PCLC offices and seven commercial banking offices. Peoples distribution network also includes fully integrated online banking and investment trading, a 24 hour telephone banking service and participation in a worldwide ATM network. Peoples has expanded its residential mortgage and home equity lending activities in the contiguous markets of New York and Massachusetts. In addition, Peoples maintains a loan production office in Massachusetts and PCLC maintains a sales presence in six states to support commercial real estate lending and equipment financing operations, respectively, outside of Connecticut. Within the Commercial Banking division, Peoples maintains a national credits group, which seeks to participate in commercial loans and commercial real estate finance loans to borrowers in various industries on a national scale. 19 Table of Contents Peoples results of operations are largely dependent upon revenues generated through net interest income and fee based revenues and, to a much lesser extent, other forms of non interest income such as gains on asset sales. Sources for these revenues are diversified across Peoples two primary business segments representing its core businesses, Commercial Banking and Consumer Financial Services, and to a lesser extent, Treasury. Peoples results of operations are also significantly affected by the provision for loan losses and the level of non interest expense. In addition, Peoples results of operations may also be affected by general and local economic conditions, changes in market interest rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Charter Conversion, Regulation and Plan of Conversion Peoples converted to a federally chartered stock savings bank from a Connecticut chartered stock savings bank effective August 18, 2006. The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) is Peoples regulator under the federal charter. Previously under its state charter, Peoples was regulated by the State of Connecticut Department of Banking and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Simultaneously with Peoples conversion, Peoples Mutual Holdings (Holdings) converted to a federally chartered mutual holding company from a Connecticut chartered mutual holding company. On September 20, 2006, Peoples and Holdings announced their plan to convert from a mutual holding company structure to a fully public stock holding company structure. The Boards of Holdings and Peoples have adopted a Plan of Conversion and Reorganization (the Plan). The transactions contemplated by the Plan are subject to approval by Peoples stockholders, its depositors and the OTS. On February 14, 2007, the OTS gave its conditional approval to the Plan. Special meetings of Peoples stockholders and depositors to approve the Plan are scheduled for April 5, 2007. Critical Accounting Policies In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, Peoples is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, including the classification of revenues and expenses to discontinued operations. Actual results could differ from Peoples current estimates, as a result of changing conditions and future events. Several estimates are particularly critical and are 20 Table of Contents susceptible to significant near term change, including the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of derivative financial instruments, and asset impairment judgments including other than temporary declines in the value of securities and the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets. Peoples significant accounting policies and critical estimates are summarized in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses charged to income. Losses on loans, including impaired loans, are charged to the allowance for loan losses when all or a portion of a loan is deemed to be uncollectible. Recoveries of loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance when realized. Management maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that is believed to be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio, based on a quarterly evaluation of a variety of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to: Peoples historical loan loss experience and recent trends in that experience; risk ratings assigned by lending personnel to commercial real estate finance, commercial and PCLC loans, and the results of ongoing reviews of those ratings by Peoples independent loan review function; an evaluation of non performing loans and related collateral values; the probability of loss in view of geographic and industry concentrations and other portfolio risk characteristics; the present financial condition of borrowers; and current economic conditions. While management seeks to use the best available information to make these evaluations, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions, results of regulatory examinations, further information obtained regarding known problem loans, the identification of additional problem loans and other factors. The allowance for loan losses consists of amounts determined in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, and SFAS No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan. In applying SFAS No. 5, management considers the factors listed in the preceding paragraph in order to estimate a loss allowance for (1) each homogeneous pool of smaller balance loans (residential mortgage and consumer loans) that are evaluated on a collective basis, and (2) commercial real estate finance, commercial and PCLC loans that are not considered impaired under SFAS No. 114. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that Peoples will be unable to collect all principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan. Peoples applies SFAS No. 114 to loans 21 Table of Contents that are individually evaluated for collectibility in accordance with its normal loan review procedures. Under SFAS No. 114, impaired loans are reported based on one of three measures: the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate; the loans observable market price; or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. If the measure is less than an impaired loans recorded investment, an impairment loss is recognized as part of the allowance for loan losses. Valuation of Derivative Financial Instruments. Peoples uses derivatives for market risk management purposes (principally interest rate risk) and not for trading or speculation purposes. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, all derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. Favorable changes in fair values result in unrealized gains that are recognized as assets, while unfavorable changes result in unrealized losses that are recognized as liabilities. Peoples hedge accounting methods vary depending on whether the derivative instrument is classified as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. Hedge accounting is permitted only if specific criteria are met, including a requirement that a highly effective relationship exist between the derivative instrument and the hedged item, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis. Results of effective hedges are recognized in current earnings for fair value hedges. Changes in the fair value of effective cash flow hedges are recognized in other comprehensive income until earnings are affected by the variability in cash flows of the designated hedged item. Ineffective portions of hedge results are recognized in current earnings. Peoples formally documents all relationships between the derivative instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as hedges to specific assets and liabilities, or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. Peoples also formally assesses, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged items. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective or has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, Peoples would discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. Interest rate lock commitments extended to borrowers relate to the origination of residential mortgage loans. To mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in these commitments, Peoples enters into mandatory delivery and best efforts contracts to sell adjustable rate and fixed rate residential mortgage loans. Forward commitments to sell and 22 Table of Contents interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans are considered derivatives and their respective estimated fair values are adjusted based on changes in interest rates and exclude the value of mortgage servicing rights. Asset Impairment Judgments Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, requires, among other things, use of the purchase method to account for all business combinations and specifies criteria that acquired intangible assets must meet in order to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. The assets and liabilities of an acquired company are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. Intangible assets are recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Other acquisition related intangibles are separately identified, where appropriate, for the estimated value of acquired customer relationships and are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated remaining average life of those relationships (ranging from 7 to 12 years from the respective acquisition dates). The remaining intangible asset is classified as goodwill. FAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill be reviewed for impairment at least annually, with impairment losses charged to expense when they occur. Acquisition related intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives and are periodically reviewed by management to assess recoverability. Impairment losses are recognized as a charge to expense if carrying amounts exceed fair values. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment using a two step approach that involves the identification of reporting units and the estimation of fair values. Goodwill shall also be tested for impairment when events occur that would more likely than not reduce the implied fair value of goodwill below its carrying value. An impairment loss is recognized as a charge to expense for any excess of the goodwill carrying amount over implied fair value. Securities. Marketable equity and debt securities (other than those reported as short term investments) are classified as either trading account securities, held to maturity securities (applicable only to debt securities) or available for sale securities. Management determines the classification of a security at the time of its purchase. Securities purchased for sale in the near term and those held by PSI (in accordance with the requirements for a broker dealer) are classified as trading account securities and reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are 23 Table of Contents reported in non interest income. Debt securities that Peoples has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity securities and reported at amortized cost. All other securities are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are reported on an after tax basis in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Premiums are amortized and discounts are accreted to interest income for debt securities, using the interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity, adjusted for the effect of actual prepayments in the case of mortgage backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and other asset backed securities. Federal Home Loan Bank stock is a non marketable equity security reported at cost. Security transactions are generally recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method and reported in non interest income. Management conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if the decline in fair value of any security appears to be other than temporary. If the decline is deemed to be other than temporary, the security is written down to a new cost basis and the resulting loss is reported in non interest income. The factors considered by management in its periodic review include, but are not limited to: the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer; the ratings of the security; whether the decline in fair value appears to be issuer specific or, alternatively, a reflection of general market or industry conditions; and Peoples intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in fair value. Non GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation to GAAP In addition to evaluating Peoples results of operations in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management routinely supplements this evaluation with an analysis of certain non GAAP financial measures, such as the efficiency ratio, core deposits and purchased funds. Management believes such non GAAP financial measures provides information useful to investors in understanding Peoples underlying operating performance and trends, and facilitates comparisons with the performance of other banks and thrifts. Management utilizes core deposits and purchased funds as non GAAP financial measures to supplement its analysis of Peoples business performance. Core deposits is a measure of stable funding sources and is defined as total deposits, other than brokered certificates of deposit (acquired in the wholesale market), municipal deposits (which are seasonally variable by nature) and non interest bearing deposits utilized for the operation of Peoples businesses. Purchased funds include borrowings, brokered certificates of deposit and municipal deposits. 24 Table of Contents Although management believes that the above mentioned non GAAP financial measures enhance investors understanding of Peoples operating performance, these non GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. The reconciliation of these non GAAP financial measures from GAAP to non GAAP is presented below. 25 Table of Contents The following tables provide reconciliations between GAAP and non GAAP financial measures: As of December 31 (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Deposits $ 9,083 $ 9,083 $ 8,862 $ 8,714 $ 8,426 Less: Municipal deposits 43 129 106 125 77 Brokered certificates of deposit 70 120 Other non interest bearing deposits 81 81 75 86 127 Core deposits $ 8,959 $ 8,873 $ 8,681 $ 8,433 $ 8,102 As of December 31 (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Borrowings $ 4 $ 295 $ 341 $ 1,516 $ 2,437 Plus: Municipal deposits 43 129 106 125 77 Brokered certificates of deposit 70 120 Purchased funds $ 47 $ 424 $ 447 $ 1,711 $ 2,634 In addition to the above non GAAP financial measures, management uses the efficiency ratio to monitor its operating efficiency compared to its peers. The efficiency ratio, which represents an approximate measure of the cost required by Peoples to generate a dollar of revenue, is the ratio of total non interest expense (excluding goodwill impairment charges, amortization of acquisition related intangibles, losses on real estate assets and nonrecurring expenses) (the numerator) to net interest income plus total non interest income (excluding gains and losses on sales of assets, other than residential mortgage loans, and nonrecurring income) (the denominator). Peoples generally considers an income or expense to be nonrecurring if it is not similar to an income or expense of a type incurred within the last two years and is not similar to an expense of a type reasonably expected to be incurred within the following two years. Management considers the efficiency ratio to be more representative of Peoples ongoing operating efficiency, as the excluded items are generally related to external market conditions and non routine transactions. 26 Table of Contents The following table summarizes Peoples efficiency ratio derived from amounts reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Economic activity in the United States showed continued signs of expanding in 2006. Real gross domestic product increased at a rate of 3.4% for the year, a level that represents the countrys long term historical average growth rate and an increase from the 3.2% pace recorded in 2005. The national unemployment rate was 4.5% as of December 31, 2006, down from 4.9% at the end of 2005. The national economy continued to grow despite widening federal budget and trade deficits, higher short term interest rates, elevated energy costs, a weaker housing market, and geopolitical uncertainties. In response to continuing signs that the U.S. economy was expanding, the Federal Reserve Board increased the targeted federal funds rate four times in 2006 by a total of 100 basis points, after thirteen interest rate increases during 2004 and 2005 totaling 350 basis points, bringing the rate to 5.25% as of December 31, 2006. This was up from 1.00% at the end of 2003. The Federal Reserve has not increased the targeted federal funds rates since the June 29, 2006 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, however, and has held the rate steady at 5.25% for the last five FOMC meetings. Peoples primary market area, Connecticut, is one of the most attractive markets in the United States with a total population of approximately 3.5 million and a median household income of $66,018 as of June 30, 2006, ranking second in the United States and well above the U.S. median income of $51,546, according to estimates from SNL Securities. Fairfield County, where Peoples is headquartered, is the wealthiest county in Connecticut, with a June 30, 2006 median household income of $81,678 according to estimates from SNL Securities. The states unemployment rate decreased to 4.2% as of December 31, 2006, compared to 4.6% at the end of 2005, and remained below the national rate of 4.5%. The Connecticut economy experienced moderate job growth in 2006, with total employment increasing by 10,600 jobs, or approximately 0.6% from December 31, 2005 to December 31, 2006. The outlook for the Connecticut economy in 2007 is cautiously optimistic, with the expectation that the state will experience further job growth as the economy continues to expand moderately. 28 Table of Contents Financial Overview Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005. Total assets at December 31, 2006 were $10.7 billion, a decrease of $246 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2005, primarily due to a $1.3 billion decline in total securities, partially offset by increases of $799 million in total loans, $193 million in short term investments, $58 million in bank owned life insurance and $66 million in other assets. The increase in total loans reflects growth of $456 million, or 10%, in Consumer Financial Services and $343 million, or 9%, in Commercial Banking. The growth in Consumer Financial Services was driven by increases of $392 million, or 11%, in residential mortgage loans and $64 million, or 5%, in consumer loans. The increase in residential mortgage loans reflects, in part, the purchase of $170 million of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans towards the end of the first quarter of 2006. The growth in Commercial Banking reflects increases of $235 million, or 37%, in loans originated by PCLC, our equipment financing subsidiary, $135 million, or 29%, in our national credits portfolio, and $60 million, or 5%, in commercial lending. These increases were partially offset by an $87 million, or 5%, decline in commercial real estate finance loans. The decrease in the securities portfolio reflects the sale of $266 million and $810 million of debt securities in the second and third quarters of 2006, respectively, to better position Peoples balance sheet for the prevailing interest rate environment at the time. Peoples also funded an additional $50 million of bank owned life insurance in 2006 and contributed $91.5 million in the third quarter of 2006 to its employee retirement plan (reported in other assets) to more than fully fund its projected benefit obligation and to significantly reduce pension plan expense in future years. Proceeds from sales of securities were also used to reduce total borrowings and subordinated notes by $335 million since December 31, 2005. Non performing assets totaled $22.7 million at December 31, 2006, a $0.7 million increase from December 31, 2005. Non performing assets declined by $0.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2006, reflecting an increase in non performing commercial loans to $11.9 million at December 31, 2006 as one commercial loan totaling $10.6 million was classified as non performing, partially offset by a $4.1 million decrease in non performing PCLC loans and a decrease in non performing commercial real estate finance loans to $0.2 million resulting from the full recovery on one commercial real estate finance loan totaling $5.5 million. The allowance for loan losses decreased $1.0 million to $74 million at December 31, 2006 compared to December 31, 2005, primarily reflecting reductions 29 Table of Contents in the allowance for loan losses allocated to the consumer loan portfolios, partially offset by net additions to the commercial banking loan portfolios. At December 31, 2006, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.79% and as a percentage of non performing loans was 328%, compared to 0.87% and 353%, respectively, at December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2006, liabilities totaled $9.3 billion, a $297 million, or 3%, decrease from December 31, 2005, reflecting a $335 million reduction in total borrowings and subordinated notes. Core deposits increased a modest $86 million, or 1%, in 2006 compared to 2005, reflecting Peoples strategy to fund loan growth with proceeds from maturities, sales and repayments of securities rather than core deposits. Peoples total stockholders equity was $1.34 billion at December 31, 2006, a $51 million net increase from December 31, 2005, reflecting net income of $124.0 million, partially offset by dividends paid of $60 million and a $25 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss reflects a $40 million after tax increase from the implementation of SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans and a $4 million increase in the after tax unrealized loss on derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges, partially offset by a $19 million reduction in the after tax net unrealized loss on securities available for sale due to the sales of securities discussed above. As a percentage of total assets, stockholders equity was 12.5% at December 31, 2006 compared to 11.8% at December 31, 2005. Peoples leverage, tier 1 and total risk based capital ratios were 12.0%, 14.8% and 16.1%, respectively, at December 31, 2006, compared to 11.2%, 14.8% and 16.4%, respectively, at December 31, 2005. The capital ratios were calculated in accordance with OTS regulations as of December 31, 2006 and FDIC regulations as of December 31, 2005. Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004. Total assets at December 31, 2005 were $10.9 billion, an increase of $215 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2004, primarily due to increases of $640 million in total loans and $154 million in bank owned life insurance, partially offset by a $708 million decline in total securities. The increase in total loans from year end 2004 was largely attributable to increases of $340 million in commercial loans and $242 million in residential mortgage loans. The decrease in the securities portfolio reflects the substitution of higher yielding loans for securities and the funding of a $150 million investment in bank owned life insurance with proceeds from maturing securities. 30 Table of Contents Non performing assets totaled $22.0 million at December 31, 2005, a $6.6 million decrease from year end 2004. The allowance for loan losses increased $2.5 million to $75 million at December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004, primarily reflecting increases in the allowance for loan losses allocated to commercial loans of $2.0 million and PCLC loans of $2.5 million, partially offset by a $2.0 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses allocated to the consumer loan portfolio. At December 31, 2005, the allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans was 0.87% and as a percent of non performing loans was 353%, compared to 0.91% and 265%, respectively, at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2005, liabilities totaled $9.6 billion, a $126 million increase from December 31, 2004, reflecting a $221 million increase in total deposits and an $89 million increase in stockholders equity, partially offset by a $46 million reduction in total borrowings. Peoples total stockholders equity was $1.29 billion at December 31, 2005, an $89 million increase from December 31, 2004, reflecting net income of $137.1 million, partially offset by dividends paid of $52.4 million. As a percentage of total assets, stockholders equity was 11.8% at December 31, 2005, compared to 11.2% at December 31, 2004. Peoples leverage, tier 1 and total risk based capital ratios were 11.2%, 14.8% and 16.4%, respectively, at December 31, 2005, compared to 10.5%, 14.6% and 16.7%, respectively, at December 31, 2004. The capital ratios were calculated in accordance with FDIC regulations. Comparison of Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005. Peoples reported net income of $124.0 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $137.1 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, for the year ago period. Income from continuing operations totaled $121.7 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $125.9 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, for the year ago period. In 2006, Peoples return on average assets was 1.15% and return on average stockholders equity was 9.4%. Results for 2006 include net security losses totaling $27.4 million from the sale of $266 million and $810 million of debt securities in the second and third quarters of 2006, respectively. Results for 2006 also include a $2.4 million income tax benefit related to certain prior year tax matters. The net impact of these items reduced 2006 net income by $15.8 million, or $0.11 per share. 31 Table of Contents Results for 2005 included an $8.1 million gain on the sale of three branches, a $9.7 million gain from the resolution of a significant contingency related to the sale of the credit card business in 2004 (reported in income from discontinued operations), a $2.0 million income tax benefit resulting from the completion of a routine federal tax audit, a $2.0 million goodwill impairment charge and expenses incurred in connection with the repurchase of subordinated notes ($2.7 million) and the accelerated vesting of stock options ($0.7 million). The net impact of these items increased 2005 net income by $9.3 million, or $0.07 per share. Net interest income increased $12.7 million, or 3%, from 2005 and the net interest margin improved 19 basis points to 3.87%. The higher net interest margin reflects the asset sensitive position of the balance sheet, the substitution of securities with higher yielding loans, the partial benefit from the sales of securities in the second and third quarters of 2006, and the impact of our deposit pricing strategy. Compared to 2005, average earning assets decreased $173 million, or 2%, as a $934 million, or 54%, decline in average securities funded a $715 million, or 9%, increase in average loans and a $113 million, or 27%, decrease in average total borrowings and average subordinated notes. The loan growth reflects increases of $285 million, or 8%, in average commercial banking loans, $345 million, or 10%, in average residential mortgage loans, and $108 million, or 9%, in average home equity loans, all as compared to 2005. The increase in average residential mortgage loans reflects, in part, the purchase of $170 million of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans towards the end of the first quarter of 2006. In addition, Peoples invested $50 million in the first quarter of 2006 and $150 million in the second quarter of 2005 in bank owned life insurance, and contributed $91.5 million to its employee retirement plan in September 2006. Compared to 2005, total non interest income, excluding net security losses, increased $1.2 million, or 1%; total non interest expense increased $2.5 million, or 1%; and the efficiency ratio improved to 61.3% from 62.8%. The provision for loan losses was $3.4 million compared to $8.6 million in 2005. The provision for loan losses for 2006 reflects net loan charge offs of $4.4 million, partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in the allowance for loan losses. The provision for loan losses in 2005 reflected net loan charge offs of $6.1 million and a $2.5 million increase in the allowance for loan losses. Net loan charge offs decreased $1.7 million, or 28%, for 2006, compared to 2005. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average loans equaled 0.05%, down from 0.07% for 2005. 32 Table of Contents Comparison of Results of Operations for 2005 and 2004. Peoples reported net income in 2005 of $137.1 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, compared to $199.7 million, or $1.42 per diluted share in 2004. Included in the 2005 results were a gain on the sale of three branches, a gain from the resolution of a significant contingency related to the sale of Peoples credit card portfolio in 2004, an income tax benefit, a goodwill impairment charge and expenses incurred in connection with the repurchase of subordinated notes and the accelerated vesting of stock options. The 2004 results included the net gain on the sale of Peoples credit card business, liability restructuring charges, other nonrecurring expenses and an income tax benefit. In 2005, Peoples return on average assets was 1.27% and return on average stockholders equity was 11.1%. The net interest margin improved 35 basis points from 2004, reflecting a combination of Peoples asset sensitive position and the ongoing shift of its asset mix from investment securities to higher yielding loans. Other important factors that affected the financial results in 2005 were strong loan growth in Peoples commercial banking and home equity lending portfolios; a 35% reduction in the provision for loan losses; growth in fee based revenues; and continued expense control. On March 5, 2004, Peoples completed the sale of its credit card business, which included $2.0 billion of credit card receivables, as well as the transfer of its related credit card operations and 420 employees, to The Royal Bank of Scotland Group. The net pre tax gain on sale of $305.4 million is included in income from discontinued operations for 2004 in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Peoples utilized a portion of the proceeds from the sale of its credit card business to prepay slightly over $1.0 billion of long term borrowings. In addition, derivative positions with notional values of $770 million were canceled. Liability restructuring costs totaling $133.4 million are included in total non interest expense for 2004 in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 33 Table of Contents Business Segment Results Peoples operations are divided into two primary business segments that represent its core businesses, commercial banking and consumer financial services. In addition, the treasury area is responsible for managing Peoples securities portfolio, short term investments, wholesale funding activities, such as borrowings and the funding center. The income or loss for the funding center, which includes the impact of derivative financial instruments used for risk management purposes, represents the interest rate risk component of Peoples net interest income as calculated by Peoples funds transfer pricing model (FTP), to derive each operating segments net interest income. Business Segment Performance Summary Net Income Years ended December 31 (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Commercial Banking $ 41.9 $ 45.7 $ 45.1 Consumer Financial Services 85.8 94.2 90.0 Treasury (26.0 ) (25.0 ) (60.5 ) Total reportable segments 101.7 114.9 74.6 Other 22.3 22.2 125.1 Total Consolidated $ 124.0 $ 137.1 $ 199.7 Peoples uses an internal profitability reporting system to generate information by operating segment, which is based on a series of management estimates and allocations regarding funds transfer pricing, the provision for loan losses, non interest expense and income taxes. These estimates and allocations, some of which can be subjective in nature, are continually being reviewed and refined. Any changes in estimates and allocations that may affect the reported results of any business segment will not affect the consolidated financial position or results of operations of Peoples as a whole. FTP is used in the calculation of each operating segments net interest income, and measures the value of funds used in and provided by an operating segment. The difference between the interest income on earning assets and the interest expense on funding liabilities, and the corresponding FTP charge for interest income or credit for interest expense, results in net spread income. The provision for loan losses for the Commercial Banking and Consumer Financial Services segments is generally based on a five year rolling average net charge off rate for the respective segment. Peoples allocates a majority of non interest expenses to each business segment using a full absorption costing process. Direct and indirect costs are analyzed and pooled by process and assigned to the appropriate 34 Table of Contents business segment and corporate overhead costs are allocated to the business segments. Income tax expense is allocated to each business segment using a constant rate, based on an estimate of the consolidated effective income tax rate for the year. In the second quarter of 2006, the results of the funding center, previously included in Other, were reclassified to Treasury. In the first quarter of 2006, Peoples revised its FTP methodology assumptions relating to deposit products with indeterminate maturities, based on a comprehensive historical analysis of the implied maturities and repricing characteristics of those deposits. As a result, the duration for most of those deposits was lengthened, which in turn increased their value and corresponding FTP credit. Segment information for all periods presented has been restated to reflect the changes resulting from the reclassification of the funding center to Treasury and the revised FTP methodology assumptions. For a more detailed description of the estimates and allocations used to measure business segment performance, see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Commercial Banking consists principally of commercial lending, commercial real estate finance lending and commercial deposit gathering activities. This segment also includes the equipment financing operations of PCLC, as well as cash management, correspondent banking and municipal banking.

Net interest income increased $0.8 million, or 1%, reflecting a $284 million, or 8%, increase in average earning assets, partially offset by narrower net spreads. The $3.9 million decrease in fee based revenues reflects lower lending related charges and fees, primarily lower commercial real estate finance loan prepayment penalties. The increase in other non interest income primarily reflects a $2.7 million increase in rental income on leased equipment. The $4.6 million, or 6%, increase in non interest expense reflects an increase in direct expenses due to the continued growth in Commercial Banking, including a $2.0 million increase in the amortization expense of equipment leased to commercial customers. The increase in average earning assets compared to 2005 reflects increases of $183 million, or 35%, in PCLC loans, and $127 million, or 10%, in commercial loans, partially offset by a $25 million, or 1%, decrease in commercial real estate finance loans. Average commercial non interest bearing deposits totaled $939 million for 2006, a $43 million, or 4%, decrease compared to 2005, reflecting the current higher interest rate environment. Commercial Banking income from continuing operations increased $0.6 million, or 1%, in 2005 compared to 2004, reflecting increases in net interest income and fee based revenues, partially offset by increases in non interest expense. Net interest income increased $3.9 million, or 3%, reflecting a $417 million, or 13%, increase in average earning assets, partially offset by narrower net spreads. The $3.3 million increase in fee based revenues reflects higher lending related charges and fees, primarily higher commercial real estate finance loan prepayment penalties. The $6.3 million, or 9%, increase in non interest expense reflects a $5.3 million increase in allocated expenses, due to the continued growth in this business during 2005 and a higher level of charges related to loan prepayments. The increase in average earning assets compared to 2004 reflects increases of $224 million, or 21%, in commercial loans, $164 million, or 46%, in PCLC loans and $30 million, or 2%, in commercial real estate finance loans. Average commercial non interest bearing deposits grew $43 million, or 5%, on a year over year basis. 36 Table of Contents Consumer Financial Services includes, as its principal business lines, consumer deposit gathering activities, and residential mortgage, home equity and other consumer lending (excluding the national consumer loan portfolio, which is reported in Other). In addition to trust services, this segment also includes brokerage, financial advisory services, investment management services and life insurance provided by PSI, and other insurance services provided through RC Knox.

Additionally, results for 2005 included the $8.1 million gain on sale of branches. The decrease in net interest income primarily reflects the reduction in net spread interest income for residential mortgage loans and the decline in net interest spread from an unfavorable shift from savings and money market deposits to higher rate time deposits, partially offset by the benefit of an increase in average loan balances. The shift in deposit mix reflects an increase in higher rate time deposits, partially offset by a decline in savings and money market deposits. During 2006, average earning assets increased $452 million, or 10%, including increases of $345 million, or 10%, in average residential mortgage loans and $106 million, or 9%, in average home equity loans. Peoples purchased $170 million of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans towards the end of the first quarter of 2006. Average consumer deposits totaled $7.7 billion, a 1% increase compared to 2005. 37 Table of Contents The increase in fee based revenues in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily reflects an increase in service charges on deposit accounts related to changes in Peoples fee structure. The increase in other non interest income reflects a $0.7 million net gain from the sale of a corporate insurance account by RC Knox. Included in non interest income in 2005 was an $8.1 million gain on the sale of three branches. The increase in non interest expense reflects a $3.8 million increase in allocated expenses in 2006, partially offset by a $2.0 million goodwill impairment charge in 2005. Consumer Financial Services income from continuing operations increased $4.2 million, or 5%, in 2005 compared to 2004. Fee based revenues increased $5.3 million compared to 2004, reflecting increases in service charges on deposit accounts and insurance revenue. Included in non interest income in 2005 was an $8.1 million gain on the sale of three branches. The increase in non interest expense reflects a $7.6 million increase in allocated expenses and a $2.0 million goodwill impairment charge in 2005 resulting from the decision to combine OMIA, previously a separate operating subsidiary, with one of Peoples other businesses within the Consumer Financial Services segment (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In 2005, average earning assets increased $487 million, or 12%, including increases of $250 million, or 8%, in average residential mortgage loans and $228 million, or 25%, in average home equity loans. Average consumer deposits increased $90 million, or 1%, compared to 2004. 38 Table of Contents Treasury encompasses the securities portfolio, short term investments, wholesale funding activities, such as borrowings and the funding center. The income or loss for the funding center, which includes the impact of derivative financial instruments used for risk management purposes, represents the interest rate risk component of Peoples net interest income as calculated by Peoples funds transfer pricing model (FTP), to derive each operating segments net interest income. Under this process, a money desk (the funding center) buys funds from liability generating business lines (such as consumer deposits) and sells funds to asset generating business lines (such as commercial lending). The price at which funds are bought and sold on any given day is set by Peoples treasury group and is based on the wholesale cost to Peoples of assets and liabilities with similar maturities. Liability generating businesses sell newly originated liabilities to the money desk and recognize a funding credit, while asset generating businesses buy funding for newly originated assets from the money desk and recognize a funding charge. Once funding for an asset is purchased from or a liability is sold to the money desk, the price that is set by the treasury group will remain with that asset or liability until it matures or reprices, which effectively transfers responsibility for managing interest rate risk to the treasury group.

The reduction in treasurys net spread income reflects a $934 million decline in average securities and an increase in the FTP charge for funding the BOLI investment (with no offsetting interest income as BOLI income is recorded in non interest income). The improvement in the funding centers net spread loss reflects the rising interest rate environment and the asset sensitive position of Peoples balance sheet. Average earning assets decreased $887 million, or 50%, reflecting a $934 million, or 54%, decline in average securities from 2005 given Peoples sale of its debt securities portfolio during 2006 as part of restructuring activities to better position Peoples balance sheet for the prevailing interest rate environment. The debt securities portfolio totaled $27 million at December 31, 2006, compared to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2005, reflecting the sale of approximately $1.1 billion of securities and the substitution of securities with higher yielding loans. Average securities comprised 8% of average earning assets in 2006, compared to 17% in 2005. The improvement in treasurys loss from continuing operations in 2005 compared to 2004 reflects a $45.4 million improvement in net interest income and an increase in non interest income (attributable to BOLI income of $3.3 million in 2005 and $4.5 million of net security losses in 2004). The improvement in net interest income reflects the funding centers net spread loss declining by $49.7 million, partially offset by a $4.3 million decline in treasurys net spread income. The reduction in treasurys net spread income reflects a $510 million decline in average securities. The improvement in the funding centers net spread loss reflects the rising interest rate environment and the asset sensitive position of Peoples balance sheet. Peoples invested $150 million in a BOLI program in the second quarter of 2005 with proceeds from maturing securities. Increases in the cash surrender value of BOLI are included in non interest income and totaled $3.3 million in 2005. Peoples invested an additional $50 million in BOLI in February 2006 with proceeds from maturing securities. Average securities comprised 17% of average earning assets in 2005, compared to 23% in 2004. 40 Table of Contents Other includes the residual financial impact from the allocation of revenues and expenses and certain revenues and expenses not attributable to a particular segment. This category also includes: revenues and expenses relating to the national consumer loan portfolio; liability restructuring costs; certain nonrecurring items; income from discontinued operations, including the gain on the sale of the credit card business; and benefits from completed Internal Revenue Service audits in each of the three years. Included in period end assets are cash, national consumer loans, premises and equipment, and other assets. Years ended December 31 (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Net interest income $ 21.7 $ 16.6 $ 21.7 Provision for loan losses (10.1 ) (4.3 ) 1.2 Non interest income 2.3 2.0 6.8 Liability restructuring costs 2.7 133.4 Other non interest expense 6.8 7.2 26.6 Income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) 27.3 13.0 (132.7 ) Income tax expense (benefit) 7.3 2.0 (52.5 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations 20.0 11.0 (80.2 ) Income from discontinued operations, net of tax 2.3 5.0 6.8 Gain on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax 6.2 198.5 Income from discontinued operations 2.3 11.2 205.3 Net income $ 22.3 $ 22.2 $ 125.1 Average liabilities $ 246.9 $ 264.5 $ 316.0 Year end assets 696.5 666.4 611.4 41 Table of Contents Net Interest Income Net interest income and net interest margin are affected by many factors, including changes in average balances; interest rate fluctuations and the slope of the yield curve; sales of loans and securities; residential mortgage loan and mortgage backed security prepayment rates; product pricing; competitive forces; the relative mix, repricing characteristics and maturity of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities; non interest bearing sources of funds; hedging activities; and asset quality. 42 Table of Contents In response to signs of an expanding U.S. economy, since June 2004 the Federal Reserve Board increased the targeted federal funds rate 17 times by a total of 425 basis points, bringing the rate to 5.25% as of June 30, 2006. Given the asset sensitive position of the balance sheet, the net interest margin has generally benefited from these interest rate increases. There have been no additional increases in the targeted federal funds rate between June 30, 2006 and December 31, 2006. 2006 Compared to 2005 Net interest income increased $13 million, or 3%, and the net interest margin improved 19 basis points to 3.87% for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in net interest income reflects a $74 million increase in total interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $61 million increase in total interest expense. Average earning assets totaled $9.8 billion for 2006, a $173 million, or 2%, decrease from 2005, while the asset mix continued to shift. The shift in asset mix from securities to higher yielding loans continued to benefit the net interest margin. Average loans increased $715 million, or 9%, while average securities declined $934 million, or 54%, for 2006 compared to 2005. As a result, average loans and average securities comprised 91% and 8%, respectively, of average earning assets for 2006 compared to 82% and 17%, respectively, for 2005. The yield earned on the total loan portfolio was 6.10% for 2006 while the yield earned on securities was 3.74%, compared to 5.41% and 3.47%, respectively, for 2005. Growth in loans reflects increases of $345 million, or 10%, in average residential mortgage loans, $285 million, or 8%, in average commercial banking loans and $85 million, or 7%, in average consumer loans for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in average residential mortgage loans reflects, in part, the purchase of $170 million of adjustable rate mortgage loans towards the end of the first quarter of 2006. The growth in average commercial banking loans for 2006 compared to 2005 reflects a $183 million, or 35%, increase in average PCLC loans and a $127 million, or 10%, increase in average commercial loans, partially offset by a $25 million, or 1%, decrease in average commercial real estate finance loans. Included in average commercial loans and average commercial real estate finance loans were increases of $44 million, or 15%, and $59 million, or 40%, in the respective national credits portfolios. The growth in average consumer loans for 2006 compared to 2005 continues to reflect a shift in mix as an increase of $108 million, or 9%, in home equity loans was partially offset by a $21 million, or 81%, reduction in higher yielding unsecured national personal installment loans, which continue to run off as a result of a management decision to discontinue this type of lending. 43 Table of Contents The significant decrease in the average securities portfolio for 2006 compared to 2005 reflects the substitution of securities with higher yielding loans as securities pay down and mature, as well as the partial impact of security sales during 2006 to better position Peoples balance sheet for the prevailing interest rate environment. Peoples sold $810 million and $266 million of debt securities in the third and second quarters of 2006, respectively, and used the proceeds to fund loan growth and pay down borrowings. The duration of the remaining securities portfolio was approximately 0.07 years at December 31, 2006. In addition to funding loan growth, Peoples invested $50 million in the first quarter of 2006 and $150 million in the second quarter of 2005 in a bank owned life insurance program with proceeds from maturing securities. The earnings from bank owned life insurance are reported in non interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The overall 84 basis point improvement in the yield on average earning assets for 2006 compared to 2005 primarily reflects increases in market interest rates since June 2004 and the ongoing shift in asset mix. The interest rate increases initiated by the Federal Reserve continue to have a beneficial effect on the earning asset yield as approximately 29% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2006 has floating interest rates. Average funding liabilities totaled $9.3 billion for 2006, down $113 million or 1% compared with 2005. Average core deposits increased $50 million, or 1%, to $8.9 billion and comprised 95% of average funding liabilities, compared to 94% in 2005. Average interest bearing core deposits increased $101 million, or 2%, and average non interest bearing core deposits decreased $51 million, or 2%, reflective of Peoples strategy of funding loan growth with proceeds from maturities, sales and repayments of securities rather than core deposits. The 68 basis point increase to 2.15% from 1.47% in the rate paid on average funding liabilities for 2006 compared to 2005 primarily reflects increases in market interest rates since June 2004 and the ongoing shift in deposit mix. The rates paid on average core deposits increased 70 basis points in 2006, reflecting increases of 115 basis points in time deposits and 36 basis points in savings and money market deposits in response to rising market interest rates. The change in the mix of average interest bearing core deposits reflects a $660 million, or 25%, increase in higher rate time deposits, partially offset by a $559 million, or 14%, decline in savings and money market deposits, reflecting customers preferences for deposit products with higher interest rates given the 44 Table of Contents prevailing interest rate environment. Average time deposits comprised 37% of average total core deposits, compared to 30% for 2005. Further shifts in deposit mix to higher rate deposits are likely to raise Peoples overall cost of funding. Average purchased funds decreased $37 million, or 10%, and average subordinated notes decreased $16 million, or 13%, in 2006 compared to 2005. 2005 Compared to 2004 Net interest income increased $43 million, or 13%, and the net interest margin improved 35 basis points to 3.68% in 2005 compared to 2004. The increase in net interest income reflects a $71 million increase in total interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $28 million increase in total interest expense. Average earning assets totaled $10.0 billion in 2005, a $205 million, or 2%, increase from 2004, while the asset mix continued to shift. Average loans increased $836 million, or 11%, while average securities and average short term investments declined a combined $631 million, or 26%. As a result, average loans and average securities comprised 82% and 17%, respectively, of average earning assets, compared to 75% and 23%, respectively, in 2004. The yield earned on the total loan portfolio was 5.41% in 2005 while the yield earned on securities and short term investments was 3.45%, compared to 4.90% and 3.23%, respectively, for 2004. The total average commercial banking loan portfolio increased $418 million, or 13%, in 2005 compared to 2004, reflecting increases of $224 million, or 21%, in commercial loans, $164 million, or 46%, in PCLC loans and $30 million, or 2%, in commercial real estate finance loans. Included in average commercial loans and average commercial real estate finance loans were increases of $83 million, or 41%, and $8 million, or 5%, in the respective national credits portfolios. Average residential mortgage loans increased $250 million, or 8%, in 2005 compared to 2004, while average consumer loans increased $168 million, or 16%. Consumer loans continued to reflect a shift in mix as growth of $228 million, or 25%, in home equity loans generated by the Connecticut franchise was partially offset by a $60 million, or 70%, reduction in higher yielding unsecured national personal installment loans, which continued to run off as a result of a management decision to discontinue this type of lending. The growth in home equity lending reflected a combination of the emphasis placed on this line of business by Peoples, as well as nationwide trends. The $510 million, or 23%, decrease in the average securities portfolio in 2005 compared to 2004 reflected the substitution of securities with higher yielding loans as securities paid down and matured. The duration of the securities portfolio was approximately 1.7 years at December 31, 2005. In addition, Peoples invested $150 million in a bank owned life insurance program with proceeds from maturing securities in 2005. 45 Table of Contents The overall 61 basis point improvement in the yield on average earning assets in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily reflected the increase in market interest rates since June 2004 and the ongoing shift in asset mix. The interest rate increases initiated by the Federal Reserve had a beneficial effect on the earning asset yield as approximately 30% of the loan portfolio had floating interest rates. In 2005, average funding liabilities totaled $9.4 billion, essentially flat with 2004 before the allocation of funding liabilities to discontinued operations. Average core deposits increased $224 million, or 3%, and comprised 94% of average funding liabilities in 2005 compared to 91% in 2004 before the allocation of funding liabilities to discontinued operations. Average non interest bearing core deposits increased $98 million, or 5%, and average interest bearing core deposits increased $126 million, or 2%, due in part to Peoples focus on growing core deposits during 2005. The 27 basis point increase to 1.47% from 1.20% in the rate paid on average funding liabilities in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily reflected the increase in market interest rates throughout 2005 and the shift in deposit mix. The rates paid on average core deposits increased 32 basis points in 2005, reflecting increases of 50 basis points in time deposits and 25 basis points in savings and money market deposits in response to rising market interest rates, partially offset by growth in non interest bearing core deposits. The change in the mix of average interest bearing core deposits reflected a $377 million, or 17%, increase in higher rate time deposits, partially offset by a $251 million, or 6%, decline in savings and money market deposits, reflecting customers preferences for deposit products with higher interest rates. Average time deposits comprised 29% of average total deposits in 2005, compared to 26% in 2004. Average purchased funds decreased $186 million, or 33%, and average subordinated notes decreased $25 million, or 17%, in 2005 compared to 2004. In December 2005, Peoples repurchased $13.5 million of its 9.875% subordinated notes due 2010. In the first quarter of 2004, Peoples used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of its credit card business to pay down interest bearing liabilities. The repayment of slightly over $1 billion in high cost wholesale liabilities and the cancellation of $770 million in derivative positions relating to a portion of these liabilities had a net beneficial impact on the net interest margin in 2004. 46 Table of Contents Average Balance, Interest and Yield/Rate Analysis The table on the following page presents average balance sheets, interest income, interest expense and the corresponding average yields earned and rates paid for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The average balances are principally daily averages and, for loans, include both performing and non performing balances. Interest income on loans includes the effect of deferred loan fees and costs accounted for as yield adjustments, but does not include interest on loans for which Peoples has ceased to accrue interest. The impact of Peoples use of derivative instruments in managing interest rate risk is also reflected in the table, classified according to the instrument hedged and the risk management objective. For 2004, the net interest margin, net interest income and average funding liabilities reflect a reduction in funding liabilities and interest expense relating to the earning assets of the credit card business that were reclassified to discontinued operations for the periods prior to the sale in the first quarter of 2004. Interest expense was allocated to discontinued operations for 2004 by applying the weighted average cost of funds previously used for credit card segment reporting purposes to the average earning assets of the discontinued operations for 2004, with a corresponding reduction in total interest expense. 47 Table of Contents Average Balance, Interest and Yield/Rate Analysis 2006 2005 2004 Years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) Average Balance Interest Yield/ Rate Average Balance Interest Yield/ Rate Average Balance Interest Yield/ Rate Earning assets: Short term investments $ 106.6 $ 5.3 4.97 % $ 54.5 $ 1.5 2.86 % $ 198.0 $ 2.3 1.19 % Securities purchased under agreements to resell 16.6 0.8 4.98 22.8 1.0 4.22 Securities (1) 803.8 30.0 3.74 1,737.8 60.3 3.47 2,248.0 72.5 3.23 Loans: Residential mortgage 3,758.8 185.2 4.93 3,413.3 154.7 4.53 3,163.4 137.7 4.35 Commercial 2,135.7 146.5 6.86 1,825.5 108.7 5.95 1,437.6 73.3 5.10 Commercial real estate finance 1,765.1 126.0 7.14 1,790.5 116.2 6.49 1,760.7 105.0 5.96 Consumer 1,288.3 88.3 6.85 1,203.3 65.8 5.47 1,035.0 46.7 4.51 Total loans 8,947.9 546.0 6.10 8,232.6 445.4 5.41 7,396.7 362.7 4.90 Total earning assets $ 9,874.9 $ 582.1 5.90 % $ 10,047.7 $ 508.2 5.06 % $ 9,842.7 $ 437.5 4.45 % Funding liabilities: Deposits: Non interest bearing deposits $ 2,090.7 $ % $ 2,142.0 $ % $ 2,043.7 $ % Savings, interest bearing checking and money market 3,464.3 49.2 1.42 4,023.4 42.6 1.06 4,274.7 34.4 0.81 Time 3,308.7 128.8 3.89 2,648.8 72.6 2.74 2,271.5 50.9 2.24 Total core deposits 8,863.7 178.0 2.01 8,814.2 115.2 1.31 8,589.9 85.3 0.99 Non core deposits 118.4 2.1 1.85 167.2 2.3 1.40 198.5 1.4 0.69 Total deposits 8,982.1 180.1 2.01 8,981.4 117.5 1.31 8,788.4 86.7 0.99 Borrowings: Federal funds purchased 158.2 7.6 4.78 250.5 7.9 3.19 249.6 3.2 1.25 FHLB advances 47.2 2.4 5.15 50.3 1.4 2.73 176.1 9.4 5.32 Repurchase agreements 1.7 0.1 2.41 36.1 1.0 2.91 Total borrowings 205.4 10.0 4.87 302.5 9.4 3.11 461.8 13.6 2.94 Subordinated notes 105.0 9.6 9.10 121.2 11.3 9.29 146.5 13.4 9.16 Total 9,292.5 9,405.1 9,396.7 Funding liabilities allocated to discontinued operations (2) (203.6 ) (3.6 ) 1.77 Total funding liabilities $ 9,292.5 $ 199.7 2.15 % $ 9,405.1 $ 138.2 1.47 % $ 9,193.1 $ 110.1 1.20 % Excess of earning assets over funding liabilities $ 582.4 $ 642.6 $ 649.6 Net interest income/spread $ 382.4 3.75 % $ 370.0 3.59 % $ 327.4 3.25 % Net interest margin 3.87 % 3.68 % 3.33 % (1) Average balances and yields for securities available for sale are based on amortized cost.

For each category of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, information is provided relating to: changes in volume (changes in average balances multiplied by the prior years average interest rate); changes in rates (changes in average interest rates multiplied by the prior years average balance); and the total change. Changes attributable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately. 2006 Compared to 2005 Increase (Decrease) 2005 Compared to 2004 Increase (Decrease) (in millions) Volume Rate Total Volume Rate Total Interest and dividend income: Short term investments $ 2.1 $ 1.7 $ 3.8 $ (2.5 ) $ 1.7 $ (0.8 ) Securities purchased under agreements to resell (0.3 ) 0.1 (0.2 ) 1.0 1.0 Securities (34.6 ) 4.3 (30.3 ) (17.4 ) 5.2 (12.2 ) Loans: Residential mortgage 16.4 14.1 30.5 11.2 5.8 17.0 Commercial 20.0 17.8 37.8 21.8 13.6 35.4 Commercial real estate finance (1.7 ) 11.5 9.8 1.8 9.4 11.2 Consumer 4.9 17.6 22.5 8.3 10.8 19.1 Total loans 39.6 61.0 100.6 43.1 39.6 82.7 Total change in interest and dividend income 6.8 67.1 73.9 24.2 46.5 70.7 Interest expense: Deposits: Savings, interest bearing checking and money market (6.5 ) 13.1 6.6 (2.1 ) 10.3 8.2 Time 20.9 35.3 56.2 9.3 12.4 21.7 Total core deposits 14.4 48.4 62.8 7.2 22.7 29.9 Non core deposits (0.8 ) 0.6 (0.2 ) (0.2 ) 1.1 0.9 Total deposits 13.6 49.0 62.6 7.0 23.8 30.8 Borrowings: FHLB advances (0.1 ) 1.1 1.0 (4.8 ) (3.2 ) (8.0 ) Federal funds purchased (3.6 ) 3.3 (0.3 ) 4.7 4.7 Repurchase agreements (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.9 ) (0.9 ) Total borrowings (3.8 ) 4.4 0.6 (5.7 ) 1.5 (4.2 ) Subordinated notes (1.5 ) (0.2 ) (1.7 ) (2.3 ) 0.2 (2.1 ) Funding liabilities allocated to discontinued operations 3.6 3.6 Total change in interest expense 8.3 53.2 61.5 2.6 25.5 28.1 Change in net interest income $ (1.5 ) $ 13.9 $ 12.4 $ 21.6 $ 21.0 $ 42.6 49 Table of Contents The following table provides the weighted average yields earned and rates paid for each major category of earning assets and funding liabilities as of December 31, 2006.

Peoples has focused on enhancing these revenue streams by leveraging its commercial banking relationships, growing existing fee based revenue generating businesses, and strengthening its retail delivery network and products. Total non interest income decreased $25.9 million, or 15%, in 2006, compared to 2005, reflecting net security losses of $27.4 million as part of balance sheet restructuring activities in 2006 and an $8.1 million gain on sale of branches in 2005. Excluding net security losses from both periods and the branch sale gain from 2005, total non interest income would have increased $9.3 million, or 6%, reflecting higher fee based revenues, higher bank owned life insurance income and higher other non interest income, partially offset by lower net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans. 51 Table of Contents Revenue from service charges on deposit accounts increased $5.4 million, or 7%, compared to 2005, reflecting changes in Peoples fee structure implemented in both the second quarter of 2006 and the third quarter of 2005 to close the gap between Peoples pricing practices and those of the competition, partially offset by the impact of higher usage by the public of the cash back option at point of sale locations. Insurance revenue declined $0.7 million, or 2.5%, in 2006, reflecting industry wide trends for this business, characterized as a soft market with lower pricing for renewals, as well as reductions related to the sale of a large corporate account in the third quarter of 2006. Other banking service charges and fees increased $0.6 million in 2006, primarily due to growth in retail banking fees associated with higher levels of Personal Identification Number (PIN) debit interchange fees resulting from customer preferences for debit card related transactions. PIN debit interchange refers to the revenue generated when a customer uses their PIN to make a purchase with their debit card. Peoples earns a portion of the purchase amount whenever its customers use their debit card at a retail merchant. This interchange is paid by the retail merchant. Other fees decreased $5.1 million, reflecting lower lending related charges and fees, primarily lower commercial real estate loan prepayment penalties. As previously discussed, $810 million and $266 million of debt securities were sold in the third and second quarters of 2006, respectively, resulting in net security losses of $23.4 million and $4.0 million for the respective periods. Peoples also sold $25 million in securities purchased under agreements to resell in the third quarter of 2006 at a loss of $0.3 million, which is reported in other non interest expense. These transactions were undertaken to better position Peoples balance sheet for the prevailing interest rate environment. Net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans decreased $2.0 million in 2006, reflecting lower residential mortgage loan origination volume and subsequent lower levels of fixed rate loan sales. Sales volume of fixed rate residential mortgage loans decreased approximately 40% in 2006, which is consistent with the 39% decrease in fixed rate residential mortgage originations compared to 2005. Residential mortgage originations totaled $1.1 billion in 2006, compared to $1.4 billion in 2005. Peoples invested an additional $50 million in the first quarter of 2006 in bank owned life insurance, after an initial investment of $150 million in the second quarter of 2005 to help defray the rising costs of employee benefits. Increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance are included in non interest income and totaled $9.1 million in 2006 ($13.7 million on a taxable equivalent basis), compared to $3.3 million ($5.1 million on a taxable equivalent basis) for 2005. 52 Table of Contents The increase in other non interest income compared to 2005 reflects a $2.7 million increase in rental income resulting from the higher level of equipment leased to PCLC customers. In addition, other non interest income for the 2006 period includes a $0.7 million net gain from the sale of a large corporate insurance account by RC Knox, a $0.7 million gain from the redemption of common stock received in conjunction with the MasterCard Incorporated initial public offering given People debit card business and $0.6 million of interest related to the completion of a federal tax audit. Total non interest income increased $21.6 million in 2005 compared to 2004, reflecting an $8.1 million gain on the sale of three branches, higher fee based revenues, higher bank owned life insurance income and higher net security losses in 2004, partially offset by a reduction in other non interest income in 2005 due to the elimination of servicing income from The Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS), which purchased Peoples credit card business in 2004. Service charges on deposit accounts increased $3.2 million compared to 2004, reflecting changes in Peoples fee structure implemented in the third quarter of 2005 to close the gap between Peoples pricing practices and those of the competition, partially offset by the impact of promotional campaigns on certain commercial and retail checking fees that began in the third quarter of 2004. Insurance revenue reflects higher commissions earned by RC Knox in a soft insurance market, offset by lower contingent commission revenue and lower fee based revenues from the sale of life insurance products offered in Peoples branch network. The decrease in brokerage commissions primarily reflects lower fees received from sales of annuity products. Other banking service charges and fees increased primarily due to growth in retail banking fees associated with higher levels of PIN debit interchange fees resulting from customer preferences for debit card related transactions. The increase in other fees reflects higher lending related charges and fees, including higher commercial real estate loan prepayment penalties received as a result of the low interest rate environment in 2005. 53 Table of Contents Peoples invested $150 million in the second quarter of 2005 in a bank owned life insurance program to help defray the rising costs of employee benefits. Increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance are included in non interest income and totaled $3.3 million in 2005. Included in other non interest income in 2004 was $4.8 million of servicing income related to the interim servicing agreement with RBS following the credit card sale. 54 Table of Contents Non Interest Expense Percentage Increase (Decrease) Years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2006/2005 2005/2004 Compensation and benefits $ 202.9 $ 195.5 $ 194.3 3.8 % 0.6 % Occupancy and equipment 62.2 62.4 69.3 (0.3 ) (10.0 ) Professional and outside service fees 24.3 26.1 25.8 (6.9 ) 1.2 Advertising and promotion 10.3 9.9 9.8 4.0 1.0 Stationery, printing and postage 7.5 7.1 8.0 5.6 (11.3 ) Amortization of other acquisition related intangibles 1.1 1.8 3.4 (38.9 ) (47.1 ) Other non interest expense 38.6 36.9 35.7 4.6 3.4 Total 346.9 339.7 346.3 2.1 (1.9 ) Liability restructuring costs 2.7 133.4 n/m n/m Goodwill impairment charge 2.0 n/m n/m Total non interest expense $ 346.9 $ 344.4 $ 479.7 0.7 % (28.2 )% Efficiency ratio 61.3 % 62.8 % 69.2 % n/m not meaningful Total non interest expense in 2006 increased $2.5 million, or 1%, compared to 2005, primarily reflecting higher compensation and benefits and lower professional and outside service fees. The improvement in Peoples efficiency ratio in 2006 reflects a $22.8 million, or 4%, increase in revenue. Total non interest expense in 2006 included the following items: severance related expenses totaling $1.6 million (recorded to compensation and benefits); a $0.3 million charge related to the sale of $25 million of securities purchased under agreements to resell as part of balance sheet restructuring activities (recorded to other non interest expense); and a $0.9 million charge related to the resolution of an RC Knox contingency (recorded to other non interest expense). Total non interest expense in 2005 included the following items: liability restructuring costs of $2.7 million; a $0.7 million charge related to the accelerated vesting of stock options (recorded to compensation and benefits); and a $2.0 million goodwill impairment charge. Excluding these expenses from the respective years, total non interest expense in 2006 would have increased $5.1 million, or 2%, compared to 2005. Compensation and benefits increased $6.5 million, or 3%, compared to the 2005 period, after excluding the items discussed above. The increase reflects the combination of normal merit increases, higher accruals for incentive compensation, and increased pension costs, partially offset by lower health care expenses. On September 29, 2006, Peoples contributed $91.5 million to its employee retirement plan, representing the maximum deductible contribution per Internal Revenue Service rules. Earnings on these contributions are expected to significantly reduce Peoples pension expense beginning in 2007. 55 Table of Contents Professional and outside service fees decreased $1.8 million, or 7%, compared to the 2005 period, reflecting lower utilization of information technology contractors and lower costs for Peoples declining national consumer loan portfolio, partially offset by higher legal costs related to Peoples conversion to a federal charter and costs related to infrastructure initiatives. The increase in other non interest expense compared to 2005 primarily reflects a $2.0 million increase in the amortization of equipment leased to PCLC customers, partially offset by lower operational charge offs. The $2.0 million goodwill impairment charge in 2005 related to the decision to combine Olson Mobeck Investment Advisors, Inc. with one of Peoples other businesses in the consumer financial services business segment. Total non interest expense in 2005 decreased $135.3 million, or 28%, compared to 2004. Included in total non interest expense were certain nonrecurring expenses totaling $0.7 million in 2005 and $9.3 million in 2004, liability restructuring costs of $2.7 million in 2005 and $133.4 million in 2004, as well as a $2.0 million goodwill impairment charge in 2005. Excluding these expenses from the respective years, total non interest expense would have increased $2.0 million, or 1%, in 2005 compared to 2004. The improvement in Peoples efficiency ratio in 2005 primarily reflects a $53.1 million, or 11%, increase in revenue. Included in compensation and benefits was a $0.7 million nonrecurring charge related to the accelerated vesting of stock options in 2005 and $6.7 million of nonrecurring expenses in 2004. Compensation and benefits increased $7.2 million, or 4%, compared to 2004, after excluding these nonrecurring expenses from both years. The increase reflects the combination of normal merit increases; higher accruals for incentives tied to overall bank performance; higher incentive compensation for revenue generating businesses and increased health care costs. Occupancy and equipment decreased $6.9 million in 2005 compared to 2004, reflecting a $3.2 million, or 14%, reduction in depreciation expense and a substantially higher level of costs incurred in 2004 to upgrade personal computers throughout the bank. Professional and outside service fees and other non interest expense included nonrecurring expenses of $0.4 million and $2.2 million, respectively, in 2004. 56 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, totaled $2.3 million in 2006, compared to $11.2 million in 2005 and $205.3 million in 2004. Included in income from discontinued operations was an after tax charge of $0.5 million in 2006 from the resolution of a contingency related to the sale of Peoples credit card business in 2004, after tax income of $6.2 million in 2005 from the resolution of a significant contingency related to the credit card sale and an after tax gain of $198.5 million in 2004 from the sale of the credit card business. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Peoples continues to generate recoveries from collection efforts on previously charged off credit card accounts that were not included in the sale of the credit card business. These recoveries are included in income from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Recoveries, net of collection costs, totaled $4.1 million, $7.7 million and $11.2 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The level of recoveries is expected to continue declining in 2007 due to the aging and diminishing pool of charged off accounts. 57 Table of Contents Income Taxes Income tax expense (benefit) from continuing operations totaled $57.8 million in 2006, compared to $64.1 million in 2005 and $(8.6) million in 2004. Income tax benefits of $2.4 million, $2.0 million and $4.0 million are included in income tax expense (benefit) from continuing operations in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These benefits relate to certain prior year tax matters, including the completion of federal tax audits in 2005 and 2004. Excluding these benefits from the respective years, Peoples effective income tax rate from continuing operations would have been 33.5% in 2006, 34.8% in 2005 and 32.4% in 2004. The lower effective income tax rate for 2006 compared to 2005 primarily reflects the higher level of tax exempt bank owned life insurance income earned in 2006. Income tax expense (benefit) for all three years reflects the state tax benefit resulting from the formation of Peoples Mortgage Investment Company, a wholly owned subsidiary. The formation of this subsidiary was a result of Connecticut tax legislation, which became effective on January 1, 1999, that allows for the transfer of mortgage loans to a passive investment subsidiary. The related earnings of the subsidiary, and any dividends it pays to the parent, are not subject to Connecticut income tax. 58 Table of Contents Earning Assets The discussion of earning assets has been grouped into Treasury, Consumer Financial Services and Commercial Banking.

Securities available for sale are used as part of Peoples asset/liability management strategy and may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, factors such as changes in market conditions and interest rates, changes in security prepayment rates, liquidity considerations and regulatory capital requirements. 59 Table of Contents Peoples primarily invests in debt securities rated in the four highest categories assigned by a nationally recognized statistical ratings organization. Management has internal guidelines for the credit quality and duration of Peoples debt securities portfolio and monitors these on a regular basis. Peoples strives to maintain an appropriate balance between loan portfolio growth and core deposit funding. Peoples management currently believes that, other than for transitional deployment of excess core deposits or excess equity, a large securities portfolio funded with wholesale borrowings provides limited economic value. As part of this focus, Peoples has reduced its securities portfolio by $3.2 billion since December 31, 2002 and increased its loans by $2.7 billion over the same period. Peoples has also reduced borrowings by $2.4 billion since year end 2002. During the second and third quarters of 2006, Peoples sold approximately $1.1 billion of debt securities as part of the restructuring of its balance sheet. Realized losses from these sales of $27.4 million are included in net security losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. In the second quarter of 2006, Peoples decided to exit a product line and cease purchasing federal funds from a group of smaller New England community banks. The sale of securities was undertaken to pay down the related borrowings. During the third quarter of 2006, Peoples completed the sale of substantially its entire remaining debt securities portfolio to better position its balance sheet for the prevailing interest rate environment. At December 31, 2006, Peoples securities portfolio totaled $78 million, or 1% of total assets, and wholesale borrowings totaled $4 million, or less than 0.5% of total assets, which represent ratios well below industry averages. At December 31, 2005, Peoples securities portfolio totaled $1.4 billion, a $708 million, or 34%, decline from year end 2004. The reduction in the securities portfolio in 2005 reflects the substitution of higher yielding loans for lower yielding securities as securities pay down and mature. The securities portfolio represented 14% of earning assets at December 31, 2005, compared to 21% at year end 2004, consistent with managements goal of reducing the percentage of securities to earning assets. 60 Table of Contents At December 31, 2006, the book value and the market value of the securities available for sale portfolio were approximately equivalent, compared to net unrealized losses of $28.9 million and $14.1 million at year end 2005 and 2004, respectively. The significant reduction in the unrealized loss in 2006 reflects the sale of securities during 2006 and the resulting significantly smaller securities portfolio. All unrealized gains and those unrealized losses representing temporary declines in value are recorded in stockholders equity, net of income taxes. As a result, management anticipates continued fluctuations in stockholders equity due to changes in the fair value of these securities, albeit on a much smaller scale due to the size and short duration of the portfolio. The duration of the debt securities portfolio was approximately 0.07 years at December 31, 2006, compared to 1.7 years at year end 2005. For a discussion of the regulatory capital treatment of unrealized gains and losses, see Capital on page 93. 61 Table of Contents Lending Activities Peoples conducts its lending activities through its two major business segments that constitute its core businesses: Consumer Financial Services and Commercial Banking. Peoples lending activities consist of originating loans secured by residential and commercial properties, and extending secured and unsecured loans to consumers and businesses. Total loans increased $799 million, or 9%, in 2006 compared to 2005, after increases of 8% in 2005 and 12% in 2004. The increase in 2006 reflects growth of $456 million, or 10%, in Consumer Financial Services and $343 million, or 9%, in Commercial Banking. The following table summarizes the loan portfolio. Amounts represent gross loans before deducting the allowance for loan losses.

(in millions) Fixed Adjustable Total Consumer Financial Services $ 369.4 $ 4,579.4 $ 4,948.8 Commercial Banking 1,629.0 1,916.8 3,545.8 Total loans due after one year $ 1,998.4 $ 6,496.2 $ 8,494.6 63 Table of Contents Consumer Financial Services Residential Mortgage Lending Peoples offers its customers a wide range of residential mortgage loan products. These include conventional fixed rate loans, jumbo fixed rate loans (loans with principal balances greater than established Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae limits), adjustable rate loans, sometimes referred to as ARM loans, interest only loans (loans where payments made by the borrower consist of only interest for a set period of time, before the payments change to principal and interest), as well as Federal Housing Authority insured loans and Connecticut Housing Finance Authority loans. Peoples originates these loans through its network of branches and calling officers, as well as in the wholesale market, which accounted for approximately 66%, 59% and 57% of Peoples mortgage loan originations for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, 92% and 97%, respectively, of the residential mortgage portfolio was secured by properties located in Connecticut. Included in residential mortgage loans are construction loans totaling $188 million and $197 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In 2006, Peoples Banks level of residential mortgage originations declined to $1.1 billion, compared to $1.4 billion in 2005 and $1.6 billion in 2004, consistent with industry wide trends attributable to rising interest rates. The mix and volume of residential mortgage loan originations vary in response to changes in market interest rates and customer preferences. Adjustable rate loans accounted for 77% of total residential mortgage originations in 2006, compared to 73% and 72% for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Overall, the volume of refinancings (approximately 41% of 2006 originations) was less than the volume of purchase mortgages as the upward movement in interest rates continues to make the refinancing market relatively less attractive for consumers. At December 31, 2006, the adjustable rate loan portfolio included $2.2 billion, or 57%, of interest only loans, compared to $1.6 billion, or 47%, at December 31, 2005. Peoples underwriting practices and credit review standards for such loans are consistent with those applied to other types of residential mortgage products. Peoples began originating interest only residential mortgage loans in March 2003. The underwriting guidelines and requirements are more restrictive for interest only loans than for amortizing adjustable rate mortgages. Properties must be a single family and owner occupied primary residence, loan to value ratios are lower, higher credit scores 64 Table of Contents are required, post closing reserves requirements are greater, and there are limits on cash out refinances as compared to amortizing adjustable rate mortgages. Amortization of an interest only loan begins after the initial interest rate change (e.g., after 5 years for a 5/1 adjustable rate mortgage). Adjustable rate residential loans at December 31, 2006 increased $395 million compared to year end 2005, while fixed rate mortgage loans decreased $3 million. Total adjustable rate residential loans increased $254 million in 2005 compared to year end 2004, while fixed rate mortgage loans decreased $13 million. The continued growth and performance of the residential mortgage loan portfolio in 2007 may be adversely impacted by the level and direction of interest rates, consumer preferences and the regional economy. Historically, Peoples has held virtually all of the adjustable rate residential mortgage loans that it originates on its balance sheet and has sold virtually all of the fixed rate residential mortgage loans that it originates into the secondary market. Peoples has recently reassessed its pricing with respect to adjustable rate residential mortgage loans in light of the prevailing interest rate environment. As a result, Peoples believes the level of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans it originates will be reduced significantly in the near term. Peoples intends to continue to actively offer residential mortgage loans of all types through its extensive distribution system. However, if a reduction in originations occurs and continues for an extended period, the balance of Peoples residential mortgage loan portfolio will decline. 65 Table of Contents Residential Mortgage Originations Years ended December 31 (in millions) Residential Mortgage Originations by Product Year ended December 31, 2006 (percent) 66 Table of Contents Consumer Lending As of December 31 (in millions) 2006 2005 Home equity credit lines $ 1,010.8 $ 1,027.8 Second mortgages 279.8 184.5 Personal installment loans 14.1 25.8 Other loans 16.6 19.4 Total consumer $ 1,321.3 $ 1,257.5 Peoples offers Connecticut based customers home equity credit lines and second mortgage loans, and to a lesser extent, other forms of installment and revolving credit loans. In the first quarter of 2006, Peoples began offering home equity credit lines and loans in Massachusetts and New York. Consumer loans also include unsecured personal installment loans that had been originated nationally in prior years and totaled under $1 million at December 31, 2006, compared to $12 million and $46 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Future growth of Peoples consumer loan portfolio is highly dependent upon economic conditions, the interest rate environment and competitors strategies, as well as the success of Peoples marketing programs and information based strategies. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, approximately 99% and 98%, respectively, of the consumer loan portfolio was to customers located in Connecticut. The increase in consumer loans reflects growth in home equity lending, partially offset by continued declines in national unsecured personal installment loans, which continue to run off as a result of a management decision to discontinue this type of lending. Home equity credit lines decreased $17 million, or 2%, since year end 2005, after increasing $114 million, or 12%, during 2005 and $288 million, or 46%, during 2004. The slower rate of portfolio growth in an interest rate environment characterized by higher short term interest rates reflects nationwide trends. 67 Table of Contents Commercial Banking The Commercial Banking lending businesses include commercial real estate finance, commercial and industrial lending and equipment financing by PCLC. Shared national credits are included in the commercial real estate finance and commercial and industrial lending portfolios. Commercial Real Estate Finance As of December 31 (in millions) 2006 2005 Property Type: Residential $ 513.6 $ 439.9 Retail 390.7 435.0 Office buildings 360.0 367.1 Industrial/manufacturing 184.8 202.9 Self storage/industrial 97.8 84.9 Hospitality and entertainment 61.8 90.1 Land 61.4 44.8 Health care 53.9 47.0 Special use 47.4 52.3 Other properties 15.3 14.3 Total commercial real estate finance $ 1,786.7 $ 1,778.3 Peoples manages the commercial real estate finance portfolio by limiting the concentration in any loan type, term, industry, or to any individual borrower. Historically, Peoples primary strategy has been to focus on lending in the state of Connecticut and adjacent states that represent its home market. In addition, Peoples will purchase interests in out of state loan participations. Included in commercial real estate finance loans are shared national credits totaling $209 million, $143 million and $105 million at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Peoples highest loan concentration in the commercial real estate finance loan portfolio was in the residential sector, which represented 29% of this loan portfolio at December 31, 2006, compared to 25% at December 31, 2005 and 17% at year end 2004. Much of the growth in the residential sector was due to increases totaling $86 million, or 117%, for 2006 and $70 million, or 52% for 2005 in shared national credits. 68 Table of Contents Commercial Real Estate Finance Portfolio As of December 31 (dollars in millions) At December 31, 2006, approximately 68% of Peoples commercial real estate finance portfolio was secured by properties located in Connecticut, compared to approximately 74% at December 31, 2005. Included in this portfolio are construction loans totaling $541 million, $512 million and $429 million at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Commercial real estate finance is dependent on the successful operation of the related income producing real estate. Accordingly, the income streams generated by this portfolio can be impacted by changes in the real estate market and, to a large extent, Connecticuts economy. The commercial real estate finance portfolio increased slightly (0.5%) in 2006 and decreased 3% in 2005 after growing 8% in 2004. The slow growth in 2006 and decrease in 2005 reflects the high level of loan prepayments during this period and Peoples focus on maintaining strong asset quality standards in a competitive market generally characterized by aggressive pricing and less attractive underwriting terms. The growth and performance of this portfolio is largely dependent on the economic environment in Connecticut and may be adversely impacted if the economy slows in 2007. 69 Table of Contents Commercial Real Estate Finance Diversification As of December 31, 2006 (percent) 70 Table of Contents Commercial and Industrial Lending As of December 31 (in millions) 2006 2005 Industry: Manufacturing $ 412.1 $ 414.7 Finance, insurance and real estate 354.7 330.4 Service 230.2 208.0 Wholesale distribution 119.9 127.0 Retail sales 113.6 103.6 Health services 108.5 91.9 Arts/entertainment/recreation 61.8 30.7 Transportation/utility 26.4 24.8 Other 66.6 63.4 Total commercial and industrial lending $ 1,493.8 $ 1,394.5 Peoples provides diversified products and services to its commercial customers, including short term working capital credit facilities, term financing, asset based loans, letters of credit, cash management services and commercial deposit accounts. Commercial products are generally packaged together to create a financing solution specifically tailored to the needs of the customer. Taking a total relationship focused approach with commercial customers to meet their financing needs has resulted in substantial growth in non interest bearing deposits over time, as well as in opportunities to provide other banking services to principals and employees of these commercial customers. The borrowers ability to repay a commercial loan is closely tied to the ongoing profitability and cash flow of the borrowers business. Consequently, a commercial loan tends to be more directly impacted by changes in economic cycles that affect businesses generally and the borrowers business specifically. The availability of adequate collateral is a factor in commercial loan decisions, and loans are generally collateralized and or guaranteed by third parties. In 2006, the commercial and industrial lending portfolio increased $100 million, or 7%, compared to increases of $159 million, or 13%, in 2005 and $201 million or 19% in 2004. The increase in 2006 includes a $47 million, or 15%, increase in shared national credits, compared to an increase of $61 million, or 24%, for the full year of 2005. Included in commercial lending are shared national credits totaling $368 million, $321 million and $260 million at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. At December 31, 2006, approximately 66% of the commercial loan portfolio consisted of loans to Connecticut based businesses, compared to approximately 69% and 72% at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The manufacturing sector remains Peoples highest commercial loan concentration. While Peoples continues to focus on asset quality, the performance of the commercial lending portfolio may be adversely impacted if the economy slows in 2007. 71 Table of Contents Commercial and Industrial Lending Diversification As of December 31, 2006 (percent) Commercial and Industrial Lending Portfolio As of December 31 (dollars in millions) 72 Table of Contents Shared National Credits At December 31, 2006, the shared national credits loan portfolio totaled $577 million, compared to $464 million and $365 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and represented 14%, 12% and 10% of the total Commercial Banking loan portfolio at the respective dates. As discussed above, included in the shared national credits portfolio at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were commercial loans totaling $368 million, $321 million and $260 million, respectively, and commercial real estate finance loans totaling $209 million, $143 million and $105 million, respectively. Peoples will purchase, and to a lesser extent sell, interests in shared national credits from and to other financial institutions having comparable asset quality standards. At December 31, 2006, the shared national credits loan portfolio included $562 million in loans purchased from other financial institutions and $15 million in loans originated by Peoples. At December 31, 2006, approximately $67 million, or 12%, of the shared national credits loan portfolio is to borrowers who are headquartered in Connecticut, while approximately $288 million, or 50%, is to borrowers located in California, Florida and New York. Peoples may grow this portfolio to represent approximately 15% of the overall Commercial Banking loan portfolio. 73 Table of Contents PCLC As of December 31 (in millions) 2006 2005 Industry: Printing $ 308.9 $ 263.0 Transportation/utility 209.5 100.3 General manufacturing 141.6 118.0 Retail sales 85.7 41.5 Packaging 76.7 63.8 Service 28.2 26.1 Wholesale distribution 12.4 12.4 Health services 6.8 8.5 Finance, insurance and real estate 1.1 Total PCLC $ 869.8 $ 634.7 PCLC provides equipment financing for customers in 48 states, specializing in financing for the printing, transportation/utility, general manufacturing, retail sales and packaging industries. PCLC will buy or sell portions of financing transactions in the secondary market to manage the concentration risk of the overall portfolio. At December 31, 2006, approximately 2% of the portfolio consisted of loans to Connecticut based businesses, while approximately 39% were loans to customers located in California, Texas, Illinois and Florida. The PCLC portfolio grew $235 million, or 37%, in 2006, after increasing $182 million, or 40%, in 2005 and $153 million, or 51%, in 2004, reflecting managements decision to grow this portfolio. Operating on a national scale, PCLC represented 21% of the Commercial Banking loan portfolio at December 31, 2006, compared to 17% and 13% at year end 2005 and 2004, respectively. Based on the level of growth in this portfolio, the percentage increase in 2007 may not continue at recent levels. 74 Table of Contents PCLC Diversification As of December 31, 2006 (percent) PCLC Loan Portfolio As of December 31 (dollars in millions) 75 Table of Contents Asset Quality Peoples actively manages asset quality through its underwriting practices and collection operations. Underwriting practices tend to focus on optimizing the return of a given risk classification while collection operations focus on minimizing losses once an account becomes delinquent. The allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses charged to income. Losses on loans, including impaired loans, are charged to the allowance for loan losses when all or a portion of a loan is deemed to be uncollectible. Recoveries of loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance for loan losses when realized. Peoples maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that is believed to be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio, based on a quarterly evaluation of a variety of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to: Peoples historical loan loss experience and recent trends in that experience; risk ratings assigned by lending personnel to commercial real estate finance, commercial and PCLC loans, and the results of ongoing reviews of those ratings by Peoples independent loan review function; an evaluation of non performing loans and related collateral values; the probability of loss in view of geographic and industry concentrations and other portfolio risk characteristics; the present financial condition of borrowers; and current economic conditions. While Peoples seeks to use the best available information to make these evaluations, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions, results of regulatory examinations, further information obtained regarding known problem loans, the identification of additional problem loans and other factors. 76 Table of Contents Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses The following table presents the activity in the allowance for loan losses and ratios: Years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Beginning allowance for loan losses $ 75.0 $ 72.5 $ 70.5 $ 69.2 $ 73.7 Charge offs: Commercial (5.2 ) (0.9 ) (0.6 ) (1.2 ) (3.4 ) Consumer (3.4 ) (4.9 ) (9.7 ) (16.8 ) (25.3 ) PCLC (0.6 ) (3.1 ) (1.5 ) (2.0 ) (2.4 ) Commercial real estate finance (0.1 ) (3.2 ) Residential mortgage (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.2 ) (0.1 ) Total charge offs (9.3 ) (9.1 ) (15.2 ) (20.1 ) (31.1 ) Recoveries: Commercial 0.4 0.4 0.3 1.4 0.7 Consumer 1.6 2.0 2.8 2.9 2.6 PCLC 0.3 0.3 0.5 0.1 0.1 Commercial real estate finance 2.5 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.6 Residential mortgage 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.1 0.4 Total recoveries 4.9 3.0 3.9 4.7 4.4 Net loan charge offs (4.4 ) (6.1 ) (11.3 ) (15.4 ) (26.7 ) Provision for loan losses 3.4 8.6 13.3 16.7 22.2 Ending allowance for loan losses $ 74.0 $ 75.0 $ 72.5 $ 70.5 $ 69.2 Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans 0.79 % 0.87 % 0.91 % 0.99 % 1.04 % Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non performing loans 327.9 352.5 264.6 208.4 198.2 The provision for loan losses in 2006 totaled $3.4 million, a $5.2 million, or 60%, reduction compared to $8.6 million for 2005. The 2006 period reflects $4.4 million in net loan charge offs, partially offset by a $1.0 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses. The 2005 period reflected net loan charge offs of $6.1 million and a $2.5 million increase in the allowance for loan losses. Net loan charge offs decreased $1.7 million, or 28%, for 2006, compared to 2005. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.79% at December 31, 2006 and 0.87% at December 31, 2005. Commercial loan net charge offs reflect a $4.0 million charge off in the third quarter of 2006 relating to one commercial banking loan that was placed on non accrual status in the second quarter of 2006 as previously disclosed. Commercial real estate finance net recoveries reflect a $2.3 million cash recovery in the first quarter of 2006 on one non performing loan that was resolved. 77 Table of Contents Consumer loan net charge offs decreased $1.2 million, or 39%, during 2006, reflecting a $1.9 million decrease in national consumer loan net charge offs, partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in home equity loan net charge offs and a $0.5 million increase in charge offs related to consumer overdrafts that were previously reported in non interest expense through the second quarter of 2005. The average national consumer loan portfolio decreased $21 million, or 81%, on a year over year basis and totaled slightly less than $1 million at December 31, 2006. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average total loans equaled 0.05% for 2006, down from 0.07% for 2005, reflecting the $1.7 million decrease in net loan charge offs and the impact on the ratio of a $715 million, or 9%, increase in average loans, both as compared to 2005. The very low level of net loan charge offs in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of average loans is unlikely to be sustainable in the future. The provision for loan losses decreased $4.7 million in 2005 compared to 2004, reflecting lower net loan charge offs in 2005, partially offset by a $2.5 million increase in the allowance for loan losses in 2005, compared to a $2.0 million increase in the allowance for loan losses in 2004. Net loan charge offs in 2005 declined $5.2 million, or 46%, compared to 2004. Consumer loan net charge offs decreased $4.0 million, or 58%, reflecting a 72% decrease in the dollar amount of national consumer loan net charge offs given a $60 million, or 70%, reduction in this portfolios average balances during 2005. The increase in PCLC loan net charge offs in 2005 reflects a $2.3 million charge off related to one loan. Commercial real estate finance loan net charge offs in 2004 reflected a $3.2 million charge off related to one shared national credit that had been classified as non performing since 2002. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average total loans decreased 8 basis points to 0.07% in 2005 compared to 0.15% in 2004. In addition to the $5.2 million decrease in net loan charge offs, the improvement in the net loan charge off ratio reflected an $836 million, or 11%, increase in average total loans.

These decreases were partially offset by an increase to the allowance for loan losses and a corresponding increase to the provision for loan losses by $3.0 million for the PCLC loan portfolio (reflecting loan growth) and by $2.0 million for the commercial loan portfolio (reflecting loan growth and ratings downgrades) during 2006. As a result of these changes, the total allowance for loan losses declined by $1.0 million in 2006. A loan is classified as non accrual generally when it becomes 90 days past due as to interest or principal payments. All previously accrued but unpaid interest on non accrual loans is reversed from interest income in the current period. Interest payments received on non accrual loans (including impaired loans) are generally applied as a reduction of principal if future collections are doubtful, although such interest payments may be recognized as income. A loan remains on non accrual status until the factors that indicated doubtful collectibility no longer exist or until a loan is determined to be uncollectible and is charged off against the allowance for loan losses. The classification of a loan as non performing does not necessarily indicate that loan principal and interest ultimately will not be collected. 79 Table of Contents Peoples historical experience suggests that a portion of these assets will eventually be recovered. All non performing loans are in various stages of collection, workout, settlement or foreclosure. When loan workout efforts are exhausted and it is determined that the borrower is unable to repay the obligation, Peoples will complete foreclosure procedures, if applicable. Restructured commercial and commercial real estate finance loans are those for which concessions to below market terms, such as below market interest rates or deferral of interest, have been granted due to the borrowers financial condition. Non Performing Assets The following table presents information regarding non accrual loans, restructured loans, real estate owned and repossessed assets: As of December 31 (dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Non accrual loans: Commercial $ 11.9 $ 1.3 $ 5.2 $ 3.3 $ 4.8 Residential mortgage 6.7 6.7 7.5 11.4 13.2 PCLC 2.1 6.2 5.1 4.2 3.3 Consumer 1.7 1.3 0.9 2.5 3.4 Commercial real estate finance 0.2 5.8 8.7 11.4 10.2 Total non accrual loans 22.6 21.3 27.4 32.8 34.9 Restructured loans 1.0 Total non performing loans 22.6 21.3 27.4 33.8 34.9 Real estate owned (REO) and repossessed assets, net 0.1 0.7 1.2 0.5 0.7 Total non performing assets $ 22.7 $ 22.0 $ 28.6 $ 34.3 $ 35.6 Non performing loans as a percentage of total loans 0.24 % 0.25 % 0.35 % 0.48 % 0.52 % Non performing assets as a percentage of total loans, REO and repossessed assets 0.24 0.26 0.36 0.48 0.53 Non performing assets as a percentage of stockholders equity and allowance for loan losses 1.61 1.62 2.25 3.20 3.53 Non performing assets totaled $22.7 million at December 31, 2006, an increase of $0.7 million, or 3%, compared to December 31, 2005 and improved 2 basis points to 0.24% of total loans, real estate owned and repossessed assets at December 31, 2006. The slight increase in non performing assets during 2006 reflects increases in non performing commercial loans of $10.6 million, partially offset by a $5.6 million reduction in non performing commercial real estate finance loans and a $4.1 million reduction in PCLC non performing loans. The net increase in non performing commercial loans since December 31, 2005 reflects one $10.6 million loan classified as non performing in the fourth quarter of 2006. The net decrease in non performing commercial real estate finance loans since December 31, 2005 reflects one $5.5 million loan that was resolved in the first quarter of 80 Table of Contents 2006 and generated a $2.3 million cash recovery. Additional activity in non performing commercial real estate finance loans during 2006 included one $12.1 million loan that was classified as non performing in the first quarter of 2006 and subsequently repaid in full through payments received in the third and fourth quarters of 2006. Total non performing assets at December 31, 2005 decreased $6.6 million, or 23%, from December 31, 2004 and improved 10 basis points to 0.26% of total loans, real estate owned and repossessed assets at December 31, 2005. Reductions of $3.9 million and $2.9 million in non performing commercial and commercial real estate finance loans, respectively, were partially offset by an increase of $1.1 million in non performing PCLC loans. The level of non performing assets is expected to fluctuate in response to changing economic and market conditions, and the relative sizes of the respective loan portfolios, along with managements degree of success in resolving problem assets. At December 31, 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002, Peoples portfolio did not include any loans, not included in the table above, which are troubled debt restructurings as defined in SFAS No. 15, Accounting by Debtors and Creditors for Troubled Debt Restructurings. As of December 31, 2006, if all non accruing loans had been current in accordance with their terms and had been outstanding throughout 2006 or since origination if held for part of the year, the gross interest income that would have been recorded in 2006 on such loans would have amounted to approximately $1.9 million. The amount of interest income on the non accruing loans included in net income in 2006 was $0.7 million. 81 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Detailed discussions pertaining to Peoples off balance sheet arrangements are included in the following sections: Funding, Liquidity, Capital and Market Risk Management. Funding At the current time, Peoples primary funding sources are deposits and stockholders equity, which represent 98% of total assets at December 31, 2006. Borrowings, while less than 0.5% of total assets at December 31, 2006, are an available source of funding. Based on the Banks membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston and the level of qualifying collateral available at December 31, 2006, Peoples had up to $3.5 billion of borrowing capacity. Peoples also had unsecured borrowing capacity of $1.1 billion at December 31, 2006.

Peoples provides customers access to their deposits through 77 traditional branches, 74 full service Stop & Shop supermarket branches, seven limited service branches, over 250 ATMs, telephone banking and an Internet banking site that is fully integrated with Peoples brokerage subsidiary, PSI. 82 Table of Contents Core deposits equaled 84% and 81% of total assets at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Core deposits and stockholders equity constituted over 98% of Peoples funding base at December 31, 2006 and over 94% at December 31, 2005. The expansion of Peoples branch network and its commitment to developing full service relationships with its customers are integral components of Peoples strategy to leverage the success of its supermarket banking initiative, expand market share and continue growing deposits. At December 31, 2006, Peoples statewide network of Stop & Shop branches held deposits totaling $2.1 billion and deposits in supermarket branches open for more than one year averaged $30 million per store. In 2006, Peoples announced plans to expand into New York State by opening at least 15 new traditional branches in Westchester County over the next three years. Seven of these branches are expected to be opened by the end of 2007. Peoples also plans to continue its branch expansion in Connecticut by opening new both traditional and Stop & Shop branches. Non interest bearing deposits are an important source of low cost funding and fee income for Peoples. In addition, Peoples believes that checking accounts represent one of the core relationships between a financial institution and its customers, and it is from these relationships that cross selling of other financial services can be achieved. Non interest bearing core deposits equaled 24% and 25% of core deposits at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Time deposits of $100,000 or more totaled $889 million at December 31, 2006, of which $247 million mature within three months, $364 million mature after three months but within six months, $241 million mature after six months but within one year and $37 million mature after one year. There were no brokered certificates of deposit at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Commercial deposits fund a significant portion of the loan portfolio. Average non interest bearing commercial deposits totaled $939 million in 2006, a $43 million, or 5%, decrease compared to 2005, after increasing $43 million, or 5%, in 2005 and $64 million, or 7%, in 2004. The decrease in 2006 is reflective of the current interest rate environment. 83 Table of Contents The following table presents, by rate category, time deposits as of December 31, 2006 and 2005.

Peoples uses federal funds purchased as a source of funds, which are typically unsecured overnight loans among banks. Sources include three of the twelve regional Federal Home Loan Banks and several money center and large regional banks. Federal funds purchased represented less than 0.5% of total assets at December 31, 2006 and 2% of total assets at December 31, 2005. In previous years, Peoples primary source for borrowings was advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, which provides credit for member institutions within its assigned region. Peoples outstanding Federal Home Loan Bank advances at December 31, 2005 represented less than one half of one percent of total assets. At December 31, 2006, there were no outstanding Federal Home Loan Bank advances. The average balances of Peoples advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston during 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $47 million, $50 million and $176 million, respectively, and the maximum Federal Home Loan Bank advances outstanding during 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $155 million, $190 million and $849 million, respectively. Another source of funds in previous years has been repurchase agreements. These transactions involve the sale of securities to broker/dealers under agreements to repurchase the same (or substantially the same) securities. Repurchase agreements with broker/dealers are limited to Reporting Federal Reserve Dealers in government securities that have been approved by Peoples Board of Directors. 85 Table of Contents Subordinated Notes At December 31, 2006, Peoples had $65 million of 9.875% subordinated notes outstanding. Subordinated notes totaled $109 million at December 31, 2005. Peoples repaid $44 million of 7.20% subordinated notes that matured on December 1, 2006. Peoples repurchased $14 million of its 9.875% subordinated notes in 2005. The 9.875% subordinated notes are due in 2010 and are unsecured general obligations of Peoples with interest payable semi annually, are subordinated to the claims of depositors and Peoples other creditors and are not redeemable prior to maturity. They qualify, up to certain limits, as supplementary (tier 2) capital for risk based capital purposes. 86 Table of Contents Contractual Cash Obligations The following table is a summary of Peoples contractual cash obligations, other than deposit liabilities, including operating leases. Additional information concerning these contractual cash obligations is included in Notes 9, 10 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase obligations included in the table represent those agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions. A substantial majority of Peoples purchase obligations are renewable on a year to year basis. As such, the purchase obligations included in this table only reflect the contractual commitment.

Liquidity management addresses Peoples ability to fund new loans and investments as opportunities arise, to meet customer deposit withdrawals and to repay borrowings and subordinated notes as they mature. Peoples liquidity position is monitored daily by management. The Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO) is responsible for setting guidelines to ensure maintenance of prudent levels of liquidity. Asset liquidity is provided by: cash; short term investments; proceeds from security sales, maturities and principal repayments; and proceeds from scheduled principal collections, prepayments and sales of loans. In addition, certain securities may be used to collateralize borrowings under repurchase agreements. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows present data on cash provided by and used in Peoples operating, investing and financing activities. At December 31, 2006, Peoples liquid assets included $30 million in trading account securities, $569 million in cash and cash equivalents, and $26 million in debt securities available for sale. At December 31, 2006, Peoples had pledged securities available for sale with a total fair value of $22 million as collateral for public deposits and for other purposes. Liability liquidity is measured by Peoples ability to obtain core deposits and purchased funds at cost effective rates that are diversified with respect to markets and maturities. Core deposits, which are considered the most stable source of liability liquidity, totaled $9.0 billion at December 31, 2006 , compared to $8.9 billion at December 31, 2005 (representing 85% and 82% of total funding at the respective dates). Purchased funds are used from time to time to diversify Peoples funding mix and to support asset growth. Peoples purchased funds totaled $47 million at December 31, 2006 and $0.4 billion at December 31, 2005 (representing 0.5% and 4% of total funding at the respective dates). Peoples current sources of purchased funds include: federal funds purchased, advances from the FHLB of Boston and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, municipal deposits and repurchase agreements. At December 31, 2006, Peoples borrowing limit from FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank advances and repurchase agreements was $3.5 billion, based on the level of qualifying collateral available for these borrowing sources. In addition, Peoples had unsecured borrowing capacity of $1.1 billion at December 31, 2006. 88 Table of Contents At December 31, 2006, Peoples had outstanding commitments to originate loans totaling $853 million and approved, but unused, lines of credit extended to customers totaling $2.3 billion. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The sources of liquidity discussed above are deemed by management to be sufficient to fund outstanding loan commitments and to meet Peoples other obligations. Earning Asset Mix $9.7 billion as of December 31, 2006 Funding Base $10.5 billion as of December 31, 2006 89 Table of Contents Capital Peoples total stockholders equity was $1.34 billion at December 31, 2006, a $51 million net increase from December 31, 2005, reflecting net income of $124.0 million, partially offset by dividends paid in 2006 of $60 million and a $25 million increase in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) since December 31, 2005. The net increase in AOCL primarily reflects a $40 million after tax increase from the adoption of SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, effective December 31, 2006, partially offset by a $19 million reduction in the net unrealized loss on securities available for sale due to the sales of securities previously discussed. Peoples total stockholders equity was $1.29 billion at December 31, 2005, an $89 million net increase compared to $1.20 billion at December 31, 2004. This increase primarily reflects net income of $137.1 million and net stock option related activity totaling $15 million, partially offset by dividends paid of $52 million and an $11 million increase in AOCL since December 31, 2004. The increase in AOCL primarily reflects a $10 million increase in the after tax net unrealized loss on securities available for sale in response to rising interest rates. Dividends declared and paid per common share (other than shares on which Holdings waived receipt of dividends) were $0.97, $0.85 and $0.75 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Peoples dividend payout ratio (dividends paid as a percentage of net income) in 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 48.3%, 38.3% and 22.9%, respectively. Stockholders equity equaled 12.5% of total assets at December 31, 2006, compared to 11.8% at December 31, 2005. Capital Requirements. OTS capital regulations require federally chartered savings banks, such as Peoples, to meet three minimum capital ratios: Tangible Capital Ratio A 1.5% tangible capital ratio, calculated as tangible capital to adjusted total assets. Leverage (Core) Capital Ratio A 4% leverage (core) capital ratio, calculated as core capital to adjusted total assets. The minimum leverage (core) capital ratio is reduced to 3% if the savings bank received the highest rating on its most recent safety and soundness examination. Risk Based Capital Ratio An 8% total risk based capital ratio, calculated as total capital to risk weighted assets. For purposes of this calculation, total capital includes core and supplementary capital, provided that supplementary capital may not exceed 100% of core capital. 90 Table of Contents In assessing an institutions capital adequacy, the OTS takes into consideration not only these numeric factors but also qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where necessary. Peoples, as a matter of prudent management, targets as its goal the maintenance of capital ratios which exceed these minimum requirements and that are consistent with Peoples risk profile. The following summary compares Peoples regulatory capital amounts and ratios to OTS minimum requirements as of December 31, 2006. Peoples adjusted total assets, as defined, totaled $10.7 billion at December 31, 2006 and Peoples risk weighted assets, as defined, totaled $8.6 billion at December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, Peoples exceeded each of its capital requirements. As of December 31, 2006 Peoples OTS Minimum Requirements (dollars in millions) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Tangible capital $ 1,278.4 (1) 12.0 % $ 159.8 1.5 % Leverage (core) capital 1,278.4 (1) 12.0 426.2 4.0 Total risk based capital 1,389.7 (2) 16.1 689.5 8.0 (1) Represents total stockholders equity, excluding (i) after tax net unrealized gains (losses) on debt and certain equity securities classified as available for sale, (ii) after tax net unrealized losses on derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges, (iii) certain assets not recognized in tier 1 capital (principally goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles), and (iv) the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income relating to SFAS No. 158. (2) Represents tier 1 capital plus subordinated notes, up to certain limits, and the allowance for loan losses up to 1.25% of risk adjusted total assets. Peoples regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2006 exceeded the OTS numeric criteria for classification as well capitalized. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning Peoples regulatory capital amounts and ratios. 91 Table of Contents 92 Table of Contents Market Risk Management Market risk is the risk of loss to earnings, capital and the fair market values of certain assets and liabilities resulting from changes in interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. Interest Rate Risk For Peoples, the only relevant market risk at this time is interest rate risk (IRR), which is the potential exposure to earnings or capital that may result from changes in interest rates. Peoples actively manages its IRR to achieve a balance between risk, earnings volatility and capital preservation. ALCO has primary responsibility for managing Peoples IRR and reports to the Treasury and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. To evaluate Peoples IRR profile, ALCO monitors economic conditions, interest rate trends, liquidity levels and capital ratios. Management also reviews assumptions periodically for projected customer and competitor behavior, in addition to the expected repricing characteristics and cash flow projections for assets, liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments. Actual conditions may vary significantly from Peoples assumptions. Management evaluates the impact of IRR on Income at Risk using an earnings simulation model to project earnings under multiple interest rate environments over a one year time horizon resulting in a quantification of IRR. Income at Risk includes significant interest rate sensitive income sources, such as net interest income, gains on sales of residential mortgage loans and BOLI income. The earnings projections are based on a static balance sheet and estimates of pricing levels for Peoples products under multiple scenarios intended to reflect instantaneous yield curve shocks. Peoples estimates its base case Income at Risk using current interest rates. Internal guidelines regarding IRR simulation specify that for instantaneous parallel shifts of the yield curve, estimated Income at Risk for the subsequent one year period should not decline by more than: 10% for a 100 basis point shift; 15% for a 200 basis point shift; and 20% for a 300 basis point shift. 93 Table of Contents The following table shows the estimated percentage increase (decrease) in Peoples Income at Risk over a one year simulation period beginning December 31, 2006. Given the slope of the yield curve at December 31, 2006, simulations for declines in interest rates below 300 basis points were not meaningful. Rate Change (basis points) Percent Change in Income at Risk +300 7.46% +200 5.41 +100 2.88 100 (3.11) 200 (7.55) 300 (15.97) While Income at Risk simulation identifies earnings exposure over a relatively short time horizon, Market Value of Equity (MVE) takes a long term economic perspective when quantifying IRR. MVE identifies possible margin behavior over a longer time horizon and is therefore a valuable complement of interest rate risk management. Base case MVE is calculated by estimating the net present value of all future cash flows from existing assets and liabilities using current interest rates. The base case scenario assumes that future interest rates remain unchanged. Internal guidelines limit the exposure of a decrease in MVE resulting from instantaneous parallel shifts of the yield curve in the following manner: for 100 basis points 10% of base case MVE; for 200 basis points 15% of base case MVE; and for 300 basis points 20% of base case MVE. The following table shows the estimated percentage decrease in Peoples MVE, assuming various shifts in interest rates. Given the slope of the yield curve at December 31, 2006, simulations for declines in interest rates below 300 basis points were not meaningful. Rate Change (basis points) Percent Change in Market Value of Equity +300 (6.31)% +200 (3.65) +100 (1.47) 100 (0.82) 200 (3.54) 300 (6.64) Management believes Peoples interest rate risk position at December 31, 2006 represents an acceptable level of risk. However, given the uncertainty of the magnitude, timing and direction of future interest rate movements and the shape of the yield curve, actual results may vary from those predicted by Peoples models. 94 Table of Contents Peoples uses derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps and interest rate floors, as components of its IRR management. Peoples has written guidelines that have been approved by the Board of Directors and ALCO governing the use of these financial instruments, including approved counterparties and risk limits, and controls the credit risk of these instruments through collateral, credit approvals and monitoring procedures. At December 31, 2006, each of Peoples counterparties had an investment grade credit rating from the major rating agencies and is specifically approved up to a maximum credit exposure. Derivative financial instruments have been used for market risk management purposes (principally interest rate risk) and not for trading or speculative purposes. Peoples is currently using interest rate swaps and interest rate floors to manage IRR associated with certain interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Interest rate swaps, which are accounted for as fair value hedges, are used to match more closely the repricing of certain commercial real estate finance loans and the funding associated with these loans. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the funding liabilities from a variable interest rate into a fixed interest rate and consequently reduce Peoples exposure to increases in interest rates and their effect on interest income and interest expense. Peoples is currently using interest rate floors to partially manage its exposure to a decrease in interest income resulting from declines in certain interest rates. These interest rate floors, which are accounted for as cash flow hedges, offer protection against a decline in interest income if the one month LIBOR index rate used to reprice certain floating rate commercial loans declines below the strike rate on the interest rate floors. If the one month LIBOR index rate falls below the specified strike rate, Peoples would receive an interest payment on the interest rate floor equal to the difference between the one month LIBOR index rate on the reset date and the strike rate, which in effect, would offset the decline in interest income earned on the hedged floating rate commercial loans from the decline in interest rates. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign exchange forward contracts are commitments to buy or sell foreign currency on a future date at a contractual price. Peoples uses these instruments on a limited basis to eliminate its exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates on certain of its commercial loans that are denominated in foreign currencies. Gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts substantially offset the translation gains and losses on the related loans. 95 Table of Contents Derivative Financial Instruments The following table summarizes certain information concerning derivative financial instruments utilized by Peoples in its management of IRR.

That process also resulted in the formation of Peoples Mutual Holdings (Holdings), a mutual form financial holding company that is subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. At December 31, 2006, Holdings owned 82.0 million shares of Peoples common stock, representing 57.7% of the total number of outstanding shares of Peoples common stock. By virtue of its ownership of a majority of Peoples outstanding shares, Holdings is able to elect all of the members of the Board of Directors of Peoples and will generally be able to significantly affect the outcome of all matters presented for consideration by the shareholders of Peoples. Holdings is different in significant aspects from an ordinary financial holding company or a bank holding company. Holdings is a corporation without shares of capital stock, and Holdings Articles of Incorporation require its Board of Trustees to consider the impact of its actions on a variety of constituencies in making certain business decisions. These include the depositors, employees and debtholders of Peoples, and the well being of the communities in which Peoples conducts business, but do not include Peoples shareholders. Thus, Holdings will act in a manner that furthers the general interests of these various constituencies. Since its formation in 1988, Holdings has consistently waived the receipt of cash dividends on substantially all of the shares of Peoples common stock it owns. The Board of Directors of Peoples establishes the rate at which dividends are declared with advance knowledge of the amount of dividends to be waived by Holdings. No dividends are declared on shares for which Holdings waives the dividend. If dividends had actually been declared and paid on all outstanding shares of Peoples common stock at the same rate as was declared and paid on shares not subject to the waiver, Holdings would have received additional dividends of approximately $78 million in 2006. There can be no assurance that Holdings will continue to waive the receipt of cash dividends in any future period, and Holdings retains the right to accept payment of future cash dividends on all of the Peoples common stock it owns, at its discretion. 97 Table of Contents On September 20, 2006, Peoples and Holdings announced their plan to convert from a mutual holding company structure to a fully public stock holding company structure. The Boards of Holdings and Peoples have adopted a Plan of Conversion and Reorganization (the Plan). The transactions contemplated by the Plan are subject to approval by Peoples stockholders, its depositors and the OTS. On February 14, 2007, the OTS gave its conditional approval to the Plan. Special meetings of Peoples stockholders and depositors to approve the Plan are scheduled for April 5, 2007. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 98 Table of Contents Forward Looking Statements Periodic and other filings made by Peoples with the OTS (with the FDIC prior to the charter conversion on August 18, 2006) pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 may from time to time contain information and statements that are forward looking in nature. Such filings include the Annual Report to Shareholders, Form 10 K, Form 10 Q and Form 8 K, and may include other forms such as proxy statements. Other written or oral statements made by Peoples or its representatives from time to time may also contain forward looking statements. In general, forward looking statements usually use words such as may, believe, expect, anticipate, should, plan, estimate, predict, continue and potential or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Examples of forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, estimates with respect to Peoples financial condition, results of operations and business that are subject to various factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates. Forward looking statements represent managements beliefs, based upon information available at the time the statements are made, with regard to the matters addressed; they are not guarantees of future performance. All forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause Peoples actual results or financial condition to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such statements. Factors of particular importance to Peoples include, but are not limited to: (i) changes in general economic conditions, including interest rates; (ii) potential improvements or deterioration in credit quality; (iii) competition among providers of financial services; (iv) residential mortgage and secondary market activity; (v) changes in accounting and regulatory guidance applicable to banks; and (vi) price levels and conditions in the public securities markets generally. All forward looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Consequently, no forward looking statement can be guaranteed. Peoples does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 99 Table of Contents STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENTS RESPONSIBILITY Management is responsible for the preparation, content and integrity of the consolidated financial statements and all other information included in this annual report. The consolidated financial statements and related footnotes are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Management is also responsible for compliance with laws and regulations relating to safety and soundness as designated by the Office of Thrift Supervision. The consolidated financial statements as identified in the accompanying Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm have been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. These audits were conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, and included tests of the accounting records and other auditing procedures considered necessary to formulate an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The Board of Directors has an Audit Committee composed of five outside directors, each of whom meets the criteria for independence as set forth in applicable listing standards. The Audit Committee meets regularly with the independent auditors, the internal auditors and management to ensure that the system of internal control over financial reporting is being properly administered and that financial data is being properly reported. The Audit Committee reviews the scope and timing of internal audits, including recommendations made with respect to the system of internal control over financial reporting. The independent auditors and the internal auditors have free access to the Audit Committee. MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting for Peoples. Management maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting, including an internal audit function, which is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, transactions are properly authorized, and that accounting records are reliable for the preparation of financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that internal control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on its assessment, management has concluded that Peoples maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. Managements assessment of the effectiveness of Peoples internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that is included herein. /s/ John A.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Peoples Bank (Peoples) is a federally chartered stock savings bank headquartered in Bridgeport, Connecticut with $10.7 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2006. Peoples was organized in 1842 as a mutual savings bank and converted to stock form in 1988. In August 2006, Peoples converted from a Connecticut chartered stock savings bank to a federally chartered stock savings bank. Deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Peoples regulator is the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). Peoples offers a full range of financial services to individual, corporate and municipal customers. Traditional banking activities are conducted primarily within the state of Connecticut and include extending secured and unsecured commercial and consumer loans, originating mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial properties, and accepting consumer, commercial and municipal deposits. In addition to traditional banking activities, Peoples provides specialized services tailored to specific markets including: personal, institutional and employee benefit trust; cash management; and municipal banking and finance. Through its subsidiaries, Peoples offers: brokerage, financial advisory services, investment management services and life insurance through Peoples Securities, Inc. (PSI); equipment financing through Peoples Capital and Leasing Corp. (PCLC); and other insurance services through R.C. Knox and Company, Inc. (RC Knox). This full range of financial services is delivered through a network of 77 traditional branches, 74 full service Stop & Shop supermarket branches that provide customers with seven day a week banking, seven limited service branches, 23 investment and brokerage offices (22 of which are located within branch offices), five wealth management and trust offices, eight PCLC offices and seven commercial banking offices. Peoples distribution network also includes fully integrated online banking and investment trading, a 24 hour telephone banking service and participation in a worldwide ATM network. Peoples has expanded its residential mortgage and home equity lending activities in the contiguous markets of New York and Massachusetts. In addition, Peoples maintains a loan production office in Massachusetts and PCLC maintains a sales presence in six states to support commercial real estate lending and equipment financing operations, respectively, outside of Connecticut. Within the Commercial Banking division, Peoples maintains a national credits group, which seeks to participate in commercial loans and commercial real estate finance loans to borrowers in various industries on a national scale. 19 Table of Contents Peoples results of operations are largely dependent upon revenues generated through net interest income and fee based revenues and, to a much lesser extent, other forms of non interest income such as gains on asset sales. Sources for these revenues are diversified across Peoples two primary business segments representing its core businesses, Commercial Banking and Consumer Financial Services, and to a lesser extent, Treasury. Peoples results of operations are also significantly affected by the provision for loan losses and the level of non interest expense. In addition, Peoples results of operations may also be affected by general and local economic conditions, changes in market interest rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Charter Conversion, Regulation and Plan of Conversion Peoples converted to a federally chartered stock savings bank from a Connecticut chartered stock savings bank effective August 18, 2006. The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) is Peoples regulator under the federal charter. Previously under its state charter, Peoples was regulated by the State of Connecticut Department of Banking and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Simultaneously with Peoples conversion, Peoples Mutual Holdings (Holdings) converted to a federally chartered mutual holding company from a Connecticut chartered mutual holding company. On September 20, 2006, Peoples and Holdings announced their plan to convert from a mutual holding company structure to a fully public stock holding company structure. The Boards of Holdings and Peoples have adopted a Plan of Conversion and Reorganization (the Plan). The transactions contemplated by the Plan are subject to approval by Peoples stockholders, its depositors and the OTS. On February 14, 2007, the OTS gave its conditional approval to the Plan. Special meetings of Peoples stockholders and depositors to approve the Plan are scheduled for April 5, 2007. Critical Accounting Policies In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, Peoples is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, including the classification of revenues and expenses to discontinued operations. Actual results could differ from Peoples current estimates, as a result of changing conditions and future events. Several estimates are particularly critical and are 20 Table of Contents susceptible to significant near term change, including the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of derivative financial instruments, and asset impairment judgments including other than temporary declines in the value of securities and the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets. Peoples significant accounting policies and critical estimates are summarized in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses charged to income. Losses on loans, including impaired loans, are charged to the allowance for loan losses when all or a portion of a loan is deemed to be uncollectible. Recoveries of loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance when realized. Management maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that is believed to be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio, based on a quarterly evaluation of a variety of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to: Peoples historical loan loss experience and recent trends in that experience; risk ratings assigned by lending personnel to commercial real estate finance, commercial and PCLC loans, and the results of ongoing reviews of those ratings by Peoples independent loan review function; an evaluation of non performing loans and related collateral values; the probability of loss in view of geographic and industry concentrations and other portfolio risk characteristics; the present financial condition of borrowers; and current economic conditions. While management seeks to use the best available information to make these evaluations, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions, results of regulatory examinations, further information obtained regarding known problem loans, the identification of additional problem loans and other factors. The allowance for loan losses consists of amounts determined in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, and SFAS No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan. In applying SFAS No. 5, management considers the factors listed in the preceding paragraph in order to estimate a loss allowance for (1) each homogeneous pool of smaller balance loans (residential mortgage and consumer loans) that are evaluated on a collective basis, and (2) commercial real estate finance, commercial and PCLC loans that are not considered impaired under SFAS No. 114. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that Peoples will be unable to collect all principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan. Peoples applies SFAS No. 114 to loans 21 Table of Contents that are individually evaluated for collectibility in accordance with its normal loan review procedures. Under SFAS No. 114, impaired loans are reported based on one of three measures: the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate; the loans observable market price; or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. If the measure is less than an impaired loans recorded investment, an impairment loss is recognized as part of the allowance for loan losses. Valuation of Derivative Financial Instruments. Peoples uses derivatives for market risk management purposes (principally interest rate risk) and not for trading or speculation purposes. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, all derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. Favorable changes in fair values result in unrealized gains that are recognized as assets, while unfavorable changes result in unrealized losses that are recognized as liabilities. Peoples hedge accounting methods vary depending on whether the derivative instrument is classified as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. Hedge accounting is permitted only if specific criteria are met, including a requirement that a highly effective relationship exist between the derivative instrument and the hedged item, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis. Results of effective hedges are recognized in current earnings for fair value hedges. Changes in the fair value of effective cash flow hedges are recognized in other comprehensive income until earnings are affected by the variability in cash flows of the designated hedged item. Ineffective portions of hedge results are recognized in current earnings. Peoples formally documents all relationships between the derivative instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as hedges to specific assets and liabilities, or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. Peoples also formally assesses, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged items. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective or has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, Peoples would discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. Interest rate lock commitments extended to borrowers relate to the origination of residential mortgage loans. To mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in these commitments, Peoples enters into mandatory delivery and best efforts contracts to sell adjustable rate and fixed rate residential mortgage loans. Forward commitments to sell and 22 Table of Contents interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans are considered derivatives and their respective estimated fair values are adjusted based on changes in interest rates and exclude the value of mortgage servicing rights. Asset Impairment Judgments Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, requires, among other things, use of the purchase method to account for all business combinations and specifies criteria that acquired intangible assets must meet in order to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. The assets and liabilities of an acquired company are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. Intangible assets are recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Other acquisition related intangibles are separately identified, where appropriate, for the estimated value of acquired customer relationships and are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated remaining average life of those relationships (ranging from 7 to 12 years from the respective acquisition dates). The remaining intangible asset is classified as goodwill. FAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill be reviewed for impairment at least annually, with impairment losses charged to expense when they occur. Acquisition related intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives and are periodically reviewed by management to assess recoverability. Impairment losses are recognized as a charge to expense if carrying amounts exceed fair values. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment using a two step approach that involves the identification of reporting units and the estimation of fair values. Goodwill shall also be tested for impairment when events occur that would more likely than not reduce the implied fair value of goodwill below its carrying value. An impairment loss is recognized as a charge to expense for any excess of the goodwill carrying amount over implied fair value. Securities. Marketable equity and debt securities (other than those reported as short term investments) are classified as either trading account securities, held to maturity securities (applicable only to debt securities) or available for sale securities. Management determines the classification of a security at the time of its purchase. Securities purchased for sale in the near term and those held by PSI (in accordance with the requirements for a broker dealer) are classified as trading account securities and reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are 23 Table of Contents reported in non interest income. Debt securities that Peoples has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity securities and reported at amortized cost. All other securities are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are reported on an after tax basis in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Premiums are amortized and discounts are accreted to interest income for debt securities, using the interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity, adjusted for the effect of actual prepayments in the case of mortgage backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and other asset backed securities. Federal Home Loan Bank stock is a non marketable equity security reported at cost. Security transactions are generally recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method and reported in non interest income. Management conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if the decline in fair value of any security appears to be other than temporary. If the decline is deemed to be other than temporary, the security is written down to a new cost basis and the resulting loss is reported in non interest income. The factors considered by management in its periodic review include, but are not limited to: the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer; the ratings of the security; whether the decline in fair value appears to be issuer specific or, alternatively, a reflection of general market or industry conditions; and Peoples intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in fair value. Non GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation to GAAP In addition to evaluating Peoples results of operations in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management routinely supplements this evaluation with an analysis of certain non GAAP financial measures, such as the efficiency ratio, core deposits and purchased funds. Management believes such non GAAP financial measures provides information useful to investors in understanding Peoples underlying operating performance and trends, and facilitates comparisons with the performance of other banks and thrifts. Management utilizes core deposits and purchased funds as non GAAP financial measures to supplement its analysis of Peoples business performance. Core deposits is a measure of stable funding sources and is defined as total deposits, other than brokered certificates of deposit (acquired in the wholesale market), municipal deposits (which are seasonally variable by nature) and non interest bearing deposits utilized for the operation of Peoples businesses. Purchased funds include borrowings, brokered certificates of deposit and municipal deposits. 24 Table of Contents Although management believes that the above mentioned non GAAP financial measures enhance investors understanding of Peoples operating performance, these non GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. The reconciliation of these non GAAP financial measures from GAAP to non GAAP is presented below. 25 Table of Contents The following tables provide reconciliations between GAAP and non GAAP financial measures: As of December 31 (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Deposits $ 9,083 $ 9,083 $ 8,862 $ 8,714 $ 8,426 Less: Municipal deposits 43 129 106 125 77 Brokered certificates of deposit 70 120 Other non interest bearing deposits 81 81 75 86 127 Core deposits $ 8,959 $ 8,873 $ 8,681 $ 8,433 $ 8,102 As of December 31 (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Borrowings $ 4 $ 295 $ 341 $ 1,516 $ 2,437 Plus: Municipal deposits 43 129 106 125 77 Brokered certificates of deposit 70 120 Purchased funds $ 47 $ 424 $ 447 $ 1,711 $ 2,634 In addition to the above non GAAP financial measures, management uses the efficiency ratio to monitor its operating efficiency compared to its peers. The efficiency ratio, which represents an approximate measure of the cost required by Peoples to generate a dollar of revenue, is the ratio of total non interest expense (excluding goodwill impairment charges, amortization of acquisition related intangibles, losses on real estate assets and nonrecurring expenses) (the numerator) to net interest income plus total non interest income (excluding gains and losses on sales of assets, other than residential mortgage loans, and nonrecurring income) (the denominator). Peoples generally considers an income or expense to be nonrecurring if it is not similar to an income or expense of a type incurred within the last two years and is not similar to an expense of a type reasonably expected to be incurred within the following two years. Management considers the efficiency ratio to be more representative of Peoples ongoing operating efficiency, as the excluded items are generally related to external market conditions and non routine transactions. 26 Table of Contents The following table summarizes Peoples efficiency ratio derived from amounts reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Economic activity in the United States showed continued signs of expanding in 2006. Real gross domestic product increased at a rate of 3.4% for the year, a level that represents the countrys long term historical average growth rate and an increase from the 3.2% pace recorded in 2005. The national unemployment rate was 4.5% as of December 31, 2006, down from 4.9% at the end of 2005. The national economy continued to grow despite widening federal budget and trade deficits, higher short term interest rates, elevated energy costs, a weaker housing market, and geopolitical uncertainties. In response to continuing signs that the U.S. economy was expanding, the Federal Reserve Board increased the targeted federal funds rate four times in 2006 by a total of 100 basis points, after thirteen interest rate increases during 2004 and 2005 totaling 350 basis points, bringing the rate to 5.25% as of December 31, 2006. This was up from 1.00% at the end of 2003. The Federal Reserve has not increased the targeted federal funds rates since the June 29, 2006 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, however, and has held the rate steady at 5.25% for the last five FOMC meetings. Peoples primary market area, Connecticut, is one of the most attractive markets in the United States with a total population of approximately 3.5 million and a median household income of $66,018 as of June 30, 2006, ranking second in the United States and well above the U.S. median income of $51,546, according to estimates from SNL Securities. Fairfield County, where Peoples is headquartered, is the wealthiest county in Connecticut, with a June 30, 2006 median household income of $81,678 according to estimates from SNL Securities. The states unemployment rate decreased to 4.2% as of December 31, 2006, compared to 4.6% at the end of 2005, and remained below the national rate of 4.5%. The Connecticut economy experienced moderate job growth in 2006, with total employment increasing by 10,600 jobs, or approximately 0.6% from December 31, 2005 to December 31, 2006. The outlook for the Connecticut economy in 2007 is cautiously optimistic, with the expectation that the state will experience further job growth as the economy continues to expand moderately. 28 Table of Contents Financial Overview Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005. Total assets at December 31, 2006 were $10.7 billion, a decrease of $246 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2005, primarily due to a $1.3 billion decline in total securities, partially offset by increases of $799 million in total loans, $193 million in short term investments, $58 million in bank owned life insurance and $66 million in other assets. The increase in total loans reflects growth of $456 million, or 10%, in Consumer Financial Services and $343 million, or 9%, in Commercial Banking. The growth in Consumer Financial Services was driven by increases of $392 million, or 11%, in residential mortgage loans and $64 million, or 5%, in consumer loans. The increase in residential mortgage loans reflects, in part, the purchase of $170 million of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans towards the end of the first quarter of 2006. The growth in Commercial Banking reflects increases of $235 million, or 37%, in loans originated by PCLC, our equipment financing subsidiary, $135 million, or 29%, in our national credits portfolio, and $60 million, or 5%, in commercial lending. These increases were partially offset by an $87 million, or 5%, decline in commercial real estate finance loans. The decrease in the securities portfolio reflects the sale of $266 million and $810 million of debt securities in the second and third quarters of 2006, respectively, to better position Peoples balance sheet for the prevailing interest rate environment at the time. Peoples also funded an additional $50 million of bank owned life insurance in 2006 and contributed $91.5 million in the third quarter of 2006 to its employee retirement plan (reported in other assets) to more than fully fund its projected benefit obligation and to significantly reduce pension plan expense in future years. Proceeds from sales of securities were also used to reduce total borrowings and subordinated notes by $335 million since December 31, 2005. Non performing assets totaled $22.7 million at December 31, 2006, a $0.7 million increase from December 31, 2005. Non performing assets declined by $0.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2006, reflecting an increase in non performing commercial loans to $11.9 million at December 31, 2006 as one commercial loan totaling $10.6 million was classified as non performing, partially offset by a $4.1 million decrease in non performing PCLC loans and a decrease in non performing commercial real estate finance loans to $0.2 million resulting from the full recovery on one commercial real estate finance loan totaling $5.5 million. The allowance for loan losses decreased $1.0 million to $74 million at December 31, 2006 compared to December 31, 2005, primarily reflecting reductions 29 Table of Contents in the allowance for loan losses allocated to the consumer loan portfolios, partially offset by net additions to the commercial banking loan portfolios. At December 31, 2006, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.79% and as a percentage of non performing loans was 328%, compared to 0.87% and 353%, respectively, at December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2006, liabilities totaled $9.3 billion, a $297 million, or 3%, decrease from December 31, 2005, reflecting a $335 million reduction in total borrowings and subordinated notes. Core deposits increased a modest $86 million, or 1%, in 2006 compared to 2005, reflecting Peoples strategy to fund loan growth with proceeds from maturities, sales and repayments of securities rather than core deposits. Peoples total stockholders equity was $1.34 billion at December 31, 2006, a $51 million net increase from December 31, 2005, reflecting net income of $124.0 million, partially offset by dividends paid of $60 million and a $25 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss reflects a $40 million after tax increase from the implementation of SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans and a $4 million increase in the after tax unrealized loss on derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges, partially offset by a $19 million reduction in the after tax net unrealized loss on securities available for sale due to the sales of securities discussed above. As a percentage of total assets, stockholders equity was 12.5% at December 31, 2006 compared to 11.8% at December 31, 2005. Peoples leverage, tier 1 and total risk based capital ratios were 12.0%, 14.8% and 16.1%, respectively, at December 31, 2006, compared to 11.2%, 14.8% and 16.4%, respectively, at December 31, 2005. The capital ratios were calculated in accordance with OTS regulations as of December 31, 2006 and FDIC regulations as of December 31, 2005. Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004. Total assets at December 31, 2005 were $10.9 billion, an increase of $215 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2004, primarily due to increases of $640 million in total loans and $154 million in bank owned life insurance, partially offset by a $708 million decline in total securities. The increase in total loans from year end 2004 was largely attributable to increases of $340 million in commercial loans and $242 million in residential mortgage loans. The decrease in the securities portfolio reflects the substitution of higher yielding loans for securities and the funding of a $150 million investment in bank owned life insurance with proceeds from maturing securities. 30 Table of Contents Non performing assets totaled $22.0 million at December 31, 2005, a $6.6 million decrease from year end 2004. The allowance for loan losses increased $2.5 million to $75 million at December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004, primarily reflecting increases in the allowance for loan losses allocated to commercial loans of $2.0 million and PCLC loans of $2.5 million, partially offset by a $2.0 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses allocated to the consumer loan portfolio. At December 31, 2005, the allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans was 0.87% and as a percent of non performing loans was 353%, compared to 0.91% and 265%, respectively, at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2005, liabilities totaled $9.6 billion, a $126 million increase from December 31, 2004, reflecting a $221 million increase in total deposits and an $89 million increase in stockholders equity, partially offset by a $46 million reduction in total borrowings. Peoples total stockholders equity was $1.29 billion at December 31, 2005, an $89 million increase from December 31, 2004, reflecting net income of $137.1 million, partially offset by dividends paid of $52.4 million. As a percentage of total assets, stockholders equity was 11.8% at December 31, 2005, compared to 11.2% at December 31, 2004. Peoples leverage, tier 1 and total risk based capital ratios were 11.2%, 14.8% and 16.4%, respectively, at December 31, 2005, compared to 10.5%, 14.6% and 16.7%, respectively, at December 31, 2004. The capital ratios were calculated in accordance with FDIC regulations. Comparison of Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005. Peoples reported net income of $124.0 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $137.1 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, for the year ago period. Income from continuing operations totaled $121.7 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $125.9 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, for the year ago period. In 2006, Peoples return on average assets was 1.15% and return on average stockholders equity was 9.4%. Results for 2006 include net security losses totaling $27.4 million from the sale of $266 million and $810 million of debt securities in the second and third quarters of 2006, respectively. Results for 2006 also include a $2.4 million income tax benefit related to certain prior year tax matters. The net impact of these items reduced 2006 net income by $15.8 million, or $0.11 per share. 31 Table of Contents Results for 2005 included an $8.1 million gain on the sale of three branches, a $9.7 million gain from the resolution of a significant contingency related to the sale of the credit card business in 2004 (reported in income from discontinued operations), a $2.0 million income tax benefit resulting from the completion of a routine federal tax audit, a $2.0 million goodwill impairment charge and expenses incurred in connection with the repurchase of subordinated notes ($2.7 million) and the accelerated vesting of stock options ($0.7 million). The net impact of these items increased 2005 net income by $9.3 million, or $0.07 per share. Net interest income increased $12.7 million, or 3%, from 2005 and the net interest margin improved 19 basis points to 3.87%. The higher net interest margin reflects the asset sensitive position of the balance sheet, the substitution of securities with higher yielding loans, the partial benefit from the sales of securities in the second and third quarters of 2006, and the impact of our deposit pricing strategy. Compared to 2005, average earning assets decreased $173 million, or 2%, as a $934 million, or 54%, decline in average securities funded a $715 million, or 9%, increase in average loans and a $113 million, or 27%, decrease in average total borrowings and average subordinated notes. The loan growth reflects increases of $285 million, or 8%, in average commercial banking loans, $345 million, or 10%, in average residential mortgage loans, and $108 million, or 9%, in average home equity loans, all as compared to 2005. The increase in average residential mortgage loans reflects, in part, the purchase of $170 million of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans towards the end of the first quarter of 2006. In addition, Peoples invested $50 million in the first quarter of 2006 and $150 million in the second quarter of 2005 in bank owned life insurance, and contributed $91.5 million to its employee retirement plan in September 2006. Compared to 2005, total non interest income, excluding net security losses, increased $1.2 million, or 1%; total non interest expense increased $2.5 million, or 1%; and the efficiency ratio improved to 61.3% from 62.8%. The provision for loan losses was $3.4 million compared to $8.6 million in 2005. The provision for loan losses for 2006 reflects net loan charge offs of $4.4 million, partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in the allowance for loan losses. The provision for loan losses in 2005 reflected net loan charge offs of $6.1 million and a $2.5 million increase in the allowance for loan losses. Net loan charge offs decreased $1.7 million, or 28%, for 2006, compared to 2005. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average loans equaled 0.05%, down from 0.07% for 2005. 32 Table of Contents Comparison of Results of Operations for 2005 and 2004. Peoples reported net income in 2005 of $137.1 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, compared to $199.7 million, or $1.42 per diluted share in 2004. Included in the 2005 results were a gain on the sale of three branches, a gain from the resolution of a significant contingency related to the sale of Peoples credit card portfolio in 2004, an income tax benefit, a goodwill impairment charge and expenses incurred in connection with the repurchase of subordinated notes and the accelerated vesting of stock options. The 2004 results included the net gain on the sale of Peoples credit card business, liability restructuring charges, other nonrecurring expenses and an income tax benefit. In 2005, Peoples return on average assets was 1.27% and return on average stockholders equity was 11.1%. The net interest margin improved 35 basis points from 2004, reflecting a combination of Peoples asset sensitive position and the ongoing shift of its asset mix from investment securities to higher yielding loans. Other important factors that affected the financial results in 2005 were strong loan growth in Peoples commercial banking and home equity lending portfolios; a 35% reduction in the provision for loan losses; growth in fee based revenues; and continued expense control. On March 5, 2004, Peoples completed the sale of its credit card business, which included $2.0 billion of credit card receivables, as well as the transfer of its related credit card operations and 420 employees, to The Royal Bank of Scotland Group. The net pre tax gain on sale of $305.4 million is included in income from discontinued operations for 2004 in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Peoples utilized a portion of the proceeds from the sale of its credit card business to prepay slightly over $1.0 billion of long term borrowings. In addition, derivative positions with notional values of $770 million were canceled. Liability restructuring costs totaling $133.4 million are included in total non interest expense for 2004 in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 33 Table of Contents Business Segment Results Peoples operations are divided into two primary business segments that represent its core businesses, commercial banking and consumer financial services. In addition, the treasury area is responsible for managing Peoples securities portfolio, short term investments, wholesale funding activities, such as borrowings and the funding center. The income or loss for the funding center, which includes the impact of derivative financial instruments used for risk management purposes, represents the interest rate risk component of Peoples net interest income as calculated by Peoples funds transfer pricing model (FTP), to derive each operating segments net interest income. Business Segment Performance Summary Net Income Years ended December 31 (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Commercial Banking $ 41.9 $ 45.7 $ 45.1 Consumer Financial Services 85.8 94.2 90.0 Treasury (26.0 ) (25.0 ) (60.5 ) Total reportable segments 101.7 114.9 74.6 Other 22.3 22.2 125.1 Total Consolidated $ 124.0 $ 137.1 $ 199.7 Peoples uses an internal profitability reporting system to generate information by operating segment, which is based on a series of management estimates and allocations regarding funds transfer pricing, the provision for loan losses, non interest expense and income taxes. These estimates and allocations, some of which can be subjective in nature, are continually being reviewed and refined. Any changes in estimates and allocations that may affect the reported results of any business segment will not affect the consolidated financial position or results of operations of Peoples as a whole. FTP is used in the calculation of each operating segments net interest income, and measures the value of funds used in and provided by an operating segment. The difference between the interest income on earning assets and the interest expense on funding liabilities, and the corresponding FTP charge for interest income or credit for interest expense, results in net spread income. The provision for loan losses for the Commercial Banking and Consumer Financial Services segments is generally based on a five year rolling average net charge off rate for the respective segment. Peoples allocates a majority of non interest expenses to each business segment using a full absorption costing process. Direct and indirect costs are analyzed and pooled by process and assigned to the appropriate 34 Table of Contents business segment and corporate overhead costs are allocated to the business segments. Income tax expense is allocated to each business segment using a constant rate, based on an estimate of the consolidated effective income tax rate for the year. In the second quarter of 2006, the results of the funding center, previously included in Other, were reclassified to Treasury. In the first quarter of 2006, Peoples revised its FTP methodology assumptions relating to deposit products with indeterminate maturities, based on a comprehensive historical analysis of the implied maturities and repricing characteristics of those deposits. As a result, the duration for most of those deposits was lengthened, which in turn increased their value and corresponding FTP credit. Segment information for all periods presented has been restated to reflect the changes resulting from the reclassification of the funding center to Treasury and the revised FTP methodology assumptions. For a more detailed description of the estimates and allocations used to measure business segment performance, see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Commercial Banking consists principally of commercial lending, commercial real estate finance lending and commercial deposit gathering activities. This segment also includes the equipment financing operations of PCLC, as well as cash management, correspondent banking and municipal banking.

Net interest income increased $0.8 million, or 1%, reflecting a $284 million, or 8%, increase in average earning assets, partially offset by narrower net spreads. The $3.9 million decrease in fee based revenues reflects lower lending related charges and fees, primarily lower commercial real estate finance loan prepayment penalties. The increase in other non interest income primarily reflects a $2.7 million increase in rental income on leased equipment. The $4.6 million, or 6%, increase in non interest expense reflects an increase in direct expenses due to the continued growth in Commercial Banking, including a $2.0 million increase in the amortization expense of equipment leased to commercial customers. The increase in average earning assets compared to 2005 reflects increases of $183 million, or 35%, in PCLC loans, and $127 million, or 10%, in commercial loans, partially offset by a $25 million, or 1%, decrease in commercial real estate finance loans. Average commercial non interest bearing deposits totaled $939 million for 2006, a $43 million, or 4%, decrease compared to 2005, reflecting the current higher interest rate environment. Commercial Banking income from continuing operations increased $0.6 million, or 1%, in 2005 compared to 2004, reflecting increases in net interest income and fee based revenues, partially offset by increases in non interest expense. Net interest income increased $3.9 million, or 3%, reflecting a $417 million, or 13%, increase in average earning assets, partially offset by narrower net spreads. The $3.3 million increase in fee based revenues reflects higher lending related charges and fees, primarily higher commercial real estate finance loan prepayment penalties. The $6.3 million, or 9%, increase in non interest expense reflects a $5.3 million increase in allocated expenses, due to the continued growth in this business during 2005 and a higher level of charges related to loan prepayments. The increase in average earning assets compared to 2004 reflects increases of $224 million, or 21%, in commercial loans, $164 million, or 46%, in PCLC loans and $30 million, or 2%, in commercial real estate finance loans. Average commercial non interest bearing deposits grew $43 million, or 5%, on a year over year basis. 36 Table of Contents Consumer Financial Services includes, as its principal business lines, consumer deposit gathering activities, and residential mortgage, home equity and other consumer lending (excluding the national consumer loan portfolio, which is reported in Other). In addition to trust services, this segment also includes brokerage, financial advisory services, investment management services and life insurance provided by PSI, and other insurance services provided through RC Knox. Years ended December 31 (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Net interest income $ 256.4 $ 266.4 $ 268.0 Provision for loan losses 3.0 3.5 3.3 Non interest income: Fee based revenues 135.1 129.0 123.7 Net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans 2.0 4.0 3.7 Gain on sale of branches 8.1 Other non interest income 3.4 2.4 2.1 Total non interest income 140.5 143.5 129.5 Non interest expense 261.3 259.4 252.1 Income before income tax expense 132.6 147.0 142.1 Income tax expense 46.8 52.8 52.1 Income from continuing operations $ 85.8 $ 94.2 $ 90.0 Average earning assets $ 5,086.6 $ 4,634.9 $ 4,148.2 Average liabilities 7,807.8 7,762.4 7,626.0 Year end assets 5,366.4 4,900.7 4,487.9 Consumer Financial Services income from continuing operations decreased $8.4 million, or 9%, in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to decreases in net interest income and net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans, partially offset by higher fee based revenues. Additionally, results for 2005 included the $8.1 million gain on sale of branches. The decrease in net interest income primarily reflects the reduction in net spread interest income for residential mortgage loans and the decline in net interest spread from an unfavorable shift from savings and money market deposits to higher rate time deposits, partially offset by the benefit of an increase in average loan balances. The shift in deposit mix reflects an increase in higher rate time deposits, partially offset by a decline in savings and money market deposits. During 2006, average earning assets increased $452 million, or 10%, including increases of $345 million, or 10%, in average residential mortgage loans and $106 million, or 9%, in average home equity loans. Peoples purchased $170 million of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans towards the end of the first quarter of 2006. Average consumer deposits totaled $7.7 billion, a 1% increase compared to 2005. 37 Table of Contents The increase in fee based revenues in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily reflects an increase in service charges on deposit accounts related to changes in Peoples fee structure. The increase in other non interest income reflects a $0.7 million net gain from the sale of a corporate insurance account by RC Knox. Included in non interest income in 2005 was an $8.1 million gain on the sale of three branches. The increase in non interest expense reflects a $3.8 million increase in allocated expenses in 2006, partially offset by a $2.0 million goodwill impairment charge in 2005. Consumer Financial Services income from continuing operations increased $4.2 million, or 5%, in 2005 compared to 2004. Fee based revenues increased $5.3 million compared to 2004, reflecting increases in service charges on deposit accounts and insurance revenue. Included in non interest income in 2005 was an $8.1 million gain on the sale of three branches. The increase in non interest expense reflects a $7.6 million increase in allocated expenses and a $2.0 million goodwill impairment charge in 2005 resulting from the decision to combine OMIA, previously a separate operating subsidiary, with one of Peoples other businesses within the Consumer Financial Services segment (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In 2005, average earning assets increased $487 million, or 12%, including increases of $250 million, or 8%, in average residential mortgage loans and $228 million, or 25%, in average home equity loans. Average consumer deposits increased $90 million, or 1%, compared to 2004. 38 Table of Contents Treasury encompasses the securities portfolio, short term investments, wholesale funding activities, such as borrowings and the funding center. The income or loss for the funding center, which includes the impact of derivative financial instruments used for risk management purposes, represents the interest rate risk component of Peoples net interest income as calculated by Peoples funds transfer pricing model (FTP), to derive each operating segments net interest income. Under this process, a money desk (the funding center) buys funds from liability generating business lines (such as consumer deposits) and sells funds to asset generating business lines (such as commercial lending). The price at which funds are bought and sold on any given day is set by Peoples treasury group and is based on the wholesale cost to Peoples of assets and liabilities with similar maturities. Liability generating businesses sell newly originated liabilities to the money desk and recognize a funding credit, while asset generating businesses buy funding for newly originated assets from the money desk and recognize a funding charge. Once funding for an asset is purchased from or a liability is sold to the money desk, the price that is set by the treasury group will remain with that asset or liability until it matures or reprices, which effectively transfers responsibility for managing interest rate risk to the treasury group.

The reduction in treasurys net spread income reflects a $934 million decline in average securities and an increase in the FTP charge for funding the BOLI investment (with no offsetting interest income as BOLI income is recorded in non interest income). The improvement in the funding centers net spread loss reflects the rising interest rate environment and the asset sensitive position of Peoples balance sheet. Average earning assets decreased $887 million, or 50%, reflecting a $934 million, or 54%, decline in average securities from 2005 given Peoples sale of its debt securities portfolio during 2006 as part of restructuring activities to better position Peoples balance sheet for the prevailing interest rate environment. The debt securities portfolio totaled $27 million at December 31, 2006, compared to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2005, reflecting the sale of approximately $1.1 billion of securities and the substitution of securities with higher yielding loans. Average securities comprised 8% of average earning assets in 2006, compared to 17% in 2005. The improvement in treasurys loss from continuing operations in 2005 compared to 2004 reflects a $45.4 million improvement in net interest income and an increase in non interest income (attributable to BOLI income of $3.3 million in 2005 and $4.5 million of net security losses in 2004). The improvement in net interest income reflects the funding centers net spread loss declining by $49.7 million, partially offset by a $4.3 million decline in treasurys net spread income. The reduction in treasurys net spread income reflects a $510 million decline in average securities. The improvement in the funding centers net spread loss reflects the rising interest rate environment and the asset sensitive position of Peoples balance sheet. Peoples invested $150 million in a BOLI program in the second quarter of 2005 with proceeds from maturing securities. Increases in the cash surrender value of BOLI are included in non interest income and totaled $3.3 million in 2005. Peoples invested an additional $50 million in BOLI in February 2006 with proceeds from maturing securities. Average securities comprised 17% of average earning assets in 2005, compared to 23% in 2004. 40 Table of Contents Other includes the residual financial impact from the allocation of revenues and expenses and certain revenues and expenses not attributable to a particular segment. This category also includes: revenues and expenses relating to the national consumer loan portfolio; liability restructuring costs; certain nonrecurring items; income from discontinued operations, including the gain on the sale of the credit card business; and benefits from completed Internal Revenue Service audits in each of the three years. Included in period end assets are cash, national consumer loans, premises and equipment, and other assets.

Given the asset sensitive position of the balance sheet, the net interest margin has generally benefited from these interest rate increases. There have been no additional increases in the targeted federal funds rate between June 30, 2006 and December 31, 2006. 2006 Compared to 2005 Net interest income increased $13 million, or 3%, and the net interest margin improved 19 basis points to 3.87% for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in net interest income reflects a $74 million increase in total interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $61 million increase in total interest expense. Average earning assets totaled $9.8 billion for 2006, a $173 million, or 2%, decrease from 2005, while the asset mix continued to shift. The shift in asset mix from securities to higher yielding loans continued to benefit the net interest margin. Average loans increased $715 million, or 9%, while average securities declined $934 million, or 54%, for 2006 compared to 2005. As a result, average loans and average securities comprised 91% and 8%, respectively, of average earning assets for 2006 compared to 82% and 17%, respectively, for 2005. The yield earned on the total loan portfolio was 6.10% for 2006 while the yield earned on securities was 3.74%, compared to 5.41% and 3.47%, respectively, for 2005. Growth in loans reflects increases of $345 million, or 10%, in average residential mortgage loans, $285 million, or 8%, in average commercial banking loans and $85 million, or 7%, in average consumer loans for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in average residential mortgage loans reflects, in part, the purchase of $170 million of adjustable rate mortgage loans towards the end of the first quarter of 2006. The growth in average commercial banking loans for 2006 compared to 2005 reflects a $183 million, or 35%, increase in average PCLC loans and a $127 million, or 10%, increase in average commercial loans, partially offset by a $25 million, or 1%, decrease in average commercial real estate finance loans. Included in average commercial loans and average commercial real estate finance loans were increases of $44 million, or 15%, and $59 million, or 40%, in the respective national credits portfolios. The growth in average consumer loans for 2006 compared to 2005 continues to reflect a shift in mix as an increase of $108 million, or 9%, in home equity loans was partially offset by a $21 million, or 81%, reduction in higher yielding unsecured national personal installment loans, which continue to run off as a result of a management decision to discontinue this type of lending. 43 Table of Contents The significant decrease in the average securities portfolio for 2006 compared to 2005 reflects the substitution of securities with higher yielding loans as securities pay down and mature, as well as the partial impact of security sales during 2006 to better position Peoples balance sheet for the prevailing interest rate environment. Peoples sold $810 million and $266 million of debt securities in the third and second quarters of 2006, respectively, and used the proceeds to fund loan growth and pay down borrowings. The duration of the remaining securities portfolio was approximately 0.07 years at December 31, 2006. In addition to funding loan growth, Peoples invested $50 million in the first quarter of 2006 and $150 million in the second quarter of 2005 in a bank owned life insurance program with proceeds from maturing securities. The earnings from bank owned life insurance are reported in non interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The overall 84 basis point improvement in the yield on average earning assets for 2006 compared to 2005 primarily reflects increases in market interest rates since June 2004 and the ongoing shift in asset mix. The interest rate increases initiated by the Federal Reserve continue to have a beneficial effect on the earning asset yield as approximately 29% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2006 has floating interest rates. Average funding liabilities totaled $9.3 billion for 2006, down $113 million or 1% compared with 2005. Average core deposits increased $50 million, or 1%, to $8.9 billion and comprised 95% of average funding liabilities, compared to 94% in 2005. Average interest bearing core deposits increased $101 million, or 2%, and average non interest bearing core deposits decreased $51 million, or 2%, reflective of Peoples strategy of funding loan growth with proceeds from maturities, sales and repayments of securities rather than core deposits. The 68 basis point increase to 2.15% from 1.47% in the rate paid on average funding liabilities for 2006 compared to 2005 primarily reflects increases in market interest rates since June 2004 and the ongoing shift in deposit mix. The rates paid on average core deposits increased 70 basis points in 2006, reflecting increases of 115 basis points in time deposits and 36 basis points in savings and money market deposits in response to rising market interest rates. The change in the mix of average interest bearing core deposits reflects a $660 million, or 25%, increase in higher rate time deposits, partially offset by a $559 million, or 14%, decline in savings and money market deposits, reflecting customers preferences for deposit products with higher interest rates given the 44 Table of Contents prevailing interest rate environment. Average time deposits comprised 37% of average total core deposits, compared to 30% for 2005. Further shifts in deposit mix to higher rate deposits are likely to raise Peoples overall cost of funding. Average purchased funds decreased $37 million, or 10%, and average subordinated notes decreased $16 million, or 13%, in 2006 compared to 2005. 2005 Compared to 2004 Net interest income increased $43 million, or 13%, and the net interest margin improved 35 basis points to 3.68% in 2005 compared to 2004. The increase in net interest income reflects a $71 million increase in total interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $28 million increase in total interest expense. Average earning assets totaled $10.0 billion in 2005, a $205 million, or 2%, increase from 2004, while the asset mix continued to shift. Average loans increased $836 million, or 11%, while average securities and average short term investments declined a combined $631 million, or 26%. As a result, average loans and average securities comprised 82% and 17%, respectively, of average earning assets, compared to 75% and 23%, respectively, in 2004. The yield earned on the total loan portfolio was 5.41% in 2005 while the yield earned on securities and short term investments was 3.45%, compared to 4.90% and 3.23%, respectively, for 2004. The total average commercial banking loan portfolio increased $418 million, or 13%, in 2005 compared to 2004, reflecting increases of $224 million, or 21%, in commercial loans, $164 million, or 46%, in PCLC loans and $30 million, or 2%, in commercial real estate finance loans. Included in average commercial loans and average commercial real estate finance loans were increases of $83 million, or 41%, and $8 million, or 5%, in the respective national credits portfolios. Average residential mortgage loans increased $250 million, or 8%, in 2005 compared to 2004, while average consumer loans increased $168 million, or 16%. Consumer loans continued to reflect a shift in mix as growth of $228 million, or 25%, in home equity loans generated by the Connecticut franchise was partially offset by a $60 million, or 70%, reduction in higher yielding unsecured national personal installment loans, which continued to run off as a result of a management decision to discontinue this type of lending. The growth in home equity lending reflected a combination of the emphasis placed on this line of business by Peoples, as well as nationwide trends. The $510 million, or 23%, decrease in the average securities portfolio in 2005 compared to 2004 reflected the substitution of securities with higher yielding loans as securities paid down and matured. The duration of the securities portfolio was approximately 1.7 years at December 31, 2005. In addition, Peoples invested $150 million in a bank owned life insurance program with proceeds from maturing securities in 2005. 45 Table of Contents The overall 61 basis point improvement in the yield on average earning assets in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily reflected the increase in market interest rates since June 2004 and the ongoing shift in asset mix. The interest rate increases initiated by the Federal Reserve had a beneficial effect on the earning asset yield as approximately 30% of the loan portfolio had floating interest rates. In 2005, average funding liabilities totaled $9.4 billion, essentially flat with 2004 before the allocation of funding liabilities to discontinued operations. Average core deposits increased $224 million, or 3%, and comprised 94% of average funding liabilities in 2005 compared to 91% in 2004 before the allocation of funding liabilities to discontinued operations. Average non interest bearing core deposits increased $98 million, or 5%, and average interest bearing core deposits increased $126 million, or 2%, due in part to Peoples focus on growing core deposits during 2005. The 27 basis point increase to 1.47% from 1.20% in the rate paid on average funding liabilities in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily reflected the increase in market interest rates throughout 2005 and the shift in deposit mix. The rates paid on average core deposits increased 32 basis points in 2005, reflecting increases of 50 basis points in time deposits and 25 basis points in savings and money market deposits in response to rising market interest rates, partially offset by growth in non interest bearing core deposits. The change in the mix of average interest bearing core deposits reflected a $377 million, or 17%, increase in higher rate time deposits, partially offset by a $251 million, or 6%, decline in savings and money market deposits, reflecting customers preferences for deposit products with higher interest rates. Average time deposits comprised 29% of average total deposits in 2005, compared to 26% in 2004. Average purchased funds decreased $186 million, or 33%, and average subordinated notes decreased $25 million, or 17%, in 2005 compared to 2004. In December 2005, Peoples repurchased $13.5 million of its 9.875% subordinated notes due 2010. In the first quarter of 2004, Peoples used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of its credit card business to pay down interest bearing liabilities. The repayment of slightly over $1 billion in high cost wholesale liabilities and the cancellation of $770 million in derivative positions relating to a portion of these liabilities had a net beneficial impact on the net interest margin in 2004. 46 Table of Contents Average Balance, Interest and Yield/Rate Analysis The table on the following page presents average balance sheets, interest income, interest expense and the corresponding average yields earned and rates paid for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The average balances are principally daily averages and, for loans, include both performing and non performing balances. Interest income on loans includes the effect of deferred loan fees and costs accounted for as yield adjustments, but does not include interest on loans for which Peoples has ceased to accrue interest. The impact of Peoples use of derivative instruments in managing interest rate risk is also reflected in the table, classified according to the instrument hedged and the risk management objective. For 2004, the net interest margin, net interest income and average funding liabilities reflect a reduction in funding liabilities and interest expense relating to the earning assets of the credit card business that were reclassified to discontinued operations for the periods prior to the sale in the first quarter of 2004. Interest expense was allocated to discontinued operations for 2004 by applying the weighted average cost of funds previously used for credit card segment reporting purposes to the average earning assets of the discontinued operations for 2004, with a corresponding reduction in total interest expense. 47 Table of Contents Average Balance, Interest and Yield/Rate Analysis 2006 2005 2004 Years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) Average Balance Interest Yield/ Rate Average Balance Interest Yield/ Rate Average Balance Interest Yield/ Rate Earning assets: Short term investments $ 106.6 $ 5.3 4.97 % $ 54.5 $ 1.5 2.86 % $ 198.0 $ 2.3 1.19 % Securities purchased under agreements to resell 16.6 0.8 4.98 22.8 1.0 4.22 Securities (1) 803.8 30.0 3.74 1,737.8 60.3 3.47 2,248.0 72.5 3.23 Loans: Residential mortgage 3,758.8 185.2 4.93 3,413.3 154.7 4.53 3,163.4 137.7 4.35 Commercial 2,135.7 146.5 6.86 1,825.5 108.7 5.95 1,437.6 73.3 5.10 Commercial real estate finance 1,765.1 126.0 7.14 1,790.5 116.2 6.49 1,760.7 105.0 5.96 Consumer 1,288.3 88.3 6.85 1,203.3 65.8 5.47 1,035.0 46.7 4.51 Total loans 8,947.9 546.0 6.10 8,232.6 445.4 5.41 7,396.7 362.7 4.90 Total earning assets $ 9,874.9 $ 582.1 5.90 % $ 10,047.7 $ 508.2 5.06 % $ 9,842.7 $ 437.5 4.45 % Funding liabilities: Deposits: Non interest bearing deposits $ 2,090.7 $ % $ 2,142.0 $ % $ 2,043.7 $ % Savings, interest bearing checking and money market 3,464.3 49.2 1.42 4,023.4 42.6 1.06 4,274.7 34.4 0.81 Time 3,308.7 128.8 3.89 2,648.8 72.6 2.74 2,271.5 50.9 2.24 Total core deposits 8,863.7 178.0 2.01 8,814.2 115.2 1.31 8,589.9 85.3 0.99 Non core deposits 118.4 2.1 1.85 167.2 2.3 1.40 198.5 1.4 0.69 Total deposits 8,982.1 180.1 2.01 8,981.4 117.5 1.31 8,788.4 86.7 0.99 Borrowings: Federal funds purchased 158.2 7.6 4.78 250.5 7.9 3.19 249.6 3.2 1.25 FHLB advances 47.2 2.4 5.15 50.3 1.4 2.73 176.1 9.4 5.32 Repurchase agreements 1.7 0.1 2.41 36.1 1.0 2.91 Total borrowings 205.4 10.0 4.87 302.5 9.4 3.11 461.8 13.6 2.94 Subordinated notes 105.0 9.6 9.10 121.2 11.3 9.29 146.5 13.4 9.16 Total 9,292.5 9,405.1 9,396.7 Funding liabilities allocated to discontinued operations (2) (203.6 ) (3.6 ) 1.77 Total funding liabilities $ 9,292.5 $ 199.7 2.15 % $ 9,405.1 $ 138.2 1.47 % $ 9,193.1 $ 110.1 1.20 % Excess of earning assets over funding liabilities $ 582.4 $ 642.6 $ 649.6 Net interest income/spread $ 382.4 3.75 % $ 370.0 3.59 % $ 327.4 3.25 % Net interest margin 3.87 % 3.68 % 3.33 % (1) Average balances and yields for securities available for sale are based on amortized cost.

For each category of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, information is provided relating to: changes in volume (changes in average balances multiplied by the prior years average interest rate); changes in rates (changes in average interest rates multiplied by the prior years average balance); and the total change. Changes attributable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately. 2006 Compared to 2005 Increase (Decrease) 2005 Compared to 2004 Increase (Decrease) (in millions) Volume Rate Total Volume Rate Total Interest and dividend income: Short term investments $ 2.1 $ 1.7 $ 3.8 $ (2.5 ) $ 1.7 $ (0.8 ) Securities purchased under agreements to resell (0.3 ) 0.1 (0.2 ) 1.0 1.0 Securities (34.6 ) 4.3 (30.3 ) (17.4 ) 5.2 (12.2 ) Loans: Residential mortgage 16.4 14.1 30.5 11.2 5.8 17.0 Commercial 20.0 17.8 37.8 21.8 13.6 35.4 Commercial real estate finance (1.7 ) 11.5 9.8 1.8 9.4 11.2 Consumer 4.9 17.6 22.5 8.3 10.8 19.1 Total loans 39.6 61.0 100.6 43.1 39.6 82.7 Total change in interest and dividend income 6.8 67.1 73.9 24.2 46.5 70.7 Interest expense: Deposits: Savings, interest bearing checking and money market (6.5 ) 13.1 6.6 (2.1 ) 10.3 8.2 Time 20.9 35.3 56.2 9.3 12.4 21.7 Total core deposits 14.4 48.4 62.8 7.2 22.7 29.9 Non core deposits (0.8 ) 0.6 (0.2 ) (0.2 ) 1.1 0.9 Total deposits 13.6 49.0 62.6 7.0 23.8 30.8 Borrowings: FHLB advances (0.1 ) 1.1 1.0 (4.8 ) (3.2 ) (8.0 ) Federal funds purchased (3.6 ) 3.3 (0.3 ) 4.7 4.7 Repurchase agreements (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.9 ) (0.9 ) Total borrowings (3.8 ) 4.4 0.6 (5.7 ) 1.5 (4.2 ) Subordinated notes (1.5 ) (0.2 ) (1.7 ) (2.3 ) 0.2 (2.1 ) Funding liabilities allocated to discontinued operations 3.6 3.6 Total change in interest expense 8.3 53.2 61.5 2.6 25.5 28.1 Change in net interest income $ (1.5 ) $ 13.9 $ 12.4 $ 21.6 $ 21.0 $ 42.6 49 Table of Contents The following table provides the weighted average yields earned and rates paid for each major category of earning assets and funding liabilities as of December 31, 2006.

Peoples has focused on enhancing these revenue streams by leveraging its commercial banking relationships, growing existing fee based revenue generating businesses, and strengthening its retail delivery network and products. Total non interest income decreased $25.9 million, or 15%, in 2006, compared to 2005, reflecting net security losses of $27.4 million as part of balance sheet restructuring activities in 2006 and an $8.1 million gain on sale of branches in 2005. Excluding net security losses from both periods and the branch sale gain from 2005, total non interest income would have increased $9.3 million, or 6%, reflecting higher fee based revenues, higher bank owned life insurance income and higher other non interest income, partially offset by lower net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans. 51 Table of Contents Revenue from service charges on deposit accounts increased $5.4 million, or 7%, compared to 2005, reflecting changes in Peoples fee structure implemented in both the second quarter of 2006 and the third quarter of 2005 to close the gap between Peoples pricing practices and those of the competition, partially offset by the impact of higher usage by the public of the cash back option at point of sale locations. Insurance revenue declined $0.7 million, or 2.5%, in 2006, reflecting industry wide trends for this business, characterized as a soft market with lower pricing for renewals, as well as reductions related to the sale of a large corporate account in the third quarter of 2006. Other banking service charges and fees increased $0.6 million in 2006, primarily due to growth in retail banking fees associated with higher levels of Personal Identification Number (PIN) debit interchange fees resulting from customer preferences for debit card related transactions. PIN debit interchange refers to the revenue generated when a customer uses their PIN to make a purchase with their debit card. Peoples earns a portion of the purchase amount whenever its customers use their debit card at a retail merchant. This interchange is paid by the retail merchant. Other fees decreased $5.1 million, reflecting lower lending related charges and fees, primarily lower commercial real estate loan prepayment penalties. As previously discussed, $810 million and $266 million of debt securities were sold in the third and second quarters of 2006, respectively, resulting in net security losses of $23.4 million and $4.0 million for the respective periods. Peoples also sold $25 million in securities purchased under agreements to resell in the third quarter of 2006 at a loss of $0.3 million, which is reported in other non interest expense. These transactions were undertaken to better position Peoples balance sheet for the prevailing interest rate environment. Net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans decreased $2.0 million in 2006, reflecting lower residential mortgage loan origination volume and subsequent lower levels of fixed rate loan sales. Sales volume of fixed rate residential mortgage loans decreased approximately 40% in 2006, which is consistent with the 39% decrease in fixed rate residential mortgage originations compared to 2005. Residential mortgage originations totaled $1.1 billion in 2006, compared to $1.4 billion in 2005. Peoples invested an additional $50 million in the first quarter of 2006 in bank owned life insurance, after an initial investment of $150 million in the second quarter of 2005 to help defray the rising costs of employee benefits. Increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance are included in non interest income and totaled $9.1 million in 2006 ($13.7 million on a taxable equivalent basis), compared to $3.3 million ($5.1 million on a taxable equivalent basis) for 2005. 52 Table of Contents The increase in other non interest income compared to 2005 reflects a $2.7 million increase in rental income resulting from the higher level of equipment leased to PCLC customers. In addition, other non interest income for the 2006 period includes a $0.7 million net gain from the sale of a large corporate insurance account by RC Knox, a $0.7 million gain from the redemption of common stock received in conjunction with the MasterCard Incorporated initial public offering given People debit card business and $0.6 million of interest related to the completion of a federal tax audit. Total non interest income increased $21.6 million in 2005 compared to 2004, reflecting an $8.1 million gain on the sale of three branches, higher fee based revenues, higher bank owned life insurance income and higher net security losses in 2004, partially offset by a reduction in other non interest income in 2005 due to the elimination of servicing income from The Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS), which purchased Peoples credit card business in 2004. Service charges on deposit accounts increased $3.2 million compared to 2004, reflecting changes in Peoples fee structure implemented in the third quarter of 2005 to close the gap between Peoples pricing practices and those of the competition, partially offset by the impact of promotional campaigns on certain commercial and retail checking fees that began in the third quarter of 2004. Insurance revenue reflects higher commissions earned by RC Knox in a soft insurance market, offset by lower contingent commission revenue and lower fee based revenues from the sale of life insurance products offered in Peoples branch network. The decrease in brokerage commissions primarily reflects lower fees received from sales of annuity products. Other banking service charges and fees increased primarily due to growth in retail banking fees associated with higher levels of PIN debit interchange fees resulting from customer preferences for debit card related transactions. The increase in other fees reflects higher lending related charges and fees, including higher commercial real estate loan prepayment penalties received as a result of the low interest rate environment in 2005. 53 Table of Contents Peoples invested $150 million in the second quarter of 2005 in a bank owned life insurance program to help defray the rising costs of employee benefits. Increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance are included in non interest income and totaled $3.3 million in 2005. Included in other non interest income in 2004 was $4.8 million of servicing income related to the interim servicing agreement with RBS following the credit card sale. 54 Table of Contents Non Interest Expense Percentage Increase (Decrease) Years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2006/2005 2005/2004 Compensation and benefits $ 202.9 $ 195.5 $ 194.3 3.8 % 0.6 % Occupancy and equipment 62.2 62.4 69.3 (0.3 ) (10.0 ) Professional and outside service fees 24.3 26.1 25.8 (6.9 ) 1.2 Advertising and promotion 10.3 9.9 9.8 4.0 1.0 Stationery, printing and postage 7.5 7.1 8.0 5.6 (11.3 ) Amortization of other acquisition related intangibles 1.1 1.8 3.4 (38.9 ) (47.1 ) Other non interest expense 38.6 36.9 35.7 4.6 3.4 Total 346.9 339.7 346.3 2.1 (1.9 ) Liability restructuring costs 2.7 133.4 n/m n/m Goodwill impairment charge 2.0 n/m n/m Total non interest expense $ 346.9 $ 344.4 $ 479.7 0.7 % (28.2 )% Efficiency ratio 61.3 % 62.8 % 69.2 % n/m not meaningful Total non interest expense in 2006 increased $2.5 million, or 1%, compared to 2005, primarily reflecting higher compensation and benefits and lower professional and outside service fees. The improvement in Peoples efficiency ratio in 2006 reflects a $22.8 million, or 4%, increase in revenue. Total non interest expense in 2006 included the following items: severance related expenses totaling $1.6 million (recorded to compensation and benefits); a $0.3 million charge related to the sale of $25 million of securities purchased under agreements to resell as part of balance sheet restructuring activities (recorded to other non interest expense); and a $0.9 million charge related to the resolution of an RC Knox contingency (recorded to other non interest expense). Total non interest expense in 2005 included the following items: liability restructuring costs of $2.7 million; a $0.7 million charge related to the accelerated vesting of stock options (recorded to compensation and benefits); and a $2.0 million goodwill impairment charge. Excluding these expenses from the respective years, total non interest expense in 2006 would have increased $5.1 million, or 2%, compared to 2005. Compensation and benefits increased $6.5 million, or 3%, compared to the 2005 period, after excluding the items discussed above. The increase reflects the combination of normal merit increases, higher accruals for incentive compensation, and increased pension costs, partially offset by lower health care expenses. On September 29, 2006, Peoples contributed $91.5 million to its employee retirement plan, representing the maximum deductible contribution per Internal Revenue Service rules. Earnings on these contributions are expected to significantly reduce Peoples pension expense beginning in 2007. 55 Table of Contents Professional and outside service fees decreased $1.8 million, or 7%, compared to the 2005 period, reflecting lower utilization of information technology contractors and lower costs for Peoples declining national consumer loan portfolio, partially offset by higher legal costs related to Peoples conversion to a federal charter and costs related to infrastructure initiatives. The increase in other non interest expense compared to 2005 primarily reflects a $2.0 million increase in the amortization of equipment leased to PCLC customers, partially offset by lower operational charge offs. The $2.0 million goodwill impairment charge in 2005 related to the decision to combine Olson Mobeck Investment Advisors, Inc. with one of Peoples other businesses in the consumer financial services business segment. Total non interest expense in 2005 decreased $135.3 million, or 28%, compared to 2004. Included in total non interest expense were certain nonrecurring expenses totaling $0.7 million in 2005 and $9.3 million in 2004, liability restructuring costs of $2.7 million in 2005 and $133.4 million in 2004, as well as a $2.0 million goodwill impairment charge in 2005. Excluding these expenses from the respective years, total non interest expense would have increased $2.0 million, or 1%, in 2005 compared to 2004. The improvement in Peoples efficiency ratio in 2005 primarily reflects a $53.1 million, or 11%, increase in revenue. Included in compensation and benefits was a $0.7 million nonrecurring charge related to the accelerated vesting of stock options in 2005 and $6.7 million of nonrecurring expenses in 2004. Compensation and benefits increased $7.2 million, or 4%, compared to 2004, after excluding these nonrecurring expenses from both years. The increase reflects the combination of normal merit increases; higher accruals for incentives tied to overall bank performance; higher incentive compensation for revenue generating businesses and increased health care costs. Occupancy and equipment decreased $6.9 million in 2005 compared to 2004, reflecting a $3.2 million, or 14%, reduction in depreciation expense and a substantially higher level of costs incurred in 2004 to upgrade personal computers throughout the bank. Professional and outside service fees and other non interest expense included nonrecurring expenses of $0.4 million and $2.2 million, respectively, in 2004. 56 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, totaled $2.3 million in 2006, compared to $11.2 million in 2005 and $205.3 million in 2004. Included in income from discontinued operations was an after tax charge of $0.5 million in 2006 from the resolution of a contingency related to the sale of Peoples credit card business in 2004, after tax income of $6.2 million in 2005 from the resolution of a significant contingency related to the credit card sale and an after tax gain of $198.5 million in 2004 from the sale of the credit card business. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Peoples continues to generate recoveries from collection efforts on previously charged off credit card accounts that were not included in the sale of the credit card business. These recoveries are included in income from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Recoveries, net of collection costs, totaled $4.1 million, $7.7 million and $11.2 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The level of recoveries is expected to continue declining in 2007 due to the aging and diminishing pool of charged off accounts. 57 Table of Contents Income Taxes Income tax expense (benefit) from continuing operations totaled $57.8 million in 2006, compared to $64.1 million in 2005 and $(8.6) million in 2004. Income tax benefits of $2.4 million, $2.0 million and $4.0 million are included in income tax expense (benefit) from continuing operations in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These benefits relate to certain prior year tax matters, including the completion of federal tax audits in 2005 and 2004. Excluding these benefits from the respective years, Peoples effective income tax rate from continuing operations would have been 33.5% in 2006, 34.8% in 2005 and 32.4% in 2004. The lower effective income tax rate for 2006 compared to 2005 primarily reflects the higher level of tax exempt bank owned life insurance income earned in 2006. Income tax expense (benefit) for all three years reflects the state tax benefit resulting from the formation of Peoples Mortgage Investment Company, a wholly owned subsidiary. The formation of this subsidiary was a result of Connecticut tax legislation, which became effective on January 1, 1999, that allows for the transfer of mortgage loans to a passive investment subsidiary. The related earnings of the subsidiary, and any dividends it pays to the parent, are not subject to Connecticut income tax. 58 Table of Contents Earning Assets The discussion of earning assets has been grouped into Treasury, Consumer Financial Services and Commercial Banking.

Securities available for sale are used as part of Peoples asset/liability management strategy and may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, factors such as changes in market conditions and interest rates, changes in security prepayment rates, liquidity considerations and regulatory capital requirements. 59 Table of Contents Peoples primarily invests in debt securities rated in the four highest categories assigned by a nationally recognized statistical ratings organization. Management has internal guidelines for the credit quality and duration of Peoples debt securities portfolio and monitors these on a regular basis. Peoples strives to maintain an appropriate balance between loan portfolio growth and core deposit funding. Peoples management currently believes that, other than for transitional deployment of excess core deposits or excess equity, a large securities portfolio funded with wholesale borrowings provides limited economic value. As part of this focus, Peoples has reduced its securities portfolio by $3.2 billion since December 31, 2002 and increased its loans by $2.7 billion over the same period. Peoples has also reduced borrowings by $2.4 billion since year end 2002. During the second and third quarters of 2006, Peoples sold approximately $1.1 billion of debt securities as part of the restructuring of its balance sheet. Realized losses from these sales of $27.4 million are included in net security losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. In the second quarter of 2006, Peoples decided to exit a product line and cease purchasing federal funds from a group of smaller New England community banks. The sale of securities was undertaken to pay down the related borrowings. During the third quarter of 2006, Peoples completed the sale of substantially its entire remaining debt securities portfolio to better position its balance sheet for the prevailing interest rate environment. At December 31, 2006, Peoples securities portfolio totaled $78 million, or 1% of total assets, and wholesale borrowings totaled $4 million, or less than 0.5% of total assets, which represent ratios well below industry averages. At December 31, 2005, Peoples securities portfolio totaled $1.4 billion, a $708 million, or 34%, decline from year end 2004. The reduction in the securities portfolio in 2005 reflects the substitution of higher yielding loans for lower yielding securities as securities pay down and mature. The securities portfolio represented 14% of earning assets at December 31, 2005, compared to 21% at year end 2004, consistent with managements goal of reducing the percentage of securities to earning assets. 60 Table of Contents At December 31, 2006, the book value and the market value of the securities available for sale portfolio were approximately equivalent, compared to net unrealized losses of $28.9 million and $14.1 million at year end 2005 and 2004, respectively. The significant reduction in the unrealized loss in 2006 reflects the sale of securities during 2006 and the resulting significantly smaller securities portfolio. All unrealized gains and those unrealized losses representing temporary declines in value are recorded in stockholders equity, net of income taxes. As a result, management anticipates continued fluctuations in stockholders equity due to changes in the fair value of these securities, albeit on a much smaller scale due to the size and short duration of the portfolio. The duration of the debt securities portfolio was approximately 0.07 years at December 31, 2006, compared to 1.7 years at year end 2005. For a discussion of the regulatory capital treatment of unrealized gains and losses, see Capital on page 93. 61 Table of Contents Lending Activities Peoples conducts its lending activities through its two major business segments that constitute its core businesses: Consumer Financial Services and Commercial Banking. Peoples lending activities consist of originating loans secured by residential and commercial properties, and extending secured and unsecured loans to consumers and businesses. Total loans increased $799 million, or 9%, in 2006 compared to 2005, after increases of 8% in 2005 and 12% in 2004. The increase in 2006 reflects growth of $456 million, or 10%, in Consumer Financial Services and $343 million, or 9%, in Commercial Banking. The following table summarizes the loan portfolio. Amounts represent gross loans before deducting the allowance for loan losses.

(in millions) Fixed Adjustable Total Consumer Financial Services $ 369.4 $ 4,579.4 $ 4,948.8 Commercial Banking 1,629.0 1,916.8 3,545.8 Total loans due after one year $ 1,998.4 $ 6,496.2 $ 8,494.6 63 Table of Contents Consumer Financial Services Residential Mortgage Lending Peoples offers its customers a wide range of residential mortgage loan products. These include conventional fixed rate loans, jumbo fixed rate loans (loans with principal balances greater than established Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae limits), adjustable rate loans, sometimes referred to as ARM loans, interest only loans (loans where payments made by the borrower consist of only interest for a set period of time, before the payments change to principal and interest), as well as Federal Housing Authority insured loans and Connecticut Housing Finance Authority loans. Peoples originates these loans through its network of branches and calling officers, as well as in the wholesale market, which accounted for approximately 66%, 59% and 57% of Peoples mortgage loan originations for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, 92% and 97%, respectively, of the residential mortgage portfolio was secured by properties located in Connecticut. Included in residential mortgage loans are construction loans totaling $188 million and $197 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In 2006, Peoples Banks level of residential mortgage originations declined to $1.1 billion, compared to $1.4 billion in 2005 and $1.6 billion in 2004, consistent with industry wide trends attributable to rising interest rates. The mix and volume of residential mortgage loan originations vary in response to changes in market interest rates and customer preferences. Adjustable rate loans accounted for 77% of total residential mortgage originations in 2006, compared to 73% and 72% for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Overall, the volume of refinancings (approximately 41% of 2006 originations) was less than the volume of purchase mortgages as the upward movement in interest rates continues to make the refinancing market relatively less attractive for consumers. At December 31, 2006, the adjustable rate loan portfolio included $2.2 billion, or 57%, of interest only loans, compared to $1.6 billion, or 47%, at December 31, 2005. Peoples underwriting practices and credit review standards for such loans are consistent with those applied to other types of residential mortgage products. Peoples began originating interest only residential mortgage loans in March 2003. The underwriting guidelines and requirements are more restrictive for interest only loans than for amortizing adjustable rate mortgages. Properties must be a single family and owner occupied primary residence, loan to value ratios are lower, higher credit scores 64 Table of Contents are required, post closing reserves requirements are greater, and there are limits on cash out refinances as compared to amortizing adjustable rate mortgages. Amortization of an interest only loan begins after the initial interest rate change (e.g., after 5 years for a 5/1 adjustable rate mortgage). Adjustable rate residential loans at December 31, 2006 increased $395 million compared to year end 2005, while fixed rate mortgage loans decreased $3 million. Total adjustable rate residential loans increased $254 million in 2005 compared to year end 2004, while fixed rate mortgage loans decreased $13 million. The continued growth and performance of the residential mortgage loan portfolio in 2007 may be adversely impacted by the level and direction of interest rates, consumer preferences and the regional economy. Historically, Peoples has held virtually all of the adjustable rate residential mortgage loans that it originates on its balance sheet and has sold virtually all of the fixed rate residential mortgage loans that it originates into the secondary market. Peoples has recently reassessed its pricing with respect to adjustable rate residential mortgage loans in light of the prevailing interest rate environment. As a result, Peoples believes the level of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans it originates will be reduced significantly in the near term. Peoples intends to continue to actively offer residential mortgage loans of all types through its extensive distribution system. However, if a reduction in originations occurs and continues for an extended period, the balance of Peoples residential mortgage loan portfolio will decline. 65 Table of Contents Residential Mortgage Originations Years ended December 31 (in millions) Residential Mortgage Originations by Product Year ended December 31, 2006 (percent) 66 Table of Contents Consumer Lending As of December 31 (in millions) 2006 2005 Home equity credit lines $ 1,010.8 $ 1,027.8 Second mortgages 279.8 184.5 Personal installment loans 14.1 25.8 Other loans 16.6 19.4 Total consumer $ 1,321.3 $ 1,257.5 Peoples offers Connecticut based customers home equity credit lines and second mortgage loans, and to a lesser extent, other forms of installment and revolving credit loans. In the first quarter of 2006, Peoples began offering home equity credit lines and loans in Massachusetts and New York. Consumer loans also include unsecured personal installment loans that had been originated nationally in prior years and totaled under $1 million at December 31, 2006, compared to $12 million and $46 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Future growth of Peoples consumer loan portfolio is highly dependent upon economic conditions, the interest rate environment and competitors strategies, as well as the success of Peoples marketing programs and information based strategies. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, approximately 99% and 98%, respectively, of the consumer loan portfolio was to customers located in Connecticut. The increase in consumer loans reflects growth in home equity lending, partially offset by continued declines in national unsecured personal installment loans, which continue to run off as a result of a management decision to discontinue this type of lending. Home equity credit lines decreased $17 million, or 2%, since year end 2005, after increasing $114 million, or 12%, during 2005 and $288 million, or 46%, during 2004. The slower rate of portfolio growth in an interest rate environment characterized by higher short term interest rates reflects nationwide trends. 67 Table of Contents Commercial Banking The Commercial Banking lending businesses include commercial real estate finance, commercial and industrial lending and equipment financing by PCLC. Shared national credits are included in the commercial real estate finance and commercial and industrial lending portfolios. Commercial Real Estate Finance As of December 31 (in millions) 2006 2005 Property Type: Residential $ 513.6 $ 439.9 Retail 390.7 435.0 Office buildings 360.0 367.1 Industrial/manufacturing 184.8 202.9 Self storage/industrial 97.8 84.9 Hospitality and entertainment 61.8 90.1 Land 61.4 44.8 Health care 53.9 47.0 Special use 47.4 52.3 Other properties 15.3 14.3 Total commercial real estate finance $ 1,786.7 $ 1,778.3 Peoples manages the commercial real estate finance portfolio by limiting the concentration in any loan type, term, industry, or to any individual borrower. Historically, Peoples primary strategy has been to focus on lending in the state of Connecticut and adjacent states that represent its home market. In addition, Peoples will purchase interests in out of state loan participations. Included in commercial real estate finance loans are shared national credits totaling $209 million, $143 million and $105 million at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Peoples highest loan concentration in the commercial real estate finance loan portfolio was in the residential sector, which represented 29% of this loan portfolio at December 31, 2006, compared to 25% at December 31, 2005 and 17% at year end 2004. Much of the growth in the residential sector was due to increases totaling $86 million, or 117%, for 2006 and $70 million, or 52% for 2005 in shared national credits. 68 Table of Contents Commercial Real Estate Finance Portfolio As of December 31 (dollars in millions) At December 31, 2006, approximately 68% of Peoples commercial real estate finance portfolio was secured by properties located in Connecticut, compared to approximately 74% at December 31, 2005. Included in this portfolio are construction loans totaling $541 million, $512 million and $429 million at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Commercial real estate finance is dependent on the successful operation of the related income producing real estate. Accordingly, the income streams generated by this portfolio can be impacted by changes in the real estate market and, to a large extent, Connecticuts economy. The commercial real estate finance portfolio increased slightly (0.5%) in 2006 and decreased 3% in 2005 after growing 8% in 2004. The slow growth in 2006 and decrease in 2005 reflects the high level of loan prepayments during this period and Peoples focus on maintaining strong asset quality standards in a competitive market generally characterized by aggressive pricing and less attractive underwriting terms. The growth and performance of this portfolio is largely dependent on the economic environment in Connecticut and may be adversely impacted if the economy slows in 2007. 69 Table of Contents Commercial Real Estate Finance Diversification As of December 31, 2006 (percent) 70 Table of Contents Commercial and Industrial Lending As of December 31 (in millions) 2006 2005 Industry: Manufacturing $ 412.1 $ 414.7 Finance, insurance and real estate 354.7 330.4 Service 230.2 208.0 Wholesale distribution 119.9 127.0 Retail sales 113.6 103.6 Health services 108.5 91.9 Arts/entertainment/recreation 61.8 30.7 Transportation/utility 26.4 24.8 Other 66.6 63.4 Total commercial and industrial lending $ 1,493.8 $ 1,394.5 Peoples provides diversified products and services to its commercial customers, including short term working capital credit facilities, term financing, asset based loans, letters of credit, cash management services and commercial deposit accounts. Commercial products are generally packaged together to create a financing solution specifically tailored to the needs of the customer. Taking a total relationship focused approach with commercial customers to meet their financing needs has resulted in substantial growth in non interest bearing deposits over time, as well as in opportunities to provide other banking services to principals and employees of these commercial customers. The borrowers ability to repay a commercial loan is closely tied to the ongoing profitability and cash flow of the borrowers business. Consequently, a commercial loan tends to be more directly impacted by changes in economic cycles that affect businesses generally and the borrowers business specifically. The availability of adequate collateral is a factor in commercial loan decisions, and loans are generally collateralized and or guaranteed by third parties. In 2006, the commercial and industrial lending portfolio increased $100 million, or 7%, compared to increases of $159 million, or 13%, in 2005 and $201 million or 19% in 2004. The increase in 2006 includes a $47 million, or 15%, increase in shared national credits, compared to an increase of $61 million, or 24%, for the full year of 2005. Included in commercial lending are shared national credits totaling $368 million, $321 million and $260 million at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. At December 31, 2006, approximately 66% of the commercial loan portfolio consisted of loans to Connecticut based businesses, compared to approximately 69% and 72% at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The manufacturing sector remains Peoples highest commercial loan concentration. While Peoples continues to focus on asset quality, the performance of the commercial lending portfolio may be adversely impacted if the economy slows in 2007. 71 Table of Contents Commercial and Industrial Lending Diversification As of December 31, 2006 (percent) Commercial and Industrial Lending Portfolio As of December 31 (dollars in millions) 72 Table of Contents Shared National Credits At December 31, 2006, the shared national credits loan portfolio totaled $577 million, compared to $464 million and $365 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and represented 14%, 12% and 10% of the total Commercial Banking loan portfolio at the respective dates. As discussed above, included in the shared national credits portfolio at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were commercial loans totaling $368 million, $321 million and $260 million, respectively, and commercial real estate finance loans totaling $209 million, $143 million and $105 million, respectively. Peoples will purchase, and to a lesser extent sell, interests in shared national credits from and to other financial institutions having comparable asset quality standards. At December 31, 2006, the shared national credits loan portfolio included $562 million in loans purchased from other financial institutions and $15 million in loans originated by Peoples. At December 31, 2006, approximately $67 million, or 12%, of the shared national credits loan portfolio is to borrowers who are headquartered in Connecticut, while approximately $288 million, or 50%, is to borrowers located in California, Florida and New York. Peoples may grow this portfolio to represent approximately 15% of the overall Commercial Banking loan portfolio. 73 Table of Contents PCLC As of December 31 (in millions) 2006 2005 Industry: Printing $ 308.9 $ 263.0 Transportation/utility 209.5 100.3 General manufacturing 141.6 118.0 Retail sales 85.7 41.5 Packaging 76.7 63.8 Service 28.2 26.1 Wholesale distribution 12.4 12.4 Health services 6.8 8.5 Finance, insurance and real estate 1.1 Total PCLC $ 869.8 $ 634.7 PCLC provides equipment financing for customers in 48 states, specializing in financing for the printing, transportation/utility, general manufacturing, retail sales and packaging industries. PCLC will buy or sell portions of financing transactions in the secondary market to manage the concentration risk of the overall portfolio. At December 31, 2006, approximately 2% of the portfolio consisted of loans to Connecticut based businesses, while approximately 39% were loans to customers located in California, Texas, Illinois and Florida. The PCLC portfolio grew $235 million, or 37%, in 2006, after increasing $182 million, or 40%, in 2005 and $153 million, or 51%, in 2004, reflecting managements decision to grow this portfolio. Operating on a national scale, PCLC represented 21% of the Commercial Banking loan portfolio at December 31, 2006, compared to 17% and 13% at year end 2005 and 2004, respectively. Based on the level of growth in this portfolio, the percentage increase in 2007 may not continue at recent levels. 74 Table of Contents PCLC Diversification As of December 31, 2006 (percent) PCLC Loan Portfolio As of December 31 (dollars in millions) 75 Table of Contents Asset Quality Peoples actively manages asset quality through its underwriting practices and collection operations. Underwriting practices tend to focus on optimizing the return of a given risk classification while collection operations focus on minimizing losses once an account becomes delinquent. The allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses charged to income. Losses on loans, including impaired loans, are charged to the allowance for loan losses when all or a portion of a loan is deemed to be uncollectible. Recoveries of loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance for loan losses when realized. Peoples maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that is believed to be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio, based on a quarterly evaluation of a variety of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to: Peoples historical loan loss experience and recent trends in that experience; risk ratings assigned by lending personnel to commercial real estate finance, commercial and PCLC loans, and the results of ongoing reviews of those ratings by Peoples independent loan review function; an evaluation of non performing loans and related collateral values; the probability of loss in view of geographic and industry concentrations and other portfolio risk characteristics; the present financial condition of borrowers; and current economic conditions. While Peoples seeks to use the best available information to make these evaluations, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions, results of regulatory examinations, further information obtained regarding known problem loans, the identification of additional problem loans and other factors. 76 Table of Contents Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses The following table presents the activity in the allowance for loan losses and ratios: Years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Beginning allowance for loan losses $ 75.0 $ 72.5 $ 70.5 $ 69.2 $ 73.7 Charge offs: Commercial (5.2 ) (0.9 ) (0.6 ) (1.2 ) (3.4 ) Consumer (3.4 ) (4.9 ) (9.7 ) (16.8 ) (25.3 ) PCLC (0.6 ) (3.1 ) (1.5 ) (2.0 ) (2.4 ) Commercial real estate finance (0.1 ) (3.2 ) Residential mortgage (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.2 ) (0.1 ) Total charge offs (9.3 ) (9.1 ) (15.2 ) (20.1 ) (31.1 ) Recoveries: Commercial 0.4 0.4 0.3 1.4 0.7 Consumer 1.6 2.0 2.8 2.9 2.6 PCLC 0.3 0.3 0.5 0.1 0.1 Commercial real estate finance 2.5 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.6 Residential mortgage 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.1 0.4 Total recoveries 4.9 3.0 3.9 4.7 4.4 Net loan charge offs (4.4 ) (6.1 ) (11.3 ) (15.4 ) (26.7 ) Provision for loan losses 3.4 8.6 13.3 16.7 22.2 Ending allowance for loan losses $ 74.0 $ 75.0 $ 72.5 $ 70.5 $ 69.2 Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans 0.79 % 0.87 % 0.91 % 0.99 % 1.04 % Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non performing loans 327.9 352.5 264.6 208.4 198.2 The provision for loan losses in 2006 totaled $3.4 million, a $5.2 million, or 60%, reduction compared to $8.6 million for 2005. The 2006 period reflects $4.4 million in net loan charge offs, partially offset by a $1.0 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses. The 2005 period reflected net loan charge offs of $6.1 million and a $2.5 million increase in the allowance for loan losses. Net loan charge offs decreased $1.7 million, or 28%, for 2006, compared to 2005. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.79% at December 31, 2006 and 0.87% at December 31, 2005. Commercial loan net charge offs reflect a $4.0 million charge off in the third quarter of 2006 relating to one commercial banking loan that was placed on non accrual status in the second quarter of 2006 as previously disclosed. Commercial real estate finance net recoveries reflect a $2.3 million cash recovery in the first quarter of 2006 on one non performing loan that was resolved. 77 Table of Contents Consumer loan net charge offs decreased $1.2 million, or 39%, during 2006, reflecting a $1.9 million decrease in national consumer loan net charge offs, partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in home equity loan net charge offs and a $0.5 million increase in charge offs related to consumer overdrafts that were previously reported in non interest expense through the second quarter of 2005. The average national consumer loan portfolio decreased $21 million, or 81%, on a year over year basis and totaled slightly less than $1 million at December 31, 2006. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average total loans equaled 0.05% for 2006, down from 0.07% for 2005, reflecting the $1.7 million decrease in net loan charge offs and the impact on the ratio of a $715 million, or 9%, increase in average loans, both as compared to 2005. The very low level of net loan charge offs in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of average loans is unlikely to be sustainable in the future. The provision for loan losses decreased $4.7 million in 2005 compared to 2004, reflecting lower net loan charge offs in 2005, partially offset by a $2.5 million increase in the allowance for loan losses in 2005, compared to a $2.0 million increase in the allowance for loan losses in 2004. Net loan charge offs in 2005 declined $5.2 million, or 46%, compared to 2004. Consumer loan net charge offs decreased $4.0 million, or 58%, reflecting a 72% decrease in the dollar amount of national consumer loan net charge offs given a $60 million, or 70%, reduction in this portfolios average balances during 2005. The increase in PCLC loan net charge offs in 2005 reflects a $2.3 million charge off related to one loan. Commercial real estate finance loan net charge offs in 2004 reflected a $3.2 million charge off related to one shared national credit that had been classified as non performing since 2002. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average total loans decreased 8 basis points to 0.07% in 2005 compared to 0.15% in 2004. In addition to the $5.2 million decrease in net loan charge offs, the improvement in the net loan charge off ratio reflected an $836 million, or 11%, increase in average total loans.

These decreases were partially offset by an increase to the allowance for loan losses and a corresponding increase to the provision for loan losses by $3.0 million for the PCLC loan portfolio (reflecting loan growth) and by $2.0 million for the commercial loan portfolio (reflecting loan growth and ratings downgrades) during 2006. As a result of these changes, the total allowance for loan losses declined by $1.0 million in 2006. A loan is classified as non accrual generally when it becomes 90 days past due as to interest or principal payments. All previously accrued but unpaid interest on non accrual loans is reversed from interest income in the current period. Interest payments received on non accrual loans (including impaired loans) are generally applied as a reduction of principal if future collections are doubtful, although such interest payments may be recognized as income. A loan remains on non accrual status until the factors that indicated doubtful collectibility no longer exist or until a loan is determined to be uncollectible and is charged off against the allowance for loan losses. The classification of a loan as non performing does not necessarily indicate that loan principal and interest ultimately will not be collected. 79 Table of Contents Peoples historical experience suggests that a portion of these assets will eventually be recovered. All non performing loans are in various stages of collection, workout, settlement or foreclosure. When loan workout efforts are exhausted and it is determined that the borrower is unable to repay the obligation, Peoples will complete foreclosure procedures, if applicable. Restructured commercial and commercial real estate finance loans are those for which concessions to below market terms, such as below market interest rates or deferral of interest, have been granted due to the borrowers financial condition. Non Performing Assets The following table presents information regarding non accrual loans, restructured loans, real estate owned and repossessed assets: As of December 31 (dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Non accrual loans: Commercial $ 11.9 $ 1.3 $ 5.2 $ 3.3 $ 4.8 Residential mortgage 6.7 6.7 7.5 11.4 13.2 PCLC 2.1 6.2 5.1 4.2 3.3 Consumer 1.7 1.3 0.9 2.5 3.4 Commercial real estate finance 0.2 5.8 8.7 11.4 10.2 Total non accrual loans 22.6 21.3 27.4 32.8 34.9 Restructured loans 1.0 Total non performing loans 22.6 21.3 27.4 33.8 34.9 Real estate owned (REO) and repossessed assets, net 0.1 0.7 1.2 0.5 0.7 Total non performing assets $ 22.7 $ 22.0 $ 28.6 $ 34.3 $ 35.6 Non performing loans as a percentage of total loans 0.24 % 0.25 % 0.35 % 0.48 % 0.52 % Non performing assets as a percentage of total loans, REO and repossessed assets 0.24 0.26 0.36 0.48 0.53 Non performing assets as a percentage of stockholders equity and allowance for loan losses 1.61 1.62 2.25 3.20 3.53 Non performing assets totaled $22.7 million at December 31, 2006, an increase of $0.7 million, or 3%, compared to December 31, 2005 and improved 2 basis points to 0.24% of total loans, real estate owned and repossessed assets at December 31, 2006. The slight increase in non performing assets during 2006 reflects increases in non performing commercial loans of $10.6 million, partially offset by a $5.6 million reduction in non performing commercial real estate finance loans and a $4.1 million reduction in PCLC non performing loans. The net increase in non performing commercial loans since December 31, 2005 reflects one $10.6 million loan classified as non performing in the fourth quarter of 2006. The net decrease in non performing commercial real estate finance loans since December 31, 2005 reflects one $5.5 million loan that was resolved in the first quarter of 80 Table of Contents 2006 and generated a $2.3 million cash recovery. Additional activity in non performing commercial real estate finance loans during 2006 included one $12.1 million loan that was classified as non performing in the first quarter of 2006 and subsequently repaid in full through payments received in the third and fourth quarters of 2006. Total non performing assets at December 31, 2005 decreased $6.6 million, or 23%, from December 31, 2004 and improved 10 basis points to 0.26% of total loans, real estate owned and repossessed assets at December 31, 2005. Reductions of $3.9 million and $2.9 million in non performing commercial and commercial real estate finance loans, respectively, were partially offset by an increase of $1.1 million in non performing PCLC loans. The level of non performing assets is expected to fluctuate in response to changing economic and market conditions, and the relative sizes of the respective loan portfolios, along with managements degree of success in resolving problem assets. At December 31, 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002, Peoples portfolio did not include any loans, not included in the table above, which are troubled debt restructurings as defined in SFAS No. 15, Accounting by Debtors and Creditors for Troubled Debt Restructurings. As of December 31, 2006, if all non accruing loans had been current in accordance with their terms and had been outstanding throughout 2006 or since origination if held for part of the year, the gross interest income that would have been recorded in 2006 on such loans would have amounted to approximately $1.9 million. The amount of interest income on the non accruing loans included in net income in 2006 was $0.7 million. 81 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Detailed discussions pertaining to Peoples off balance sheet arrangements are included in the following sections: Funding, Liquidity, Capital and Market Risk Management. Funding At the current time, Peoples primary funding sources are deposits and stockholders equity, which represent 98% of total assets at December 31, 2006. Borrowings, while less than 0.5% of total assets at December 31, 2006, are an available source of funding. Based on the Banks membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston and the level of qualifying collateral available at December 31, 2006, Peoples had up to $3.5 billion of borrowing capacity. Peoples also had unsecured borrowing capacity of $1.1 billion at December 31, 2006.

Peoples provides customers access to their deposits through 77 traditional branches, 74 full service Stop & Shop supermarket branches, seven limited service branches, over 250 ATMs, telephone banking and an Internet banking site that is fully integrated with Peoples brokerage subsidiary, PSI. 82 Table of Contents Core deposits equaled 84% and 81% of total assets at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Core deposits and stockholders equity constituted over 98% of Peoples funding base at December 31, 2006 and over 94% at December 31, 2005. The expansion of Peoples branch network and its commitment to developing full service relationships with its customers are integral components of Peoples strategy to leverage the success of its supermarket banking initiative, expand market share and continue growing deposits. At December 31, 2006, Peoples statewide network of Stop & Shop branches held deposits totaling $2.1 billion and deposits in supermarket branches open for more than one year averaged $30 million per store. In 2006, Peoples announced plans to expand into New York State by opening at least 15 new traditional branches in Westchester County over the next three years. Seven of these branches are expected to be opened by the end of 2007. Peoples also plans to continue its branch expansion in Connecticut by opening new both traditional and Stop & Shop branches. Non interest bearing deposits are an important source of low cost funding and fee income for Peoples. In addition, Peoples believes that checking accounts represent one of the core relationships between a financial institution and its customers, and it is from these relationships that cross selling of other financial services can be achieved. Non interest bearing core deposits equaled 24% and 25% of core deposits at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Time deposits of $100,000 or more totaled $889 million at December 31, 2006, of which $247 million mature within three months, $364 million mature after three months but within six months, $241 million mature after six months but within one year and $37 million mature after one year. There were no brokered certificates of deposit at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Commercial deposits fund a significant portion of the loan portfolio. Average non interest bearing commercial deposits totaled $939 million in 2006, a $43 million, or 5%, decrease compared to 2005, after increasing $43 million, or 5%, in 2005 and $64 million, or 7%, in 2004. The decrease in 2006 is reflective of the current interest rate environment. 83 Table of Contents The following table presents, by rate category, time deposits as of December 31, 2006 and 2005.

Peoples uses federal funds purchased as a source of funds, which are typically unsecured overnight loans among banks. Sources include three of the twelve regional Federal Home Loan Banks and several money center and large regional banks. Federal funds purchased represented less than 0.5% of total assets at December 31, 2006 and 2% of total assets at December 31, 2005. In previous years, Peoples primary source for borrowings was advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, which provides credit for member institutions within its assigned region. Peoples outstanding Federal Home Loan Bank advances at December 31, 2005 represented less than one half of one percent of total assets. At December 31, 2006, there were no outstanding Federal Home Loan Bank advances. The average balances of Peoples advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston during 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $47 million, $50 million and $176 million, respectively, and the maximum Federal Home Loan Bank advances outstanding during 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $155 million, $190 million and $849 million, respectively. Another source of funds in previous years has been repurchase agreements. These transactions involve the sale of securities to broker/dealers under agreements to repurchase the same (or substantially the same) securities. Repurchase agreements with broker/dealers are limited to Reporting Federal Reserve Dealers in government securities that have been approved by Peoples Board of Directors. 85 Table of Contents Subordinated Notes At December 31, 2006, Peoples had $65 million of 9.875% subordinated notes outstanding. Subordinated notes totaled $109 million at December 31, 2005. Peoples repaid $44 million of 7.20% subordinated notes that matured on December 1, 2006. Peoples repurchased $14 million of its 9.875% subordinated notes in 2005. The 9.875% subordinated notes are due in 2010 and are unsecured general obligations of Peoples with interest payable semi annually, are subordinated to the claims of depositors and Peoples other creditors and are not redeemable prior to maturity. They qualify, up to certain limits, as supplementary (tier 2) capital for risk based capital purposes. 86 Table of Contents Contractual Cash Obligations The following table is a summary of Peoples contractual cash obligations, other than deposit liabilities, including operating leases. Additional information concerning these contractual cash obligations is included in Notes 9, 10 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase obligations included in the table represent those agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions. A substantial majority of Peoples purchase obligations are renewable on a year to year basis. As such, the purchase obligations included in this table only reflect the contractual commitment.

Liquidity management addresses Peoples ability to fund new loans and investments as opportunities arise, to meet customer deposit withdrawals and to repay borrowings and subordinated notes as they mature. Peoples liquidity position is monitored daily by management. The Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO) is responsible for setting guidelines to ensure maintenance of prudent levels of liquidity. Asset liquidity is provided by: cash; short term investments; proceeds from security sales, maturities and principal repayments; and proceeds from scheduled principal collections, prepayments and sales of loans. In addition, certain securities may be used to collateralize borrowings under repurchase agreements. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows present data on cash provided by and used in Peoples operating, investing and financing activities. At December 31, 2006, Peoples liquid assets included $30 million in trading account securities, $569 million in cash and cash equivalents, and $26 million in debt securities available for sale. At December 31, 2006, Peoples had pledged securities available for sale with a total fair value of $22 million as collateral for public deposits and for other purposes. Liability liquidity is measured by Peoples ability to obtain core deposits and purchased funds at cost effective rates that are diversified with respect to markets and maturities. Core deposits, which are considered the most stable source of liability liquidity, totaled $9.0 billion at December 31, 2006 , compared to $8.9 billion at December 31, 2005 (representing 85% and 82% of total funding at the respective dates). Purchased funds are used from time to time to diversify Peoples funding mix and to support asset growth. Peoples purchased funds totaled $47 million at December 31, 2006 and $0.4 billion at December 31, 2005 (representing 0.5% and 4% of total funding at the respective dates). Peoples current sources of purchased funds include: federal funds purchased, advances from the FHLB of Boston and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, municipal deposits and repurchase agreements. At December 31, 2006, Peoples borrowing limit from FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank advances and repurchase agreements was $3.5 billion, based on the level of qualifying collateral available for these borrowing sources. In addition, Peoples had unsecured borrowing capacity of $1.1 billion at December 31, 2006. 88 Table of Contents At December 31, 2006, Peoples had outstanding commitments to originate loans totaling $853 million and approved, but unused, lines of credit extended to customers totaling $2.3 billion. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The sources of liquidity discussed above are deemed by management to be sufficient to fund outstanding loan commitments and to meet Peoples other obligations. Earning Asset Mix $9.7 billion as of December 31, 2006 Funding Base $10.5 billion as of December 31, 2006 89 Table of Contents Capital Peoples total stockholders equity was $1.34 billion at December 31, 2006, a $51 million net increase from December 31, 2005, reflecting net income of $124.0 million, partially offset by dividends paid in 2006 of $60 million and a $25 million increase in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) since December 31, 2005. The net increase in AOCL primarily reflects a $40 million after tax increase from the adoption of SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, effective December 31, 2006, partially offset by a $19 million reduction in the net unrealized loss on securities available for sale due to the sales of securities previously discussed. Peoples total stockholders equity was $1.29 billion at December 31, 2005, an $89 million net increase compared to $1.20 billion at December 31, 2004. This increase primarily reflects net income of $137.1 million and net stock option related activity totaling $15 million, partially offset by dividends paid of $52 million and an $11 million increase in AOCL since December 31, 2004. The increase in AOCL primarily reflects a $10 million increase in the after tax net unrealized loss on securities available for sale in response to rising interest rates. Dividends declared and paid per common share (other than shares on which Holdings waived receipt of dividends) were $0.97, $0.85 and $0.75 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Peoples dividend payout ratio (dividends paid as a percentage of net income) in 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 48.3%, 38.3% and 22.9%, respectively. Stockholders equity equaled 12.5% of total assets at December 31, 2006, compared to 11.8% at December 31, 2005. Capital Requirements. OTS capital regulations require federally chartered savings banks, such as Peoples, to meet three minimum capital ratios: Tangible Capital Ratio A 1.5% tangible capital ratio, calculated as tangible capital to adjusted total assets. Leverage (Core) Capital Ratio A 4% leverage (core) capital ratio, calculated as core capital to adjusted total assets. The minimum leverage (core) capital ratio is reduced to 3% if the savings bank received the highest rating on its most recent safety and soundness examination. Risk Based Capital Ratio An 8% total risk based capital ratio, calculated as total capital to risk weighted assets. For purposes of this calculation, total capital includes core and supplementary capital, provided that supplementary capital may not exceed 100% of core capital. 90 Table of Contents In assessing an institutions capital adequacy, the OTS takes into consideration not only these numeric factors but also qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where necessary. Peoples, as a matter of prudent management, targets as its goal the maintenance of capital ratios which exceed these minimum requirements and that are consistent with Peoples risk profile. The following summary compares Peoples regulatory capital amounts and ratios to OTS minimum requirements as of December 31, 2006. Peoples adjusted total assets, as defined, totaled $10.7 billion at December 31, 2006 and Peoples risk weighted assets, as defined, totaled $8.6 billion at December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, Peoples exceeded each of its capital requirements. As of December 31, 2006 Peoples OTS Minimum Requirements (dollars in millions) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Tangible capital $ 1,278.4 (1) 12.0 % $ 159.8 1.5 % Leverage (core) capital 1,278.4 (1) 12.0 426.2 4.0 Total risk based capital 1,389.7 (2) 16.1 689.5 8.0 (1) Represents total stockholders equity, excluding (i) after tax net unrealized gains (losses) on debt and certain equity securities classified as available for sale, (ii) after tax net unrealized losses on derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges, (iii) certain assets not recognized in tier 1 capital (principally goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles), and (iv) the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income relating to SFAS No. 158. (2) Represents tier 1 capital plus subordinated notes, up to certain limits, and the allowance for loan losses up to 1.25% of risk adjusted total assets. Peoples regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2006 exceeded the OTS numeric criteria for classification as well capitalized. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning Peoples regulatory capital amounts and ratios. 91 Table of Contents 92 Table of Contents Market Risk Management Market risk is the risk of loss to earnings, capital and the fair market values of certain assets and liabilities resulting from changes in interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. Interest Rate Risk For Peoples, the only relevant market risk at this time is interest rate risk (IRR), which is the potential exposure to earnings or capital that may result from changes in interest rates. Peoples actively manages its IRR to achieve a balance between risk, earnings volatility and capital preservation. ALCO has primary responsibility for managing Peoples IRR and reports to the Treasury and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. To evaluate Peoples IRR profile, ALCO monitors economic conditions, interest rate trends, liquidity levels and capital ratios. Management also reviews assumptions periodically for projected customer and competitor behavior, in addition to the expected repricing characteristics and cash flow projections for assets, liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments. Actual conditions may vary significantly from Peoples assumptions. Management evaluates the impact of IRR on Income at Risk using an earnings simulation model to project earnings under multiple interest rate environments over a one year time horizon resulting in a quantification of IRR. Income at Risk includes significant interest rate sensitive income sources, such as net interest income, gains on sales of residential mortgage loans and BOLI income. The earnings projections are based on a static balance sheet and estimates of pricing levels for Peoples products under multiple scenarios intended to reflect instantaneous yield curve shocks. Peoples estimates its base case Income at Risk using current interest rates. Internal guidelines regarding IRR simulation specify that for instantaneous parallel shifts of the yield curve, estimated Income at Risk for the subsequent one year period should not decline by more than: 10% for a 100 basis point shift; 15% for a 200 basis point shift; and 20% for a 300 basis point shift. 93 Table of Contents The following table shows the estimated percentage increase (decrease) in Peoples Income at Risk over a one year simulation period beginning December 31, 2006. Given the slope of the yield curve at December 31, 2006, simulations for declines in interest rates below 300 basis points were not meaningful. Rate Change (basis points) Percent Change in Income at Risk +300 7.46% +200 5.41 +100 2.88 100 (3.11) 200 (7.55) 300 (15.97) While Income at Risk simulation identifies earnings exposure over a relatively short time horizon, Market Value of Equity (MVE) takes a long term economic perspective when quantifying IRR. MVE identifies possible margin behavior over a longer time horizon and is therefore a valuable complement of interest rate risk management. Base case MVE is calculated by estimating the net present value of all future cash flows from existing assets and liabilities using current interest rates. The base case scenario assumes that future interest rates remain unchanged. Internal guidelines limit the exposure of a decrease in MVE resulting from instantaneous parallel shifts of the yield curve in the following manner: for 100 basis points 10% of base case MVE; for 200 basis points 15% of base case MVE; and for 300 basis points 20% of base case MVE. The following table shows the estimated percentage decrease in Peoples MVE, assuming various shifts in interest rates. Given the slope of the yield curve at December 31, 2006, simulations for declines in interest rates below 300 basis points were not meaningful. Rate Change (basis points) Percent Change in Market Value of Equity +300 (6.31)% +200 (3.65) +100 (1.47) 100 (0.82) 200 (3.54) 300 (6.64) Management believes Peoples interest rate risk position at December 31, 2006 represents an acceptable level of risk. However, given the uncertainty of the magnitude, timing and direction of future interest rate movements and the shape of the yield curve, actual results may vary from those predicted by Peoples models. 94 Table of Contents Peoples uses derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps and interest rate floors, as components of its IRR management. Peoples has written guidelines that have been approved by the Board of Directors and ALCO governing the use of these financial instruments, including approved counterparties and risk limits, and controls the credit risk of these instruments through collateral, credit approvals and monitoring procedures. At December 31, 2006, each of Peoples counterparties had an investment grade credit rating from the major rating agencies and is specifically approved up to a maximum credit exposure. Derivative financial instruments have been used for market risk management purposes (principally interest rate risk) and not for trading or speculative purposes. Peoples is currently using interest rate swaps and interest rate floors to manage IRR associated with certain interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Interest rate swaps, which are accounted for as fair value hedges, are used to match more closely the repricing of certain commercial real estate finance loans and the funding associated with these loans. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the funding liabilities from a variable interest rate into a fixed interest rate and consequently reduce Peoples exposure to increases in interest rates and their effect on interest income and interest expense. Peoples is currently using interest rate floors to partially manage its exposure to a decrease in interest income resulting from declines in certain interest rates. These interest rate floors, which are accounted for as cash flow hedges, offer protection against a decline in interest income if the one month LIBOR index rate used to reprice certain floating rate commercial loans declines below the strike rate on the interest rate floors. If the one month LIBOR index rate falls below the specified strike rate, Peoples would receive an interest payment on the interest rate floor equal to the difference between the one month LIBOR index rate on the reset date and the strike rate, which in effect, would offset the decline in interest income earned on the hedged floating rate commercial loans from the decline in interest rates. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign exchange forward contracts are commitments to buy or sell foreign currency on a future date at a contractual price. Peoples uses these instruments on a limited basis to eliminate its exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates on certain of its commercial loans that are denominated in foreign currencies. Gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts substantially offset the translation gains and losses on the related loans. 95 Table of Contents Derivative Financial Instruments The following table summarizes certain information concerning derivative financial instruments utilized by Peoples in its management of IRR.

That process also resulted in the formation of Peoples Mutual Holdings (Holdings), a mutual form financial holding company that is subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. At December 31, 2006, Holdings owned 82.0 million shares of Peoples common stock, representing 57.7% of the total number of outstanding shares of Peoples common stock. By virtue of its ownership of a majority of Peoples outstanding shares, Holdings is able to elect all of the members of the Board of Directors of Peoples and will generally be able to significantly affect the outcome of all matters presented for consideration by the shareholders of Peoples. Holdings is different in significant aspects from an ordinary financial holding company or a bank holding company. Holdings is a corporation without shares of capital stock, and Holdings Articles of Incorporation require its Board of Trustees to consider the impact of its actions on a variety of constituencies in making certain business decisions. These include the depositors, employees and debtholders of Peoples, and the well being of the communities in which Peoples conducts business, but do not include Peoples shareholders. Thus, Holdings will act in a manner that furthers the general interests of these various constituencies. Since its formation in 1988, Holdings has consistently waived the receipt of cash dividends on substantially all of the shares of Peoples common stock it owns. The Board of Directors of Peoples establishes the rate at which dividends are declared with advance knowledge of the amount of dividends to be waived by Holdings. No dividends are declared on shares for which Holdings waives the dividend. If dividends had actually been declared and paid on all outstanding shares of Peoples common stock at the same rate as was declared and paid on shares not subject to the waiver, Holdings would have received additional dividends of approximately $78 million in 2006. There can be no assurance that Holdings will continue to waive the receipt of cash dividends in any future period, and Holdings retains the right to accept payment of future cash dividends on all of the Peoples common stock it owns, at its discretion. 97 Table of Contents On September 20, 2006, Peoples and Holdings announced their plan to convert from a mutual holding company structure to a fully public stock holding company structure. The Boards of Holdings and Peoples have adopted a Plan of Conversion and Reorganization (the Plan). The transactions contemplated by the Plan are subject to approval by Peoples stockholders, its depositors and the OTS. On February 14, 2007, the OTS gave its conditional approval to the Plan. Special meetings of Peoples stockholders and depositors to approve the Plan are scheduled for April 5, 2007. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 98 Table of Contents Forward Looking Statements Periodic and other filings made by Peoples with the OTS (with the FDIC prior to the charter conversion on August 18, 2006) pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 may from time to time contain information and statements that are forward looking in nature. Such filings include the Annual Report to Shareholders, Form 10 K, Form 10 Q and Form 8 K, and may include other forms such as proxy statements. Other written or oral statements made by Peoples or its representatives from time to time may also contain forward looking statements. In general, forward looking statements usually use words such as may, believe, expect, anticipate, should, plan, estimate, predict, continue and potential or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Examples of forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, estimates with respect to Peoples financial condition, results of operations and business that are subject to various factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates. Forward looking statements represent managements beliefs, based upon information available at the time the statements are made, with regard to the matters addressed; they are not guarantees of future performance. All forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause Peoples actual results or financial condition to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such statements. Factors of particular importance to Peoples include, but are not limited to: (i) changes in general economic conditions, including interest rates; (ii) potential improvements or deterioration in credit quality; (iii) competition among providers of financial services; (iv) residential mortgage and secondary market activity; (v) changes in accounting and regulatory guidance applicable to banks; and (vi) price levels and conditions in the public securities markets generally. All forward looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Consequently, no forward looking statement can be guaranteed. Peoples does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 99 Table of Contents STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENTS RESPONSIBILITY Management is responsible for the preparation, content and integrity of the consolidated financial statements and all other information included in this annual report. The consolidated financial statements and related footnotes are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Management is also responsible for compliance with laws and regulations relating to safety and soundness as designated by the Office of Thrift Supervision. The consolidated financial statements as identified in the accompanying Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm have been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. These audits were conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, and included tests of the accounting records and other auditing procedures considered necessary to formulate an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The Board of Directors has an Audit Committee composed of five outside directors, each of whom meets the criteria for independence as set forth in applicable listing standards. The Audit Committee meets regularly with the independent auditors, the internal auditors and management to ensure that the system of internal control over financial reporting is being properly administered and that financial data is being properly reported. The Audit Committee reviews the scope and timing of internal audits, including recommendations made with respect to the system of internal control over financial reporting. The independent auditors and the internal auditors have free access to the Audit Committee. MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting for Peoples. Management maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting, including an internal audit function, which is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, transactions are properly authorized, and that accounting records are reliable for the preparation of financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that internal control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on its assessment, management has concluded that Peoples maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. Managements assessment of the effectiveness of Peoples internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that is included herein. /s/ John A.
