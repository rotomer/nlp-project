General Peoples United Financial, Inc. (Peoples United Financial) is a savings and loan holding company incorporated under the state laws of Delaware and the holding company for Peoples United Bank. On April 16, 2007, Peoples United Financial, Peoples Bank and Peoples Mutual Holdings completed their second step conversion from a mutual holding company structure to a fully public stock holding company structure. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of the second step conversion. Peoples United Financial had not engaged in any business through March 31, 2007; accordingly, the financial information for periods prior to March 31, 2007 is that of Peoples Bank. On June 6, 2007, Peoples Bank changed its name to Peoples United Bank. The name Peoples United Bank is used to refer to the Bank both before and after the name change. Peoples United Financial is registered with the Office of Thrift Supervision (the OTS) and subject to OTS regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements. Peoples United Bank is a federally chartered stock savings bank headquartered in Bridgeport, Connecticut with $12.1 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2007. Peoples United Bank was organized in 1842 as a mutual savings bank and converted to stock form in 1988. In August 2006, Peoples United Bank converted from a Connecticut chartered stock savings bank to a federally chartered stock savings bank. 24 Table of Contents Deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Peoples United Banks regulator is the OTS. The principal business of Peoples United Financial is to provide, through Peoples United Bank and its subsidiaries, a full range of financial services to individual, corporate and municipal customers. Traditional banking activities are conducted primarily within the state of Connecticut and include extending secured and unsecured commercial and consumer loans, originating mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial properties, and accepting consumer, commercial and municipal deposits. In addition to traditional banking activities, Peoples United Bank provides specialized services tailored to specific markets including: personal, institutional and employee benefit trust; cash management; and municipal banking and finance. Through its non bank subsidiaries, Peoples United Bank offers: brokerage, financial advisory services, investment management services and life insurance through Peoples Securities, Inc. (PSI); equipment financing through Peoples Capital and Leasing Corp. (PCLC); and other insurance services through R.C. Knox and Company, Inc. (RC Knox). This full range of financial services is delivered through a network of 79 traditional branches, 75 full service Stop & Shop supermarket branches that provide customers with seven day a week banking, seven limited service branches, 23 investment and brokerage offices (22 of which are located within branch offices), five wealth management and trust offices, nine PCLC offices and six commercial banking offices. Peoples United Banks distribution network also includes fully integrated online banking and investment trading, a 24 hour telephone banking service and participation in a worldwide ATM network. Peoples United Bank has expanded its residential mortgage and home equity lending activities in the contiguous markets of New York and Massachusetts. In addition, PCLC maintains a sales presence in six states to support its equipment financing operations outside of Connecticut. Within the Commercial Banking division, Peoples United Bank maintains a national credits group, which seeks to participate in commercial loans and commercial real estate loans to borrowers in various industries on a national scale. Peoples United Financials results of operations are largely dependent upon revenues generated through net interest income and fee based revenues and, to a much lesser extent, other forms of non interest income such as gains on asset sales. Sources for these revenues are diversified across Peoples United Financials two primary business segments representing its core businesses, Commercial Banking and Consumer Financial Services, and to a lesser extent, Treasury. Peoples United Financials results of operations are also significantly affected by the provision for loan losses and the level of non interest expense. In addition, Peoples United Financials results of operations may also be affected by general and local economic conditions, changes in market interest rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Acquisition of Chittenden Corporation On January 1, 2008, Peoples United Financial completed its acquisition of the Chittenden Corporation, a multi bank holding company located in Burlington, Vermont for total consideration of approximately $1.7 billion. Chittenden had total assets of $7.4 billion as of December 31, 2007 and its six banks are located in Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Maine. The acquisition of Chittenden will be accounted for as a purchase and accordingly, Chittendens results of operations will be included with Peoples United Financials results of operations beginning in 2008. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, Peoples United Financial is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, including the classification of revenues and expenses to discontinued operations. Actual results could differ from Peoples United Financials current estimates, as a result of changing conditions and future events. Several estimates are particularly critical and are susceptible to significant near term change, including the 25 Table of Contents allowance for loan losses, the valuation of derivative financial instruments, and asset impairment judgments including the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets, and other than temporary declines in the value of securities. Peoples United Financials significant accounting policies and critical estimates are summarized in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses charged to income. Losses on loans, including impaired loans, are charged to the allowance for loan losses when all or a portion of a loan is deemed to be uncollectible. Recoveries of loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance when realized. Management maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that is believed to be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio, based on a quarterly evaluation of a variety of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to: Peoples United Financials historical loan loss experience and recent trends in that experience; risk ratings assigned by lending personnel to commercial real estate finance, commercial and PCLC loans, and the results of ongoing reviews of those ratings by Peoples United Financials independent loan review function; an evaluation of non performing loans and related collateral values; the probability of loss in view of geographic and industry concentrations and other portfolio risk characteristics; the present financial condition of borrowers; and current economic conditions. While management seeks to use the best available information to make these evaluations, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions, results of regulatory examinations, further information obtained regarding known problem loans, the identification of additional problem loans and other factors. The allowance for loan losses consists of amounts determined in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, and SFAS No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan. In applying SFAS No. 5, management considers the factors listed in the preceding paragraph in order to estimate a loss allowance for (1) each homogeneous pool of smaller balance loans (residential mortgage and consumer loans) that are evaluated on a collective basis, and (2) commercial real estate, commercial and PCLC loans that are not considered impaired under SFAS No. 114. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that Peoples United Financial will be unable to collect all principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan. Peoples United Financial applies SFAS No. 114 to loans that are individually evaluated for collectibility in accordance with its normal loan review procedures. Under SFAS No. 114, impaired loans are reported based on one of three measures: the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate; the loans observable market price; or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. If the measure is less than an impaired loans recorded investment, an impairment loss is recognized as part of the allowance for loan losses. Valuation of Derivative Financial Instruments. Peoples United Financial uses derivatives for market risk management purposes (principally interest rate risk) and not for trading or speculative purposes. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, all derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. Until such time that a derivative is settled, favorable changes in fair values result in unrealized gains that are recognized as assets, while unfavorable changes result in unrealized losses that are recognized as liabilities. Peoples United Financial hedge accounting methods vary depending on whether the derivative instrument is classified as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. Hedge accounting is permitted only if specific criteria are met, including a requirement that a highly effective relationship exist between the derivative instrument and the hedged item, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis. Changes in the fair value of effective fair value hedges are recognized in current earnings. Changes in the fair value of effective cash flow hedges are recognized in other comprehensive income until earnings are affected by the variability in cash flows of the designated hedged item. Ineffective portions of hedge results are recognized in current earnings. Peoples United Financial formally documents all relationships between the derivative instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as hedges to specific assets and liabilities, or to 26 Table of Contents specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. Peoples United Financial also formally assesses, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged items. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective or has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, Peoples United Financial would discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. Interest rate lock commitments extended to borrowers relate to the origination of residential mortgage loans. To mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in these commitments, Peoples United Financial enters into mandatory delivery and best efforts contracts to sell adjustable rate and fixed rate residential mortgage loans (servicing released). Forward commitments to sell and interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans are considered derivatives and their respective estimated fair values are adjusted based on changes in interest rates and exclude the value of mortgage servicing rights. Asset Impairment Judgments Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, requires, among other things, use of the purchase method to account for all business combinations and specifies criteria that acquired intangible assets must meet in order to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. The assets and liabilities of an acquired company are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. Intangible assets are recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Other acquisition related intangibles are separately identified, where appropriate, for the estimated value of acquired customer relationships and are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated remaining average life of those relationships (ranging from 7 to 12 years from the respective acquisition dates). The remaining intangible asset is classified as goodwill. SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill be reviewed for impairment at least annually, with impairment losses charged to expense when they occur. Acquisition related intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives and are periodically reviewed by management to assess recoverability. Impairment losses are recognized as a charge to expense if carrying amounts exceed fair values. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment using a two step approach that involves the identification of reporting units and the estimation of fair values. Goodwill shall also be tested for impairment when events occur that would more likely than not reduce the implied fair value of goodwill below its carrying value. An impairment loss is recognized as a charge to expense for any excess of the goodwill carrying amount over implied fair value. Peoples United Financial uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of its reporting units. This model requires the use of long term planning forecasts and assumptions regarding industry specific economic conditions that are outside our control. Securities. Marketable equity and debt securities (other than those reported as short term investments) are classified as either trading account securities, held to maturity securities (applicable only to debt securities) or available for sale securities. Management determines the classification of a security at the time of its purchase. Securities purchased for sale in the near term and those held by PSI (in accordance with the requirements for a broker dealer) are classified as trading account securities and reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are reported in non interest income. Debt securities that Peoples United Financial has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity securities and reported at amortized cost. All other securities are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are reported on an after tax basis in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Premiums are amortized and discounts are accreted to interest income for debt securities, using the interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity, adjusted for the effect of actual 27 Table of Contents prepayments in the case of mortgage backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and other asset backed securities. Federal Home Loan Bank stock is a non marketable equity security reported at cost. Security transactions are generally recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method and reported in non interest income. Management conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if the decline in fair value of any security appears to be other than temporary. If the decline is deemed to be other than temporary, the security is written down to a new cost basis and the resulting loss is reported in non interest income. The factors considered by management in its periodic review include, but are not limited to: the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer; the ratings of the security; whether the decline in fair value appears to be issuer specific or, alternatively, a reflection of general market or industry conditions; and Peoples United Financials intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in fair value. Non GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation to GAAP In addition to evaluating Peoples United Financials results of operations in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management routinely supplements this evaluation with an analysis of certain non GAAP financial measures, such as the efficiency ratio, core deposits and purchased funds. Management believes such non GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding Peoples United Financials underlying operating performance and trends, and facilitates comparisons with the performance of other banks and thrifts. Management utilizes core deposits and purchased funds as non GAAP financial measures to supplement its analysis of Peoples United Financials business performance. Core deposits is a measure of stable funding sources and is defined as total deposits, other than brokered certificates of deposit (acquired in the wholesale market), municipal deposits (which are seasonally variable by nature) and escrow funds from Peoples United Financials stock offering (applicable only for 2007 average core deposits). Purchased funds include borrowings, brokered certificates of deposit and municipal deposits. Although management believes that the above mentioned non GAAP financial measures enhance investors understanding of Peoples United Financials operating performance, these non GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. The reconciliation of these non GAAP financial measures from GAAP to non GAAP is presented below. The following tables provide reconciliations between GAAP and non GAAP financial measures: As of December 31 (in millions) 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Deposits $ 8,881 $ 9,083 $ 9,083 $ 8,862 $ 8,714 Less: Municipal deposits 45 43 129 106 125 Brokered certificates of deposit 70 Core deposits $ 8,836 $ 9,040 $ 8,954 $ 8,756 $ 8,519 As of December 31 (in millions) 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Borrowings $ $ 4 $ 295 $ 341 $ 1,516 Plus: Municipal deposits 45 43 129 106 125 Brokered certificates of deposit 70 Purchased funds $ 45 $ 47 $ 424 $ 447 $ 1,711 28 Table of Contents In addition to the above non GAAP financial measures, management uses the efficiency ratio to monitor its operating efficiency compared to its peers. The efficiency ratio, which represents an approximate measure of the cost required by Peoples United Financial to generate a dollar of revenue, is the ratio of total non interest expense (excluding goodwill impairment charges, amortization of goodwill and acquisition related intangibles, losses on real estate assets and nonrecurring expenses) (the numerator) to net interest income plus total non interest income (including the fully taxable equivalent adjustment on bank owned life insurance income and excluding gains and losses on sales of assets, other than residential mortgage loans, and nonrecurring income) (the denominator). Peoples United Financial generally considers an income or expense to be nonrecurring if it is not similar to an income or expense of a type incurred within the last two years and is not similar to an income or expense of a type reasonably expected to be incurred within the following two years. Management considers the efficiency ratio to be more representative of Peoples United Financials ongoing operating efficiency, as the excluded items are generally related to external market conditions and non routine transactions. The following table summarizes Peoples United Financials efficiency ratio derived from amounts reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Economic activity in the United States showed signs of slowing in 2007. Real gross domestic product increased at a rate of 2.5% for the year, a decrease from 2.9% in 2006. The national unemployment rate was 5.0% as of December 31, 2007, up from 4.4% at the end of 2006. The national economy continued to grow despite widening federal budget and trade deficits, significant volatility in the financial and capital markets, lower short term interest rates, elevated energy costs, a weak housing market, and geopolitical uncertainties. In response to a contracting U.S. economy and the significant disruptions in the capital markets primarily caused by the sub prime mortgage crisis, the Federal Reserve Board lowered the targeted federal funds rate five times from September 2007 to January 2008, by a total of 225 basis points, bringing the rate to 3.00% as of January 30, 2008. The Federal Reserve had not increased the targeted federal funds rates since the June 29, 2006 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Peoples United Financials primary market area, Connecticut, is one of the most attractive markets in the United States with a total population of approximately 3.6 million and a median household income of $68,430 as of June 30, 2007, ranking second in the United States and well above the U.S. median income of $53,154, according to estimates from SNL Securities. Fairfield County, where Peoples United Financial is headquartered, is the wealthiest county in Connecticut, with a June 30, 2007 median household income of $84,825 according to estimates from SNL Securities. The states unemployment rate increased to 5.0% as of December 31, 2007 compared to 4.1% at the end of 2006, and was the same as the national rate. The Connecticut economy experienced moderate job growth in 2007, with total employment increasing by 16,600 jobs, or approximately 1.0% from December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007. The outlook for the Connecticut economy in 2008 is cautiously optimistic, with the expectation that the state will experience further job growth as the economy continues to expand moderately. Financial Overview Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006. Total assets at December 31, 2007 were $13.6 billion, an increase of $2.9 billion, or 27%, from December 31, 2006, primarily due to a $3.3 billion increase in short term investments, partially offset by a decrease of $422 million in total loans. The increase in short term investments reflects the net proceeds from the second step conversion completed on April 16, 2007. The decrease in total loans reflects a decline of $758 million, or 15%, in Consumer Financial Services, partially offset by an increase of $336 million, or 8%, in Commercial Banking. The decline in Consumer Financial Services was driven by decreases of $687 million, or 18%, in residential mortgage loans and $71 million, or 5%, in consumer loans. The decrease in residential mortgage loans reflects Peoples United Banks decision in the fourth quarter of 2006 to sell essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans due to the low spreads on such loans. The growth in Commercial Banking reflects increases of $175 million, or 29%, in our national credits portfolio, $112 million, or 13%, in loans originated by PCLC, our equipment financing subsidiary, $34 million, or 3%, in commercial lending, and $15 million, or 1%, in commercial real estate loans. Non performing assets totaled $26.1 million at December 31, 2007, a $3.4 million increase from December 31, 2006. Increases in non performing commercial real estate loans of $3.5 million, real estate owned (REO) and repossessed assets of $5.7 million, non performing PCLC loans of $1.0 million and non performing residential mortgage loans of $2.2 million, were partially offset by a decrease of $10.6 million in non performing commercial loans. The decrease in non performing commercial loans primarily reflects the $5.9 million charge off relating to one commercial banking loan and the subsequent transfer to real estate owned of the real estate securing the remaining loan balance. The allowance for loan losses decreased $1.3 million to $72.7 million 30 Table of Contents at December 31, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006, reflecting reductions in the allowance for loan losses allocated to the consumer loan portfolios and by net reductions to the commercial banking loan portfolios. At December 31, 2007, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.81% and as a percentage of non performing loans was 358%, compared to 0.79% and 328%, respectively, at December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2007, liabilities totaled $9.1 billion, a $238 million, or 3%, decrease from December 31, 2006, primarily reflecting a $202 million reduction in total deposits. Core deposits decreased $204 million, or 2%, in 2007 compared to 2006, reflecting Peoples United Financials strategy to fund loan growth with proceeds from maturities, sales and repayments of securities rather than core deposits. Peoples United Financials total stockholders equity was $4.4 billion at December 31, 2007, a $3.1 billion net increase from December 31, 2006, reflecting the net proceeds of $3.3 billion from the second step conversion and net income of $150.7 million, partially offset by the purchases of Peoples United Financial common stock for the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the ESOP) of $216.8 million and the 2007 Recognition and Retention Plan of $127.1 million, and dividends paid of $131.1 million. As a percentage of total assets, stockholders equity was 32.8% at December 31, 2007 compared to 12.5% at December 31, 2006. Peoples United Banks leverage, tier 1 and total risk based capital ratios were 24.1%, 32.3% and 33.4%, respectively, at December 31, 2007, compared to 12.0%, 14.8% and 16.1%, respectively, at December 31, 2006. The improvements in the capital ratios from December 31, 2006 primarily reflect the $1.7 billion capital contribution from Peoples United Financial with a portion of the net proceeds from the second step conversion. Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005. Total assets at December 31, 2006 were $10.7 billion, a decrease of $246 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2005, primarily due to a $1.3 billion decline in total securities, partially offset by increases of $799 million in total loans, $193 million in short term investments, $58 million in bank owned life insurance and $66 million in other assets. The increase in total loans reflects growth of $456 million, or 10%, in Consumer Financial Services and $343 million, or 9%, in Commercial Banking. The growth in Consumer Financial Services was driven by increases of $392 million, or 11%, in residential mortgage loans and $64 million, or 5%, in consumer loans. The increase in residential mortgage loans reflects, in part, the purchase of $170 million of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans towards the end of the first quarter of 2006. The growth in Commercial Banking reflects increases of $235 million, or 37%, in loans originated by PCLC, $135 million, or 29%, in our national credits portfolio, and $60 million, or 5%, in commercial lending. These increases were partially offset by an $87 million, or 5%, decline in commercial real estate loans. The decrease in the securities portfolio reflects the sale of $266 million and $810 million of debt securities in the second and third quarters of 2006, respectively, to better position Peoples United Financials balance sheet for the prevailing interest rate environment at the time. Peoples United Financial also funded an additional $50 million of bank owned life insurance in 2006 and contributed $91.5 million in the third quarter of 2006 to its employee retirement plan (reported in other assets) to more than fully fund its projected benefit obligation and to significantly reduce pension plan expense in future years. Proceeds from sales of securities were also used to reduce total borrowings and subordinated notes by $335 million since December 31, 2005. Non performing assets totaled $22.7 million at December 31, 2006, a $0.7 million increase from December 31, 2005. The slight increase in 2006 reflects a $10.6 million increase in non performing commercial loans, essentially offset by decreases in non performing commercial real estate loans and non performing PCLC loans of $5.6 million and $4.1 million, respectively. The allowance for loan losses decreased $1.0 million to $74 million at December 31, 2006 compared to December 31, 2005, primarily reflecting reductions in the allowance for loan losses allocated to the consumer loan portfolios, partially offset by net additions to the commercial banking loan portfolios. At December 31, 2006, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.79% and as a percentage of non performing loans was 328%, compared to 0.87% and 353%, respectively, at December 31, 2005. 31 Table of Contents At December 31, 2006, liabilities totaled $9.3 billion, a $297 million, or 3%, decrease from December 31, 2005, reflecting a $335 million reduction in total borrowings and subordinated notes. Core deposits increased a modest $86 million, or 1%, in 2006 compared to 2005, reflecting Peoples United Financials strategy to fund loan growth with proceeds from maturities, sales and repayments of securities rather than core deposits. Peoples United Financials total stockholders equity was $1.34 billion at December 31, 2006, a $51 million net increase from December 31, 2005, reflecting net income of $124.0 million, partially offset by dividends paid of $60 million and a $25 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss reflects a $40 million after tax increase from the adoption of SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, effective December 31, 2006 and a $4 million increase in the after tax unrealized loss on derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges, partially offset by a $19 million reduction in the after tax net unrealized loss on securities available for sale due to the sales of securities discussed above. As a percentage of total assets, stockholders equity was 12.5% at December 31, 2006 compared to 11.8% at December 31, 2005. Comparison of Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006. Peoples United Financial reported net income of $150.7 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $124.0 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, for the year ago period. Income from continuing operations totaled $149.2 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $121.7 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, for the year ago period. In 2007, Peoples United Financials return on average assets was 1.18% and return on average stockholders equity was 4.2%. Results for 2007 include a $60 million contribution to The Peoples United Community Foundation (included in non interest expense), which had the effect of reducing net income by $39.6 million, or $0.13 per diluted share. Results for 2006 include net security losses totaling $27.4 million from the sale of $266 million and $810 million of debt securities in the second and third quarters of 2006, respectively. Results for 2006 also include a $2.4 million income tax benefit related to certain prior year tax matters. The net impact of these items reduced 2006 net income by $15.8 million, or $0.11 per share. Net interest income increased $104.2 million, or 27%, from 2006 and the net interest margin improved 25 basis points to 4.12%. These improvements reflect the investment of $3.3 billion in net proceeds from the second step conversion (completed on April 16, 2007) in short term investments, as well as the benefits from balance sheet restructuring activities completed during 2006. Compared to 2006, average earning assets increased $1.9 billion, or 20%, reflecting increases of $2.5 billion in average short term investments and $120 million in average loans, partially offset by a decrease of $735 million in average securities, reflecting the sale of $1.1 billion of debt securities in 2006 (described above). Compared to 2006, total non interest income increased $38 million. Included in total non interest income are net security gains of $5.5 million in 2007 and net security losses of $23.2 million in 2006. Total non interest expense in 2007 increased $32.4 million, or 9%, compared to 2006, excluding the $60 million contribution to the Peoples United Community Foundation. The efficiency ratio improved to 56.1% from 61.3%. The provision for loan losses was $8.0 million compared to $3.4 million in 2006. The provision for loan losses in 2007 reflects net loan charge offs of $9.3 million, partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease in the allowance for loan losses. The provision for loan losses in 2006 reflects net loan charge offs of $4.4 million and a $1.0 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses. Net loan charge offs increased $4.9 million in 2007 compared to 2006. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average loans equaled 0.10% in 2007, up from 0.05% in 2006. 32 Table of Contents Comparison of Results of Operations for 2006 and 2005. Peoples United Financial reported net income in 2006 of $124.0 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, compared to $137.1 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, in 2005. Income from continuing operations totaled $121.7 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $125.9 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, for the year ago period. Results for 2006 include net security losses totaling $27.4 million from the sale of debt securities and a $2.4 million income tax benefit related to certain prior year tax matters. The net impact of these items reduced 2006 net income by $15.8 million, or $0.5 per share. Results for 2005 included an $8.1 million gain on the sale of three branches, a $9.7 million gain from the resolution of a significant contingency related to the sale of the credit card business in 2004 (reported in income from discontinued operations), a $2.0 million income tax benefit resulting from the completion of a routine federal tax audit, a $2.0 million goodwill impairment charge and expenses incurred in connection with the repurchase of subordinated notes ($2.7 million) and the accelerated vesting of stock options ($0.7 million). The net impact of these items increased 2005 net income by $9.3 million, or $0.03 per share. In 2005, Peoples United Financials return on average assets was 1.27% and return on average stockholders equity was 11.1%. Net interest income increased $12.7 million, or 3%, from 2005 and the net interest margin improved 19 basis points to 3.87%. The higher net interest margin reflects the asset sensitive position of the balance sheet, the substitution of securities with higher yielding loans, the partial benefit from the sales of securities in the second and third quarters of 2006, and the impact of our deposit pricing strategy. Compared to 2005, average earning assets decreased $173 million, or 2%, as a $934 million, or 54%, decline in average securities funded a $715 million, or 9%, increase in average loans and a $113 million, or 27%, decrease in average total borrowings and average subordinated notes. The loan growth reflects increases of $285 million, or 8%, in average commercial banking loans, $345 million, or 10%, in average residential mortgage loans, and $108 million, or 9%, in average home equity loans, all as compared to 2005. The increase in average residential mortgage loans reflects, in part, the purchase of $170 million of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans towards the end of the first quarter of 2006. In addition, Peoples United Financial invested $50 million in the first quarter of 2006 and $150 million in the second quarter of 2005 in bank owned life insurance, and contributed $91.5 million to its employee retirement plan in September 2006. Compared to 2005, total non interest income, excluding net security losses, increased $1.2 million, or 1%; total non interest expense increased $2.5 million, or 1%; and the efficiency ratio improved to 61.3% from 62.8%. The provision for loan losses was $3.4 million compared to $8.6 million in 2005. The provision for loan losses for 2006 reflects net loan charge offs of $4.4 million, partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in the allowance for loan losses. The provision for loan losses in 2005 reflects net loan charge offs of $6.1 million and a $2.5 million increase in the allowance for loan losses. Net loan charge offs decreased $1.7 million, or 28%, in 2006 compared to 2005. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average loans equaled 0.05%, down from 0.07% in 2005. Business Segment Results Peoples United Financials operations are divided into two primary business segments that represent its core businesses, commercial banking and consumer financial services. In addition, the treasury area is responsible for managing Peoples United Financials securities portfolio, short term investments, wholesale funding activities, such as borrowings, and the funding center. The income or loss for the funding center, which includes the impact of derivative financial instruments used for risk management purposes, represents the interest rate risk component of Peoples United Financials net interest income as calculated by Peoples United Financials funds transfer pricing model (FTP), to derive each operating segments net interest income. 33 Table of Contents Business Segment Performance Summary Net Income Years ended December 31 (in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Commercial Banking $ 37.6 $ 41.9 $ 45.7 Consumer Financial Services 66.8 85.8 94.2 Treasury (8.6 ) (26.0 ) (25.0 ) Total reportable segments 95.8 101.7 114.9 Other 54.9 22.3 22.2 Total Consolidated $ 150.7 $ 124.0 $ 137.1 Peoples United Financial uses an internal profitability reporting system to generate information by operating segment, which is based on a series of management estimates and allocations regarding funds transfer pricing, the provision for loan losses, non interest expense and income taxes. These estimates and allocations, some of which can be subjective in nature, are continually being reviewed and refined. Any changes in estimates and allocations that may affect the reported results of any business segment will not affect the consolidated financial position or results of operations of Peoples United Financial as a whole. FTP is used in the calculation of each operating segments net interest income, and measures the value of funds used in and provided by an operating segment. The difference between the interest income on earning assets and the interest expense on funding liabilities, and the corresponding FTP charge for interest income or credit for interest expense, results in net spread income. The provision for loan losses for the Commercial Banking and Consumer Financial Services segments is generally based on a five year rolling average net charge off rate for the respective segment. Peoples United Financial allocates a majority of non interest expenses to each business segment using a full absorption costing process. Direct and indirect costs are analyzed and pooled by process and assigned to the appropriate business segment and corporate overhead costs are allocated to the business segments. Income tax expense is allocated to each business segment using a constant rate, based on an estimate of the consolidated effective income tax rate for the year. For a more detailed description of the estimates and allocations used to measure business segment performance, see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Commercial Banking consists principally of commercial lending, commercial real estate lending and commercial deposit gathering activities. This segment also includes the equipment financing operations of PCLC, as well as cash management, correspondent banking and municipal banking.

Net interest income increased $1.2 million, or 1%, reflecting a $349 million, or 9%, increase in average earning assets, partially offset by narrower net spreads and a decline in commercial non interest bearing deposits. The $2.0 million increase in fee based revenues reflects higher lending related charges and fees. The increase in other non interest income primarily reflects a $3.8 million increase in rental income on leased equipment. The $12.8 million, or 16%, increase in non interest expense reflects increases in direct expenses due to continued growth in Commercial Banking and a $2.8 million increase in amortization expense for leased equipment, as well as allocated expenses primarily related to costs associated with ongoing infrastructure upgrades. The increase in average earning assets compared to 2006 reflects increases of $210 million, or 30%, in PCLC loans, $96 million, or 7%, in commercial loans and $42 million, or 2%, in commercial real estate loans. Average commercial non interest bearing deposits totaled $883 million for 2007, a $56 million, or 6%, decrease compared to 2006, reflecting the current higher interest rate environment. Commercial Banking income from continuing operations declined $3.8 million, or 8%, in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily reflecting lower fee based revenues and an increase in non interest expense, partially offset by an increase in other non interest income. Net interest income increased $0.8 million, or 1%, reflecting a $284 million, or 8%, increase in average earning assets, partially offset by narrower net spreads. The $3.9 million decrease in fee based revenues reflects lower lending related charges and fees, primarily lower commercial real estate loan prepayment penalties. The increase in other non interest income primarily reflects a $2.7 million increase in rental income on leased equipment. The $4.6 million, or 6%, increase in non interest expense reflects an increase in direct expenses due to the continued growth in Commercial Banking, including a $2.0 million increase in the amortization expense of equipment leased to commercial customers. The increase in average earning assets compared to 2005 reflects increases of $183 million, or 35%, in PCLC loans, and $127 million, or 10%, in commercial loans, partially offset by a $25 million, or 1%, decrease in commercial real estate finance loans. Average commercial non interest bearing deposits totaled $939 million for 2006, a $43 million, or 4%, decrease compared to 2005, reflecting the current higher interest rate environment. Consumer Financial Services includes, as its principal business lines, consumer deposit gathering activities, and residential mortgage, home equity and other consumer lending (excluding the national consumer loan portfolio, which is reported in Other). In addition to trust services, this segment also includes brokerage, financial advisory services, investment management services and life insurance provided by PSI, and other insurance services provided through RC Knox.

The decrease in net interest income reflects a reduction in residential mortgage loan net spread interest income, and a shift from wider net spread deposits to time deposits with narrower net spreads, partially offset by the widening net spreads on money market accounts. During 2007, average earning assets decreased $224 million, or 4%, including decreases of $208 million, or 6%, in average residential mortgage loans and $9 million, or 1%, in average home equity loans. The decrease in average residential mortgage loans reflects Peoples United Financials decision in the fourth quarter of 2006 to sell essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. As a result, residential mortgage loan balances are expected to decline in the future until Peoples United Financial resumes adding such loans to its portfolio to an extent that more than offsets repayments. Average consumer deposits totaled $7.7 billion, a less than 1% increase compared to 2006. The increase in non interest expense reflects increases in allocated expenses primarily due to the costs associated with ongoing infrastructure upgrades relating to deposit gathering activities. Consumer Financial Services income from continuing operations decreased $8.4 million, or 9%, in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to decreases in net interest income and net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans, partially offset by higher fee based revenues. Additionally, results for 2005 included the $8.1 million gain on sale of branches. The decrease in net interest income primarily reflects the reduction in net spread interest income for residential mortgage loans and the decline in net interest spread from an unfavorable shift from savings and money market deposits to higher rate time deposits, partially offset by the benefit of an increase in average loan balances. The shift in deposit mix reflects an increase in higher rate time deposits, partially offset by a decline in savings and money market deposits. During 2006, average earning assets increased $452 million, or 10%, including increases of $345 million, or 10%, in average residential mortgage loans and $106 million, or 9%, in average home equity loans. Peoples United Financial purchased $170 million of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans towards the end of the first quarter of 2006. Average consumer deposits totaled $7.7 billion, a 1% increase compared to 2005. The increase in fee based revenues in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily reflects an increase in service charges on deposit accounts related to changes in Peoples United Financials fee structure. The increase in other non interest income reflects a $0.7 million net gain from the sale of a corporate insurance account by RC Knox. Included in non interest income in 2005 was an $8.1 million gain on the sale of three branches. The increase in non interest expense reflects a $3.8 million increase in allocated expenses in 2006, partially offset by a $2.0 million goodwill impairment charge in 2005. Treasury encompasses the securities portfolio, short term investments, wholesale funding activities, such as borrowings, and the funding center. The income or loss for the funding center, which includes the impact of derivative financial instruments used for risk management purposes, represents the interest rate risk component of Peoples United Financials net interest income as calculated by Peoples United Financials funds transfer pricing model (FTP), to derive each operating segments net interest income. Under this process, a money desk (the funding center) buys funds from liability generating business lines (such as consumer deposits) and sells funds to asset generating business lines (such as commercial lending). The price at which funds are bought and sold on any given day is set by Peoples United Financials treasury group and is based on the wholesale cost to Peoples United Financial of assets and liabilities with similar maturities. Liability generating businesses sell newly originated liabilities to the money desk and recognize a funding credit, while asset generating businesses buy funding for newly originated assets from the money desk and recognize a funding charge. Once funding for an asset is purchased from or a liability is sold to the money desk, the price that is set by the treasury group will remain with that asset or liability until it matures or reprices, which effectively transfers responsibility for managing interest rate risk to the treasury group. 36 Table of Contents Years ended December 31 (in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Net interest loss $ (29.8 ) $ (26.2 ) $ (43.0 ) Non interest income: Fee based revenues 0.5 Net security losses (27.4 ) Bank owned life insurance 10.5 9.1 3.3 Other non interest income 0.1 0.1 0.3 Total non interest income 10.6 (18.2 ) 4.1 Non interest expense (0.3 ) 0.5 1.4 Loss before income tax expense (18.9 ) (44.9 ) (40.3 ) Income tax benefit (10.3 ) (18.9 ) (15.3 ) Loss from continuing operations $ (8.6 ) $ (26.0 ) $ (25.0 ) Average earning assets $ 2,689.0 $ 878.5 $ 1,765.9 Average liabilities 81.0 234.1 282.5 Year end assets 3,756.6 469.0 1,553.2 The reduction in Treasurys loss from continuing operations in 2007 compared to 2006 reflects $27.4 million of net security losses in 2006 and a $1.4 million increase in bank owned life insurance (BOLI), partially offset by a $3.6 million increase in net interest loss. The increase in net interest loss reflects an increase of $7.1 million in treasurys net spread loss, partially offset by a $3.5 million decline in the funding centers net spread loss. The increase in treasurys net spread loss reflects a $735 million decline in average securities and virtually no net spread benefit from the increase in average short term investments. The benefit from the increase in average short term investments is included in Other as interest income from excess capital. The improvement in the funding centers net spread loss reflects the rising interest rate environment prevalent for most of 2007 and the asset sensitive position of Peoples United Financials balance sheet. Average earning assets increased $1.8 billion from 2006. Average short term investments increased $2.5 billion, reflecting the investment of net proceeds from the second step conversion, while average securities declined $735 million resulting from the sale of $1.1 billion of securities in 2006. The debt securities portfolio totaled $23 million at December 31, 2007, compared to $27 million at December 31, 2006. Average securities comprised 1% of average earning assets in 2007, compared to 8% in 2006. Treasurys loss from continuing operations in 2006 compared to 2005 reflects $27.4 million of net security losses, partially offset by a $16.8 million improvement in net interest income and BOLI income of $9.1 million ($13.7 million on a taxable equivalent basis). The improvement in net interest income reflects the funding centers net spread loss declining by $31.8 million, partially offset by a $15.0 million decline in treasurys net spread income. The reduction in treasurys net spread income reflects a $934 million decline in average securities and an increase in the FTP charge for funding the BOLI investment (with no offsetting interest income as BOLI income is recorded in non interest income). The improvement in the funding centers net spread loss reflects the rising interest rate environment and the asset sensitive position of Peoples United Financials balance sheet. Average earning assets decreased $887 million, or 50%, reflecting a $934 million, or 54%, decline in average securities from 2005 given Peoples United Financials sale of its debt securities portfolio during 2006 as part of restructuring activities to better position Peoples United Financials balance sheet for the prevailing interest rate environment. The debt securities portfolio totaled $27 million at December 31, 2006, compared to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2005, reflecting the sale of approximately $1.1 billion of securities and the 37 Table of Contents substitution of securities with higher yielding loans. Average securities comprised 8% of average earning assets in 2006, compared to 17% in 2005. Other includes the residual financial impact from the allocation of revenues and expenses and certain revenues and expenses not attributable to a particular segment, and the FTP impact attributable to excess capital. This category also includes: revenues and expenses relating to the national consumer loan portfolio; certain nonrecurring items, including security gains of $5.4 million from the sale of Peoples United Financials entire holdings of MasterCard Incorporated Class B Common Stock (included in non interest income for the year ended December 31, 2007) and the $60 million contribution to The Peoples United Community Foundation (included in non interest expense for the year December 31, 2007); income from discontinued operations; and income tax benefits. The increase in net interest income in 2007 compared to 2006 reflects the FTP credit resulting from the significant increase in excess capital from the second step conversion. Included in period end assets are cash, national consumer loans, premises and equipment, and other assets.

Net Interest Margin Years ended December 31 (percent) Net Interest Income Years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) In response to the disruptions in the capital markets caused by the sub prime mortgage crisis and the potential for a contracting U.S. economy, since September 2007 the Federal Reserve Board lowered the targeted federal funds rate five times by a total of 225 basis points, bringing the rate to 3.00% as of January 30, 2008. Given the asset sensitive position of the balance sheet, the net interest margin may compress in 2008. 2007 Compared to 2006 Net interest income increased $105 million, or 27%, and the net interest margin improved 25 basis points to 4.12% for 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in net interest income reflects a $125 million increase in total interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $20 million increase in total interest expense. The increase in net interest margin reflects the investment of $3.3 billion in net proceeds from the second step conversion in short term investments, as well as the benefits from the balance sheet restructuring activities completed during 2006. 39 Table of Contents Average earning assets totaled $11.8 billion in 2007, a $1.9 billion, or 20%, increase from 2006, while the asset mix continued to shift. Average short term investments increased $2.5 billion, reflecting the investment of $3.3 billion in net proceeds from the second step conversion in April 2007; average loans increased $120 million, or 1%; and average securities declined $735 million, reflecting the sale of $1.1 billion of debt securities in 2006. As a result, average loans, average securities and average short term investments comprised 77%, 1% and 22%, respectively, of average earning assets in 2007 compared to 91%, 8% and 1%, respectively, in 2006. The yield earned on the total loan portfolio was 6.27% in 2007 while the yield earned on securities was 5.62%, compared to 6.10% and 3.74%, respectively, in 2006. Excluding adjustable rate residential mortgage loans, which are mostly of the hybrid variety, approximately 31% of the loan portfolio has floating interest rates at December 31, 2007 compared to approximately 29% at the end of 2006. Growth in loans reflects an increase of $348 million, or 9%, in average commercial banking loans, partially offset by decreases of $209 million, or 6%, in average residential mortgage loans and $19 million, or 2%, in average consumer loans for 2007 compared to 2006. The growth in average commercial banking loans in 2007 compared to 2006 reflects increases of $210 million, or 30%, in average PCLC loans, $96 million, or 7%, in average commercial loans and $42 million, or 2%, in average commercial real estate loans. Included in average commercial loans and average commercial real estate loans were increases of $64 million, or 20%, and $78 million, or 38%, in the respective national credits portfolios. The decrease in average residential mortgage loans in 2007 compared to 2006 reflects Peoples United Financials decision in the fourth quarter of 2006 to sell essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. As a result, residential mortgage loan balances are expected to continue to decline in the future until Peoples United Financial resumes adding such loans to its portfolio to an extent that more than offsets repayments. The decrease in average consumer loans primarily reflects a $9 million, or 1%, decline in average home equity loans following a nationwide pattern. The overall 9 basis point improvement in the yield on average earning assets in 2007 primarily reflects the investment of the net proceeds from the second step conversion discussed above, increases in market interest rates and the ongoing shift in asset mix, including the impact of the security sales. Average funding liabilities totaled $9.0 billion in 2007, down $287 million or 3% compared with 2006. Average core deposits decreased $83 million, or 1%, to $8.9 billion and comprised 98% of average funding liabilities, compared to 96% in 2006. Average non interest bearing core deposits decreased $57 million, or 3%, and average interest bearing core deposits decreased $26 million, or less than 1%, reflective of Peoples United Financials strategy of funding loan growth with proceeds from maturities, sales and repayments of securities rather than core deposits. The 30 basis point increase to 2.45% from 2.15% in the rate paid on average funding liabilities in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily reflects increases in market interest rates prevalent in most of 2007 and the ongoing shift in deposit mix. The rates paid on average core deposits increased 41 basis points in 2007, reflecting increases of 67 basis points in time deposits and 8 basis points in savings and money market deposits in response to rising market interest rates prevalent in most of 2007. The change in the mix of average interest bearing core deposits reflects a $323 million, or 10%, increase in higher rate time deposits, partially offset by a $349 million, or 10%, decline in savings and money market deposits, reflecting customers preferences for deposit products with higher interest rates. Average time deposits comprised 41% of average total core deposits, compared to 37% for 2006. Average purchased funds decreased $227 million, or 92%, and average subordinated notes decreased $40 million, or 38%, in 2007 compared to 2006. 40 Table of Contents 2006 Compared to 2005 Net interest income increased $13 million, or 3%, and the net interest margin improved 19 basis points to 3.87% in 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in net interest income reflects a $74 million increase in total interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $61 million increase in total interest expense. Average earning assets totaled $9.8 billion in 2006, a $173 million, or 2%, decrease from 2005, while the asset mix continued to shift. The shift in asset mix from securities to higher yielding loans continued to benefit the net interest margin. Average loans increased $715 million, or 9%, while average securities declined $934 million, or 54%, in 2006 compared to 2005. As a result, average loans and average securities comprised 91% and 8%, respectively, of average earning assets in 2006 compared to 82% and 17%, respectively, in 2005. The yield earned on the total loan portfolio was 6.10% in 2006 while the yield earned on securities was 3.74%, compared to 5.41% and 3.47%, respectively, in 2005. Loan growth reflects increases of $345 million, or 10%, in average residential mortgage loans, $285 million, or 8%, in average commercial banking loans and $85 million, or 7%, in average consumer loans in 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in average residential mortgage loans reflects, in part, the purchase of $170 million of adjustable rate mortgage loans towards the end of the first quarter of 2006. The growth in average commercial banking loans in 2006 compared to 2005 reflects a $183 million, or 35%, increase in average PCLC loans and a $127 million, or 10%, increase in average commercial loans, partially offset by a $25 million, or 1%, decrease in average commercial real estate loans. Included in average commercial loans and average commercial real estate loans were increases of $44 million, or 15%, and $59 million, or 40%, in the respective national credits portfolios. The growth in average consumer loans in 2006 compared to 2005 continues to reflect a shift in mix as an increase of $108 million, or 9%, in home equity loans was partially offset by a $21 million, or 81%, reduction in higher yielding unsecured national personal installment loans, which continue to run off as a result of a management decision to discontinue this type of lending. The significant decrease in the average securities portfolio in 2006 compared to 2005 reflects the substitution of securities with higher yielding loans as securities pay down and mature, as well as the partial impact of security sales during 2006 to better position Peoples United Financials balance sheet for the prevailing interest rate environment. Peoples United Financial sold $810 million and $266 million of debt securities in the third and second quarters of 2006, respectively, and used the proceeds to fund loan growth and pay down borrowings. In addition to funding loan growth, Peoples United Financial invested $50 million in the first quarter of 2006 and $150 million in the second quarter of 2005 in a bank owned life insurance program with proceeds from maturing securities. The earnings from bank owned life insurance are reported in non interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The overall 84 basis point improvement in the yield on average earning assets in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily reflects increases in market interest rates since June 2004 and the ongoing shift in asset mix. Average funding liabilities totaled $9.3 billion in 2006, down $113 million or 1% compared with 2005. Average core deposits increased $38 million, or less than 1%, to $8.9 billion and comprised 96% of average funding liabilities, compared to 95% in 2005. Average interest bearing core deposits increased $101 million, or 2%, and average non interest bearing core deposits decreased $63 million, or 3%, reflective of Peoples United Financials strategy of funding loan growth with proceeds from maturities, sales and repayments of securities rather than core deposits. 41 Table of Contents The 68 basis point increase to 2.15% from 1.47% in the rate paid on average funding liabilities in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily reflects increases in market interest rates since June 2004 and the ongoing shift in deposit mix. The rates paid on average core deposits increased 70 basis points in 2006, reflecting increases of 115 basis points in time deposits and 36 basis points in savings and money market deposits in response to rising market interest rates. The change in the mix of average interest bearing core deposits reflects a $660 million, or 25%, increase in higher rate time deposits, partially offset by a $559 million, or 14%, decline in savings and money market deposits, reflecting customers preferences for deposit products with higher interest rates given the prevailing interest rate environment. Average time deposits comprised 37% of average total core deposits, compared to 30% in 2005. Average purchased funds decreased $134 million, or 35%, and average subordinated notes decreased $16 million, or 13%, in 2006 compared to 2005. Average Balance, Interest and Yield/Rate Analysis The table on the following page presents average balance sheets, interest income, interest expense and the corresponding average yields earned and rates paid for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. The average balances are principally daily averages and, for loans, include both performing and non performing balances. Interest income on loans includes the effect of deferred loan fees and costs accounted for as yield adjustments, but does not include interest on loans for which Peoples United Financial has ceased to accrue interest. The impact of Peoples United Financials use of derivative instruments in managing interest rate risk is also reflected in the table, classified according to the instrument hedged and the risk management objective. 42 Table of Contents Average Balance, Interest and Yield/Rate Analysis 2007 2006 2005 Years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) AverageBalance Interest Yield/Rate AverageBalance Interest Yield/Rate AverageBalance Interest Yield/Rate Earning assets: Short term investments $ 1,709.4 $ 86.7 5.07 % $ 106.6 $ 5.3 4.97 % $ 54.5 $ 1.5 2.86 % Securities purchased under agreements to resell 959.1 48.3 5.03 16.6 0.8 4.98 22.8 1.0 4.22 Securities (1) 69.2 3.9 5.62 803.8 30.0 3.74 1,737.8 60.3 3.47 Loans: Residential mortgage 3,550.3 183.9 5.18 3,758.8 185.2 4.93 3,413.3 154.7 4.53 Commercial 2,441.5 167.6 6.86 2,135.7 146.5 6.86 1,825.5 108.7 5.95 Commercial real estate 1,807.3 127.7 7.07 1,765.1 126.0 7.14 1,790.5 116.2 6.49 Consumer 1,268.9 88.9 7.01 1,288.3 88.3 6.85 1,203.3 65.8 5.47 Total loans 9,068.0 568.1 6.27 8,947.9 546.0 6.10 8,232.6 445.4 5.41 Total earning assets $ 11,805.7 $ 707.0 5.99 % $ 9,874.9 $ 582.1 5.90 % $ 10,047.7 $ 508.2 5.06 % Funding liabilities: Deposits: Non interest bearing deposits $ 2,111.4 $ % $ 2,168.6 $ % $ 2,231.7 $ % Savings, interest bearing checking and money market 3,114.9 46.8 1.50 3,464.4 49.2 1.42 4,023.4 42.6 1.06 Time 3,632.0 165.8 4.56 3,308.7 128.8 3.89 2,648.8 72.6 2.74 Total core deposits 8,858.3 212.6 2.40 8,941.7 178.0 1.99 8,903.9 115.2 1.29 Non core deposits (2) 78.4 1.0 1.30 40.4 2.1 5.42 77.5 2.3 3.02 Total deposits 8,936.7 213.6 2.39 8,982.1 180.1 2.01 8,981.4 117.5 1.31 Borrowings: Federal funds purchased 3.3 0.2 5.23 158.2 7.6 4.78 250.5 7.9 3.19 FHLB advances 0.1 5.04 47.2 2.4 5.15 50.3 1.4 2.73 Repurchase agreements 1.7 0.1 2.41 Total borrowings 3.4 0.2 5.23 205.4 10.0 4.87 302.5 9.4 3.11 Subordinated notes 65.3 6.6 10.15 105.0 9.6 9.10 121.2 11.3 9.29 Total funding liabilities $ 9,005.4 $ 220.4 2.45 % $ 9,292.5 $ 199.7 2.15 % $ 9,405.1 $ 138.2 1.47 % Excess of earning assets over funding liabilities $ 2,800.3 $ 582.4 $ 642.6 Net interest income/spread $ 486.6 3.54 % $ 382.4 3.75 % $ 370.0 3.59 % Net interest margin 4.12 % 3.87 % 3.68 % (1) Average balances and yields for securities available for sale are based on amortized cost.

For each category of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, information is provided relating to: changes in volume (changes in average balances multiplied by the prior years average interest rate); changes in rates (changes in average interest rates multiplied by the prior years average balance); and the total change. Changes attributable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately. 2007 Compared to 2006Increase (Decrease) 2006 Compared to 2005Increase (Decrease) (in millions) Volume Rate Total Volume Rate Total Interest and dividend income: Short term investments $ 81.3 $ 0.1 $ 81.4 $ 2.1 $ 1.7 $ 3.8 Securities purchased under agreements to resell 47.4 0.1 47.5 (0.3 ) 0.1 (0.2 ) Securities (36.4 ) 10.3 (26.1 ) (34.6 ) 4.3 (30.3 ) Loans: Residential mortgage (10.5 ) 9.2 (1.3 ) 16.4 14.1 30.5 Commercial 21.0 0.1 21.1 20.0 17.8 37.8 Commercial real estate 3.0 (1.3 ) 1.7 (1.7 ) 11.5 9.8 Consumer (1.3 ) 1.9 0.6 4.9 17.6 22.5 Total loans 12.2 9.9 22.1 39.6 61.0 100.6 Total change in interest and dividend income 104.5 20.4 124.9 6.8 67.1 73.9 Interest expense: Deposits: Savings, interest bearing checking and money market (5.1 ) 2.7 (2.4 ) (6.5 ) 13.1 6.6 Time 13.4 23.6 37.0 20.9 35.3 56.2 Total core deposits 8.3 26.3 34.6 14.4 48.4 62.8 Non core deposits 1.2 (2.3 ) (1.1 ) (0.8 ) 0.6 (0.2 ) Total deposits 9.5 24.0 33.5 13.6 49.0 62.6 Borrowings: FHLB advances (2.4 ) (2.4 ) (0.1 ) 1.1 1.0 Federal funds purchased (8.0 ) 0.6 (7.4 ) (3.6 ) 3.3 (0.3 ) Repurchase agreements (0.1 ) (0.1 ) Total borrowings (10.4 ) 0.6 (9.8 ) (3.8 ) 4.4 0.6 Subordinated notes (3.9 ) 0.9 (3.0 ) (1.5 ) (0.2 ) (1.7 ) Total change in interest expense (4.8 ) 25.5 20.7 8.3 53.2 61.5 Change in net interest income $ 109.3 $ (5.1 ) $ 104.2 $ (1.5 ) $ 13.9 $ 12.4 44 Table of Contents The following table provides the weighted average yields earned and rates paid for each major category of earning assets and funding liabilities as of December 31, 2007.

Peoples United Financial has focused on enhancing these revenue streams by leveraging its commercial banking relationships, growing existing fee based revenue generating businesses, and strengthening its retail delivery network and products. 45 Table of Contents Total non interest income increased $38 million, or 26%, in 2007 compared to 2006, reflecting net security gains of $5.5 million in 2007 and net security losses of $27.4 million in 2006 (as part of balance sheet restructuring activities). Revenue from service charges on deposit accounts decreased $1.5 million, or 2%, compared to 2006, reflecting changes in consumer behavior related to overdrafts, and more customers qualifying for free ATM network transactions and free checking. Brokerage commissions increased $1.4 million, or 11%, compared to 2006, reflecting increases in mutual fund and annuity commissions. Other banking service charges and fees increased $0.7 million in 2007, primarily due to growth in retail banking fees associated with higher levels of Personal Identification Number (PIN) debit interchange fees resulting from customer preferences for debit card related transactions. PIN debit interchange refers to the revenue generated when a customer uses their PIN to make a purchase with their debit card. Peoples United Financial earns a portion of the purchase amount whenever its customers use their debit card at a retail merchant. This interchange is paid by the retail merchant. Securities gains in 2007 represent the sale of Peoples United Financials entire holdings of MasterCard Incorporated Class B Common Stock. Net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans increased $1.0 million in 2007, reflecting Peoples United Financials decision in the fourth quarter of 2006 to sell essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgages in the current interest rate environment. Residential mortgage sales volume increased 70% compared to 2006. BOLI income totaled $10.5 million in 2007 ($16.1 million on a taxable equivalent basis), compared to $9.1 million ($13.7 million on a taxable equivalent basis) in 2006. The $1.4 million, or 15%, increase primarily reflects death benefits of $1.1 million received in 2007. The increase in other non interest income compared to 2006 reflects a $3.8 million increase in rental income resulting from the higher level of equipment leased to PCLC customers. In addition, other non interest income in 2006 included a $0.7 million net gain from the sale of a large corporate insurance account by RC Knox, a $0.7 million gain from the redemption of common stock received in conjunction with the MasterCard Incorporated initial public offering given Peoples United Financials debit card business and $0.6 million of interest related to the completion of a federal tax audit. Total non interest income decreased $25.9 million, or 15%, in 2006 compared to 2005, reflecting net security losses of $27.4 million as part of balance sheet restructuring activities in 2006 and an $8.1 million gain on sale of branches in 2005. Revenue from service charges on deposit accounts increased $5.4 million, or 7%, compared to 2005, reflecting changes in Peoples United Financials fee structure implemented in both the second quarter of 2006 and the third quarter of 2005 to close the gap between Peoples United Financials pricing practices and those of the competition, partially offset by the impact of higher usage by the public of the cash back option at point of sale locations. Insurance revenue declined $0.7 million, or 2.5%, in 2006, reflecting industry wide trends for this business, characterized as a soft market with lower pricing for renewals, as well as reductions related to the sale of a large corporate account in the third quarter of 2006. Other banking service charges and fees increased $0.6 million in 2006 primarily due to growth in retail banking fees associated with higher levels of PIN debit interchange fees resulting from customer preferences for debit card related transactions. Other fees decreased $5.1 million, reflecting lower lending related charges and fees, primarily lower commercial real estate loan prepayment penalties. 46 Table of Contents As previously discussed, $1.1 billion of debt securities were sold in 2006, resulting in net security losses of $27.4 million. Peoples United Financial also sold $25 million in securities purchased under agreements to resell in 2006 at a loss of $0.3 million, which is reported in other non interest expense. These transactions were undertaken to better position Peoples United Financials balance sheet for the prevailing interest rate environment. Net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans decreased $2.0 million in 2006, reflecting lower residential mortgage loan origination volume and subsequent lower levels of fixed rate loan sales. Sales volume of fixed rate residential mortgage loans decreased approximately 40% in 2006, which is consistent with the 39% decrease in fixed rate residential mortgage originations compared to 2005. Residential mortgage originations totaled $1.1 billion in 2006, compared to $1.4 billion in 2005. Peoples United Financial invested an additional $50 million in the first quarter of 2006 in bank owned life insurance, after an initial investment of $150 million in the second quarter of 2005 to help defray the rising costs of employee benefits. Increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance are included in non interest income and totaled $9.1 million in 2006 ($13.7 million on a taxable equivalent basis), compared to $3.3 million ($5.1 million on a taxable equivalent basis) in 2005. The increase in other non interest income compared to 2005 reflects a $2.7 million increase in rental income resulting from the higher level of equipment leased to PCLC customers. In addition, other non interest income for the 2006 period includes a $0.7 million net gain from the sale of a large corporate insurance account by RC Knox, a $0.7 million gain from the redemption of common stock received in conjunction with the MasterCard Incorporated initial public offering given Peoples United Financials debit card business and $0.6 million of interest related to the completion of a federal tax audit.

The improvement in Peoples United Financials efficiency ratio in 2007 reflects a $112.6 million, or 20%, increase in revenue, partially offset by a $34.2 million, or 10%, increase in operating expenses. The increase in operating revenue reflects the increase in net interest income due to the investment of the net proceeds from the second step conversion. 47 Table of Contents Compensation and benefits increased $12.7 million, or 6%, compared to the 2006 period. The increase reflects amortization expense of $6.3 million related to the ESOP that was established in April 2007 and $2.6 million related to the October and December 2007 grants of restricted stock and stock options pursuant to the 2007 Recognition and Retention Plan and the 2007 Stock Option Plan, as well as higher compensation expense, reflecting normal merit increases, partially offset by lower pension expenses. Compensation expense in 2008 is expected to include a full year of amortization expense, totaling approximately $25 million, relating to the ESOP, the 2007 Recognition and Retention Plan, and the 2007 Stock Option Plan. Occupancy and equipment increased $4.9 million, or 8%, compared to the 2006 period. The increase primarily reflects higher rent related expense due to rate increases and additional branches. Professional and outside service fees increased $4.5 million, or 19%, compared to the 2006 period, reflecting higher costs for information technology related projects. Advertising and promotion increased $1.8 million, or 18%, compared to the 2006 period, primarily due to costs associated with the rebranding of the Bank as a result of Peoples Bank changing its name to Peoples United Bank on June 6, 2007. The increase in other non interest expense compared to 2006 primarily reflects a $2.8 million increase in the amortization of equipment leased to PCLC customers and higher insurance costs and regulatory assessment fees. Total non interest expense in 2006 increased $2.5 million, or 1%, compared to 2005, primarily reflecting higher compensation and benefits and lower professional and outside service fees. The improvement in Peoples United Financials efficiency ratio in 2006 reflects a $22.8 million, or 4%, increase in revenue. Total non interest expense in 2006 included the following items: severance related expenses totaling $1.6 million (recorded to compensation and benefits); a $0.3 million charge related to the sale of $25 million of securities purchased under agreements to resell as part of balance sheet restructuring activities (recorded to other non interest expense); and a $0.9 million charge related to the resolution of an RC Knox contingency (recorded to other non interest expense). Total non interest expense in 2005 included the following items: liability restructuring costs of $2.7 million; a $0.7 million charge related to the accelerated vesting of stock options (recorded to compensation and benefits); and a $2.0 million goodwill impairment charge. Excluding these expenses from the respective years, total non interest expense in 2006 would have increased $5.1 million, or 2%, compared to 2005. Compensation and benefits increased $6.5 million, or 3%, compared to the 2005 period, after excluding the items discussed above. The increase reflects the combination of normal merit increases, higher accruals for incentive compensation, and increased pension costs, partially offset by lower health care expenses. On September 29, 2006, Peoples United Financial contributed $91.5 million to its employee retirement plan, representing the maximum deductible contribution per Internal Revenue Service rules. Professional and outside service fees decreased $1.8 million, or 7%, compared to the 2005 period, reflecting lower utilization of information technology contractors and lower costs for Peoples United Financials declining national consumer loan portfolio, partially offset by higher legal costs related to Peoples United Financials conversion to a federal charter and costs related to infrastructure initiatives. The increase in other non interest expense compared to 2005 primarily reflects a $2.0 million increase in the amortization of equipment leased to PCLC customers, partially offset by lower operational charge offs. The $2.0 million goodwill impairment charge in 2005 related to the decision to combine Olson Mobeck Investment Advisors, Inc. with one of Peoples United Financials other businesses in the consumer financial services business segment. 48 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, totaled $1.5 million, $2.3 million and $11.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes an after tax charge of $0.5 million and for the year ended December 31, 2005 includes after tax income of $6.2 million from the resolution of contingencies related to the sale of Peoples United Financials credit card business in 2004. See Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Peoples United Financial continues to generate recoveries from collection efforts on previously charged off credit card accounts that were not included in the sale of the credit card business. These recoveries are included in income from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Recoveries, net of collection costs, totaled $2.3 million, $4.1 million and $7.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As the level of recoveries continues to decline due to the aging and diminishing pool of charged off accounts, discontinued operations results are not expected to be reported separately in the Consolidated Statements of Income in future periods. Income Taxes Income tax expense from continuing operations totaled $75.5 million, $57.8 million and $64.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income tax benefits of $2.4 million and $2.0 million are included in income tax expense from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These benefits relate to certain prior year tax matters, including the completion of federal tax audits in 2005 and 2004. Excluding these benefits from the respective years, Peoples United Financials effective income tax rate from continuing operations would have been 33.6%, 33.5% and 34.8% for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The lower effective income tax rates for 2007 and 2006 compared to 2005 primarily reflects the higher level of tax exempt bank owned life insurance income earned in 2007 and 2006. Peoples United Financials effective income tax rate is expected to increase slightly beginning in 2008 due to a higher level of non deductible expenses and an increase in state income tax liability, both resulting from the Chittenden acquisition. Income tax expense for all three years reflects the state tax benefit resulting from the formation of Peoples Mortgage Investment Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Peoples United Bank. The formation of this subsidiary was a result of Connecticut tax legislation, which became effective on January 1, 1999, that allows for the transfer of mortgage loans to a passive investment subsidiary. The related earnings of the subsidiary, and any dividends it pays to the parent, are not subject to Connecticut income tax. 49 Table of Contents Earning Assets The discussion of earning assets has been grouped into Treasury, Consumer Financial Services and Commercial Banking.

Securities available for sale are used as part of Peoples United Financials asset/liability management strategy and may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, factors such as changes in market conditions and interest rates, changes in security prepayment rates, liquidity considerations and regulatory capital requirements. Peoples United Financial primarily invests in debt securities rated in the four highest categories assigned by a nationally recognized statistical ratings organization. Management has internal guidelines for the credit quality and duration of Peoples United Financials debt securities portfolio and monitors these on a regular basis. Peoples United Financial strives to maintain an appropriate balance between loan portfolio growth and core deposit funding. Peoples United Financials management currently believes that, other than for transitional deployment of excess core deposits or excess equity, a large securities portfolio funded with wholesale borrowings provides limited economic value. As part of this focus, Peoples United Financial has reduced its securities portfolio by $3.2 billion since December 31, 2002 and increased its loans by $2.3 billion over the same period. Peoples United Financial has also reduced borrowings by $2.4 billion since year end 2002. 50 Table of Contents At December 31, 2007, Peoples United Financials securities portfolio totaled $61 million, or less than one half of one percent of total assets, and had no wholesale borrowings, which represent positions well below industry averages. At December 31, 2006, Peoples United Financials securities portfolio totaled $78 million, a $1.3 billion, or 88%, decline from year end 2005. In 2006, Peoples United Financial sold approximately $1.1 billion of debt securities as part of the restructuring of its balance sheet. Realized losses from these sales of $27.4 million are included in net security losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the book value and the market value of the securities available for sale portfolio were approximately equivalent, compared to net unrealized losses of $28.9 million at year end 2005. The significant reduction in the unrealized loss in 2006 reflects the sale of securities during 2006 and the resulting significantly smaller securities portfolio. All unrealized gains and those unrealized losses representing temporary declines in value are recorded in stockholders equity, net of income taxes. As a result, management anticipates continued fluctuations in stockholders equity due to changes in the fair value of these securities, albeit on a much smaller scale due to the size and short duration of the portfolio. The duration of the debt securities portfolio was approximately 0.02 years at December 31, 2007, compared to 0.07 years at December 31, 2006. For a discussion of the regulatory capital treatment of unrealized gains and losses, see Capital on page 68. Lending Activities Peoples United Financial conducts its lending activities through its two major business segments that constitute its core businesses: Consumer Financial Services and Commercial Banking. Peoples United Financials lending activities consist of originating loans secured by residential and commercial properties, and extending secured and unsecured loans to consumers and businesses. Total loans decreased $422 million, or 5%, in 2007 compared to 2006, after increases of 9% in 2006 and 8% in 2005. The decrease in 2007 reflects a decline of $758 million, or 15%, in Consumer Financial Services, partially offset by an increase of $336 million, or 8%, in Commercial Banking. The $687 million decrease in residential mortgage loans in 2007 reflects Peoples United Financials decision in the fourth quarter of 2006 to sell essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans due to the low spreads on such loans in the current interest rate environment. The following table summarizes the loan portfolio. Amounts represent gross loans before deducting the allowance for loan losses.

These include conventional fixed rate loans, jumbo fixed rate loans (loans with principal balances greater than established Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae limits), adjustable rate loans, sometimes referred to as ARM loans, interest only loans (loans where payments made by the borrower consist of only interest for a set period of time, before the payments change to principal and interest), as well as Federal Housing Authority insured loans and Connecticut Housing Finance Authority loans. Peoples United Financial originates these loans through its network of branches and calling officers, as well as in the wholesale market, which accounted for approximately 21%, 66% and 59% of Peoples United Financials mortgage loan originations for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decline in wholesale originations reflects Peoples United Financials decision in the fourth quarter of 2006 to sell essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. 52 Table of Contents At December 31, 2007 and 2006, 91% and 92%, respectively, of the residential mortgage loan portfolio was secured by properties located in Connecticut. Included in residential mortgage loans are construction loans totaling $96 million and $188 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2007, Peoples United Financials level of residential mortgage originations declined to $431 million, compared to $1.1 billion in 2006 and $1.4 billion in 2005. The mix and volume of residential mortgage loan originations vary in response to changes in market interest rates and customer preferences. Adjustable rate loans accounted for 27% of total residential mortgage originations in 2007, compared to 77% and 73% for 2006 and 2005, respectively. At December 31, 2007, the residential mortgage loan portfolio included $1.8 billion of interest only loans of which $158 million are stated income loans, compared to $2.1 billion and $180 million respectively, at December 31, 2006. Peoples United Financials underwriting practices and credit review standards for such loans are generally consistent with those applied to other types of residential mortgage loan products. Peoples United Financial began originating interest only residential mortgage loans in March 2003. The underwriting guidelines and requirements are more restrictive for interest only loans than for amortizing adjustable rate mortgages. More specifically, properties must be single family and owner occupied primary residences, loan to value ratios are lower, higher credit scores are required, post closing reserve requirements are greater, and there are limits on cash out refinances as compared to amortizing adjustable rate mortgages. Amortization of an interest only loan begins after the initial interest rate change (e.g. after 5 years for a 5/1 adjustable rate mortgage). Stated income loans represent a form of reduced documentation loan that requires a potential borrower to complete a standard mortgage application with full verification of the borrowers asset information as contained in the loan application, but no verification of the provided income information. As with interest only loans, underwriting guidelines for stated income loans require properties to be single family and owner occupied primary residences with lower loan to value ratios and higher credit scores. In addition, stated income loans require the receipt of an appraisal for the real estate used as collateral and a credit report on the prospective borrower. Peoples United Financials loan loss experience within the residential mortgage portfolio in 2007 was consistent with the level of loan losses sustained in prior years and continues to be primarily attributable to a small number of loans. Adjustable rate residential loans at December 31, 2007 decreased $682 million compared to year end 2006, while fixed rate mortgage loans decreased $5 million. Total adjustable rate residential loans increased $395 million in 2006 compared to year end 2005, while fixed rate mortgage loans decreased $3 million. Historically, Peoples United Financial has held virtually all of the adjustable rate residential mortgage loans that it originates on its balance sheet and has sold virtually all of the fixed rate residential mortgage loans that it originates into the secondary market. In 2006, Peoples United Financial completed a reassessment of its pricing with respect to adjustable rate residential mortgage loans in light of the prevailing interest rate environment at that time. As a result, Peoples United Financial made the decision in the fourth quarter of 2006 to sell essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. Peoples United Financial continues to actively offer residential mortgage loans of all types through its extensive distribution system. However, the level of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans it originated was reduced significantly in 2007 and may decline further. 53 Table of Contents Residential mortgage loan balances are expected to continue to decline in the future until Peoples United Financial resumes adding such loans to its portfolio to an extent that more than offsets repayments. The continued performance of the residential mortgage loan portfolio in 2008 may be adversely impacted by the level and direction of interest rates, consumer preferences and the regional economy. Residential Mortgage Originations Years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) Residential Mortgage Originations by Product Year ended December 31, 2007 (percent) Consumer Lending As of December 31 (in millions) 2007 2006 Home equity credit lines $ 938.5 $ 1,010.8 Second mortgages 285.9 279.8 Personal installment loans 10.8 14.1 Other loans 15.6 16.6 Total consumer $ 1,250.8 $ 1,321.3 Peoples United Financial offers Connecticut based customers home equity credit lines and second mortgage loans, and to a lesser extent, other forms of installment and revolving credit loans. In the first quarter of 2006, Peoples began offering home equity credit lines and loans in Massachusetts and New York. Future growth of Peoples United Financials consumer loan portfolio is highly dependent upon economic conditions, the interest rate environment and competitors strategies, as well as the success of Peoples United Financials marketing programs and information based strategies. At both December 31, 2007 and 2006, approximately 99% of the consumer loan portfolio was to customers located in Connecticut. The decrease in consumer loans primarily reflects a decline in home equity lending. Home equity loans decreased $66 million, or 5%, since year end 2006, following a nationwide pattern. 54 Table of Contents Commercial Banking The Commercial Banking lending businesses include commercial real estate, commercial and industrial lending and equipment financing by PCLC. Shared national credits are included in the commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending portfolios. In January 2008, Peoples United Financial announced its decision to unwind its shared national credits portfolio in an orderly manner over the next two to three years.

Historically, Peoples United Financials primary strategy has been to focus on lending in the state of Connecticut and adjacent states that represent its home market. In addition, Peoples United Financial will purchase interests in out of state loan participations. Included in commercial real estate loans are shared national credits totaling $284 million, $209 million and $143 million at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Peoples United Financials highest loan concentration in the commercial real estate loan portfolio was in the residential sector, which represented 27% of this loan portfolio at December 31, 2007, compared to 29% at December 31, 2006 and 25% at year end 2005. Commercial Real Estate Portfolio As of December 31 (dollars in millions) At December 31, 2007, approximately 65% of Peoples United Financials commercial real estate portfolio was secured by properties located in Connecticut, compared to approximately 68% at December 31, 2006. In addition, approximately 16% of the commercial real estate portfolio was secured by properties located in New York and Florida at December 31, 2007 and no other state exposure was greater than 5%. Included in the commercial real estate portfolio are construction loans totaling $607 million, $541 million and $512 million at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 55 Table of Contents Commercial real estate is dependent on the successful operation of the related income producing real estate. Accordingly, the income streams generated by this portfolio can be impacted by changes in the real estate market and, to a large extent, Connecticuts economy. The commercial real estate portfolio increased 6% in 2007 after slightly (0.5%) increasing in 2006 and decreasing 3% in 2005. Peoples United Financials continues to focus on maintaining strong asset quality standards in a competitive market generally characterized by aggressive pricing and less attractive underwriting terms. The growth and performance of this portfolio is largely dependent on the economic environment in Connecticut and may be adversely impacted if the economy slows in 2008. Commercial Real Estate Diversification As of December 31, 2007 (percent) Commercial and Industrial Lending As of December 31 (in millions) 2007 2006 Industry: Finance, insurance and real estate $ 425.6 $ 354.7 Manufacturing 386.1 412.1 Service 268.6 230.2 Wholesale distribution 153.3 119.9 Retail sales 121.9 113.6 Health services 115.4 108.5 Arts/entertainment/recreation 51.7 61.8 Transportation/utility 41.5 26.4 Other 54.8 66.6 Total commercial and industrial lending $ 1,618.9 $ 1,493.8 Peoples United Financial provides diversified products and services to its commercial customers, including short term working capital credit facilities, term financing, asset based loans, letters of credit, cash management services and commercial deposit accounts. Commercial products are generally packaged together to create a financing solution specifically tailored to the needs of the customer. Taking a total relationship focused approach with commercial customers to meet their financing needs has resulted in substantial growth in non interest bearing deposits over time, as well as in opportunities to provide other banking services to principals and employees of these commercial customers. The borrowers ability to repay a commercial loan is closely tied to the ongoing profitability and cash flow of the borrowers business. Consequently, a commercial loan tends to be more directly impacted by changes in economic cycles that affect businesses generally and the borrowers business specifically. The availability of adequate collateral is a factor in commercial loan decisions, and loans are generally collateralized and or guaranteed by third parties. 56 Table of Contents In 2007, the commercial and industrial lending portfolio increased $125 million, or 8%, compared to increases of $100 million, or 7%, in 2006 and $159 million or 13% in 2005. The increase in 2007 includes an $86 million, or 23%, increase in shared national credits, compared to an increase of $47 million, or 15%, for the full year of 2006. Included in commercial lending are shared national credits totaling $454 million, $368 million and $321 million at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. At December 31, 2007, approximately 66% of the commercial loan portfolio consisted of loans to Connecticut based businesses, compared to approximately 66% and 69% at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Commercial loan exposure in the states of California and New York totaled 16% at December 31, 2007 and no other state exposure was greater than 5%. While Peoples United Financial continues to focus on asset quality, the performance of the commercial lending portfolio may be adversely impacted if the economy slows in 2008. Commercial and Industrial Lending Diversification As of December 31, 2007 (percent) Commercial and Industrial Lending Portfolio As of December 31 (dollars in millions) Shared National Credits At December 31, 2007, the shared national credits loan portfolio totaled $738 million, compared to $577 million and $464 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and represented 16%, 14% and 12% of the total Commercial Banking loan portfolio at the respective dates. As discussed above, included in the shared national credits portfolio at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were commercial loans totaling $454 million, $368 million and $321 million, respectively, and commercial real estate loans totaling $284 million, $209 million and $143 million, respectively. In January 2008, Peoples United Financial announced its decision to unwind its shared national credits portfolio in an orderly manner over the next two to three years. 57 Table of Contents Peoples United Financial will purchase interests in shared national credits from and to other financial institutions having comparable asset quality standards. At December 31, 2007, the shared national credits loan portfolio consisted only of loans purchased from other financial institutions. At December 31, 2007, approximately $53 million, or 7%, of the shared national credits loan portfolio consisted of borrowers who are headquartered in Connecticut, while approximately $346 million, or 47%, consisted of borrowers located in California, Florida and New York. No other state exposure was greater than 8%.

PCLC will buy or sell portions of financing transactions in the secondary market to manage the concentration risk of the overall portfolio. At December 31, 2007, approximately 2% of the portfolio consisted of loans to Connecticut based businesses, while approximately 42% were loans to customers located in Texas, California, Florida, Illinois and New York. No other state exposure was greater than 5%. The PCLC portfolio grew $112 million, or 13%, in 2007, after increasing $235 million, or 37%, in 2006 and $182 million, or 40%, in 2005, reflecting managements decision to grow this portfolio. Operating on a national scale, PCLC represented 22% of the Commercial Banking loan portfolio at December 31, 2007, compared to 21% and 17% at year end 2006 and 2005, respectively. Based on the level of growth in this portfolio, the percentage increase in 2008 may not continue at recent levels. PCLC Diversification As of December 31, 2007 (percent) 58 Table of Contents PCLC Loan Portfolio As of December 31 (dollars in millions) Asset Quality The past several months have been marked by significant volatility in the financial and capital markets. This volatility has been attributable to a number of factors, including the fallout associated with the subprime mortgage market. This disruption has, in turn, led to credit and liquidity concerns which have resulted in a significant deterioration in activity within the secondary mortgage market. All of these issues have been further exacerbated by an accelerated softening of the real estate market. Subprime mortgage lending, which has been the riskiest sector of the residential housing market, is not a market Peoples United Financial has ever pursued. Further, Peoples United Financial has avoided exposure to similar, high risk Alt A loans and structured investment vehicles. While Peoples United Financial continues to adhere to prudent underwriting standards, the loan portfolio is geographically diverse and, therefore, is not immune to potential negative consequences arising as a result of general economic weakness and, in particular, a sharp downturn in the housing market on a national scale. Decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for loans. In addition, adverse changes in the economy could have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make scheduled loan payments, which would likely have an adverse impact on earnings. Further, an increase in loan delinquencies may serve to decrease net interest income and adversely impact loan loss experience, resulting in an increased provision and allowance for loan losses. Peoples United Financial actively manages asset quality through its underwriting practices and collection operations. Underwriting practices tend to focus on optimizing the return of a given risk classification while collection operations focus on minimizing losses once an account becomes delinquent. The allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses charged to income. Losses on loans, including impaired loans, are charged to the allowance for loan losses when all or a portion of a loan is deemed to be uncollectible. Recoveries of loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance for loan losses when realized. Peoples United Financial maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that is believed to be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio, based on a quarterly evaluation of a variety of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to: Peoples United Financial historical loan loss experience and recent trends in that experience; risk ratings assigned by lending personnel to commercial real estate, commercial and PCLC loans, and the results of ongoing reviews of those ratings by Peoples United Financial independent loan review function; an evaluation of non performing loans and related collateral values; the probability of loss in view of geographic and industry concentrations and other portfolio risk characteristics; the present financial condition of borrowers; and current economic conditions. Although Peoples United Financial seeks to use the best available information to make these evaluations, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions, results of regulatory examinations, further information obtained regarding known problem loans, the identification of additional problem loans and other factors. 59 Table of Contents Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses The following table presents the activity in the allowance for loan losses and ratios: Years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Beginning allowance for loan losses $ 74.0 $ 75.0 $ 72.5 $ 70.5 $ 69.2 Charge offs: Commercial (7.0 ) (5.2 ) (0.9 ) (0.6 ) (1.2 ) Consumer (2.7 ) (3.4 ) (4.9 ) (9.7 ) (16.8 ) PCLC (1.8 ) (0.6 ) (3.1 ) (1.5 ) (2.0 ) Commercial real estate (0.1 ) (3.2 ) Residential mortgage (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.2 ) (0.1 ) Total charge offs (11.5 ) (9.3 ) (9.1 ) (15.2 ) (20.1 ) Recoveries: Commercial 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.3 1.4 Consumer 1.1 1.6 2.0 2.8 2.9 PCLC 0.1 0.3 0.3 0.5 0.1 Commercial real estate 0.1 2.5 0.1 0.1 0.2 Residential mortgage 0.6 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.1 Total recoveries 2.2 4.9 3.0 3.9 4.7 Net loan charge offs (9.3 ) (4.4 ) (6.1 ) (11.3 ) (15.4 ) Provision for loan losses 8.0 3.4 8.6 13.3 16.7 Ending allowance for loan losses $ 72.7 $ 74.0 $ 75.0 $ 72.5 $ 70.5 Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans 0.81 % 0.79 % 0.87 % 0.91 % 0.99 % Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non performing loans 357.8 327.9 352.5 264.6 208.4 The provision for loan losses in 2007 totaled $8.0 million, a $4.6 million increase compared to $3.4 million in 2006. The 2007 period reflects $9.3 million in net loan charge offs, partially offset by a $1.3 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses. The 2006 period reflected net loan charge offs of $4.4 million and a $1.0 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses. Net loan charge offs increased $4.9 million in 2007 compared to 2006. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.81% at December 31, 2007 and 0.79% at December 31, 2006. Commercial loan net charge offs in 2007 include a $5.9 million charge off relating to one commercial banking loan that was placed on non accrual status in the fourth quarter of 2006 as previously disclosed. Consumer loan net charge offs decreased $0.2 million, or 10%, in 2007, as decreases of $0.3 million and $0.2 million in national consumer loan net charge offs and charge offs related to consumer overdrafts, respectively, were partially offset by a $0.2 million increase in home equity loan net charge offs. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average total loans equaled 0.10% in 2007, up from 0.05% in 2006, reflecting the $4.9 million increase in net loan charge offs and the impact on the ratio of a $120 million, or 1%, increase in average loans, both as compared to 2006. The very low level of net loan charge offs in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of average loans is unlikely to be sustainable in the future. The provision for loan losses decreased $5.2 million in 2006 compared to 2005, reflecting lower net loan charge offs in 2006 and a $1.0 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses in 2006, compared to a $2.5 million increase in the allowance for loan losses in 2005. Net loan charge offs in 2006 declined $1.7 million, or 28%, compared to 2005. Commercial loan net charge offs in 2006 reflect a $4.0 million charge off relating to 60 Table of Contents one commercial banking loan that was placed on non accrual status in the second quarter of 2006. Consumer loan net charge offs decreased $1.2 million, or 39%, reflecting a $1.9 million decrease in national consumer loan net charge offs. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average total loans decreased 2 basis points to 0.05% in 2006 compared to 0.07% in 2005. In addition to the $1.7 million decrease in net loan charge offs, the improvement in the net loan charge off ratio reflected a $715 million, or 9%, increase in average total loans.

These decreases were partially offset by an increase to the allowance for loan losses and a corresponding increase to the provision for loan losses by $2.3 million for the PCLC loan portfolio (reflecting loan growth in 2007) and by $0.2 million for the commercial real estate loan portfolio. As a result of these changes, the total allowance for loan losses declined by $1.3 million in 2007. A loan is classified as non accrual generally when it becomes 90 days past due as to interest or principal payments. All previously accrued but unpaid interest on non accrual loans is reversed from interest income in the current period. Interest payments received on non accrual loans (including impaired loans) are generally applied as a reduction of principal if future collections are doubtful, although such interest payments may be recognized 61 Table of Contents as income. A loan remains on non accrual status until the factors that indicated doubtful collectibility no longer exist or until a loan is determined to be uncollectible and is charged off against the allowance for loan losses. The classification of a loan as non performing does not necessarily indicate that loan principal and interest ultimately will not be collected. Peoples United Financial historical experience suggests that a portion of these assets will eventually be recovered. All non performing loans are in various stages of collection, workout, settlement or foreclosure. When loan workout efforts are exhausted and it is determined that the borrower is unable to repay the obligation, Peoples United Financial will complete foreclosure procedures, if applicable. Restructured commercial and commercial real estate loans are those for which concessions to below market terms, such as below market interest rates or deferral of interest, have been granted due to the borrowers financial condition. Non Performing Assets The following table presents information regarding non accrual loans, restructured loans, real estate owned and repossessed assets: As of December 31 (dollars in millions) 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Non accrual loans: Residential mortgage $ 8.9 $ 6.7 $ 6.7 $ 7.5 $ 11.4 Commercial real estate 3.7 0.2 5.8 8.7 11.4 Consumer 3.3 1.7 1.3 0.9 2.5 PCLC 3.1 2.1 6.2 5.1 4.2 Commercial 1.3 11.9 1.3 5.2 3.3 Total non accrual loans 20.3 22.6 21.3 27.4 32.8 Restructured loans 1.0 Total non performing loans 20.3 22.6 21.3 27.4 33.8 Real estate owned (REO) and repossessed assets, net 5.8 0.1 0.7 1.2 0.5 Total non performing assets $ 26.1 $ 22.7 $ 22.0 $ 28.6 $ 34.3 Non performing loans as a percentage of total loans 0.23 % 0.24 % 0.25 % 0.35 % 0.48 % Non performing assets as a percentage of total loans, REO and repossessed assets 0.29 0.24 0.26 0.36 0.48 Non performing assets as a percentage of stockholders equity and allowance for loan losses 0.58 1.61 1.62 2.25 3.20 Total non performing assets increased $3.4 million, or 15%, from December 31, 2006 and were 0.29% of total loans, real estate owned and repossessed assets at December 31, 2007. Increases in non performing commercial real estate loans of $3.5 million, REO and repossessed assets of $5.7 million, non performing PCLC loans of $1.0 million and non performing residential mortgage loans of $2.2 million, were partially offset by a decrease of $10.6 million in non performing commercial loans. The decrease in non performing commercial loans primarily reflects the $5.9 million charge off related to one loan discussed above. The increase in non performing commercial real estate loans reflects one loan totaling $3.4 million that was classified as non performing in 2007. The increase in REO and repossessed assets primarily reflects the repossession of a printing press and ancillary equipment from one borrower and the transfer to real estate owned of the real estate securing the remaining balance of the non performing commercial loan discussed above. Total non performing assets at December 31, 2006 increased $0.7 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2005 and improved 2 basis points to 0.24% of total loans, real estate owned and repossessed assets at December 31, 2006. Reductions of $5.6 million and $4.1 million in non performing commercial real estate and PCLC loans, respectively, were essentially offset by a $10.6 million increase in non performing commercial loans. The net increase in non performing commercial loans since December 31, 2005 reflects one $10.6 million loan that was classified as non performing in the fourth quarter of 2006. The decrease in non performing commercial real 62 Table of Contents estate loans since December 31, 2005 reflects the favorable resolution of one non performing loan that generated a $2.3 million cash recovery. The level of non performing assets is expected to fluctuate in response to changing economic and market conditions, and the relative sizes of the respective loan portfolios, along with managements degree of success in resolving problem assets. At December 31, 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003, Peoples United Financials portfolio did not include any loans, not included in the table above, which are troubled debt restructurings as defined in SFAS No. 15, Accounting by Debtors and Creditors for Troubled Debt Restructurings. As of December 31, 2007, if all non accruing loans had been current in accordance with their terms and had been outstanding throughout 2007 or since origination if held for part of the year, the gross interest income that would have been recorded in 2007 on such loans would have amounted to approximately $2.3 million. The amount of interest income on the non accruing loans included in net income in 2007 was $0.7 million. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Detailed discussions pertaining to Peoples United Financials off balance sheet arrangements are included in the following sections: Funding, Liquidity, Capital and Market Risk Management. Funding At the current time, Peoples United Financials primary funding sources are deposits and stockholders equity, which represent 98% of total assets at December 31, 2007. Borrowings also are an available source of funding. Based on Peoples United Banks membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston and the level of qualifying collateral available at December 31, 2007, Peoples United Bank had up to $3.1 billion of borrowing capacity in the form of advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston and Federal Reserve Bank, and repurchase agreements. Peoples United Bank also had unsecured borrowing capacity of $1.1 billion at December 31, 2007.

Peoples United Financial provides customers access to their deposits through 79 traditional branches, 75 full service Stop & Shop supermarket branches, seven limited service branches, over 250 ATMs, telephone banking and an Internet banking site that is fully integrated with Peoples United Financials brokerage subsidiary, PSI. Core deposits equaled 65% and 85% of total assets at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. While core deposits declined by $204 million, or 2%, from year end 2006, the change in the relative percentage of total assets reflects the $2.9 billion increase in total assets primarily with the net proceeds from the second step conversion. Core deposits and stockholders equity constituted over 99% of Peoples United Financials funding base at December 31, 2007 and over 98% at December 31, 2006. The expansion of Peoples United Financials branch network and its commitment to developing full service relationships with its customers are integral components of Peoples United Financials strategy to leverage the success of its supermarket banking initiative, expand market share and continue growing deposits. At December 31, 2007, Peoples United Financials statewide network of Stop & Shop branches held deposits totaling $2.1 billion and deposits in supermarket branches open for more than one year averaged $28 million per store. In 2007, Peoples United Financial expanded into Westchester County in New York State by opening 2 new traditional branches in Scarsdale and Mount Kisco. Peoples United Financial plans to continue its branch expansion by opening both traditional and Stop & Shop branches in Connecticut and traditional branches in New York. Non interest bearing deposits are an important source of low cost funding and fee income for Peoples United Financial. In addition, Peoples United Financial believes that checking accounts represent one of the core relationships between a financial institution and its customers, and it is from these relationships that cross selling of other financial services can be achieved. Non interest bearing core deposits equaled 24% and 25% of core deposits at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Time deposits of $100,000 or more totaled $972 million at December 31, 2007, of which $463 million mature within three months, $234 million mature after three months but within six months, $243 million mature after six months but within one year and $32 million mature after one year. There were no brokered certificates of deposit at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Commercial deposits fund a significant portion of the loan portfolio. Average non interest bearing commercial deposits totaled $883 million in 2007, a $56 million, or 6%, decrease compared to 2006. Average non interest bearing commercial deposits decreased by $43 million, or 4%, in 2006, after increasing by $43 million, or 5%, in 2005. The decreases in 2007 and 2006 are reflective of the interest rate environment in each year. The following table presents, by rate category, time deposits as of December 31, 2007.

Peoples United Financial uses federal funds purchased as a source of funds, which are typically unsecured overnight loans among banks. Sources include three of the twelve regional Federal Home Loan Banks and several money center and large regional banks. In previous years, Peoples United Financials primary source for borrowings was advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, which provides credit for member institutions within its assigned region. Peoples United Financials outstanding Federal Home Loan Bank advances at December 31, 2005 represented less than one half of one percent of total assets. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, there were no outstanding Federal Home Loan Bank advances. The average balances of Peoples United Financials advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston during 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $0.1 million, $47 million and $50 million, respectively, and the maximum Federal Home Loan Bank advances outstanding during 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $1 million, $155 million and $190 million, respectively. Another source of funds in previous years has been repurchase agreements. These transactions involve the sale of securities to broker/dealers under agreements to repurchase the same (or substantially the same) securities. Repurchase agreements with broker/dealers are limited to Reporting Federal Reserve Dealers in government securities that have been approved by Peoples United Financials Board of Directors. Subordinated Notes At December 31, 2007 and 2006, Peoples United Bank had $65 million of 9.875% subordinated notes outstanding. These subordinated notes are due in 2010 and are unsecured general obligations of Peoples United Bank with interest payable semi annually, are subordinated to the claims of depositors and Peoples United Banks other creditors and are not redeemable prior to maturity. They qualify, up to certain limits, as supplementary (tier 2) capital for risk based capital purposes. Contractual Cash Obligations The following table is a summary of Peoples United Financials contractual cash obligations, other than deposit liabilities, including operating leases. Additional information concerning these contractual cash obligations is included in Notes 11, 12 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase obligations included in the table represent those agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions. A substantial majority of Peoples United Financials purchase obligations are renewable on a year to year basis. As such, the purchase obligations included in this table only reflect the contractual commitment.

See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of Peoples United Financials uncertain income tax positions. 66 Table of Contents Liquidity Liquidity is defined as the ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet all present and future funding requirements at reasonable costs. Liquidity management addresses Peoples United Financials and Peoples United Banks ability to fund new loans and investments as opportunities arise, to meet customer deposit withdrawals and to repay borrowings and subordinated notes as they mature. Peoples United Financials, as well as Peoples United Banks, liquidity positions are monitored daily by management. The Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO) of Peoples United Bank has been authorized by the Board of Directors of Peoples United Financial to set guidelines to ensure maintenance of prudent levels of liquidity for Peoples United Financial as well as for Peoples United Bank. ALCO reports to the Treasury and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors of Peoples United Bank. Asset liquidity is provided by: cash; short term investments; proceeds from security sales, maturities and principal repayments; and proceeds from scheduled principal collections, prepayments and sales of loans. In addition, certain securities may be used to collateralize borrowings under repurchase agreements. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows present data on cash provided by and used in Peoples United Financials operating, investing and financing activities. At December 31, 2007, Peoples United Financials liquid assets included $428 million in securities purchased under agreements to resell. Peoples United Banks liquid assets included $2.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $42 million in debt securities available for sale and $19 million in trading account securities. Securities available for sale with a total fair value of $22 million at December 31, 2007 were pledged as collateral for public deposits and for other purposes. Liability liquidity is measured by Peoples United Financials and Peoples United Banks ability to obtain core deposits and purchased funds at cost effective rates that are diversified with respect to markets and maturities. Core deposits, which are considered the most stable source of liability liquidity, totaled $8.8 billion at December 31, 2007, compared to $9.0 billion at December 31, 2006 (representing 66% and 86% of total funding at the respective dates). While core deposits declined $204 million, or 2%, since year end 2006, the change in relative percentage mix of total funding is primarily due to the substantial increase in stockholders equity with the net proceeds from the second step conversion. Purchased funds can be used from time to time to diversify Peoples United Financials funding mix and to support asset growth. Purchased funds totaled $45 million at December 31, 2007 and $47 million at December 31, 2006 (representing 0.3% and 0.5% of total funding at the respective dates). Peoples United Banks current sources of purchased funds include: federal funds purchased, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, municipal deposits and repurchase agreements. At December 31, 2007, Peoples United Banks borrowing limit from Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank advances, and repurchase agreements totaled $3.1 billion, based on the level of qualifying collateral available for these borrowing sources and in addition, Peoples United Bank had unsecured borrowing capacity of $1.1 billion. At December 31, 2007, Peoples United Bank had outstanding commitments to originate loans totaling $951 million and approved, but unused, lines of credit extended to customers totaling $2.7 billion (including $1.6 billion of home equity lines of credit). See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 67 Table of Contents The sources of liquidity discussed above are deemed by management to be sufficient to fund outstanding loan commitments and to meet Peoples United Financials and Peoples United Banks other obligations. Earning Asset Mix $12.5 billion as of December 31, 2007 (percent) Funding Base $13.4 billion as of December 31, 2007 (percent) Capital Peoples United Financials total stockholders equity was $4.45 billion at December 31, 2007, a $3.11 billion net increase from December 31, 2006. This increase primarily reflects the $3.33 billion of net proceeds from the second step conversion, net income of $150.7 million, a common stock contribution with a fair value of $40.0 million to The Peoples United Community Foundation and a $29.4 million decrease in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) since December 31, 2006, partially offset by purchases of common stock for the ESOP and 2007 Recognition and Retention Plan totaling $343.9 million and dividends paid in 2007 of $131.1 million. The decrease in AOCL reflects a $16.8 million after tax increase in net actuarial loss, prior service costs and transition obligation on pension and other postretirement benefits, and a $12.6 million after tax increase in the net unrealized gain on derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges. Peoples United Financials total stockholders equity was $1.34 billion at December 31, 2006, a $51 million net increase compared to $1.29 billion at December 31, 2005. This increase primarily reflects net income of $124.0 million, partially offset by dividends paid in 2006 of $60.0 million and a $24.6 million increase in AOCL since December 31, 2005. The net increase in AOCL primarily reflects a $40.0 million after tax increase from the adoption of SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, effective December 31, 2006, partially offset by a $18.9 million after tax reduction in the net unrealized loss on securities available for sale due to the sales of securities in 2006. Dividends declared and paid per common share (other than shares on which Peoples Mutual Holdings waived receipt of dividends prior to completing the second step conversion in April 2007) were $0.52, $0.46 and $0.40 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Peoples United Financials dividend payout ratio (dividends paid as a percentage of net income) for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was 87.0%, 48.3% and 38.3%, respectively. The increase in the dividend payout ratio reflects the waiver of 68 Table of Contents dividends on the substantial majority of the common shares owned by Peoples Mutual Holdings prior to completing the second step conversion in April 2007. Stockholders equity equaled 32.8% of total assets at December 31, 2007, compared to 12.5% at December 31, 2006. Capital Requirements. OTS capital regulations require federally chartered savings banks, such as Peoples United Bank, to meet three minimum capital ratios: Tangible Capital Ratio A 1.5% tangible capital ratio, calculated as tangible capital to adjusted total assets. Leverage (Core) Capital Ratio A 4% leverage (core) capital ratio, calculated as core capital to adjusted total assets. The minimum leverage (core) capital ratio is reduced to 3% if the savings bank received the highest rating on its most recent safety and soundness examination. Risk Based Capital Ratio An 8% total risk based capital ratio, calculated as total capital to risk weighted assets. For purposes of this calculation, total capital includes core and supplementary capital, provided that supplementary capital may not exceed 100% of core capital. In assessing an institutions capital adequacy, the OTS takes into consideration not only these numeric factors but also qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where necessary. Peoples United Bank, as a matter of prudent management, targets as its goal the maintenance of capital ratios which exceed these minimum requirements and that are consistent with Peoples United Banks risk profile. The following summary compares Peoples United Banks regulatory capital amounts and ratios as of December 31, 2007 to the OTS minimum requirements. In 2007, Peoples United Financial made a $1.7 billion capital contribution to Peoples United Bank from a portion of the net proceeds from the second step conversion. Peoples United Banks adjusted total assets, as defined, totaled $12.1 billion at December 31, 2007 and its risk weighted assets, as defined, totaled $9.0 billion at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2007, Peoples United Bank exceeded each of its capital requirements. As of December 31, 2007 (dollars in millions) Peoples United Bank OTS MinimumRequirements Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Tangible capital $ 2,903.8 (1) 24.1 % $ 180.8 1.5 % Leverage (core) capital 2,903.8 (1) 24.1 482.1 4.0 Total risk based capital 3,001.0 (2) 33.4 719.2 8.0 (1) Represents total stockholders equity, excluding (i) after tax net unrealized gains (losses) on debt and certain equity securities classified as available for sale, (ii) after tax net unrealized losses on derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges, (iii) certain assets not recognized in tier 1 capital (principally goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles), and (iv) the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) relating to SFAS No. 158. (2) Represents tier 1 capital plus subordinated notes, up to certain limits, and the allowance for loan losses up to 1.25% of risk adjusted total assets. 69 Table of Contents Peoples United Banks regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2007 exceeded the OTS numeric criteria for classification as well capitalized. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning Peoples United Banks regulatory capital amounts and ratios. Peoples United Bank Capital Ratios Compared to Regulatory Requirements As of December 31, 2007 (percent) Market Risk Management Market risk is the risk of loss to earnings, capital and the fair market values of certain assets and liabilities resulting from changes in interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. Interest Rate Risk For Peoples United Bank, the only relevant market risk at this time is interest rate risk (IRR), which is the potential exposure to earnings or capital that may result from changes in interest rates. Peoples United Bank actively manages its IRR to achieve a balance between risk, earnings volatility and capital preservation. ALCO has primary responsibility for managing Peoples United Banks IRR. To evaluate Peoples United Banks IRR profile, ALCO monitors economic conditions, interest rate trends, liquidity levels and capital ratios. Management also reviews assumptions periodically for projected customer and competitor behavior, in addition to the expected repricing characteristics and cash flow projections for assets, liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments. Actual conditions may vary significantly from Peoples United Banks assumptions. Management evaluates the impact of IRR on Income at Risk using an earnings simulation model to project earnings under multiple interest rate environments over a one year time horizon resulting in a quantification of IRR. Income at Risk includes significant interest rate sensitive income sources, such as net interest income, gains on sales of residential mortgage loans and BOLI income. The earnings projections are based on a static balance sheet and estimates of pricing levels for Peoples United Banks products under multiple scenarios intended to reflect instantaneous yield curve shocks. Peoples United Bank estimates its base case Income at Risk using current interest rates. Internal guidelines regarding IRR simulation specify that for instantaneous parallel shifts of the yield curve, estimated Income at Risk for the subsequent one year period should not decline by more than: 10% for a 100 basis point shift; 15% for a 200 basis point shift; and 20% for a 250 basis point shift. 70 Table of Contents The following table shows the estimated percentage increase (decrease) in Peoples United Banks Income at Risk over a one year simulation period beginning December 31, 2007. Rate Change (basis points) Percent Change inIncome at Risk +300 24.05 % +200 16.73 +100 8.14 100 (6.47 ) 200 (13.98 ) 250 (18.31 ) While Income at Risk simulation identifies earnings exposure over a relatively short time horizon, Market Value of Equity (MVE) takes a long term economic perspective when quantifying IRR. MVE identifies possible margin behavior over a longer time horizon and is therefore a valuable complement of interest rate risk management. Base case MVE is calculated by estimating the net present value of all future cash flows from existing assets and liabilities using current interest rates. The base case scenario assumes that future interest rates remain unchanged. Internal guidelines limit the exposure of a decrease in MVE resulting from instantaneous parallel shifts of the yield curve in the following manner: for 100 basis points 10% of base case MVE; for 200 basis points 15% of base case MVE; and for 250 basis points 20% of base case MVE. The following table shows the estimated percentage decrease in Peoples United Bank MVE, assuming various shifts in interest rates. Rate Change (basis points) Percent Change inMarket Value of Equity +300 (3.57)% +200 (1.78) +100 (0.55) 100 (0.62) 200 (1.98) 250 (2.67) Management believes Peoples United Banks interest rate risk position at December 31, 2007 represents an acceptable level of risk. However, given the uncertainty of the magnitude, timing and direction of future interest rate movements and the shape of the yield curve, actual results may vary from those predicted by Peoples United Banks models. Peoples United Bank uses derivative financial instruments, including interest rate floors and interest rate swaps, as components of its IRR management. Peoples United Bank has written guidelines that have been approved by its Board of Directors and ALCO governing the use of these financial instruments, including approved counterparties and risk limits, and controls the credit risk of these instruments through collateral, credit approvals and monitoring procedures. At December 31, 2007, each of Peoples United Banks counterparties had an investment grade credit rating from the major rating agencies and is specifically approved up to a maximum credit exposure. Derivative financial instruments have been used for market risk management purposes (principally interest rate risk) and not for trading or speculative purposes. Peoples United Bank is currently using interest rate floors and interest rate swaps to manage IRR associated with certain interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Peoples United Bank is currently using interest rate floors to partially manage its exposure to a decrease in interest income resulting from declines in certain interest rates. These interest rate floors offer protection against a decline in interest income if the one month LIBOR index rate used to reprice certain floating rate commercial loans declines below the strike rate 71 Table of Contents on the interest rate floors. If the one month LIBOR index rate falls below the specified strike rate, Peoples United Bank would receive an interest payment on the interest rate floor equal to the difference between the one month LIBOR index rate on the reset date and the strike rate, which in effect, would offset the decline in interest income earned on the hedged floating rate commercial loans from the decline in interest rates. Interest rate floors are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Interest rate swaps are used to match more closely the repricing of fewer than five commercial real estate loans and the funding associated with these loans. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the funding liabilities from a variable interest rate into a fixed interest rate and consequently reduce Peoples United Banks exposure to increases in interest rates and their effect on interest income and interest expense. Interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign exchange forward contracts are commitments to buy or sell foreign currency on a future date at a contractual price. Peoples United Bank uses these instruments on a limited basis to eliminate its exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates on certain of its commercial loans that are denominated in foreign currencies. Gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts substantially offset the translation gains and losses on the related loans. Derivative Financial Instruments The following table summarizes certain information concerning derivative financial instruments utilized by Peoples United Bank in its management of IRR.

The consolidated financial statements and related footnotes are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Management is also responsible for compliance with laws and regulations relating to safety and soundness as designated by the Office of Thrift Supervision. The Board of Directors has an Audit Committee composed of five outside directors, each of whom meets the criteria for independence as set forth in applicable listing standards. The Audit Committee meets regularly with the independent auditors, the internal auditors and management to ensure that the system of internal control over financial reporting is being properly administered and that financial data is being properly reported. The Audit Committee reviews the scope and timing of internal audits, including recommendations made with respect to the system of internal control over financial reporting. The independent auditors and the internal auditors have free access to the Audit Committee. MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting for Peoples United Financial, Inc. Management maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting, including an internal audit function, which is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, transactions are properly authorized, and that accounting records are reliable for the preparation of financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that internal control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on its assessment, management has concluded that Peoples United Financial, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. /s/ Philip R.

Peoples United Financial does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. General Peoples United Financial, Inc. (Peoples United Financial) is a savings and loan holding company incorporated under the state laws of Delaware and the holding company for Peoples United Bank. On April 16, 2007, Peoples United Financial, Peoples Bank and Peoples Mutual Holdings completed their second step conversion from a mutual holding company structure to a fully public stock holding company structure. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of the second step conversion. Peoples United Financial had not engaged in any business through March 31, 2007; accordingly, the financial information for periods prior to March 31, 2007 is that of Peoples Bank. On June 6, 2007, Peoples Bank changed its name to Peoples United Bank. The name Peoples United Bank is used to refer to the Bank both before and after the name change. Peoples United Financial is registered with the Office of Thrift Supervision (the OTS) and subject to OTS regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements. Peoples United Bank is a federally chartered stock savings bank headquartered in Bridgeport, Connecticut with $12.1 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2007. Peoples United Bank was organized in 1842 as a mutual savings bank and converted to stock form in 1988. In August 2006, Peoples United Bank converted from a Connecticut chartered stock savings bank to a federally chartered stock savings bank. 24 Table of Contents Deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Peoples United Banks regulator is the OTS. The principal business of Peoples United Financial is to provide, through Peoples United Bank and its subsidiaries, a full range of financial services to individual, corporate and municipal customers. Traditional banking activities are conducted primarily within the state of Connecticut and include extending secured and unsecured commercial and consumer loans, originating mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial properties, and accepting consumer, commercial and municipal deposits. In addition to traditional banking activities, Peoples United Bank provides specialized services tailored to specific markets including: personal, institutional and employee benefit trust; cash management; and municipal banking and finance. Through its non bank subsidiaries, Peoples United Bank offers: brokerage, financial advisory services, investment management services and life insurance through Peoples Securities, Inc. (PSI); equipment financing through Peoples Capital and Leasing Corp. (PCLC); and other insurance services through R.C. Knox and Company, Inc. (RC Knox). This full range of financial services is delivered through a network of 79 traditional branches, 75 full service Stop & Shop supermarket branches that provide customers with seven day a week banking, seven limited service branches, 23 investment and brokerage offices (22 of which are located within branch offices), five wealth management and trust offices, nine PCLC offices and six commercial banking offices. Peoples United Banks distribution network also includes fully integrated online banking and investment trading, a 24 hour telephone banking service and participation in a worldwide ATM network. Peoples United Bank has expanded its residential mortgage and home equity lending activities in the contiguous markets of New York and Massachusetts. In addition, PCLC maintains a sales presence in six states to support its equipment financing operations outside of Connecticut. Within the Commercial Banking division, Peoples United Bank maintains a national credits group, which seeks to participate in commercial loans and commercial real estate loans to borrowers in various industries on a national scale. Peoples United Financials results of operations are largely dependent upon revenues generated through net interest income and fee based revenues and, to a much lesser extent, other forms of non interest income such as gains on asset sales. Sources for these revenues are diversified across Peoples United Financials two primary business segments representing its core businesses, Commercial Banking and Consumer Financial Services, and to a lesser extent, Treasury. Peoples United Financials results of operations are also significantly affected by the provision for loan losses and the level of non interest expense. In addition, Peoples United Financials results of operations may also be affected by general and local economic conditions, changes in market interest rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Acquisition of Chittenden Corporation On January 1, 2008, Peoples United Financial completed its acquisition of the Chittenden Corporation, a multi bank holding company located in Burlington, Vermont for total consideration of approximately $1.7 billion. Chittenden had total assets of $7.4 billion as of December 31, 2007 and its six banks are located in Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Maine. The acquisition of Chittenden will be accounted for as a purchase and accordingly, Chittendens results of operations will be included with Peoples United Financials results of operations beginning in 2008. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, Peoples United Financial is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, including the classification of revenues and expenses to discontinued operations. Actual results could differ from Peoples United Financials current estimates, as a result of changing conditions and future events. Several estimates are particularly critical and are susceptible to significant near term change, including the 25 Table of Contents allowance for loan losses, the valuation of derivative financial instruments, and asset impairment judgments including the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets, and other than temporary declines in the value of securities. Peoples United Financials significant accounting policies and critical estimates are summarized in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses charged to income. Losses on loans, including impaired loans, are charged to the allowance for loan losses when all or a portion of a loan is deemed to be uncollectible. Recoveries of loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance when realized. Management maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that is believed to be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio, based on a quarterly evaluation of a variety of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to: Peoples United Financials historical loan loss experience and recent trends in that experience; risk ratings assigned by lending personnel to commercial real estate finance, commercial and PCLC loans, and the results of ongoing reviews of those ratings by Peoples United Financials independent loan review function; an evaluation of non performing loans and related collateral values; the probability of loss in view of geographic and industry concentrations and other portfolio risk characteristics; the present financial condition of borrowers; and current economic conditions. While management seeks to use the best available information to make these evaluations, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions, results of regulatory examinations, further information obtained regarding known problem loans, the identification of additional problem loans and other factors. The allowance for loan losses consists of amounts determined in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, and SFAS No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan. In applying SFAS No. 5, management considers the factors listed in the preceding paragraph in order to estimate a loss allowance for (1) each homogeneous pool of smaller balance loans (residential mortgage and consumer loans) that are evaluated on a collective basis, and (2) commercial real estate, commercial and PCLC loans that are not considered impaired under SFAS No. 114. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that Peoples United Financial will be unable to collect all principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan. Peoples United Financial applies SFAS No. 114 to loans that are individually evaluated for collectibility in accordance with its normal loan review procedures. Under SFAS No. 114, impaired loans are reported based on one of three measures: the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate; the loans observable market price; or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. If the measure is less than an impaired loans recorded investment, an impairment loss is recognized as part of the allowance for loan losses. Valuation of Derivative Financial Instruments. Peoples United Financial uses derivatives for market risk management purposes (principally interest rate risk) and not for trading or speculative purposes. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, all derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. Until such time that a derivative is settled, favorable changes in fair values result in unrealized gains that are recognized as assets, while unfavorable changes result in unrealized losses that are recognized as liabilities. Peoples United Financial hedge accounting methods vary depending on whether the derivative instrument is classified as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. Hedge accounting is permitted only if specific criteria are met, including a requirement that a highly effective relationship exist between the derivative instrument and the hedged item, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis. Changes in the fair value of effective fair value hedges are recognized in current earnings. Changes in the fair value of effective cash flow hedges are recognized in other comprehensive income until earnings are affected by the variability in cash flows of the designated hedged item. Ineffective portions of hedge results are recognized in current earnings. Peoples United Financial formally documents all relationships between the derivative instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as hedges to specific assets and liabilities, or to 26 Table of Contents specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. Peoples United Financial also formally assesses, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged items. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective or has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, Peoples United Financial would discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. Interest rate lock commitments extended to borrowers relate to the origination of residential mortgage loans. To mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in these commitments, Peoples United Financial enters into mandatory delivery and best efforts contracts to sell adjustable rate and fixed rate residential mortgage loans (servicing released). Forward commitments to sell and interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans are considered derivatives and their respective estimated fair values are adjusted based on changes in interest rates and exclude the value of mortgage servicing rights. Asset Impairment Judgments Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, requires, among other things, use of the purchase method to account for all business combinations and specifies criteria that acquired intangible assets must meet in order to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. The assets and liabilities of an acquired company are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. Intangible assets are recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Other acquisition related intangibles are separately identified, where appropriate, for the estimated value of acquired customer relationships and are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated remaining average life of those relationships (ranging from 7 to 12 years from the respective acquisition dates). The remaining intangible asset is classified as goodwill. SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill be reviewed for impairment at least annually, with impairment losses charged to expense when they occur. Acquisition related intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives and are periodically reviewed by management to assess recoverability. Impairment losses are recognized as a charge to expense if carrying amounts exceed fair values. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment using a two step approach that involves the identification of reporting units and the estimation of fair values. Goodwill shall also be tested for impairment when events occur that would more likely than not reduce the implied fair value of goodwill below its carrying value. An impairment loss is recognized as a charge to expense for any excess of the goodwill carrying amount over implied fair value. Peoples United Financial uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of its reporting units. This model requires the use of long term planning forecasts and assumptions regarding industry specific economic conditions that are outside our control. Securities. Marketable equity and debt securities (other than those reported as short term investments) are classified as either trading account securities, held to maturity securities (applicable only to debt securities) or available for sale securities. Management determines the classification of a security at the time of its purchase. Securities purchased for sale in the near term and those held by PSI (in accordance with the requirements for a broker dealer) are classified as trading account securities and reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are reported in non interest income. Debt securities that Peoples United Financial has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity securities and reported at amortized cost. All other securities are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are reported on an after tax basis in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Premiums are amortized and discounts are accreted to interest income for debt securities, using the interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity, adjusted for the effect of actual 27 Table of Contents prepayments in the case of mortgage backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and other asset backed securities. Federal Home Loan Bank stock is a non marketable equity security reported at cost. Security transactions are generally recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method and reported in non interest income. Management conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if the decline in fair value of any security appears to be other than temporary. If the decline is deemed to be other than temporary, the security is written down to a new cost basis and the resulting loss is reported in non interest income. The factors considered by management in its periodic review include, but are not limited to: the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer; the ratings of the security; whether the decline in fair value appears to be issuer specific or, alternatively, a reflection of general market or industry conditions; and Peoples United Financials intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in fair value. Non GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation to GAAP In addition to evaluating Peoples United Financials results of operations in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management routinely supplements this evaluation with an analysis of certain non GAAP financial measures, such as the efficiency ratio, core deposits and purchased funds. Management believes such non GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding Peoples United Financials underlying operating performance and trends, and facilitates comparisons with the performance of other banks and thrifts. Management utilizes core deposits and purchased funds as non GAAP financial measures to supplement its analysis of Peoples United Financials business performance. Core deposits is a measure of stable funding sources and is defined as total deposits, other than brokered certificates of deposit (acquired in the wholesale market), municipal deposits (which are seasonally variable by nature) and escrow funds from Peoples United Financials stock offering (applicable only for 2007 average core deposits). Purchased funds include borrowings, brokered certificates of deposit and municipal deposits. Although management believes that the above mentioned non GAAP financial measures enhance investors understanding of Peoples United Financials operating performance, these non GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. The reconciliation of these non GAAP financial measures from GAAP to non GAAP is presented below. The following tables provide reconciliations between GAAP and non GAAP financial measures: As of December 31 (in millions) 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Deposits $ 8,881 $ 9,083 $ 9,083 $ 8,862 $ 8,714 Less: Municipal deposits 45 43 129 106 125 Brokered certificates of deposit 70 Core deposits $ 8,836 $ 9,040 $ 8,954 $ 8,756 $ 8,519 As of December 31 (in millions) 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Borrowings $ $ 4 $ 295 $ 341 $ 1,516 Plus: Municipal deposits 45 43 129 106 125 Brokered certificates of deposit 70 Purchased funds $ 45 $ 47 $ 424 $ 447 $ 1,711 28 Table of Contents In addition to the above non GAAP financial measures, management uses the efficiency ratio to monitor its operating efficiency compared to its peers. The efficiency ratio, which represents an approximate measure of the cost required by Peoples United Financial to generate a dollar of revenue, is the ratio of total non interest expense (excluding goodwill impairment charges, amortization of goodwill and acquisition related intangibles, losses on real estate assets and nonrecurring expenses) (the numerator) to net interest income plus total non interest income (including the fully taxable equivalent adjustment on bank owned life insurance income and excluding gains and losses on sales of assets, other than residential mortgage loans, and nonrecurring income) (the denominator). Peoples United Financial generally considers an income or expense to be nonrecurring if it is not similar to an income or expense of a type incurred within the last two years and is not similar to an income or expense of a type reasonably expected to be incurred within the following two years. Management considers the efficiency ratio to be more representative of Peoples United Financials ongoing operating efficiency, as the excluded items are generally related to external market conditions and non routine transactions.

Economic activity in the United States showed signs of slowing in 2007. Real gross domestic product increased at a rate of 2.5% for the year, a decrease from 2.9% in 2006. The national unemployment rate was 5.0% as of December 31, 2007, up from 4.4% at the end of 2006. The national economy continued to grow despite widening federal budget and trade deficits, significant volatility in the financial and capital markets, lower short term interest rates, elevated energy costs, a weak housing market, and geopolitical uncertainties. In response to a contracting U.S. economy and the significant disruptions in the capital markets primarily caused by the sub prime mortgage crisis, the Federal Reserve Board lowered the targeted federal funds rate five times from September 2007 to January 2008, by a total of 225 basis points, bringing the rate to 3.00% as of January 30, 2008. The Federal Reserve had not increased the targeted federal funds rates since the June 29, 2006 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Peoples United Financials primary market area, Connecticut, is one of the most attractive markets in the United States with a total population of approximately 3.6 million and a median household income of $68,430 as of June 30, 2007, ranking second in the United States and well above the U.S. median income of $53,154, according to estimates from SNL Securities. Fairfield County, where Peoples United Financial is headquartered, is the wealthiest county in Connecticut, with a June 30, 2007 median household income of $84,825 according to estimates from SNL Securities. The states unemployment rate increased to 5.0% as of December 31, 2007 compared to 4.1% at the end of 2006, and was the same as the national rate. The Connecticut economy experienced moderate job growth in 2007, with total employment increasing by 16,600 jobs, or approximately 1.0% from December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007. The outlook for the Connecticut economy in 2008 is cautiously optimistic, with the expectation that the state will experience further job growth as the economy continues to expand moderately. Financial Overview Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006. Total assets at December 31, 2007 were $13.6 billion, an increase of $2.9 billion, or 27%, from December 31, 2006, primarily due to a $3.3 billion increase in short term investments, partially offset by a decrease of $422 million in total loans. The increase in short term investments reflects the net proceeds from the second step conversion completed on April 16, 2007. The decrease in total loans reflects a decline of $758 million, or 15%, in Consumer Financial Services, partially offset by an increase of $336 million, or 8%, in Commercial Banking. The decline in Consumer Financial Services was driven by decreases of $687 million, or 18%, in residential mortgage loans and $71 million, or 5%, in consumer loans. The decrease in residential mortgage loans reflects Peoples United Banks decision in the fourth quarter of 2006 to sell essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans due to the low spreads on such loans. The growth in Commercial Banking reflects increases of $175 million, or 29%, in our national credits portfolio, $112 million, or 13%, in loans originated by PCLC, our equipment financing subsidiary, $34 million, or 3%, in commercial lending, and $15 million, or 1%, in commercial real estate loans. Non performing assets totaled $26.1 million at December 31, 2007, a $3.4 million increase from December 31, 2006. Increases in non performing commercial real estate loans of $3.5 million, real estate owned (REO) and repossessed assets of $5.7 million, non performing PCLC loans of $1.0 million and non performing residential mortgage loans of $2.2 million, were partially offset by a decrease of $10.6 million in non performing commercial loans. The decrease in non performing commercial loans primarily reflects the $5.9 million charge off relating to one commercial banking loan and the subsequent transfer to real estate owned of the real estate securing the remaining loan balance. The allowance for loan losses decreased $1.3 million to $72.7 million 30 Table of Contents at December 31, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006, reflecting reductions in the allowance for loan losses allocated to the consumer loan portfolios and by net reductions to the commercial banking loan portfolios. At December 31, 2007, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.81% and as a percentage of non performing loans was 358%, compared to 0.79% and 328%, respectively, at December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2007, liabilities totaled $9.1 billion, a $238 million, or 3%, decrease from December 31, 2006, primarily reflecting a $202 million reduction in total deposits. Core deposits decreased $204 million, or 2%, in 2007 compared to 2006, reflecting Peoples United Financials strategy to fund loan growth with proceeds from maturities, sales and repayments of securities rather than core deposits. Peoples United Financials total stockholders equity was $4.4 billion at December 31, 2007, a $3.1 billion net increase from December 31, 2006, reflecting the net proceeds of $3.3 billion from the second step conversion and net income of $150.7 million, partially offset by the purchases of Peoples United Financial common stock for the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the ESOP) of $216.8 million and the 2007 Recognition and Retention Plan of $127.1 million, and dividends paid of $131.1 million. As a percentage of total assets, stockholders equity was 32.8% at December 31, 2007 compared to 12.5% at December 31, 2006. Peoples United Banks leverage, tier 1 and total risk based capital ratios were 24.1%, 32.3% and 33.4%, respectively, at December 31, 2007, compared to 12.0%, 14.8% and 16.1%, respectively, at December 31, 2006. The improvements in the capital ratios from December 31, 2006 primarily reflect the $1.7 billion capital contribution from Peoples United Financial with a portion of the net proceeds from the second step conversion. Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005. Total assets at December 31, 2006 were $10.7 billion, a decrease of $246 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2005, primarily due to a $1.3 billion decline in total securities, partially offset by increases of $799 million in total loans, $193 million in short term investments, $58 million in bank owned life insurance and $66 million in other assets. The increase in total loans reflects growth of $456 million, or 10%, in Consumer Financial Services and $343 million, or 9%, in Commercial Banking. The growth in Consumer Financial Services was driven by increases of $392 million, or 11%, in residential mortgage loans and $64 million, or 5%, in consumer loans. The increase in residential mortgage loans reflects, in part, the purchase of $170 million of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans towards the end of the first quarter of 2006. The growth in Commercial Banking reflects increases of $235 million, or 37%, in loans originated by PCLC, $135 million, or 29%, in our national credits portfolio, and $60 million, or 5%, in commercial lending. These increases were partially offset by an $87 million, or 5%, decline in commercial real estate loans. The decrease in the securities portfolio reflects the sale of $266 million and $810 million of debt securities in the second and third quarters of 2006, respectively, to better position Peoples United Financials balance sheet for the prevailing interest rate environment at the time. Peoples United Financial also funded an additional $50 million of bank owned life insurance in 2006 and contributed $91.5 million in the third quarter of 2006 to its employee retirement plan (reported in other assets) to more than fully fund its projected benefit obligation and to significantly reduce pension plan expense in future years. Proceeds from sales of securities were also used to reduce total borrowings and subordinated notes by $335 million since December 31, 2005. Non performing assets totaled $22.7 million at December 31, 2006, a $0.7 million increase from December 31, 2005. The slight increase in 2006 reflects a $10.6 million increase in non performing commercial loans, essentially offset by decreases in non performing commercial real estate loans and non performing PCLC loans of $5.6 million and $4.1 million, respectively. The allowance for loan losses decreased $1.0 million to $74 million at December 31, 2006 compared to December 31, 2005, primarily reflecting reductions in the allowance for loan losses allocated to the consumer loan portfolios, partially offset by net additions to the commercial banking loan portfolios. At December 31, 2006, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.79% and as a percentage of non performing loans was 328%, compared to 0.87% and 353%, respectively, at December 31, 2005. 31 Table of Contents At December 31, 2006, liabilities totaled $9.3 billion, a $297 million, or 3%, decrease from December 31, 2005, reflecting a $335 million reduction in total borrowings and subordinated notes. Core deposits increased a modest $86 million, or 1%, in 2006 compared to 2005, reflecting Peoples United Financials strategy to fund loan growth with proceeds from maturities, sales and repayments of securities rather than core deposits. Peoples United Financials total stockholders equity was $1.34 billion at December 31, 2006, a $51 million net increase from December 31, 2005, reflecting net income of $124.0 million, partially offset by dividends paid of $60 million and a $25 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss reflects a $40 million after tax increase from the adoption of SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, effective December 31, 2006 and a $4 million increase in the after tax unrealized loss on derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges, partially offset by a $19 million reduction in the after tax net unrealized loss on securities available for sale due to the sales of securities discussed above. As a percentage of total assets, stockholders equity was 12.5% at December 31, 2006 compared to 11.8% at December 31, 2005. Comparison of Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006. Peoples United Financial reported net income of $150.7 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $124.0 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, for the year ago period. Income from continuing operations totaled $149.2 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $121.7 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, for the year ago period. In 2007, Peoples United Financials return on average assets was 1.18% and return on average stockholders equity was 4.2%. Results for 2007 include a $60 million contribution to The Peoples United Community Foundation (included in non interest expense), which had the effect of reducing net income by $39.6 million, or $0.13 per diluted share. Results for 2006 include net security losses totaling $27.4 million from the sale of $266 million and $810 million of debt securities in the second and third quarters of 2006, respectively. Results for 2006 also include a $2.4 million income tax benefit related to certain prior year tax matters. The net impact of these items reduced 2006 net income by $15.8 million, or $0.11 per share. Net interest income increased $104.2 million, or 27%, from 2006 and the net interest margin improved 25 basis points to 4.12%. These improvements reflect the investment of $3.3 billion in net proceeds from the second step conversion (completed on April 16, 2007) in short term investments, as well as the benefits from balance sheet restructuring activities completed during 2006. Compared to 2006, average earning assets increased $1.9 billion, or 20%, reflecting increases of $2.5 billion in average short term investments and $120 million in average loans, partially offset by a decrease of $735 million in average securities, reflecting the sale of $1.1 billion of debt securities in 2006 (described above). Compared to 2006, total non interest income increased $38 million. Included in total non interest income are net security gains of $5.5 million in 2007 and net security losses of $23.2 million in 2006. Total non interest expense in 2007 increased $32.4 million, or 9%, compared to 2006, excluding the $60 million contribution to the Peoples United Community Foundation. The efficiency ratio improved to 56.1% from 61.3%. The provision for loan losses was $8.0 million compared to $3.4 million in 2006. The provision for loan losses in 2007 reflects net loan charge offs of $9.3 million, partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease in the allowance for loan losses. The provision for loan losses in 2006 reflects net loan charge offs of $4.4 million and a $1.0 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses. Net loan charge offs increased $4.9 million in 2007 compared to 2006. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average loans equaled 0.10% in 2007, up from 0.05% in 2006. 32 Table of Contents Comparison of Results of Operations for 2006 and 2005. Peoples United Financial reported net income in 2006 of $124.0 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, compared to $137.1 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, in 2005. Income from continuing operations totaled $121.7 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $125.9 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, for the year ago period. Results for 2006 include net security losses totaling $27.4 million from the sale of debt securities and a $2.4 million income tax benefit related to certain prior year tax matters. The net impact of these items reduced 2006 net income by $15.8 million, or $0.5 per share. Results for 2005 included an $8.1 million gain on the sale of three branches, a $9.7 million gain from the resolution of a significant contingency related to the sale of the credit card business in 2004 (reported in income from discontinued operations), a $2.0 million income tax benefit resulting from the completion of a routine federal tax audit, a $2.0 million goodwill impairment charge and expenses incurred in connection with the repurchase of subordinated notes ($2.7 million) and the accelerated vesting of stock options ($0.7 million). The net impact of these items increased 2005 net income by $9.3 million, or $0.03 per share. In 2005, Peoples United Financials return on average assets was 1.27% and return on average stockholders equity was 11.1%. Net interest income increased $12.7 million, or 3%, from 2005 and the net interest margin improved 19 basis points to 3.87%. The higher net interest margin reflects the asset sensitive position of the balance sheet, the substitution of securities with higher yielding loans, the partial benefit from the sales of securities in the second and third quarters of 2006, and the impact of our deposit pricing strategy. Compared to 2005, average earning assets decreased $173 million, or 2%, as a $934 million, or 54%, decline in average securities funded a $715 million, or 9%, increase in average loans and a $113 million, or 27%, decrease in average total borrowings and average subordinated notes. The loan growth reflects increases of $285 million, or 8%, in average commercial banking loans, $345 million, or 10%, in average residential mortgage loans, and $108 million, or 9%, in average home equity loans, all as compared to 2005. The increase in average residential mortgage loans reflects, in part, the purchase of $170 million of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans towards the end of the first quarter of 2006. In addition, Peoples United Financial invested $50 million in the first quarter of 2006 and $150 million in the second quarter of 2005 in bank owned life insurance, and contributed $91.5 million to its employee retirement plan in September 2006. Compared to 2005, total non interest income, excluding net security losses, increased $1.2 million, or 1%; total non interest expense increased $2.5 million, or 1%; and the efficiency ratio improved to 61.3% from 62.8%. The provision for loan losses was $3.4 million compared to $8.6 million in 2005. The provision for loan losses for 2006 reflects net loan charge offs of $4.4 million, partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in the allowance for loan losses. The provision for loan losses in 2005 reflects net loan charge offs of $6.1 million and a $2.5 million increase in the allowance for loan losses. Net loan charge offs decreased $1.7 million, or 28%, in 2006 compared to 2005. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average loans equaled 0.05%, down from 0.07% in 2005. Business Segment Results Peoples United Financials operations are divided into two primary business segments that represent its core businesses, commercial banking and consumer financial services. In addition, the treasury area is responsible for managing Peoples United Financials securities portfolio, short term investments, wholesale funding activities, such as borrowings, and the funding center. The income or loss for the funding center, which includes the impact of derivative financial instruments used for risk management purposes, represents the interest rate risk component of Peoples United Financials net interest income as calculated by Peoples United Financials funds transfer pricing model (FTP), to derive each operating segments net interest income. 33 Table of Contents Business Segment Performance Summary Net Income Years ended December 31 (in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Commercial Banking $ 37.6 $ 41.9 $ 45.7 Consumer Financial Services 66.8 85.8 94.2 Treasury (8.6 ) (26.0 ) (25.0 ) Total reportable segments 95.8 101.7 114.9 Other 54.9 22.3 22.2 Total Consolidated $ 150.7 $ 124.0 $ 137.1 Peoples United Financial uses an internal profitability reporting system to generate information by operating segment, which is based on a series of management estimates and allocations regarding funds transfer pricing, the provision for loan losses, non interest expense and income taxes. These estimates and allocations, some of which can be subjective in nature, are continually being reviewed and refined. Any changes in estimates and allocations that may affect the reported results of any business segment will not affect the consolidated financial position or results of operations of Peoples United Financial as a whole. FTP is used in the calculation of each operating segments net interest income, and measures the value of funds used in and provided by an operating segment. The difference between the interest income on earning assets and the interest expense on funding liabilities, and the corresponding FTP charge for interest income or credit for interest expense, results in net spread income. The provision for loan losses for the Commercial Banking and Consumer Financial Services segments is generally based on a five year rolling average net charge off rate for the respective segment. Peoples United Financial allocates a majority of non interest expenses to each business segment using a full absorption costing process. Direct and indirect costs are analyzed and pooled by process and assigned to the appropriate business segment and corporate overhead costs are allocated to the business segments. Income tax expense is allocated to each business segment using a constant rate, based on an estimate of the consolidated effective income tax rate for the year. For a more detailed description of the estimates and allocations used to measure business segment performance, see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Commercial Banking consists principally of commercial lending, commercial real estate lending and commercial deposit gathering activities. This segment also includes the equipment financing operations of PCLC, as well as cash management, correspondent banking and municipal banking. Years ended December 31 (in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Net interest income $ 131.7 $ 130.5 $ 129.7 Provision for loan losses 10.9 10.5 9.4 Non interest income: Fee based revenues 19.8 17.8 21.7 Other non interest income 8.3 5.0 2.0 Total non interest income 28.1 22.8 23.7 Non interest expense 91.1 78.3 73.7 Income before income tax expense 57.8 64.5 70.3 Income tax expense 20.2 22.6 24.6 Income from continuing operations $ 37.6 $ 41.9 $ 45.7 Average earning assets $ 4,253.5 $ 3,904.9 $ 3,620.9 Average liabilities 1,016.2 1,172.7 1,270.5 Year end assets 4,490.8 4,155.0 3,812.2 Commercial Banking income from continuing operations declined $4.3 million, or 10%, in 2007 compared to 2006, reflecting an increase in non interest expense, partially offset by increases in net interest income, 34 Table of Contents fee based revenues and other non interest income. Net interest income increased $1.2 million, or 1%, reflecting a $349 million, or 9%, increase in average earning assets, partially offset by narrower net spreads and a decline in commercial non interest bearing deposits. The $2.0 million increase in fee based revenues reflects higher lending related charges and fees. The increase in other non interest income primarily reflects a $3.8 million increase in rental income on leased equipment. The $12.8 million, or 16%, increase in non interest expense reflects increases in direct expenses due to continued growth in Commercial Banking and a $2.8 million increase in amortization expense for leased equipment, as well as allocated expenses primarily related to costs associated with ongoing infrastructure upgrades. The increase in average earning assets compared to 2006 reflects increases of $210 million, or 30%, in PCLC loans, $96 million, or 7%, in commercial loans and $42 million, or 2%, in commercial real estate loans. Average commercial non interest bearing deposits totaled $883 million for 2007, a $56 million, or 6%, decrease compared to 2006, reflecting the current higher interest rate environment. Commercial Banking income from continuing operations declined $3.8 million, or 8%, in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily reflecting lower fee based revenues and an increase in non interest expense, partially offset by an increase in other non interest income. Net interest income increased $0.8 million, or 1%, reflecting a $284 million, or 8%, increase in average earning assets, partially offset by narrower net spreads. The $3.9 million decrease in fee based revenues reflects lower lending related charges and fees, primarily lower commercial real estate loan prepayment penalties. The increase in other non interest income primarily reflects a $2.7 million increase in rental income on leased equipment. The $4.6 million, or 6%, increase in non interest expense reflects an increase in direct expenses due to the continued growth in Commercial Banking, including a $2.0 million increase in the amortization expense of equipment leased to commercial customers. The increase in average earning assets compared to 2005 reflects increases of $183 million, or 35%, in PCLC loans, and $127 million, or 10%, in commercial loans, partially offset by a $25 million, or 1%, decrease in commercial real estate finance loans. Average commercial non interest bearing deposits totaled $939 million for 2006, a $43 million, or 4%, decrease compared to 2005, reflecting the current higher interest rate environment. Consumer Financial Services includes, as its principal business lines, consumer deposit gathering activities, and residential mortgage, home equity and other consumer lending (excluding the national consumer loan portfolio, which is reported in Other). In addition to trust services, this segment also includes brokerage, financial advisory services, investment management services and life insurance provided by PSI, and other insurance services provided through RC Knox. Years ended December 31 (in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Net interest income $ 247.7 $ 256.4 $ 266.4 Provision for loan losses 3.0 3.0 3.5 Non interest income: Fee based revenues 134.6 135.1 129.0 Net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans 3.0 2.0 4.0 Gain on sale of branches 8.1 Other non interest income 2.4 3.4 2.4 Total non interest income 140.0 140.5 143.5 Non interest expense 281.4 261.3 259.4 Income before income tax expense 103.3 132.6 147.0 Income tax expense 36.5 46.8 52.8 Income from continuing operations $ 66.8 $ 85.8 $ 94.2 Average earning assets $ 4,863.1 $ 5,086.6 $ 4,634.9 Average liabilities 7,843.6 7,807.8 7,762.4 Year end assets 4,606.2 5,366.4 4,900.7 35 Table of Contents Consumer Financial Services income from continuing operations decreased $19.0 million, or 22%, in 2007 compared to 2006, reflecting an increase in non interest expense and a decline in net interest income. The decrease in net interest income reflects a reduction in residential mortgage loan net spread interest income, and a shift from wider net spread deposits to time deposits with narrower net spreads, partially offset by the widening net spreads on money market accounts. During 2007, average earning assets decreased $224 million, or 4%, including decreases of $208 million, or 6%, in average residential mortgage loans and $9 million, or 1%, in average home equity loans. The decrease in average residential mortgage loans reflects Peoples United Financials decision in the fourth quarter of 2006 to sell essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. As a result, residential mortgage loan balances are expected to decline in the future until Peoples United Financial resumes adding such loans to its portfolio to an extent that more than offsets repayments. Average consumer deposits totaled $7.7 billion, a less than 1% increase compared to 2006. The increase in non interest expense reflects increases in allocated expenses primarily due to the costs associated with ongoing infrastructure upgrades relating to deposit gathering activities. Consumer Financial Services income from continuing operations decreased $8.4 million, or 9%, in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to decreases in net interest income and net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans, partially offset by higher fee based revenues. Additionally, results for 2005 included the $8.1 million gain on sale of branches. The decrease in net interest income primarily reflects the reduction in net spread interest income for residential mortgage loans and the decline in net interest spread from an unfavorable shift from savings and money market deposits to higher rate time deposits, partially offset by the benefit of an increase in average loan balances. The shift in deposit mix reflects an increase in higher rate time deposits, partially offset by a decline in savings and money market deposits. During 2006, average earning assets increased $452 million, or 10%, including increases of $345 million, or 10%, in average residential mortgage loans and $106 million, or 9%, in average home equity loans. Peoples United Financial purchased $170 million of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans towards the end of the first quarter of 2006. Average consumer deposits totaled $7.7 billion, a 1% increase compared to 2005. The increase in fee based revenues in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily reflects an increase in service charges on deposit accounts related to changes in Peoples United Financials fee structure. The increase in other non interest income reflects a $0.7 million net gain from the sale of a corporate insurance account by RC Knox. Included in non interest income in 2005 was an $8.1 million gain on the sale of three branches. The increase in non interest expense reflects a $3.8 million increase in allocated expenses in 2006, partially offset by a $2.0 million goodwill impairment charge in 2005. Treasury encompasses the securities portfolio, short term investments, wholesale funding activities, such as borrowings, and the funding center. The income or loss for the funding center, which includes the impact of derivative financial instruments used for risk management purposes, represents the interest rate risk component of Peoples United Financials net interest income as calculated by Peoples United Financials funds transfer pricing model (FTP), to derive each operating segments net interest income. Under this process, a money desk (the funding center) buys funds from liability generating business lines (such as consumer deposits) and sells funds to asset generating business lines (such as commercial lending). The price at which funds are bought and sold on any given day is set by Peoples United Financials treasury group and is based on the wholesale cost to Peoples United Financial of assets and liabilities with similar maturities. Liability generating businesses sell newly originated liabilities to the money desk and recognize a funding credit, while asset generating businesses buy funding for newly originated assets from the money desk and recognize a funding charge. Once funding for an asset is purchased from or a liability is sold to the money desk, the price that is set by the treasury group will remain with that asset or liability until it matures or reprices, which effectively transfers responsibility for managing interest rate risk to the treasury group. 36 Table of Contents Years ended December 31 (in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Net interest loss $ (29.8 ) $ (26.2 ) $ (43.0 ) Non interest income: Fee based revenues 0.5 Net security losses (27.4 ) Bank owned life insurance 10.5 9.1 3.3 Other non interest income 0.1 0.1 0.3 Total non interest income 10.6 (18.2 ) 4.1 Non interest expense (0.3 ) 0.5 1.4 Loss before income tax expense (18.9 ) (44.9 ) (40.3 ) Income tax benefit (10.3 ) (18.9 ) (15.3 ) Loss from continuing operations $ (8.6 ) $ (26.0 ) $ (25.0 ) Average earning assets $ 2,689.0 $ 878.5 $ 1,765.9 Average liabilities 81.0 234.1 282.5 Year end assets 3,756.6 469.0 1,553.2 The reduction in Treasurys loss from continuing operations in 2007 compared to 2006 reflects $27.4 million of net security losses in 2006 and a $1.4 million increase in bank owned life insurance (BOLI), partially offset by a $3.6 million increase in net interest loss. The increase in net interest loss reflects an increase of $7.1 million in treasurys net spread loss, partially offset by a $3.5 million decline in the funding centers net spread loss. The increase in treasurys net spread loss reflects a $735 million decline in average securities and virtually no net spread benefit from the increase in average short term investments. The benefit from the increase in average short term investments is included in Other as interest income from excess capital. The improvement in the funding centers net spread loss reflects the rising interest rate environment prevalent for most of 2007 and the asset sensitive position of Peoples United Financials balance sheet. Average earning assets increased $1.8 billion from 2006. Average short term investments increased $2.5 billion, reflecting the investment of net proceeds from the second step conversion, while average securities declined $735 million resulting from the sale of $1.1 billion of securities in 2006. The debt securities portfolio totaled $23 million at December 31, 2007, compared to $27 million at December 31, 2006. Average securities comprised 1% of average earning assets in 2007, compared to 8% in 2006. Treasurys loss from continuing operations in 2006 compared to 2005 reflects $27.4 million of net security losses, partially offset by a $16.8 million improvement in net interest income and BOLI income of $9.1 million ($13.7 million on a taxable equivalent basis). The improvement in net interest income reflects the funding centers net spread loss declining by $31.8 million, partially offset by a $15.0 million decline in treasurys net spread income. The reduction in treasurys net spread income reflects a $934 million decline in average securities and an increase in the FTP charge for funding the BOLI investment (with no offsetting interest income as BOLI income is recorded in non interest income). The improvement in the funding centers net spread loss reflects the rising interest rate environment and the asset sensitive position of Peoples United Financials balance sheet. Average earning assets decreased $887 million, or 50%, reflecting a $934 million, or 54%, decline in average securities from 2005 given Peoples United Financials sale of its debt securities portfolio during 2006 as part of restructuring activities to better position Peoples United Financials balance sheet for the prevailing interest rate environment. The debt securities portfolio totaled $27 million at December 31, 2006, compared to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2005, reflecting the sale of approximately $1.1 billion of securities and the 37 Table of Contents substitution of securities with higher yielding loans. Average securities comprised 8% of average earning assets in 2006, compared to 17% in 2005. Other includes the residual financial impact from the allocation of revenues and expenses and certain revenues and expenses not attributable to a particular segment, and the FTP impact attributable to excess capital. This category also includes: revenues and expenses relating to the national consumer loan portfolio; certain nonrecurring items, including security gains of $5.4 million from the sale of Peoples United Financials entire holdings of MasterCard Incorporated Class B Common Stock (included in non interest income for the year ended December 31, 2007) and the $60 million contribution to The Peoples United Community Foundation (included in non interest expense for the year December 31, 2007); income from discontinued operations; and income tax benefits. The increase in net interest income in 2007 compared to 2006 reflects the FTP credit resulting from the significant increase in excess capital from the second step conversion. Included in period end assets are cash, national consumer loans, premises and equipment, and other assets. Years ended December 31 (in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Net interest income $ 137.0 $ 21.7 $ 16.6 Provision for loan losses (5.9 ) (10.1 ) (4.3 ) Non interest income 6.7 2.3 2.0 Liability restructuring costs 2.7 Other non interest expense 67.1 6.8 7.2 Income before income tax expense 82.5 27.3 13.0 Income tax expense 29.1 7.3 2.0 Income from continuing operations 53.4 20.0 11.0 Income from discontinued operations, net of tax 1.5 2.3 5.0 Gain on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax 6.2 Income from discontinued operations 1.5 2.3 11.2 Net income $ 54.9 $ 22.3 $ 22.2 Average liabilities $ 233.5 $ 246.9 $ 264.5 Year end assets 701.2 696.5 666.4 38 Table of Contents Net Interest Income Net interest income and net interest margin are affected by many factors, including changes in average balances; interest rate fluctuations and the slope of the yield curve; sales of loans and securities; residential mortgage loan and mortgage backed security prepayment rates; product pricing; competitive forces; the relative mix, repricing characteristics and maturity of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities; non interest bearing sources of funds; hedging activities; and asset quality. Net Interest Margin Years ended December 31 (percent) Net Interest Income Years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) In response to the disruptions in the capital markets caused by the sub prime mortgage crisis and the potential for a contracting U.S. economy, since September 2007 the Federal Reserve Board lowered the targeted federal funds rate five times by a total of 225 basis points, bringing the rate to 3.00% as of January 30, 2008. Given the asset sensitive position of the balance sheet, the net interest margin may compress in 2008. 2007 Compared to 2006 Net interest income increased $105 million, or 27%, and the net interest margin improved 25 basis points to 4.12% for 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in net interest income reflects a $125 million increase in total interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $20 million increase in total interest expense. The increase in net interest margin reflects the investment of $3.3 billion in net proceeds from the second step conversion in short term investments, as well as the benefits from the balance sheet restructuring activities completed during 2006. 39 Table of Contents Average earning assets totaled $11.8 billion in 2007, a $1.9 billion, or 20%, increase from 2006, while the asset mix continued to shift. Average short term investments increased $2.5 billion, reflecting the investment of $3.3 billion in net proceeds from the second step conversion in April 2007; average loans increased $120 million, or 1%; and average securities declined $735 million, reflecting the sale of $1.1 billion of debt securities in 2006. As a result, average loans, average securities and average short term investments comprised 77%, 1% and 22%, respectively, of average earning assets in 2007 compared to 91%, 8% and 1%, respectively, in 2006. The yield earned on the total loan portfolio was 6.27% in 2007 while the yield earned on securities was 5.62%, compared to 6.10% and 3.74%, respectively, in 2006. Excluding adjustable rate residential mortgage loans, which are mostly of the hybrid variety, approximately 31% of the loan portfolio has floating interest rates at December 31, 2007 compared to approximately 29% at the end of 2006. Growth in loans reflects an increase of $348 million, or 9%, in average commercial banking loans, partially offset by decreases of $209 million, or 6%, in average residential mortgage loans and $19 million, or 2%, in average consumer loans for 2007 compared to 2006. The growth in average commercial banking loans in 2007 compared to 2006 reflects increases of $210 million, or 30%, in average PCLC loans, $96 million, or 7%, in average commercial loans and $42 million, or 2%, in average commercial real estate loans. Included in average commercial loans and average commercial real estate loans were increases of $64 million, or 20%, and $78 million, or 38%, in the respective national credits portfolios. The decrease in average residential mortgage loans in 2007 compared to 2006 reflects Peoples United Financials decision in the fourth quarter of 2006 to sell essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. As a result, residential mortgage loan balances are expected to continue to decline in the future until Peoples United Financial resumes adding such loans to its portfolio to an extent that more than offsets repayments. The decrease in average consumer loans primarily reflects a $9 million, or 1%, decline in average home equity loans following a nationwide pattern. The overall 9 basis point improvement in the yield on average earning assets in 2007 primarily reflects the investment of the net proceeds from the second step conversion discussed above, increases in market interest rates and the ongoing shift in asset mix, including the impact of the security sales. Average funding liabilities totaled $9.0 billion in 2007, down $287 million or 3% compared with 2006. Average core deposits decreased $83 million, or 1%, to $8.9 billion and comprised 98% of average funding liabilities, compared to 96% in 2006. Average non interest bearing core deposits decreased $57 million, or 3%, and average interest bearing core deposits decreased $26 million, or less than 1%, reflective of Peoples United Financials strategy of funding loan growth with proceeds from maturities, sales and repayments of securities rather than core deposits. The 30 basis point increase to 2.45% from 2.15% in the rate paid on average funding liabilities in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily reflects increases in market interest rates prevalent in most of 2007 and the ongoing shift in deposit mix. The rates paid on average core deposits increased 41 basis points in 2007, reflecting increases of 67 basis points in time deposits and 8 basis points in savings and money market deposits in response to rising market interest rates prevalent in most of 2007. The change in the mix of average interest bearing core deposits reflects a $323 million, or 10%, increase in higher rate time deposits, partially offset by a $349 million, or 10%, decline in savings and money market deposits, reflecting customers preferences for deposit products with higher interest rates. Average time deposits comprised 41% of average total core deposits, compared to 37% for 2006. Average purchased funds decreased $227 million, or 92%, and average subordinated notes decreased $40 million, or 38%, in 2007 compared to 2006. 40 Table of Contents 2006 Compared to 2005 Net interest income increased $13 million, or 3%, and the net interest margin improved 19 basis points to 3.87% in 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in net interest income reflects a $74 million increase in total interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $61 million increase in total interest expense. Average earning assets totaled $9.8 billion in 2006, a $173 million, or 2%, decrease from 2005, while the asset mix continued to shift. The shift in asset mix from securities to higher yielding loans continued to benefit the net interest margin. Average loans increased $715 million, or 9%, while average securities declined $934 million, or 54%, in 2006 compared to 2005. As a result, average loans and average securities comprised 91% and 8%, respectively, of average earning assets in 2006 compared to 82% and 17%, respectively, in 2005. The yield earned on the total loan portfolio was 6.10% in 2006 while the yield earned on securities was 3.74%, compared to 5.41% and 3.47%, respectively, in 2005. Loan growth reflects increases of $345 million, or 10%, in average residential mortgage loans, $285 million, or 8%, in average commercial banking loans and $85 million, or 7%, in average consumer loans in 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in average residential mortgage loans reflects, in part, the purchase of $170 million of adjustable rate mortgage loans towards the end of the first quarter of 2006. The growth in average commercial banking loans in 2006 compared to 2005 reflects a $183 million, or 35%, increase in average PCLC loans and a $127 million, or 10%, increase in average commercial loans, partially offset by a $25 million, or 1%, decrease in average commercial real estate loans. Included in average commercial loans and average commercial real estate loans were increases of $44 million, or 15%, and $59 million, or 40%, in the respective national credits portfolios. The growth in average consumer loans in 2006 compared to 2005 continues to reflect a shift in mix as an increase of $108 million, or 9%, in home equity loans was partially offset by a $21 million, or 81%, reduction in higher yielding unsecured national personal installment loans, which continue to run off as a result of a management decision to discontinue this type of lending. The significant decrease in the average securities portfolio in 2006 compared to 2005 reflects the substitution of securities with higher yielding loans as securities pay down and mature, as well as the partial impact of security sales during 2006 to better position Peoples United Financials balance sheet for the prevailing interest rate environment. Peoples United Financial sold $810 million and $266 million of debt securities in the third and second quarters of 2006, respectively, and used the proceeds to fund loan growth and pay down borrowings. In addition to funding loan growth, Peoples United Financial invested $50 million in the first quarter of 2006 and $150 million in the second quarter of 2005 in a bank owned life insurance program with proceeds from maturing securities. The earnings from bank owned life insurance are reported in non interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The overall 84 basis point improvement in the yield on average earning assets in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily reflects increases in market interest rates since June 2004 and the ongoing shift in asset mix. Average funding liabilities totaled $9.3 billion in 2006, down $113 million or 1% compared with 2005. Average core deposits increased $38 million, or less than 1%, to $8.9 billion and comprised 96% of average funding liabilities, compared to 95% in 2005. Average interest bearing core deposits increased $101 million, or 2%, and average non interest bearing core deposits decreased $63 million, or 3%, reflective of Peoples United Financials strategy of funding loan growth with proceeds from maturities, sales and repayments of securities rather than core deposits. 41 Table of Contents The 68 basis point increase to 2.15% from 1.47% in the rate paid on average funding liabilities in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily reflects increases in market interest rates since June 2004 and the ongoing shift in deposit mix. The rates paid on average core deposits increased 70 basis points in 2006, reflecting increases of 115 basis points in time deposits and 36 basis points in savings and money market deposits in response to rising market interest rates. The change in the mix of average interest bearing core deposits reflects a $660 million, or 25%, increase in higher rate time deposits, partially offset by a $559 million, or 14%, decline in savings and money market deposits, reflecting customers preferences for deposit products with higher interest rates given the prevailing interest rate environment. Average time deposits comprised 37% of average total core deposits, compared to 30% in 2005. Average purchased funds decreased $134 million, or 35%, and average subordinated notes decreased $16 million, or 13%, in 2006 compared to 2005. Average Balance, Interest and Yield/Rate Analysis The table on the following page presents average balance sheets, interest income, interest expense and the corresponding average yields earned and rates paid for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. The average balances are principally daily averages and, for loans, include both performing and non performing balances. Interest income on loans includes the effect of deferred loan fees and costs accounted for as yield adjustments, but does not include interest on loans for which Peoples United Financial has ceased to accrue interest. The impact of Peoples United Financials use of derivative instruments in managing interest rate risk is also reflected in the table, classified according to the instrument hedged and the risk management objective. 42 Table of Contents Average Balance, Interest and Yield/Rate Analysis 2007 2006 2005 Years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) AverageBalance Interest Yield/Rate AverageBalance Interest Yield/Rate AverageBalance Interest Yield/Rate Earning assets: Short term investments $ 1,709.4 $ 86.7 5.07 % $ 106.6 $ 5.3 4.97 % $ 54.5 $ 1.5 2.86 % Securities purchased under agreements to resell 959.1 48.3 5.03 16.6 0.8 4.98 22.8 1.0 4.22 Securities (1) 69.2 3.9 5.62 803.8 30.0 3.74 1,737.8 60.3 3.47 Loans: Residential mortgage 3,550.3 183.9 5.18 3,758.8 185.2 4.93 3,413.3 154.7 4.53 Commercial 2,441.5 167.6 6.86 2,135.7 146.5 6.86 1,825.5 108.7 5.95 Commercial real estate 1,807.3 127.7 7.07 1,765.1 126.0 7.14 1,790.5 116.2 6.49 Consumer 1,268.9 88.9 7.01 1,288.3 88.3 6.85 1,203.3 65.8 5.47 Total loans 9,068.0 568.1 6.27 8,947.9 546.0 6.10 8,232.6 445.4 5.41 Total earning assets $ 11,805.7 $ 707.0 5.99 % $ 9,874.9 $ 582.1 5.90 % $ 10,047.7 $ 508.2 5.06 % Funding liabilities: Deposits: Non interest bearing deposits $ 2,111.4 $ % $ 2,168.6 $ % $ 2,231.7 $ % Savings, interest bearing checking and money market 3,114.9 46.8 1.50 3,464.4 49.2 1.42 4,023.4 42.6 1.06 Time 3,632.0 165.8 4.56 3,308.7 128.8 3.89 2,648.8 72.6 2.74 Total core deposits 8,858.3 212.6 2.40 8,941.7 178.0 1.99 8,903.9 115.2 1.29 Non core deposits (2) 78.4 1.0 1.30 40.4 2.1 5.42 77.5 2.3 3.02 Total deposits 8,936.7 213.6 2.39 8,982.1 180.1 2.01 8,981.4 117.5 1.31 Borrowings: Federal funds purchased 3.3 0.2 5.23 158.2 7.6 4.78 250.5 7.9 3.19 FHLB advances 0.1 5.04 47.2 2.4 5.15 50.3 1.4 2.73 Repurchase agreements 1.7 0.1 2.41 Total borrowings 3.4 0.2 5.23 205.4 10.0 4.87 302.5 9.4 3.11 Subordinated notes 65.3 6.6 10.15 105.0 9.6 9.10 121.2 11.3 9.29 Total funding liabilities $ 9,005.4 $ 220.4 2.45 % $ 9,292.5 $ 199.7 2.15 % $ 9,405.1 $ 138.2 1.47 % Excess of earning assets over funding liabilities $ 2,800.3 $ 582.4 $ 642.6 Net interest income/spread $ 486.6 3.54 % $ 382.4 3.75 % $ 370.0 3.59 % Net interest margin 4.12 % 3.87 % 3.68 % (1) Average balances and yields for securities available for sale are based on amortized cost.

Peoples United Financial has focused on enhancing these revenue streams by leveraging its commercial banking relationships, growing existing fee based revenue generating businesses, and strengthening its retail delivery network and products. 45 Table of Contents Total non interest income increased $38 million, or 26%, in 2007 compared to 2006, reflecting net security gains of $5.5 million in 2007 and net security losses of $27.4 million in 2006 (as part of balance sheet restructuring activities). Revenue from service charges on deposit accounts decreased $1.5 million, or 2%, compared to 2006, reflecting changes in consumer behavior related to overdrafts, and more customers qualifying for free ATM network transactions and free checking. Brokerage commissions increased $1.4 million, or 11%, compared to 2006, reflecting increases in mutual fund and annuity commissions. Other banking service charges and fees increased $0.7 million in 2007, primarily due to growth in retail banking fees associated with higher levels of Personal Identification Number (PIN) debit interchange fees resulting from customer preferences for debit card related transactions. PIN debit interchange refers to the revenue generated when a customer uses their PIN to make a purchase with their debit card. Peoples United Financial earns a portion of the purchase amount whenever its customers use their debit card at a retail merchant. This interchange is paid by the retail merchant. Securities gains in 2007 represent the sale of Peoples United Financials entire holdings of MasterCard Incorporated Class B Common Stock. Net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans increased $1.0 million in 2007, reflecting Peoples United Financials decision in the fourth quarter of 2006 to sell essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgages in the current interest rate environment. Residential mortgage sales volume increased 70% compared to 2006. BOLI income totaled $10.5 million in 2007 ($16.1 million on a taxable equivalent basis), compared to $9.1 million ($13.7 million on a taxable equivalent basis) in 2006. The $1.4 million, or 15%, increase primarily reflects death benefits of $1.1 million received in 2007. The increase in other non interest income compared to 2006 reflects a $3.8 million increase in rental income resulting from the higher level of equipment leased to PCLC customers. In addition, other non interest income in 2006 included a $0.7 million net gain from the sale of a large corporate insurance account by RC Knox, a $0.7 million gain from the redemption of common stock received in conjunction with the MasterCard Incorporated initial public offering given Peoples United Financials debit card business and $0.6 million of interest related to the completion of a federal tax audit. Total non interest income decreased $25.9 million, or 15%, in 2006 compared to 2005, reflecting net security losses of $27.4 million as part of balance sheet restructuring activities in 2006 and an $8.1 million gain on sale of branches in 2005. Revenue from service charges on deposit accounts increased $5.4 million, or 7%, compared to 2005, reflecting changes in Peoples United Financials fee structure implemented in both the second quarter of 2006 and the third quarter of 2005 to close the gap between Peoples United Financials pricing practices and those of the competition, partially offset by the impact of higher usage by the public of the cash back option at point of sale locations. Insurance revenue declined $0.7 million, or 2.5%, in 2006, reflecting industry wide trends for this business, characterized as a soft market with lower pricing for renewals, as well as reductions related to the sale of a large corporate account in the third quarter of 2006. Other banking service charges and fees increased $0.6 million in 2006 primarily due to growth in retail banking fees associated with higher levels of PIN debit interchange fees resulting from customer preferences for debit card related transactions. Other fees decreased $5.1 million, reflecting lower lending related charges and fees, primarily lower commercial real estate loan prepayment penalties. 46 Table of Contents As previously discussed, $1.1 billion of debt securities were sold in 2006, resulting in net security losses of $27.4 million. Peoples United Financial also sold $25 million in securities purchased under agreements to resell in 2006 at a loss of $0.3 million, which is reported in other non interest expense. These transactions were undertaken to better position Peoples United Financials balance sheet for the prevailing interest rate environment. Net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans decreased $2.0 million in 2006, reflecting lower residential mortgage loan origination volume and subsequent lower levels of fixed rate loan sales. Sales volume of fixed rate residential mortgage loans decreased approximately 40% in 2006, which is consistent with the 39% decrease in fixed rate residential mortgage originations compared to 2005. Residential mortgage originations totaled $1.1 billion in 2006, compared to $1.4 billion in 2005. Peoples United Financial invested an additional $50 million in the first quarter of 2006 in bank owned life insurance, after an initial investment of $150 million in the second quarter of 2005 to help defray the rising costs of employee benefits. Increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance are included in non interest income and totaled $9.1 million in 2006 ($13.7 million on a taxable equivalent basis), compared to $3.3 million ($5.1 million on a taxable equivalent basis) in 2005. The increase in other non interest income compared to 2005 reflects a $2.7 million increase in rental income resulting from the higher level of equipment leased to PCLC customers. In addition, other non interest income for the 2006 period includes a $0.7 million net gain from the sale of a large corporate insurance account by RC Knox, a $0.7 million gain from the redemption of common stock received in conjunction with the MasterCard Incorporated initial public offering given Peoples United Financials debit card business and $0.6 million of interest related to the completion of a federal tax audit.

The improvement in Peoples United Financials efficiency ratio in 2007 reflects a $112.6 million, or 20%, increase in revenue, partially offset by a $34.2 million, or 10%, increase in operating expenses. The increase in operating revenue reflects the increase in net interest income due to the investment of the net proceeds from the second step conversion. 47 Table of Contents Compensation and benefits increased $12.7 million, or 6%, compared to the 2006 period. The increase reflects amortization expense of $6.3 million related to the ESOP that was established in April 2007 and $2.6 million related to the October and December 2007 grants of restricted stock and stock options pursuant to the 2007 Recognition and Retention Plan and the 2007 Stock Option Plan, as well as higher compensation expense, reflecting normal merit increases, partially offset by lower pension expenses. Compensation expense in 2008 is expected to include a full year of amortization expense, totaling approximately $25 million, relating to the ESOP, the 2007 Recognition and Retention Plan, and the 2007 Stock Option Plan. Occupancy and equipment increased $4.9 million, or 8%, compared to the 2006 period. The increase primarily reflects higher rent related expense due to rate increases and additional branches. Professional and outside service fees increased $4.5 million, or 19%, compared to the 2006 period, reflecting higher costs for information technology related projects. Advertising and promotion increased $1.8 million, or 18%, compared to the 2006 period, primarily due to costs associated with the rebranding of the Bank as a result of Peoples Bank changing its name to Peoples United Bank on June 6, 2007. The increase in other non interest expense compared to 2006 primarily reflects a $2.8 million increase in the amortization of equipment leased to PCLC customers and higher insurance costs and regulatory assessment fees. Total non interest expense in 2006 increased $2.5 million, or 1%, compared to 2005, primarily reflecting higher compensation and benefits and lower professional and outside service fees. The improvement in Peoples United Financials efficiency ratio in 2006 reflects a $22.8 million, or 4%, increase in revenue. Total non interest expense in 2006 included the following items: severance related expenses totaling $1.6 million (recorded to compensation and benefits); a $0.3 million charge related to the sale of $25 million of securities purchased under agreements to resell as part of balance sheet restructuring activities (recorded to other non interest expense); and a $0.9 million charge related to the resolution of an RC Knox contingency (recorded to other non interest expense). Total non interest expense in 2005 included the following items: liability restructuring costs of $2.7 million; a $0.7 million charge related to the accelerated vesting of stock options (recorded to compensation and benefits); and a $2.0 million goodwill impairment charge. Excluding these expenses from the respective years, total non interest expense in 2006 would have increased $5.1 million, or 2%, compared to 2005. Compensation and benefits increased $6.5 million, or 3%, compared to the 2005 period, after excluding the items discussed above. The increase reflects the combination of normal merit increases, higher accruals for incentive compensation, and increased pension costs, partially offset by lower health care expenses. On September 29, 2006, Peoples United Financial contributed $91.5 million to its employee retirement plan, representing the maximum deductible contribution per Internal Revenue Service rules. Professional and outside service fees decreased $1.8 million, or 7%, compared to the 2005 period, reflecting lower utilization of information technology contractors and lower costs for Peoples United Financials declining national consumer loan portfolio, partially offset by higher legal costs related to Peoples United Financials conversion to a federal charter and costs related to infrastructure initiatives. The increase in other non interest expense compared to 2005 primarily reflects a $2.0 million increase in the amortization of equipment leased to PCLC customers, partially offset by lower operational charge offs. The $2.0 million goodwill impairment charge in 2005 related to the decision to combine Olson Mobeck Investment Advisors, Inc. with one of Peoples United Financials other businesses in the consumer financial services business segment. 48 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, totaled $1.5 million, $2.3 million and $11.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes an after tax charge of $0.5 million and for the year ended December 31, 2005 includes after tax income of $6.2 million from the resolution of contingencies related to the sale of Peoples United Financials credit card business in 2004. See Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Peoples United Financial continues to generate recoveries from collection efforts on previously charged off credit card accounts that were not included in the sale of the credit card business. These recoveries are included in income from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Recoveries, net of collection costs, totaled $2.3 million, $4.1 million and $7.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As the level of recoveries continues to decline due to the aging and diminishing pool of charged off accounts, discontinued operations results are not expected to be reported separately in the Consolidated Statements of Income in future periods. Income Taxes Income tax expense from continuing operations totaled $75.5 million, $57.8 million and $64.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income tax benefits of $2.4 million and $2.0 million are included in income tax expense from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These benefits relate to certain prior year tax matters, including the completion of federal tax audits in 2005 and 2004. Excluding these benefits from the respective years, Peoples United Financials effective income tax rate from continuing operations would have been 33.6%, 33.5% and 34.8% for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The lower effective income tax rates for 2007 and 2006 compared to 2005 primarily reflects the higher level of tax exempt bank owned life insurance income earned in 2007 and 2006. Peoples United Financials effective income tax rate is expected to increase slightly beginning in 2008 due to a higher level of non deductible expenses and an increase in state income tax liability, both resulting from the Chittenden acquisition. Income tax expense for all three years reflects the state tax benefit resulting from the formation of Peoples Mortgage Investment Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Peoples United Bank. The formation of this subsidiary was a result of Connecticut tax legislation, which became effective on January 1, 1999, that allows for the transfer of mortgage loans to a passive investment subsidiary. The related earnings of the subsidiary, and any dividends it pays to the parent, are not subject to Connecticut income tax. 49 Table of Contents Earning Assets The discussion of earning assets has been grouped into Treasury, Consumer Financial Services and Commercial Banking.

Securities available for sale are used as part of Peoples United Financials asset/liability management strategy and may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, factors such as changes in market conditions and interest rates, changes in security prepayment rates, liquidity considerations and regulatory capital requirements. Peoples United Financial primarily invests in debt securities rated in the four highest categories assigned by a nationally recognized statistical ratings organization. Management has internal guidelines for the credit quality and duration of Peoples United Financials debt securities portfolio and monitors these on a regular basis. Peoples United Financial strives to maintain an appropriate balance between loan portfolio growth and core deposit funding. Peoples United Financials management currently believes that, other than for transitional deployment of excess core deposits or excess equity, a large securities portfolio funded with wholesale borrowings provides limited economic value. As part of this focus, Peoples United Financial has reduced its securities portfolio by $3.2 billion since December 31, 2002 and increased its loans by $2.3 billion over the same period. Peoples United Financial has also reduced borrowings by $2.4 billion since year end 2002. 50 Table of Contents At December 31, 2007, Peoples United Financials securities portfolio totaled $61 million, or less than one half of one percent of total assets, and had no wholesale borrowings, which represent positions well below industry averages. At December 31, 2006, Peoples United Financials securities portfolio totaled $78 million, a $1.3 billion, or 88%, decline from year end 2005. In 2006, Peoples United Financial sold approximately $1.1 billion of debt securities as part of the restructuring of its balance sheet. Realized losses from these sales of $27.4 million are included in net security losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the book value and the market value of the securities available for sale portfolio were approximately equivalent, compared to net unrealized losses of $28.9 million at year end 2005. The significant reduction in the unrealized loss in 2006 reflects the sale of securities during 2006 and the resulting significantly smaller securities portfolio. All unrealized gains and those unrealized losses representing temporary declines in value are recorded in stockholders equity, net of income taxes. As a result, management anticipates continued fluctuations in stockholders equity due to changes in the fair value of these securities, albeit on a much smaller scale due to the size and short duration of the portfolio. The duration of the debt securities portfolio was approximately 0.02 years at December 31, 2007, compared to 0.07 years at December 31, 2006. For a discussion of the regulatory capital treatment of unrealized gains and losses, see Capital on page 68. Lending Activities Peoples United Financial conducts its lending activities through its two major business segments that constitute its core businesses: Consumer Financial Services and Commercial Banking. Peoples United Financials lending activities consist of originating loans secured by residential and commercial properties, and extending secured and unsecured loans to consumers and businesses. Total loans decreased $422 million, or 5%, in 2007 compared to 2006, after increases of 9% in 2006 and 8% in 2005. The decrease in 2007 reflects a decline of $758 million, or 15%, in Consumer Financial Services, partially offset by an increase of $336 million, or 8%, in Commercial Banking. The $687 million decrease in residential mortgage loans in 2007 reflects Peoples United Financials decision in the fourth quarter of 2006 to sell essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans due to the low spreads on such loans in the current interest rate environment. The following table summarizes the loan portfolio. Amounts represent gross loans before deducting the allowance for loan losses.

These include conventional fixed rate loans, jumbo fixed rate loans (loans with principal balances greater than established Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae limits), adjustable rate loans, sometimes referred to as ARM loans, interest only loans (loans where payments made by the borrower consist of only interest for a set period of time, before the payments change to principal and interest), as well as Federal Housing Authority insured loans and Connecticut Housing Finance Authority loans. Peoples United Financial originates these loans through its network of branches and calling officers, as well as in the wholesale market, which accounted for approximately 21%, 66% and 59% of Peoples United Financials mortgage loan originations for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decline in wholesale originations reflects Peoples United Financials decision in the fourth quarter of 2006 to sell essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. 52 Table of Contents At December 31, 2007 and 2006, 91% and 92%, respectively, of the residential mortgage loan portfolio was secured by properties located in Connecticut. Included in residential mortgage loans are construction loans totaling $96 million and $188 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2007, Peoples United Financials level of residential mortgage originations declined to $431 million, compared to $1.1 billion in 2006 and $1.4 billion in 2005. The mix and volume of residential mortgage loan originations vary in response to changes in market interest rates and customer preferences. Adjustable rate loans accounted for 27% of total residential mortgage originations in 2007, compared to 77% and 73% for 2006 and 2005, respectively. At December 31, 2007, the residential mortgage loan portfolio included $1.8 billion of interest only loans of which $158 million are stated income loans, compared to $2.1 billion and $180 million respectively, at December 31, 2006. Peoples United Financials underwriting practices and credit review standards for such loans are generally consistent with those applied to other types of residential mortgage loan products. Peoples United Financial began originating interest only residential mortgage loans in March 2003. The underwriting guidelines and requirements are more restrictive for interest only loans than for amortizing adjustable rate mortgages. More specifically, properties must be single family and owner occupied primary residences, loan to value ratios are lower, higher credit scores are required, post closing reserve requirements are greater, and there are limits on cash out refinances as compared to amortizing adjustable rate mortgages. Amortization of an interest only loan begins after the initial interest rate change (e.g. after 5 years for a 5/1 adjustable rate mortgage). Stated income loans represent a form of reduced documentation loan that requires a potential borrower to complete a standard mortgage application with full verification of the borrowers asset information as contained in the loan application, but no verification of the provided income information. As with interest only loans, underwriting guidelines for stated income loans require properties to be single family and owner occupied primary residences with lower loan to value ratios and higher credit scores. In addition, stated income loans require the receipt of an appraisal for the real estate used as collateral and a credit report on the prospective borrower. Peoples United Financials loan loss experience within the residential mortgage portfolio in 2007 was consistent with the level of loan losses sustained in prior years and continues to be primarily attributable to a small number of loans. Adjustable rate residential loans at December 31, 2007 decreased $682 million compared to year end 2006, while fixed rate mortgage loans decreased $5 million. Total adjustable rate residential loans increased $395 million in 2006 compared to year end 2005, while fixed rate mortgage loans decreased $3 million. Historically, Peoples United Financial has held virtually all of the adjustable rate residential mortgage loans that it originates on its balance sheet and has sold virtually all of the fixed rate residential mortgage loans that it originates into the secondary market. In 2006, Peoples United Financial completed a reassessment of its pricing with respect to adjustable rate residential mortgage loans in light of the prevailing interest rate environment at that time. As a result, Peoples United Financial made the decision in the fourth quarter of 2006 to sell essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. Peoples United Financial continues to actively offer residential mortgage loans of all types through its extensive distribution system. However, the level of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans it originated was reduced significantly in 2007 and may decline further. 53 Table of Contents Residential mortgage loan balances are expected to continue to decline in the future until Peoples United Financial resumes adding such loans to its portfolio to an extent that more than offsets repayments. The continued performance of the residential mortgage loan portfolio in 2008 may be adversely impacted by the level and direction of interest rates, consumer preferences and the regional economy. Residential Mortgage Originations Years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) Residential Mortgage Originations by Product Year ended December 31, 2007 (percent) Consumer Lending As of December 31 (in millions) 2007 2006 Home equity credit lines $ 938.5 $ 1,010.8 Second mortgages 285.9 279.8 Personal installment loans 10.8 14.1 Other loans 15.6 16.6 Total consumer $ 1,250.8 $ 1,321.3 Peoples United Financial offers Connecticut based customers home equity credit lines and second mortgage loans, and to a lesser extent, other forms of installment and revolving credit loans. In the first quarter of 2006, Peoples began offering home equity credit lines and loans in Massachusetts and New York. Future growth of Peoples United Financials consumer loan portfolio is highly dependent upon economic conditions, the interest rate environment and competitors strategies, as well as the success of Peoples United Financials marketing programs and information based strategies. At both December 31, 2007 and 2006, approximately 99% of the consumer loan portfolio was to customers located in Connecticut. The decrease in consumer loans primarily reflects a decline in home equity lending. Home equity loans decreased $66 million, or 5%, since year end 2006, following a nationwide pattern. 54 Table of Contents Commercial Banking The Commercial Banking lending businesses include commercial real estate, commercial and industrial lending and equipment financing by PCLC. Shared national credits are included in the commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending portfolios. In January 2008, Peoples United Financial announced its decision to unwind its shared national credits portfolio in an orderly manner over the next two to three years.

Historically, Peoples United Financials primary strategy has been to focus on lending in the state of Connecticut and adjacent states that represent its home market. In addition, Peoples United Financial will purchase interests in out of state loan participations. Included in commercial real estate loans are shared national credits totaling $284 million, $209 million and $143 million at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Peoples United Financials highest loan concentration in the commercial real estate loan portfolio was in the residential sector, which represented 27% of this loan portfolio at December 31, 2007, compared to 29% at December 31, 2006 and 25% at year end 2005. Commercial Real Estate Portfolio As of December 31 (dollars in millions) At December 31, 2007, approximately 65% of Peoples United Financials commercial real estate portfolio was secured by properties located in Connecticut, compared to approximately 68% at December 31, 2006. In addition, approximately 16% of the commercial real estate portfolio was secured by properties located in New York and Florida at December 31, 2007 and no other state exposure was greater than 5%. Included in the commercial real estate portfolio are construction loans totaling $607 million, $541 million and $512 million at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 55 Table of Contents Commercial real estate is dependent on the successful operation of the related income producing real estate. Accordingly, the income streams generated by this portfolio can be impacted by changes in the real estate market and, to a large extent, Connecticuts economy. The commercial real estate portfolio increased 6% in 2007 after slightly (0.5%) increasing in 2006 and decreasing 3% in 2005. Peoples United Financials continues to focus on maintaining strong asset quality standards in a competitive market generally characterized by aggressive pricing and less attractive underwriting terms. The growth and performance of this portfolio is largely dependent on the economic environment in Connecticut and may be adversely impacted if the economy slows in 2008. Commercial Real Estate Diversification As of December 31, 2007 (percent) Commercial and Industrial Lending As of December 31 (in millions) 2007 2006 Industry: Finance, insurance and real estate $ 425.6 $ 354.7 Manufacturing 386.1 412.1 Service 268.6 230.2 Wholesale distribution 153.3 119.9 Retail sales 121.9 113.6 Health services 115.4 108.5 Arts/entertainment/recreation 51.7 61.8 Transportation/utility 41.5 26.4 Other 54.8 66.6 Total commercial and industrial lending $ 1,618.9 $ 1,493.8 Peoples United Financial provides diversified products and services to its commercial customers, including short term working capital credit facilities, term financing, asset based loans, letters of credit, cash management services and commercial deposit accounts. Commercial products are generally packaged together to create a financing solution specifically tailored to the needs of the customer. Taking a total relationship focused approach with commercial customers to meet their financing needs has resulted in substantial growth in non interest bearing deposits over time, as well as in opportunities to provide other banking services to principals and employees of these commercial customers. The borrowers ability to repay a commercial loan is closely tied to the ongoing profitability and cash flow of the borrowers business. Consequently, a commercial loan tends to be more directly impacted by changes in economic cycles that affect businesses generally and the borrowers business specifically. The availability of adequate collateral is a factor in commercial loan decisions, and loans are generally collateralized and or guaranteed by third parties. 56 Table of Contents In 2007, the commercial and industrial lending portfolio increased $125 million, or 8%, compared to increases of $100 million, or 7%, in 2006 and $159 million or 13% in 2005. The increase in 2007 includes an $86 million, or 23%, increase in shared national credits, compared to an increase of $47 million, or 15%, for the full year of 2006. Included in commercial lending are shared national credits totaling $454 million, $368 million and $321 million at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. At December 31, 2007, approximately 66% of the commercial loan portfolio consisted of loans to Connecticut based businesses, compared to approximately 66% and 69% at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Commercial loan exposure in the states of California and New York totaled 16% at December 31, 2007 and no other state exposure was greater than 5%. While Peoples United Financial continues to focus on asset quality, the performance of the commercial lending portfolio may be adversely impacted if the economy slows in 2008. Commercial and Industrial Lending Diversification As of December 31, 2007 (percent) Commercial and Industrial Lending Portfolio As of December 31 (dollars in millions) Shared National Credits At December 31, 2007, the shared national credits loan portfolio totaled $738 million, compared to $577 million and $464 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and represented 16%, 14% and 12% of the total Commercial Banking loan portfolio at the respective dates. As discussed above, included in the shared national credits portfolio at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were commercial loans totaling $454 million, $368 million and $321 million, respectively, and commercial real estate loans totaling $284 million, $209 million and $143 million, respectively. In January 2008, Peoples United Financial announced its decision to unwind its shared national credits portfolio in an orderly manner over the next two to three years. 57 Table of Contents Peoples United Financial will purchase interests in shared national credits from and to other financial institutions having comparable asset quality standards. At December 31, 2007, the shared national credits loan portfolio consisted only of loans purchased from other financial institutions. At December 31, 2007, approximately $53 million, or 7%, of the shared national credits loan portfolio consisted of borrowers who are headquartered in Connecticut, while approximately $346 million, or 47%, consisted of borrowers located in California, Florida and New York. No other state exposure was greater than 8%.

PCLC will buy or sell portions of financing transactions in the secondary market to manage the concentration risk of the overall portfolio. At December 31, 2007, approximately 2% of the portfolio consisted of loans to Connecticut based businesses, while approximately 42% were loans to customers located in Texas, California, Florida, Illinois and New York. No other state exposure was greater than 5%. The PCLC portfolio grew $112 million, or 13%, in 2007, after increasing $235 million, or 37%, in 2006 and $182 million, or 40%, in 2005, reflecting managements decision to grow this portfolio. Operating on a national scale, PCLC represented 22% of the Commercial Banking loan portfolio at December 31, 2007, compared to 21% and 17% at year end 2006 and 2005, respectively. Based on the level of growth in this portfolio, the percentage increase in 2008 may not continue at recent levels. PCLC Diversification As of December 31, 2007 (percent) 58 Table of Contents PCLC Loan Portfolio As of December 31 (dollars in millions) Asset Quality The past several months have been marked by significant volatility in the financial and capital markets. This volatility has been attributable to a number of factors, including the fallout associated with the subprime mortgage market. This disruption has, in turn, led to credit and liquidity concerns which have resulted in a significant deterioration in activity within the secondary mortgage market. All of these issues have been further exacerbated by an accelerated softening of the real estate market. Subprime mortgage lending, which has been the riskiest sector of the residential housing market, is not a market Peoples United Financial has ever pursued. Further, Peoples United Financial has avoided exposure to similar, high risk Alt A loans and structured investment vehicles. While Peoples United Financial continues to adhere to prudent underwriting standards, the loan portfolio is geographically diverse and, therefore, is not immune to potential negative consequences arising as a result of general economic weakness and, in particular, a sharp downturn in the housing market on a national scale. Decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for loans. In addition, adverse changes in the economy could have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make scheduled loan payments, which would likely have an adverse impact on earnings. Further, an increase in loan delinquencies may serve to decrease net interest income and adversely impact loan loss experience, resulting in an increased provision and allowance for loan losses. Peoples United Financial actively manages asset quality through its underwriting practices and collection operations. Underwriting practices tend to focus on optimizing the return of a given risk classification while collection operations focus on minimizing losses once an account becomes delinquent. The allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses charged to income. Losses on loans, including impaired loans, are charged to the allowance for loan losses when all or a portion of a loan is deemed to be uncollectible. Recoveries of loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance for loan losses when realized. Peoples United Financial maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that is believed to be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio, based on a quarterly evaluation of a variety of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to: Peoples United Financial historical loan loss experience and recent trends in that experience; risk ratings assigned by lending personnel to commercial real estate, commercial and PCLC loans, and the results of ongoing reviews of those ratings by Peoples United Financial independent loan review function; an evaluation of non performing loans and related collateral values; the probability of loss in view of geographic and industry concentrations and other portfolio risk characteristics; the present financial condition of borrowers; and current economic conditions. Although Peoples United Financial seeks to use the best available information to make these evaluations, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions, results of regulatory examinations, further information obtained regarding known problem loans, the identification of additional problem loans and other factors. 59 Table of Contents Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses The following table presents the activity in the allowance for loan losses and ratios: Years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Beginning allowance for loan losses $ 74.0 $ 75.0 $ 72.5 $ 70.5 $ 69.2 Charge offs: Commercial (7.0 ) (5.2 ) (0.9 ) (0.6 ) (1.2 ) Consumer (2.7 ) (3.4 ) (4.9 ) (9.7 ) (16.8 ) PCLC (1.8 ) (0.6 ) (3.1 ) (1.5 ) (2.0 ) Commercial real estate (0.1 ) (3.2 ) Residential mortgage (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.2 ) (0.1 ) Total charge offs (11.5 ) (9.3 ) (9.1 ) (15.2 ) (20.1 ) Recoveries: Commercial 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.3 1.4 Consumer 1.1 1.6 2.0 2.8 2.9 PCLC 0.1 0.3 0.3 0.5 0.1 Commercial real estate 0.1 2.5 0.1 0.1 0.2 Residential mortgage 0.6 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.1 Total recoveries 2.2 4.9 3.0 3.9 4.7 Net loan charge offs (9.3 ) (4.4 ) (6.1 ) (11.3 ) (15.4 ) Provision for loan losses 8.0 3.4 8.6 13.3 16.7 Ending allowance for loan losses $ 72.7 $ 74.0 $ 75.0 $ 72.5 $ 70.5 Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans 0.81 % 0.79 % 0.87 % 0.91 % 0.99 % Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non performing loans 357.8 327.9 352.5 264.6 208.4 The provision for loan losses in 2007 totaled $8.0 million, a $4.6 million increase compared to $3.4 million in 2006. The 2007 period reflects $9.3 million in net loan charge offs, partially offset by a $1.3 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses. The 2006 period reflected net loan charge offs of $4.4 million and a $1.0 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses. Net loan charge offs increased $4.9 million in 2007 compared to 2006. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.81% at December 31, 2007 and 0.79% at December 31, 2006. Commercial loan net charge offs in 2007 include a $5.9 million charge off relating to one commercial banking loan that was placed on non accrual status in the fourth quarter of 2006 as previously disclosed. Consumer loan net charge offs decreased $0.2 million, or 10%, in 2007, as decreases of $0.3 million and $0.2 million in national consumer loan net charge offs and charge offs related to consumer overdrafts, respectively, were partially offset by a $0.2 million increase in home equity loan net charge offs. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average total loans equaled 0.10% in 2007, up from 0.05% in 2006, reflecting the $4.9 million increase in net loan charge offs and the impact on the ratio of a $120 million, or 1%, increase in average loans, both as compared to 2006. The very low level of net loan charge offs in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of average loans is unlikely to be sustainable in the future. The provision for loan losses decreased $5.2 million in 2006 compared to 2005, reflecting lower net loan charge offs in 2006 and a $1.0 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses in 2006, compared to a $2.5 million increase in the allowance for loan losses in 2005. Net loan charge offs in 2006 declined $1.7 million, or 28%, compared to 2005. Commercial loan net charge offs in 2006 reflect a $4.0 million charge off relating to 60 Table of Contents one commercial banking loan that was placed on non accrual status in the second quarter of 2006. Consumer loan net charge offs decreased $1.2 million, or 39%, reflecting a $1.9 million decrease in national consumer loan net charge offs. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average total loans decreased 2 basis points to 0.05% in 2006 compared to 0.07% in 2005. In addition to the $1.7 million decrease in net loan charge offs, the improvement in the net loan charge off ratio reflected a $715 million, or 9%, increase in average total loans.

These decreases were partially offset by an increase to the allowance for loan losses and a corresponding increase to the provision for loan losses by $2.3 million for the PCLC loan portfolio (reflecting loan growth in 2007) and by $0.2 million for the commercial real estate loan portfolio. As a result of these changes, the total allowance for loan losses declined by $1.3 million in 2007. A loan is classified as non accrual generally when it becomes 90 days past due as to interest or principal payments. All previously accrued but unpaid interest on non accrual loans is reversed from interest income in the current period. Interest payments received on non accrual loans (including impaired loans) are generally applied as a reduction of principal if future collections are doubtful, although such interest payments may be recognized 61 Table of Contents as income. A loan remains on non accrual status until the factors that indicated doubtful collectibility no longer exist or until a loan is determined to be uncollectible and is charged off against the allowance for loan losses. The classification of a loan as non performing does not necessarily indicate that loan principal and interest ultimately will not be collected. Peoples United Financial historical experience suggests that a portion of these assets will eventually be recovered. All non performing loans are in various stages of collection, workout, settlement or foreclosure. When loan workout efforts are exhausted and it is determined that the borrower is unable to repay the obligation, Peoples United Financial will complete foreclosure procedures, if applicable. Restructured commercial and commercial real estate loans are those for which concessions to below market terms, such as below market interest rates or deferral of interest, have been granted due to the borrowers financial condition. Non Performing Assets The following table presents information regarding non accrual loans, restructured loans, real estate owned and repossessed assets: As of December 31 (dollars in millions) 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Non accrual loans: Residential mortgage $ 8.9 $ 6.7 $ 6.7 $ 7.5 $ 11.4 Commercial real estate 3.7 0.2 5.8 8.7 11.4 Consumer 3.3 1.7 1.3 0.9 2.5 PCLC 3.1 2.1 6.2 5.1 4.2 Commercial 1.3 11.9 1.3 5.2 3.3 Total non accrual loans 20.3 22.6 21.3 27.4 32.8 Restructured loans 1.0 Total non performing loans 20.3 22.6 21.3 27.4 33.8 Real estate owned (REO) and repossessed assets, net 5.8 0.1 0.7 1.2 0.5 Total non performing assets $ 26.1 $ 22.7 $ 22.0 $ 28.6 $ 34.3 Non performing loans as a percentage of total loans 0.23 % 0.24 % 0.25 % 0.35 % 0.48 % Non performing assets as a percentage of total loans, REO and repossessed assets 0.29 0.24 0.26 0.36 0.48 Non performing assets as a percentage of stockholders equity and allowance for loan losses 0.58 1.61 1.62 2.25 3.20 Total non performing assets increased $3.4 million, or 15%, from December 31, 2006 and were 0.29% of total loans, real estate owned and repossessed assets at December 31, 2007. Increases in non performing commercial real estate loans of $3.5 million, REO and repossessed assets of $5.7 million, non performing PCLC loans of $1.0 million and non performing residential mortgage loans of $2.2 million, were partially offset by a decrease of $10.6 million in non performing commercial loans. The decrease in non performing commercial loans primarily reflects the $5.9 million charge off related to one loan discussed above. The increase in non performing commercial real estate loans reflects one loan totaling $3.4 million that was classified as non performing in 2007. The increase in REO and repossessed assets primarily reflects the repossession of a printing press and ancillary equipment from one borrower and the transfer to real estate owned of the real estate securing the remaining balance of the non performing commercial loan discussed above. Total non performing assets at December 31, 2006 increased $0.7 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2005 and improved 2 basis points to 0.24% of total loans, real estate owned and repossessed assets at December 31, 2006. Reductions of $5.6 million and $4.1 million in non performing commercial real estate and PCLC loans, respectively, were essentially offset by a $10.6 million increase in non performing commercial loans. The net increase in non performing commercial loans since December 31, 2005 reflects one $10.6 million loan that was classified as non performing in the fourth quarter of 2006. The decrease in non performing commercial real 62 Table of Contents estate loans since December 31, 2005 reflects the favorable resolution of one non performing loan that generated a $2.3 million cash recovery. The level of non performing assets is expected to fluctuate in response to changing economic and market conditions, and the relative sizes of the respective loan portfolios, along with managements degree of success in resolving problem assets. At December 31, 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003, Peoples United Financials portfolio did not include any loans, not included in the table above, which are troubled debt restructurings as defined in SFAS No. 15, Accounting by Debtors and Creditors for Troubled Debt Restructurings. As of December 31, 2007, if all non accruing loans had been current in accordance with their terms and had been outstanding throughout 2007 or since origination if held for part of the year, the gross interest income that would have been recorded in 2007 on such loans would have amounted to approximately $2.3 million. The amount of interest income on the non accruing loans included in net income in 2007 was $0.7 million. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Detailed discussions pertaining to Peoples United Financials off balance sheet arrangements are included in the following sections: Funding, Liquidity, Capital and Market Risk Management. Funding At the current time, Peoples United Financials primary funding sources are deposits and stockholders equity, which represent 98% of total assets at December 31, 2007. Borrowings also are an available source of funding. Based on Peoples United Banks membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston and the level of qualifying collateral available at December 31, 2007, Peoples United Bank had up to $3.1 billion of borrowing capacity in the form of advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston and Federal Reserve Bank, and repurchase agreements. Peoples United Bank also had unsecured borrowing capacity of $1.1 billion at December 31, 2007.

Peoples United Financial provides customers access to their deposits through 79 traditional branches, 75 full service Stop & Shop supermarket branches, seven limited service branches, over 250 ATMs, telephone banking and an Internet banking site that is fully integrated with Peoples United Financials brokerage subsidiary, PSI. Core deposits equaled 65% and 85% of total assets at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. While core deposits declined by $204 million, or 2%, from year end 2006, the change in the relative percentage of total assets reflects the $2.9 billion increase in total assets primarily with the net proceeds from the second step conversion. Core deposits and stockholders equity constituted over 99% of Peoples United Financials funding base at December 31, 2007 and over 98% at December 31, 2006. The expansion of Peoples United Financials branch network and its commitment to developing full service relationships with its customers are integral components of Peoples United Financials strategy to leverage the success of its supermarket banking initiative, expand market share and continue growing deposits. At December 31, 2007, Peoples United Financials statewide network of Stop & Shop branches held deposits totaling $2.1 billion and deposits in supermarket branches open for more than one year averaged $28 million per store. In 2007, Peoples United Financial expanded into Westchester County in New York State by opening 2 new traditional branches in Scarsdale and Mount Kisco. Peoples United Financial plans to continue its branch expansion by opening both traditional and Stop & Shop branches in Connecticut and traditional branches in New York. Non interest bearing deposits are an important source of low cost funding and fee income for Peoples United Financial. In addition, Peoples United Financial believes that checking accounts represent one of the core relationships between a financial institution and its customers, and it is from these relationships that cross selling of other financial services can be achieved. Non interest bearing core deposits equaled 24% and 25% of core deposits at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Time deposits of $100,000 or more totaled $972 million at December 31, 2007, of which $463 million mature within three months, $234 million mature after three months but within six months, $243 million mature after six months but within one year and $32 million mature after one year. There were no brokered certificates of deposit at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Commercial deposits fund a significant portion of the loan portfolio. Average non interest bearing commercial deposits totaled $883 million in 2007, a $56 million, or 6%, decrease compared to 2006. Average non interest bearing commercial deposits decreased by $43 million, or 4%, in 2006, after increasing by $43 million, or 5%, in 2005. The decreases in 2007 and 2006 are reflective of the interest rate environment in each year. The following table presents, by rate category, time deposits as of December 31, 2007.

Peoples United Financial uses federal funds purchased as a source of funds, which are typically unsecured overnight loans among banks. Sources include three of the twelve regional Federal Home Loan Banks and several money center and large regional banks. In previous years, Peoples United Financials primary source for borrowings was advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, which provides credit for member institutions within its assigned region. Peoples United Financials outstanding Federal Home Loan Bank advances at December 31, 2005 represented less than one half of one percent of total assets. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, there were no outstanding Federal Home Loan Bank advances. The average balances of Peoples United Financials advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston during 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $0.1 million, $47 million and $50 million, respectively, and the maximum Federal Home Loan Bank advances outstanding during 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $1 million, $155 million and $190 million, respectively. Another source of funds in previous years has been repurchase agreements. These transactions involve the sale of securities to broker/dealers under agreements to repurchase the same (or substantially the same) securities. Repurchase agreements with broker/dealers are limited to Reporting Federal Reserve Dealers in government securities that have been approved by Peoples United Financials Board of Directors. Subordinated Notes At December 31, 2007 and 2006, Peoples United Bank had $65 million of 9.875% subordinated notes outstanding. These subordinated notes are due in 2010 and are unsecured general obligations of Peoples United Bank with interest payable semi annually, are subordinated to the claims of depositors and Peoples United Banks other creditors and are not redeemable prior to maturity. They qualify, up to certain limits, as supplementary (tier 2) capital for risk based capital purposes. Contractual Cash Obligations The following table is a summary of Peoples United Financials contractual cash obligations, other than deposit liabilities, including operating leases. Additional information concerning these contractual cash obligations is included in Notes 11, 12 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase obligations included in the table represent those agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions. A substantial majority of Peoples United Financials purchase obligations are renewable on a year to year basis. As such, the purchase obligations included in this table only reflect the contractual commitment.

Liquidity management addresses Peoples United Financials and Peoples United Banks ability to fund new loans and investments as opportunities arise, to meet customer deposit withdrawals and to repay borrowings and subordinated notes as they mature. Peoples United Financials, as well as Peoples United Banks, liquidity positions are monitored daily by management. The Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO) of Peoples United Bank has been authorized by the Board of Directors of Peoples United Financial to set guidelines to ensure maintenance of prudent levels of liquidity for Peoples United Financial as well as for Peoples United Bank. ALCO reports to the Treasury and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors of Peoples United Bank. Asset liquidity is provided by: cash; short term investments; proceeds from security sales, maturities and principal repayments; and proceeds from scheduled principal collections, prepayments and sales of loans. In addition, certain securities may be used to collateralize borrowings under repurchase agreements. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows present data on cash provided by and used in Peoples United Financials operating, investing and financing activities. At December 31, 2007, Peoples United Financials liquid assets included $428 million in securities purchased under agreements to resell. Peoples United Banks liquid assets included $2.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $42 million in debt securities available for sale and $19 million in trading account securities. Securities available for sale with a total fair value of $22 million at December 31, 2007 were pledged as collateral for public deposits and for other purposes. Liability liquidity is measured by Peoples United Financials and Peoples United Banks ability to obtain core deposits and purchased funds at cost effective rates that are diversified with respect to markets and maturities. Core deposits, which are considered the most stable source of liability liquidity, totaled $8.8 billion at December 31, 2007, compared to $9.0 billion at December 31, 2006 (representing 66% and 86% of total funding at the respective dates). While core deposits declined $204 million, or 2%, since year end 2006, the change in relative percentage mix of total funding is primarily due to the substantial increase in stockholders equity with the net proceeds from the second step conversion. Purchased funds can be used from time to time to diversify Peoples United Financials funding mix and to support asset growth. Purchased funds totaled $45 million at December 31, 2007 and $47 million at December 31, 2006 (representing 0.3% and 0.5% of total funding at the respective dates). Peoples United Banks current sources of purchased funds include: federal funds purchased, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, municipal deposits and repurchase agreements. At December 31, 2007, Peoples United Banks borrowing limit from Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank advances, and repurchase agreements totaled $3.1 billion, based on the level of qualifying collateral available for these borrowing sources and in addition, Peoples United Bank had unsecured borrowing capacity of $1.1 billion. At December 31, 2007, Peoples United Bank had outstanding commitments to originate loans totaling $951 million and approved, but unused, lines of credit extended to customers totaling $2.7 billion (including $1.6 billion of home equity lines of credit). See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 67 Table of Contents The sources of liquidity discussed above are deemed by management to be sufficient to fund outstanding loan commitments and to meet Peoples United Financials and Peoples United Banks other obligations. Earning Asset Mix $12.5 billion as of December 31, 2007 (percent) Funding Base $13.4 billion as of December 31, 2007 (percent) Capital Peoples United Financials total stockholders equity was $4.45 billion at December 31, 2007, a $3.11 billion net increase from December 31, 2006. This increase primarily reflects the $3.33 billion of net proceeds from the second step conversion, net income of $150.7 million, a common stock contribution with a fair value of $40.0 million to The Peoples United Community Foundation and a $29.4 million decrease in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) since December 31, 2006, partially offset by purchases of common stock for the ESOP and 2007 Recognition and Retention Plan totaling $343.9 million and dividends paid in 2007 of $131.1 million. The decrease in AOCL reflects a $16.8 million after tax increase in net actuarial loss, prior service costs and transition obligation on pension and other postretirement benefits, and a $12.6 million after tax increase in the net unrealized gain on derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges. Peoples United Financials total stockholders equity was $1.34 billion at December 31, 2006, a $51 million net increase compared to $1.29 billion at December 31, 2005. This increase primarily reflects net income of $124.0 million, partially offset by dividends paid in 2006 of $60.0 million and a $24.6 million increase in AOCL since December 31, 2005. The net increase in AOCL primarily reflects a $40.0 million after tax increase from the adoption of SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, effective December 31, 2006, partially offset by a $18.9 million after tax reduction in the net unrealized loss on securities available for sale due to the sales of securities in 2006. Dividends declared and paid per common share (other than shares on which Peoples Mutual Holdings waived receipt of dividends prior to completing the second step conversion in April 2007) were $0.52, $0.46 and $0.40 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Peoples United Financials dividend payout ratio (dividends paid as a percentage of net income) for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was 87.0%, 48.3% and 38.3%, respectively. The increase in the dividend payout ratio reflects the waiver of 68 Table of Contents dividends on the substantial majority of the common shares owned by Peoples Mutual Holdings prior to completing the second step conversion in April 2007. Stockholders equity equaled 32.8% of total assets at December 31, 2007, compared to 12.5% at December 31, 2006. Capital Requirements. OTS capital regulations require federally chartered savings banks, such as Peoples United Bank, to meet three minimum capital ratios: Tangible Capital Ratio A 1.5% tangible capital ratio, calculated as tangible capital to adjusted total assets. Leverage (Core) Capital Ratio A 4% leverage (core) capital ratio, calculated as core capital to adjusted total assets. The minimum leverage (core) capital ratio is reduced to 3% if the savings bank received the highest rating on its most recent safety and soundness examination. Risk Based Capital Ratio An 8% total risk based capital ratio, calculated as total capital to risk weighted assets. For purposes of this calculation, total capital includes core and supplementary capital, provided that supplementary capital may not exceed 100% of core capital. In assessing an institutions capital adequacy, the OTS takes into consideration not only these numeric factors but also qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where necessary. Peoples United Bank, as a matter of prudent management, targets as its goal the maintenance of capital ratios which exceed these minimum requirements and that are consistent with Peoples United Banks risk profile. The following summary compares Peoples United Banks regulatory capital amounts and ratios as of December 31, 2007 to the OTS minimum requirements. In 2007, Peoples United Financial made a $1.7 billion capital contribution to Peoples United Bank from a portion of the net proceeds from the second step conversion. Peoples United Banks adjusted total assets, as defined, totaled $12.1 billion at December 31, 2007 and its risk weighted assets, as defined, totaled $9.0 billion at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2007, Peoples United Bank exceeded each of its capital requirements. As of December 31, 2007 (dollars in millions) Peoples United Bank OTS MinimumRequirements Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Tangible capital $ 2,903.8 (1) 24.1 % $ 180.8 1.5 % Leverage (core) capital 2,903.8 (1) 24.1 482.1 4.0 Total risk based capital 3,001.0 (2) 33.4 719.2 8.0 (1) Represents total stockholders equity, excluding (i) after tax net unrealized gains (losses) on debt and certain equity securities classified as available for sale, (ii) after tax net unrealized losses on derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges, (iii) certain assets not recognized in tier 1 capital (principally goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles), and (iv) the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) relating to SFAS No. 158. (2) Represents tier 1 capital plus subordinated notes, up to certain limits, and the allowance for loan losses up to 1.25% of risk adjusted total assets. 69 Table of Contents Peoples United Banks regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2007 exceeded the OTS numeric criteria for classification as well capitalized. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning Peoples United Banks regulatory capital amounts and ratios. Peoples United Bank Capital Ratios Compared to Regulatory Requirements As of December 31, 2007 (percent) Market Risk Management Market risk is the risk of loss to earnings, capital and the fair market values of certain assets and liabilities resulting from changes in interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. Interest Rate Risk For Peoples United Bank, the only relevant market risk at this time is interest rate risk (IRR), which is the potential exposure to earnings or capital that may result from changes in interest rates. Peoples United Bank actively manages its IRR to achieve a balance between risk, earnings volatility and capital preservation. ALCO has primary responsibility for managing Peoples United Banks IRR. To evaluate Peoples United Banks IRR profile, ALCO monitors economic conditions, interest rate trends, liquidity levels and capital ratios. Management also reviews assumptions periodically for projected customer and competitor behavior, in addition to the expected repricing characteristics and cash flow projections for assets, liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments. Actual conditions may vary significantly from Peoples United Banks assumptions. Management evaluates the impact of IRR on Income at Risk using an earnings simulation model to project earnings under multiple interest rate environments over a one year time horizon resulting in a quantification of IRR. Income at Risk includes significant interest rate sensitive income sources, such as net interest income, gains on sales of residential mortgage loans and BOLI income. The earnings projections are based on a static balance sheet and estimates of pricing levels for Peoples United Banks products under multiple scenarios intended to reflect instantaneous yield curve shocks. Peoples United Bank estimates its base case Income at Risk using current interest rates. Internal guidelines regarding IRR simulation specify that for instantaneous parallel shifts of the yield curve, estimated Income at Risk for the subsequent one year period should not decline by more than: 10% for a 100 basis point shift; 15% for a 200 basis point shift; and 20% for a 250 basis point shift. 70 Table of Contents The following table shows the estimated percentage increase (decrease) in Peoples United Banks Income at Risk over a one year simulation period beginning December 31, 2007. Rate Change (basis points) Percent Change inIncome at Risk +300 24.05 % +200 16.73 +100 8.14 100 (6.47 ) 200 (13.98 ) 250 (18.31 ) While Income at Risk simulation identifies earnings exposure over a relatively short time horizon, Market Value of Equity (MVE) takes a long term economic perspective when quantifying IRR. MVE identifies possible margin behavior over a longer time horizon and is therefore a valuable complement of interest rate risk management. Base case MVE is calculated by estimating the net present value of all future cash flows from existing assets and liabilities using current interest rates. The base case scenario assumes that future interest rates remain unchanged. Internal guidelines limit the exposure of a decrease in MVE resulting from instantaneous parallel shifts of the yield curve in the following manner: for 100 basis points 10% of base case MVE; for 200 basis points 15% of base case MVE; and for 250 basis points 20% of base case MVE. The following table shows the estimated percentage decrease in Peoples United Bank MVE, assuming various shifts in interest rates. Rate Change (basis points) Percent Change inMarket Value of Equity +300 (3.57)% +200 (1.78) +100 (0.55) 100 (0.62) 200 (1.98) 250 (2.67) Management believes Peoples United Banks interest rate risk position at December 31, 2007 represents an acceptable level of risk. However, given the uncertainty of the magnitude, timing and direction of future interest rate movements and the shape of the yield curve, actual results may vary from those predicted by Peoples United Banks models. Peoples United Bank uses derivative financial instruments, including interest rate floors and interest rate swaps, as components of its IRR management. Peoples United Bank has written guidelines that have been approved by its Board of Directors and ALCO governing the use of these financial instruments, including approved counterparties and risk limits, and controls the credit risk of these instruments through collateral, credit approvals and monitoring procedures. At December 31, 2007, each of Peoples United Banks counterparties had an investment grade credit rating from the major rating agencies and is specifically approved up to a maximum credit exposure. Derivative financial instruments have been used for market risk management purposes (principally interest rate risk) and not for trading or speculative purposes. Peoples United Bank is currently using interest rate floors and interest rate swaps to manage IRR associated with certain interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Peoples United Bank is currently using interest rate floors to partially manage its exposure to a decrease in interest income resulting from declines in certain interest rates. These interest rate floors offer protection against a decline in interest income if the one month LIBOR index rate used to reprice certain floating rate commercial loans declines below the strike rate 71 Table of Contents on the interest rate floors. If the one month LIBOR index rate falls below the specified strike rate, Peoples United Bank would receive an interest payment on the interest rate floor equal to the difference between the one month LIBOR index rate on the reset date and the strike rate, which in effect, would offset the decline in interest income earned on the hedged floating rate commercial loans from the decline in interest rates. Interest rate floors are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Interest rate swaps are used to match more closely the repricing of fewer than five commercial real estate loans and the funding associated with these loans. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the funding liabilities from a variable interest rate into a fixed interest rate and consequently reduce Peoples United Banks exposure to increases in interest rates and their effect on interest income and interest expense. Interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign exchange forward contracts are commitments to buy or sell foreign currency on a future date at a contractual price. Peoples United Bank uses these instruments on a limited basis to eliminate its exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates on certain of its commercial loans that are denominated in foreign currencies. Gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts substantially offset the translation gains and losses on the related loans.

The consolidated financial statements and related footnotes are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Management is also responsible for compliance with laws and regulations relating to safety and soundness as designated by the Office of Thrift Supervision. The Board of Directors has an Audit Committee composed of five outside directors, each of whom meets the criteria for independence as set forth in applicable listing standards. The Audit Committee meets regularly with the independent auditors, the internal auditors and management to ensure that the system of internal control over financial reporting is being properly administered and that financial data is being properly reported. The Audit Committee reviews the scope and timing of internal audits, including recommendations made with respect to the system of internal control over financial reporting. The independent auditors and the internal auditors have free access to the Audit Committee. MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting for Peoples United Financial, Inc. Management maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting, including an internal audit function, which is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, transactions are properly authorized, and that accounting records are reliable for the preparation of financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that internal control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on its assessment, management has concluded that Peoples United Financial, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. /s/ Philip R.
