Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements Periodic and other filings made by Peoples United Financial with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) may from time to time contain information and statements that are forward looking in nature. Such filings include the Annual Report on Form 10 K, Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q and Current Report on Form 8 K, and may include other forms such as proxy statements. Other written or oral statements made by Peoples United Financial or its representatives from time to time may also contain forward looking statements. In general, forward looking statements usually use words such as may, believe, expect, anticipate, should, plan, estimate, predict, continue and potential or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Examples of forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, estimates with respect to Peoples United Financials financial condition, results of operations and business that are subject to various factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates. Forward looking statements represent managements beliefs, based upon information available at the time the statements are made, with regard to the matters addressed; they are not guarantees of future performance. All forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause Peoples United Financials actual results or financial condition to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such statements. Factors of particular importance to Peoples United Financial include, but are not limited to: (1) changes in general, national or regional economic conditions; (2) changes in interest rates; (3) changes in loan default and charge off rates; (4) changes in deposit levels; (5) changes in levels of income and expense in non interest income and expense related activities; (6) residential mortgage and secondary market activity; (7) changes in accounting and regulatory guidance applicable to banks; (8) price levels and conditions in the public securities markets generally; (9) competition and its effect on pricing, spending, third party relationships and revenues; and (10) the successful completion of the integration of Chittenden Corporation.

Peoples United Financial does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Recent Market Developments In response to the unprecedented challenges currently affecting the banking system, the Federal government recently announced several programs designed to address a variety of issues facing the financial sector. Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program On October 3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the EESA) was signed into law. The EESA, which is intended to stabilize and provide liquidity to the U.S. financial markets, authorized the U.S. Treasury, acting in accordance with the provisions of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (the TARP), to (i) purchase up to $700 billion of mortgages, mortgage backed securities, and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions, and (ii) establish a program to guarantee certain assets issued by financial institutions prior to March 14, 2008. The company has decided not to sell any of its assets pursuant to the TARP or to participate in the asset guarantee program. 21 Table of Contents On October 14, 2008, the U.S. Treasury announced a plan to employ a portion of its purchasing authority, as provided for by the EESA, in making direct equity investments in qualifying banks and thrifts. Under this program, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program Capital Purchase Program (the TARP CPP), the U.S. Treasury will utilize up to $250 billion of the $700 billion authorized by the EESA to purchase preferred stock in qualifying institutions that request such investments. The preferred stock TARP CPP contains a number of provisions, some of which could reduce investment returns to participating banks shareholders by restricting dividends to common shareholders, diluting existing shareholders interests, and restricting capital management practices. Peoples United Bank currently exceeds all applicable regulatory capital requirements and remains well capitalized. The company did not apply for equity capital under the TARP CPP. FDIC Insurance Coverage / Assessments The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC) insures deposits at FDIC insured financial institutions up to certain limits, charging premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund (the DIF) at specified levels. Such premiums may vary based on the risk profile of the insured institution. Current economic conditions have resulted in an increased number of bank failures and, consequently, greater use of DIF resources. In response, the FDIC has proposed higher premium assessments for 2009 pursuant to a restoration plan designed to increase the DIF reserve ratio to required levels. Under the FDICs proposed restoration plan, the premium assessment rate was raised by seven basis points beginning on January 1, 2009 resulting in a 2009 initial base assessment rate of 12 basis points for Peoples United Bank. In addition, on February 27, 2009, the FDIC approved an additional one time special assessment of 20 basis points on deposits. Further changes in assessment rates are anticipated later in 2009. The EESA increased the FDIC deposit insurance limit from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor through December 31, 2009. In addition, on October 14, 2008, the FDIC announced the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, which consists of two components: temporary unlimited deposit insurance on funds in non interest bearing transaction deposit accounts not otherwise covered by the increased $250,000 deposit insurance limit (the Transaction Account Guarantee Program) and a temporary guarantee of certain newly issued unsecured debt (the Debt Guarantee Program). All eligible institutions were covered under both programs for the first 30 days without incurring any costs. After the initial 30 day period, institutions participating in the Transaction Account Guarantee Program are assessed a 10 basis point surcharge on the additional insured deposits and institutions participating in the Debt Guarantee Program are subject to an annualized charge equal to 75 basis points. The company has elected to participate in the Transaction Account Guarantee Program as it participates in all other FDIC deposit insurance programs. While Peoples United Financial has retained its right to do so, the company does not, at this time, intend to issue senior unsecured debt securities under the Debt Guarantee Program. Based on the FDICs proposal to increase the premium assessment rate, the special assessment announced in February 2009, and the companys participation in the Transaction Account Guarantee Program, the companys cost of deposit insurance is expected to increase significantly in 2009. The actual amount of the increase will be dependent on several factors, including: (i) deposit levels; (ii) the companys risk profile; and (iii) whether the FDICs restoration plan is adopted as proposed or amended. The actions described above, together with additional actions announced by the U.S. Treasury and other regulatory agencies continue to develop. It is not clear at this time what impact the EESA, the TARP, the TARP CPP, or other liquidity and funding programs of the U.S. Treasury and bank regulatory agencies, whether previously announced or initiated in the future, will have on the capital markets and the financial services industry. The extreme levels of market volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced could continue to adversely affect the U.S. banking industry and the broader U.S. and global economies for the foreseeable future, which will have an effect on all financial institutions, including Peoples United Financial. 22 Table of Contents General Peoples United Financial, Inc. (Peoples United Financial) is a savings and loan holding company incorporated under the state laws of Delaware and the holding company for Peoples United Bank. On April 16, 2007, Peoples United Financial, Peoples United Bank and Peoples Mutual Holdings completed their second step conversion from a mutual holding company structure to a fully public stock holding company structure. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of the second step conversion. Peoples United Financial is regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision (the OTS) and is subject to OTS examination, supervision and reporting requirements. Peoples United Financial had not engaged in any business through March 31, 2007; accordingly, the financial information for periods prior to March 31, 2007 is that of Peoples United Bank. On June 6, 2007, Peoples Bank changed its name to Peoples United Bank. The name Peoples United Bank is used to refer to the Bank both before and after the name change. On January 1, 2008, Peoples United Financial completed its acquisition of Chittenden Corporation, a multi bank holding company headquartered in Burlington, Vermont. At December 31, 2007, Chittenden had total assets of $7.4 billion, total loans of $5.7 billion, total deposits of $6.2 billion and 140 branches. The six former Chittenden banks, which continue to do business under their existing names as divisions of Peoples United Bank, are: Chittenden Trust Company based in Burlington, Vermont; Flagship Bank and Trust Company based in Worcester, Massachusetts; Maine Bank & Trust Company based in Portland, Maine; Merrill Merchants Bank based in Bangor, Maine; Ocean Bank based in Portsmouth, New Hampshire; and The Bank of Western Massachusetts based in Springfield, Massachusetts. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and accordingly, Chittendens assets and liabilities were recorded by Peoples United Financial at their estimated fair values as of January 1, 2008. Financial data for periods prior to the acquisition date do not include the results of Chittenden. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of the acquisition. Peoples United Bank is a federally chartered stock savings bank headquartered in Bridgeport, Connecticut with $19.3 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2008. Peoples United Bank was organized in 1842 as a mutual savings bank, converted to stock form in 1988, and in 2006 converted from a Connecticut chartered stock savings bank to a federally chartered stock savings bank. Deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF of the FDIC. Peoples United Bank is regulated by the OTS. The principal business of Peoples United Financial is to provide, through Peoples United Bank and its subsidiaries, commercial banking, retail and small business banking, and wealth management services to individual, corporate and municipal customers. Traditional banking activities are conducted primarily within New England and include extending secured and unsecured commercial and consumer loans, originating mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial properties, and accepting consumer, commercial and municipal deposits. In addition to traditional banking activities, Peoples United Bank provides specialized financial services tailored to specific markets including: personal, institutional and employee benefit trust; cash management; and municipal banking and finance. Through its non banking subsidiaries, Peoples United Bank offers: brokerage, financial advisory services, investment management services and life insurance through Peoples Securities, Inc. and Chittenden Securities, LLC; equipment financing through Peoples Capital and Leasing Corp. (PCLC); and other insurance services through R.C. Knox and Company, Inc. and Chittenden Insurance Group, LLC. This full range of financial services is delivered through a network of over 300 branches, including 79 full service Stop & Shop supermarket branches that provide customers with seven day a week banking, 43 investment and brokerage offices, nine PCLC offices and 16 commercial banking offices. Peoples United Banks distribution network also includes online banking and investment trading, a 24 hour telephone banking service and participation in a worldwide ATM network. 23 Table of Contents PCLC maintains a sales presence in six states to support its equipment financing operations outside of New England. Within the Commercial Banking division, Peoples United Bank maintains a national credits group, which has participated in commercial loans and commercial real estate loans to borrowers in various industries on a national scale. Peoples United Financials results of operations are largely dependent upon revenues generated through net interest income and fee based revenues and, to a much lesser extent, other forms of non interest income such as gains on asset sales. Sources for these revenues are diversified across Peoples United Financials three primary business segments that represent its core businesses, Commercial Banking, Retail Banking and Small Business, and Wealth Management, and to a lesser extent, Treasury. Peoples United Financials results of operations are also significantly affected by the provision for loan losses and the level of non interest expense. In addition, Peoples United Financials results of operations may also be affected by general and local economic conditions, changes in market interest rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Critical Accounting Policies In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, Peoples United Financial is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from Peoples United Financials current estimates, as a result of changing conditions and future events. Several accounting estimates are particularly critical and are susceptible to significant near term change, including the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of derivative financial instruments, and asset impairment judgments, such as the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets and other than temporary declines in the value of securities. The current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these significant estimates. Peoples United Financials significant accounting policies and critical estimates are summarized in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses charged to income. Losses on loans, including impaired loans, are charged to the allowance for loan losses when all or a portion of a loan is deemed to be uncollectible. Recoveries of loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance when realized. Management maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that is deemed adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio, based on a quarterly evaluation of a variety of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to: Peoples United Financials historical loan loss experience and recent trends in that experience; risk ratings assigned by lending personnel to commercial real estate, commercial and PCLC loans, and the results of ongoing reviews of those ratings by Peoples United Financials independent loan review function; an evaluation of delinquent and non performing loans and related collateral values; the probability of loss in view of geographic and industry concentrations and other portfolio risk characteristics; the present financial condition of borrowers; and current economic conditions. While management seeks to use the best available information to make these evaluations, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions, results of regulatory examinations, further information obtained regarding known problem loans, the identification of additional problem loans and other factors. The allowance for loan losses consists of amounts determined in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, and SFAS No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan. In applying SFAS No. 5, management considers the factors listed in the preceding paragraph in order to estimate a loss allowance for (i) each homogeneous pool of smaller balance loans (residential mortgage and consumer loans) that are evaluated on a collective basis, and (ii) commercial real estate and commercial loans that are not subjected to an individual evaluation for impairment under SFAS No. 114. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that Peoples United Financial will be unable to collect all principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan. Peoples United Financial applies SFAS No. 114 to loans that are individually evaluated for collectibility in 24 Table of Contents accordance with its normal loan review procedures. Under SFAS No. 114, if the measurement of an impaired loan is less than its recorded investment, an impairment loss is recognized as part of the allowance for loan losses. Valuation of Derivative Financial Instruments. Peoples United Financial uses derivatives primarily for market risk management purposes (principally interest rate risk). Certain other derivatives are entered into in connection with transactions with commercial customers. Derivatives are not used for speculative purposes. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, all derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. Until such time that a derivative is settled, favorable changes in fair values result in unrealized gains that are recognized as assets, while unfavorable changes result in unrealized losses that are recognized as liabilities. Peoples United Financial applies hedge accounting to its derivatives used for market risk management purposes. The hedge accounting methods depend on whether the derivative instrument is classified as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. Hedge accounting is permitted only if specific criteria are met, including a requirement that a highly effective relationship exist between the derivative instrument and the hedged item, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis. Changes in the fair value of effective fair value hedges are recognized in current earnings. Changes in the fair value of effective cash flow hedges are recognized in other comprehensive income or loss until earnings are affected by the variability in cash flows of the designated hedged item. Ineffective portions of hedge results are recognized in current earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied are recognized in current earnings. Peoples United Financial formally documents at inception all relationships between the derivative instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as hedges to specific assets and liabilities, or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. Peoples United Financial also formally assesses, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged items. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective or has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, Peoples United Financial would discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. Gains or losses resulting from the termination of a derivative accounted for as a cash flow hedge generally remain in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and are amortized to earnings over the remaining period of the former hedging relationship. Interest rate lock commitments extended to borrowers relate to the origination of residential mortgage loans. To mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in these commitments, Peoples United Financial enters into mandatory delivery and best efforts contracts to sell adjustable rate and fixed rate residential mortgage loans (servicing released). Forward commitments to sell and interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans are considered derivatives and their respective estimated fair values are adjusted based on changes in interest rates and, prior to January 1, 2008, excluded the value of mortgage servicing rights. On January 1, 2008, Peoples United Financial adopted the provisions of Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 109, Written Loan Commitments Recorded at Fair Value through Earnings (SAB No. 109), which requires that the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of the loan be included in the measurement of all written loan commitments accounted for at fair value through earnings. Adoption of SAB No. 109 did not have a significant impact on the companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Asset Impairment Judgments Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, requires, among other things, use of the purchase method to account for all business combinations and specifies criteria that acquired intangible assets must meet in order to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. The assets and liabilities of an acquired company are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. Intangible assets are 25 Table of Contents recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of the tangible net assets acquired. Other acquisition related intangibles are separately identified, where appropriate, for assets such as trade names and the estimated values of acquired core deposits and or customer relationships. Trade names recognized by Peoples United Financial are deemed to have indefinite useful lives and, accordingly, are not amortized. Core deposit intangibles are amortized over 10 years on an accelerated basis that reflects the manner in which the related benefit attributable to the acquired deposits will be recognized. Customer relationship intangibles are amortized on a straight line basis (approximating the manner in which the benefit is realized) over the estimated remaining average life of those relationships (ranging from 7 to 15 years from the respective acquisition dates). The remaining intangible asset is classified as goodwill. SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually, with impairment losses charged to expense when they occur. Acquisition related intangible assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives and are periodically reviewed by management to assess recoverability. Impairment losses on other acquisition related intangibles are recognized as a charge to expense if carrying amounts exceed fair values. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. The test is performed as of an annual impairment testing date or more frequently if a triggering event indicates that impairment may have occurred. The goodwill impairment analysis is a two step test. The first step (Step 1) is used to identify potential impairment, and involves comparing each reporting units estimated fair value to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not deemed to be impaired. Should the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceed its estimated fair value, an indicator of potential impairment is deemed to exist and a second step is performed to measure the amount of such impairment, if any. The second step (Step 2) involves calculating the implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which impairment was indicated in Step 1. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to how the amount of goodwill is determined in a business combination (i.e. by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, as determined in Step 1, over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities, and identifiable intangibles applicable to that reporting unit as of the impairment testing date). If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, no impairment exists. If the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to such excess. An impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit, and the loss (write down) establishes a new carrying amount for the goodwill. Subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted. Peoples United Financial uses a present value measurement technique (discounted cash flow analysis) to estimate the fair value of its reporting units. This analysis is based on significant assumptions and judgments including (i) future growth rates and (ii) discount rates reflecting managements assessment of market participant views of the risks associated with the projected cash flows of the reporting units. Differences in the identification of reporting units or in the selection of valuation techniques and related assumptions could result in materially different evaluations of goodwill impairment. Securities. Marketable equity and debt securities (other than those reported as short term investments) are classified as either trading account securities, held to maturity securities (applicable only to debt securities) or available for sale securities. Management determines the classification of a security at the time of its purchase. Securities purchased for sale in the near term as well as those held by Peoples Securities and Chittenden Securities (in accordance with the requirements for a broker dealer) are classified as trading account securities and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in non interest income. Debt securities that 26 Table of Contents Peoples United Financial has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity securities and reported at amortized cost. All other securities are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported on an after tax basis in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Premiums are amortized and discounts are accreted to interest income for debt securities, using the interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity, adjusted for the effect of actual prepayments in the case of mortgage backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and other asset backed securities. FHLB stock is a non marketable equity security and is, therefore, reported at cost, which equals par value. Security transactions are generally recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method and reported in non interest income. Management conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if the decline in fair value of any security is deemed to be other than temporary. If the decline is deemed to be other than temporary, the security is written down to a new cost basis and the resulting loss is reported in non interest income. The factors considered by management in its periodic review include, but are not limited to: the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer; the ratings of the security; whether the decline in fair value appears to be issuer specific or, alternatively, a reflection of general market or industry conditions; and Peoples United Financials intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in fair value. Non GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation to GAAP In addition to evaluating Peoples United Financials results of operations in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management routinely supplements this evaluation with an analysis of certain non GAAP financial measures, such as the efficiency ratio. Management believes this non GAAP financial measure provides information useful to investors in understanding Peoples United Financials underlying operating performance and trends, and facilitates comparisons with the performance of other banks and thrifts. Further, the efficiency ratio is used by management in its assessment of financial performance specifically as it relates to non interest expense control. The efficiency ratio, which represents an approximate measure of the cost required by Peoples United Financial to generate a dollar of revenue, is the ratio of total non interest expense (excluding goodwill impairment charges, amortization of acquisition related intangibles and fair value adjustments, losses on real estate assets and nonrecurring expenses) (the numerator) to net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis (excluding fair value adjustments) plus total non interest income (including the fully taxable equivalent adjustment on bank owned life insurance income, and excluding gains and losses on sales of assets, other than residential mortgage loans, and nonrecurring income) (the denominator). Peoples United Financial generally considers an item of income or expense to be nonrecurring if it is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type incurred within the last two years and is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type reasonably expected to be incurred within the following two years. 27 Table of Contents The following table summarizes Peoples United Financials efficiency ratio derived from amounts reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 Total non interest expense $ 706.3 $ 439.3 $ 346.9 $ 344.4 $ 479.7 Less: Merger related expenses and other one time charges 51.3 Contribution to The Peoples United Community Foundation 60.0 Amortization of other acquisition related intangibles 21.3 1.0 1.1 1.8 3.4 REO expense 2.5 1.0 0.3 0.1 0.3 Fair value adjustments 3.2 Severance related charges 1.2 Goodwill impairment charge 2.0 Liability restructuring costs 2.7 133.4 Non recurring compensation costs 6.7 Other 0.9 1.2 0.7 1.3 Total $ 627.1 $ 377.3 $ 343.1 $ 337.1 $ 334.6 Net interest income (1) $ 640.3 $ 486.6 $ 382.4 $ 370.0 $ 327.4 Total non interest income 303.6 185.4 147.4 173.3 151.7 Add: BOLI FTE adjustment (1) 4.5 5.7 4.6 1.8 Fair value adjustments 10.4 Net security losses 27.2 0.1 4.7 Less: Net security gains 8.3 5.5 Gain on sale of assets 4.3 0.7 8.1 Other 1.3 0.3 0.1 Total $ 946.2 $ 672.2 $ 559.6 $ 536.8 $ 483.7 Efficiency ratio 66.3 % 56.1 % 61.3 % 62.8 % 69.2 % (1) Fully taxable equivalent. Economic Environment Peoples United Financials results are subject to fluctuations based on economic conditions. Economic activity in the United States slowed significantly throughout 2008 and more dramatically in the second half of the year. Real gross domestic product contracted at an annual rate of 6.2% in the fourth quarter of 2008, after declining 0.5% in the third quarter. The national unemployment rate was 7.2% as of December 31, 2008, up from 4.9% at the end of 2007. In response to a contracting U.S. economy and the significant disruptions in the capital markets primarily caused by the sub prime mortgage crisis and its after effects, the Federal Reserve Board lowered the targeted federal funds rate ten times since September 2007, and established a target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to 0.25 percent as of December 16, 2008. The New England region is Peoples United Financials primary market area, with Connecticut and Vermont having the largest concentration of Peoples United Financials loans, deposits and branches. Connecticut is one of the most attractive markets in the United States with a total population of approximately 28 Table of Contents 3.6 million and a median household income of $70,814 as of June 30, 2008, ranking second in the United States and well above the U.S. median income of $54,749, according to estimates from SNL Securities. Fairfield County, where Peoples United Financial is headquartered, is the wealthiest county in Connecticut, with a June 30, 2008 median household income of $88,571 according to estimates from SNL Securities. The states unemployment rate increased to 7.1% as of December 31, 2008 compared to 4.8% at the end of 2007, in line with the national rate. The Connecticut economy experienced a moderate decline in jobs in 2008, with total employment decreasing by 29,300 jobs, or approximately 1.7% from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008. The median household income in Vermont was $54,204 as of June 30, 2008, comparable to the national level, and the states unemployment rate was 6.4% at December 31, 2008, up from 3.9% at the end of 2007 but still below the national rate. The overall outlook for the New England economy in 2009 is consistent with the rest of the United States, with the expectation that the region will experience further increases in unemployment as long as the recessionary environment continues into 2009. Financial Overview Peoples United Financial completed its acquisition of Chittenden Corporation on January 1, 2008. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, financial data for periods prior to the acquisition date do not include the results of Chittenden Corporation and therefore, are not directly comparable to 2008. Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007. Total assets at December 31, 2008 were $20.2 billion, a $6.6 billion increase from December 31, 2007, reflecting increases of $5.6 billion in total loans and $1.4 billion in goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles (resulting from the Chittenden acquisition). The increase in total loans is primarily due to $5.7 billion in loans acquired in the Chittenden acquisition. The increase in total loans from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008 reflects increases of $3.1 billion in commercial real estate loans ($285 million of organic growth), $1.6 billion in commercial loans ($348 million of organic growth) and $1.0 billion in consumer loans ($153 million of organic growth). Excluding the effect of residential mortgage loans acquired in the Chittenden acquisition, residential mortgage loans would have decreased $813 million since December 31, 2007, reflecting Peoples United Financials decision in the fourth quarter of 2006 to begin selling essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. Residential mortgage loan balances are expected to continue to decline in the future until Peoples United Financial resumes adding such loans to its portfolio to an extent that more than offsets repayments. Non performing assets totaled $93.7 million at December 31, 2008, a $67.6 million increase from year end 2007, primarily reflecting additional non performing assets attributable to the acquired Chittenden loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses totaled $157.5 million at December 31, 2008 compared to $72.7 million at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2008, the allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans was 1.08% and as a percent of non performing loans was 187%, compared to 0.81% and 358%, respectively, at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2008, liabilities totaled $15.0 billion, a $5.9 billion increase from December 31, 2007, reflecting a $5.4 billion increase in total deposits primarily due to $6.2 billion in deposits acquired in the Chittenden acquisition. Peoples United Financials total stockholders equity was $5.2 billion at December 31, 2008, a $730 million increase from December 31, 2007. The increase primarily reflects the issuance of 44.3 million shares of common stock with a fair value (net of issuance costs) of approximately $770 million in connection with the 29 Table of Contents Chittenden acquisition and net income of $139.5 million, partially offset by dividends paid of $194.4 million and a $56.8 million increase in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. As a percentage of total assets, stockholders equity was 25.7% at December 31, 2008 compared to 32.8% at December 31, 2007. Tangible stockholders equity as a percentage of tangible assets was 19.5% at December 31, 2008 compared to 32.3% at December 31, 2007. Peoples United Banks leverage (core) capital ratio, and tier 1 and total risk based capital ratios were 10.0%, 12.2% and 13.4%, respectively, at December 31, 2008, compared to 24.1%, 32.3% and 33.4%, respectively, at December 31, 2007. The decrease in these ratios from December 31, 2007 primarily reflects (i) the reduction in Peoples United Banks regulatory capital due to the $1.8 billion in dividends that Peoples United Bank paid to its parent, Peoples United Financial, in 2008, and (ii) increases in Peoples United Banks adjusted total assets and its total risk weighted assets, both as a result of the Chittenden acquisition (see Regulatory Capital Requirements). Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006. Total assets at December 31, 2007 were $13.6 billion, an increase of $2.9 billion, or 27%, from December 31, 2006, primarily due to a $3.3 billion increase in short term investments, partially offset by a decrease of $422 million in total loans. The increase in short term investments reflects the net proceeds from the second step conversion completed on April 16, 2007. The decrease in total loans reflects a decline of $687 million in residential mortgage loans, partially offset by an increase of $336 million in commercial banking loans. The decrease in residential mortgage loans reflects Peoples United Banks decision in the fourth quarter of 2006 to sell essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans due to the low spreads on such loans. The growth in commercial banking loans reflects increases of $175 million in our national credits portfolio, $112 million in loans originated by PCLC, our equipment financing subsidiary, $34 million in commercial lending, and $15 million in commercial real estate loans. Non performing assets totaled $26.1 million at December 31, 2007, a $3.4 million increase from December 31, 2006. Increases in non performing commercial real estate loans of $3.5 million, real estate owned (REO) and repossessed assets of $5.7 million, non performing PCLC loans of $1.0 million and non performing residential mortgage loans of $2.2 million, were partially offset by a decrease of $10.6 million in non performing commercial loans. The decrease in non performing commercial loans primarily reflects the $5.9 million charge off relating to one commercial banking loan and the subsequent transfer to real estate owned of the real estate securing the remaining loan balance. The allowance for loan losses decreased $1.3 million to $72.7 million at December 31, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006, reflecting reductions in the allowance for loan losses allocated to the consumer loan portfolios and by net reductions to the commercial banking loan portfolios. At December 31, 2007, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.81% and as a percentage of non performing loans was 358%, compared to 0.79% and 328%, respectively, at December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2007, liabilities totaled $9.1 billion, a $238 million decrease from December 31, 2006, primarily due to a $202 million reduction in total deposits, reflecting Peoples United Financials strategy to fund loan growth with proceeds from maturities, sales and repayments of securities rather than deposits. Peoples United Financials total stockholders equity was $4.4 billion at December 31, 2007, a $3.1 billion increase from December 31, 2006, reflecting the net proceeds of $3.3 billion from the second step conversion and net income of $150.7 million, partially offset by the purchases of Peoples United Financial common stock for the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the ESOP) of $216.8 million and the 2007 Recognition and Retention Plan of $127.1 million, and dividends paid of $131.1 million. As a percentage of total assets, stockholders equity was 32.8% at December 31, 2007 compared to 12.5% at December 31, 2006. 30 Table of Contents Peoples United Banks leverage, tier 1 and total risk based capital ratios were 24.1%, 32.3% and 33.4%, respectively, at December 31, 2007, compared to 12.0%, 14.8% and 16.1%, respectively, at December 31, 2006. The improvements in the capital ratios from December 31, 2006 primarily reflect the $1.7 billion capital contribution from Peoples United Financial with a portion of the net proceeds from the second step conversion. Comparison of Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007. Peoples United Financial reported net income of $139.5 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $150.7 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, for the year ago period. Included in the 2008 results are merger related expenses of $41.0 million, other one time charges totaling $14.8 million and a $6.9 million gain related to the Visa, Inc. initial public offering (IPO). The net impact of these items reduced 2008 net income by $33.2 million, or $0.10 per diluted share. Results for 2007 included the $60.0 million contribution to The Peoples United Community Foundation, which had the effect of reducing net income in 2007 by $39.6 million, or $0.13 per diluted share. Excluding the effect of these items from the respective years results, earnings would have been $172.7 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, in 2008, compared to $190.3 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, in 2007. In 2008, Peoples United Financials return on average tangible assets was 0.74% and return on average tangible stockholders equity was 3.8%, compared to 1.19% and 4.3%, respectively, in 2007. Net interest income increased $149.8 million from 2007 while the net interest margin declined 50 basis points to 3.62%. The lower net interest margin reflects the interest rate cuts initiated by the Federal Reserve Bank in 2008 and 2007, and the companys asset sensitive balance sheet, including its significant excess capital position, which for most of 2008 was temporarily invested in low yielding short term investments. Average earning assets increased $5.9 billion, compared to 2007, reflecting increases of $5.3 billion in average loans and $1.0 billion in average securities, partially offset by a decrease of $0.4 billion in average short term investments. Average funding liabilities increased $5.8 billion compared to 2007, primarily reflecting a $5.5 billion increase in average deposits. Compared to 2007, total non interest income increased $118 million and total non interest expense increased $267 million (see Non Interest Income and Non Interest Expense). The efficiency ratio was 66.3% in 2008 compared to 56.1% in 2007. The provision for loan losses was $26.2 million compared to $8.0 million in 2007. The provision for loan losses in 2008 reflects net loan charge offs of $14.9 million and an $11.3 million increase in the allowance for loan losses, including a $4.5 million increase resulting from the alignment of the former Chittenden allowance for loan losses methodology with that of Peoples United Financial. The provision for loan losses in 2007 reflects net loan charge offs of $9.3 million, partially offset by a $1.3 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average loans equaled 0.10% in both 2008 and 2007. Comparison of Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006. Peoples United Financial reported net income in 2007 of $150.7 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, compared to $124.0 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, in 2006. Income from continuing operations totaled $149.2 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $121.7 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, for the year ago period. Results for 2007 include the $60.0 million contribution to The Peoples United Community Foundation (included in non interest expense), which had the effect of reducing net income by $39.6 million, or $0.13 per diluted share. 31 Table of Contents Results for 2006 include net security losses totaling $27.4 million from the sale of $1.1 billion of debt securities in 2006. Results for 2006 also include a $2.4 million income tax benefit related to certain prior year tax matters. The net impact of these items reduced 2006 net income by $15.8 million, or $0.11 per diluted share. Net interest income increased $104.2 million, or 27%, from 2006 and the net interest margin improved 25 basis points to 4.12%. These improvements reflect the investment of $3.3 billion in net proceeds from the second step conversion (completed on April 16, 2007) in short term investments, as well as the benefits from balance sheet restructuring activities completed during 2006. Compared to 2006, average earning assets increased $1.9 billion, or 20%, reflecting increases of $2.5 billion in average short term investments and $120 million in average loans, partially offset by a decrease of $735 million in average securities, reflecting the sale of $1.1 billion of debt securities in 2006 (described above). Total non interest income increased $38 million compared to 2006. Included in total non interest income are net security gains of $5.5 million in 2007 and net security losses of $23.2 million in 2006. Total non interest expense in 2007 increased $32.4 million, or 9%, compared to 2006, excluding the $60.0 million contribution to The Peoples United Community Foundation. The efficiency ratio improved to 56.1% from 61.3%. The provision for loan losses was $8.0 million compared to $3.4 million in 2006. The provision for loan losses in 2007 reflects net loan charge offs of $9.3 million, partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease in the allowance for loan losses. The provision for loan losses in 2006 reflects net loan charge offs of $4.4 million and a $1.0 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses. Net loan charge offs increased $4.9 million in 2007 compared to 2006. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average loans equaled 0.10% in 2007, up from 0.05% in 2006. Business Segment Results As a result of the Chittenden acquisition, Peoples United Financials business segments have been realigned to correspond with its three core businesses. All prior years business segment results have been restated to conform to the current presentation. Peoples United Financials operations are divided into three primary business segments that represent its core businesses, Commercial Banking, Retail Banking and Small Business, and Wealth Management. In addition, the Treasury area is responsible for managing Peoples United Financials securities portfolio, short term investments, wholesale funding activities, such as borrowings, and the funding center. Business Segment Performance Summary Net Income Years ended December 31 (in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Commercial Banking $ 98.1 $ 45.2 $ 46.8 Retail Banking and Small Business 97.8 55.4 78.0 Wealth Management 3.4 4.2 3.4 Total segments 199.3 104.8 128.2 Treasury (99.9 ) (8.6 ) (26.0 ) Other 40.1 54.5 21.8 Total Consolidated $ 139.5 $ 150.7 $ 124.0 Peoples United Financial uses an internal profitability reporting system to generate information by operating segment, which is based on a series of management estimates and allocations regarding funds transfer 32 Table of Contents pricing (FTP), the provision for loan losses, non interest expense and income taxes. These estimates and allocations, some of which can be subjective in nature, are continually being reviewed and refined. Any changes in estimates and allocations that may affect the reported results of any business segment will not affect the consolidated financial position or results of operations of Peoples United Financial as a whole. FTP is used in the calculation of each operating segments net interest income, and measures the value of funds used in and provided by an operating segment. The difference between the interest income on earning assets and the interest expense on funding liabilities, and the corresponding FTP charge for interest income or credit for interest expense, results in net spread income. A five year rolling average net charge off rate is used as the basis for the provision for loan losses for the respective segment. Peoples United Financial allocates a majority of non interest expenses to each business segment using a full absorption costing process. Direct and indirect costs are analyzed and pooled by process and assigned to the appropriate business segment and corporate overhead costs are allocated to the business segments. Income tax expense is allocated to each business segment using a constant rate, based on an estimate of the consolidated effective income tax rate for the year. Total average assets and total average liabilities are reported for each business segment due to managements reliance, in part, on such average balances for purposes of assessing business segment performance. For a more detailed description of the estimates and allocations used to measure business segment performance, see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Commercial Banking consists principally of commercial lending, commercial real estate lending, indirect auto lending, and commercial deposit gathering activities. This segment also includes the equipment financing operations of PCLC, as well as cash management, correspondent banking, municipal banking and corporate trust. Years ended December 31 (in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Net interest income $ 266.1 $ 115.9 $ 112.9 Provision for loan losses 18.7 10.3 9.7 Total non interest income 76.4 25.9 21.2 Total non interest expense 175.3 61.9 52.4 Income before income tax expense 148.5 69.6 72.0 Income tax expense 50.4 24.4 25.2 Income from continuing operations $ 98.1 $ 45.2 $ 46.8 Total average assets $ 9,289.7 $ 4,151.0 $ 3,804.6 Total average liabilities 2,416.3 757.3 931.6 Commercial Banking income from continuing operations increased $52.9 million in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily as a result of the Chittenden acquisition. The increase in net interest income in 2008 primarily reflects the increase in earning assets and liabilities resulting from the Chittenden acquisition. Total non interest income in 2008 includes $27.6 million of merchant services income and $21.2 million of bank service charges, and reflects a $2.8 million increase in rental income resulting from the higher level of equipment leased to PCLC customers. The increase in total non interest expense compared to 2007 reflects an increase of $68.5 million in direct and allocated support costs primarily due to the Chittenden acquisition, as well as $23.9 million of merchant services expense, and $8.9 million in amortization expense, reflecting additional amortization of the intangible assets resulting from the Chittenden acquisition. The increases in total average assets and total average liabilities compared to 2007 are primarily due to the Chittenden acquisition. The total average commercial banking loan portfolio increased $4.6 billion in 2008, reflecting increases of $3.0 billion in commercial real estate loans (including organic growth of $209 million), $1.5 billion in commercial loans (including organic growth of $100 million) and $0.1 billion in PCLC loans. 33 Table of Contents Commercial Banking income from continuing operations declined $1.6 million in 2007 compared to 2006, reflecting an increase in total non interest expense, partially offset by increases in net interest income and total non interest income. Net interest income increased $3.0 million in 2007, reflecting a $346 million, or 9%, increase in average assets, partially offset by narrower net spreads and a decline in commercial non interest bearing deposits. The increase in total non interest income compared to 2006 primarily reflects a $3.8 million increase in rental income on leased equipment. The $9.5 million, or 18%, increase in total non interest expense in 2007 reflects increases in direct expenses due to continued growth in Commercial Banking and a $2.8 million increase in amortization expense for leased equipment, as well as allocated expenses primarily related to costs associated with ongoing infrastructure upgrades. The increase in total average assets compared to 2006 reflects increases of $210 million, or 30%, in PCLC loans, $96 million, or 7%, in commercial loans and $42 million, or 2%, in commercial real estate loans. Retail Banking and Small Business includes, as its principal business lines, consumer and small business deposit gathering activities, consumer lending (including residential mortgage and home equity) and small business lending. Years ended December 31 (in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Net interest income $ 398.2 $ 264.4 $ 274.5 Provision for loan losses 5.5 3.6 3.8 Total non interest income 123.7 85.9 87.0 Total non interest expense 368.3 261.5 237.7 Income before income tax expense 148.1 85.2 120.0 Income tax expense 50.3 29.8 42.0 Income from continuing operations $ 97.8 $ 55.4 $ 78.0 Total average assets $ 6,501.0 $ 4,978.7 $ 5,193.2 Total average liabilities 12,078.0 8,219.3 8,219.7 Retail Banking and Small Business income from continuing operations increased $42.4 million in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily as a result of the Chittenden acquisition. The increase in net interest income in 2008 primarily reflects the increase in earning assets and liabilities resulting from the Chittenden acquisition, partially offset by the decline in the net spread income on deposits. Total non interest income in 2008 includes $109.2 million of bank service charges, $6.5 million of net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans and a $2.6 million gain on sale of mortgage servicing rights. The increase in total non interest expense compared to 2007 reflects an increase of $99.4 million in direct and allocated support costs primarily due to the Chittenden acquisition, and $8.2 million in amortization expense, reflecting additional amortization of the intangible assets resulting from the Chittenden acquisition. The increases in total average assets and total average liabilities compared to 2007 are primarily due to the Chittenden acquisition. Average residential mortgage loans decreased $30 million compared to 2007. Excluding the effect of residential mortgage loans acquired in the Chittenden acquisition, average residential mortgage loans would have decreased $803 million, reflecting Peoples United Financials decision in the fourth quarter of 2006 to begin selling essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. Average consumer loans increased $790 million, including a $541 million increase in average home equity loans, primarily as a result of the Chittenden acquisition. Retail Banking and Small Business income from continuing operations decreased $22.6 million in 2007 compared to 2006, reflecting an increase in total non interest expense and a decline in net interest income. The decrease in net interest income in 2007 reflects a reduction in residential mortgage loan net spread interest income, and a shift from wider net spread deposits to time deposits with narrower net spreads, partially offset by the widening net spreads on money market accounts. In 2007, total assets decreased $215 million, or 4%, including decreases of $208 million, or 6%, in average residential mortgage loans and $9 million, or 1%, in 34 Table of Contents average home equity loans. The decrease in average residential mortgage loans reflects Peoples United Financials decision in the fourth quarter of 2006 to sell essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. The increase in non interest expense in 2007 reflects increases in allocated expenses primarily due to the costs associated with infrastructure upgrades relating to deposit gathering activities. Wealth Management consists of private banking, trust services, brokerage, financial advisory services, investment management services and life insurance provided by Peoples Securities and Chittenden Securities, and other insurance services provided through R.C. Knox and Chittenden Insurance Group. Years ended December 31 (in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Net interest income (loss) $ 4.4 $ (0.9 ) $ (0.5 ) Provision for loan losses 0.1 Total non interest income 86.5 56.3 55.1 Total non interest expense 85.8 49.1 49.4 Income before income tax expense 5.0 6.3 5.2 Income tax expense 1.6 2.1 1.8 Income from continuing operations $ 3.4 $ 4.2 $ 3.4 Total average assets $ 294.3 $ 79.7 $ 81.0 Total average liabilities 125.9 55.7 63.7 Wealth Management income from continuing operations decreased $0.8 million compared to 2007. The increase in net interest income in 2008 is primarily due to the private banking business acquired in connection with the Chittenden acquisition. Total non interest income in 2008 includes $33.5 million of insurance revenue and $33.3 million of investment management fees. The increase in total non interest expense compared to 2007 reflects increases of $33.4 million in direct and allocated support costs primarily due to the Chittenden acquisition, and $4.2 million in amortization expense, reflecting additional amortization of the intangible assets resulting from the Chittenden acquisition. The increases in total average assets and total average liabilities compared to 2007 are primarily due to the Chittenden acquisition. Assets under custody and management, which are not reported as assets of Peoples United Financial, totaled $10 billion at December 31, 2008. Wealth Management income from continuing operations increased $0.8 million in 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in total non interest income reflects increases in investment management fees and brokerage commissions, partially offset by a decrease in insurance revenue. Treasury encompasses the securities portfolio, short term investments, wholesale funding activities, such as borrowings, and the funding center, which includes the impact of derivative financial instruments used for risk management purposes. The income or loss for the funding center represents the interest rate risk component of Peoples United Financials net interest income as calculated by its FTP model in deriving each business segments net interest income. Under this process, a money desk (the funding center) buys funds from liability generating business lines (such as consumer deposits) and sells funds to asset generating business lines (such as commercial lending). The price at which funds are bought and sold on any given day is set by Peoples United Financials treasury group and is based on the wholesale cost to Peoples United Financial of assets and liabilities with similar maturities. Liability generating businesses sell newly originated liabilities to the money desk and recognize a funding credit, while asset generating businesses buy funding for newly originated assets from the money desk and recognize a funding charge. Once funding for an asset is purchased from or a liability is sold to the money desk, the price that is set by the treasury group will remain with that asset or liability until it matures or reprices, which effectively transfers responsibility for managing interest rate risk to the treasury group. 35 Table of Contents Years ended December 31 (in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Net interest loss $ (166.9 ) $ (29.8 ) $ (26.2 ) Total non interest income 10.4 10.6 (18.2 ) Total non interest expense (0.7 ) (0.3 ) 0.5 Loss before income tax benefit (155.8 ) (18.9 ) (44.9 ) Income tax benefit (55.9 ) (10.3 ) (18.9 ) Loss from continuing operations $ (99.9 ) $ (8.6 ) $ (26.0 ) Total average assets $ 3,022.4 $ 2,890.6 $ 1,066.4 Total average liabilities 181.7 74.4 196.2 Treasurys loss from continuing operations in 2008 compared to 2007 reflects a $137.1 million increase in net interest loss. The increase in net interest loss in 2008 primarily reflects a $127.1 million increase in the funding centers net spread loss, which is due to the acquisition of Chittenden, the 400 basis points decline in the targeted federal funds rate from December 2007 to December 2008, and the asset sensitive position of Peoples United Financials balance sheet. The reduction in Treasurys loss from continuing operations in 2007 compared to 2006 reflects $27.4 million of net security losses (included in total non interest income) in 2006, partially offset by a $3.6 million increase in net interest loss. The increase in net interest loss in 2007 reflects an increase of $7.1 million in Treasurys net spread loss, partially offset by a $3.5 million decline in the funding centers net spread loss. The increase in Treasurys net spread loss reflects a $735 million decline in average securities and virtually no net spread benefit from the increase in average short term investments. The benefit from the increase in average short term investments is included in Other as interest income from excess capital. The improvement in the funding centers net spread loss reflects the rising interest rate environment prevalent for most of 2007 and the asset sensitive position of Peoples United Financials balance sheet. Total average assets increased $1.8 billion from 2006. Average short term investments increased $2.5 billion, reflecting the investment of net proceeds from the second step conversion, while average securities declined $735 million resulting from the sale of $1.1 billion of securities in 2006. Other includes the residual financial impact from the allocation of revenues and expenses and certain revenues and expenses not attributable to a particular segment, and the FTP impact from excess capital. This category also includes: certain nonrecurring items, including $6.9 million of security gains related to the Visa IPO and a $1.4 million gain on sale of two branches (included in total non interest income for the year ended December 31, 2008), $51.3 million of merger related expenses and other one time charges, and a $0.8 million loss on sale of certain non branch properties (included in total non interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2008), $5.4 million of security gains related to the sale of Peoples United Financials entire holdings of MasterCard Incorporated Class B Common Stock (included in total non interest income for the year ended December 31, 2007) and the $60.0 million contribution to The Peoples United Community Foundation (included in total non interest expense for the year December 31, 2007); income from discontinued operations; and certain income tax benefits. 36 Table of Contents Years ended December 31 (in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Net interest income $ 134.6 $ 137.0 $ 21.7 Provision for loan losses 1.9 (5.9 ) (10.1 ) Total non interest income 6.6 6.7 2.3 Total non interest expense 77.6 67.1 6.9 Income before income tax expense 61.7 82.5 27.2 Income tax expense 21.6 29.5 7.7 Income from continuing operations 40.1 53.0 19.5 Income from discontinued operations, net of tax 1.5 2.3 Net income $ 40.1 $ 54.5 $ 21.8 Total average assets $ 1,265.6 $ 651.3 $ 637.9 Total average liabilities 358.5 67.6 50.3 The increase in net interest income in 2007 compared to 2006 reflects the FTP credit resulting from the significant increase in excess capital from the second step conversion. Included in Other are assets such as cash, premises and equipment, and other assets and other liabilities. Net Interest Income Net interest income and net interest margin are affected by many factors, including changes in average balances; interest rate fluctuations and the slope of the yield curve; sales of loans and securities; residential mortgage loan and mortgage backed security prepayment rates; product pricing; competitive forces; the relative mix, repricing characteristics and maturity of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities; non interest bearing sources of funds; hedging activities; and asset quality. Net Interest Margin Years ended December 31 (percent) 37 Table of Contents Net Interest Income FTE Years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) In response to the significant disruptions in the capital markets brought about by the sub prime mortgage crisis and its after effects, turmoil in the financial sector, and the contracting U.S. economy, the Federal Reserve Board lowered the targeted federal funds rate ten times since September 2007, and established a target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to 0.25 percent as of December 16, 2008. Given the asset sensitive position of Peoples United Financials balance sheet, including the temporary investment of a portion of the companys significant excess capital position in low yielding short term investments, the net interest margin may experience further compression in 2009. 2008 Compared to 2007 The net interest margin declined 50 basis points to 3.62% compared to 2007. The lower net interest margin reflects the dramatic actions taken by the Federal Reserve Board and the companys asset sensitive balance sheet, including its significant excess capital position, a portion of which continues to be invested in low yielding short term investments. Net interest income (FTE basis) increased $153.7 million, reflecting a $214.1 million increase in total interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $60.4 million increase in total interest expense. Average earning assets totaled $17.7 billion in 2008, a $5.9 billion increase from 2007. Average loans increased $5.3 billion and average securities increased $1.0 billion, primarily as a result of the Chittenden acquisition, while average short term investments and securities resale agreements decreased $0.4 billion. As a result, average loans, average securities and average short term investments comprised 82%, 6% and 12%, respectively, of average earning assets in 2008 compared to 77%, 1% and 22%, respectively, in 2007. The yield earned on the total loan portfolio was 5.80% and the yield earned on securities and short term investments was 2.61%, compared to 6.27% and 5.07%, respectively, in 2007. Excluding adjustable rate residential mortgage loans, which are mostly of the hybrid variety, approximately 42% of the loan portfolio had floating interest rates at December 31, 2008 compared to approximately 31% at the end of 2007. The total average commercial banking loan portfolio increased $4.6 billion, reflecting increases of $3.0 billion in commercial real estate loans, $1.5 billion in commercial loans and $0.1 billion in equipment financing loans. Average residential mortgage loans decreased $30 million compared to 2007. Excluding the effect of residential mortgage loans acquired in the Chittenden acquisition, average residential mortgage loans would have decreased $803 million, reflecting Peoples United Financials decision in the fourth quarter of 2006 to begin selling essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. As a result, residential mortgage loan 38 Table of Contents balances are expected to continue to decline in the future until Peoples United Financial resumes adding such loans to its portfolio to an extent that more than offsets repayments. Average consumer loans increased $790 million, including a $541 million increase in average home equity loans, primarily as a result of the Chittenden acquisition. Average funding liabilities totaled $14.8 billion in 2008, a $5.8 billion increase compared to 2007. Average deposits increased $5.5 billion primarily due to the deposits acquired in the Chittenden acquisition. Average non interest bearing deposits increased $1.0 billion and average interest bearing deposits increased $4.5 billion. Average deposits comprised 98% of average funding liabilities in 2008 compared to 99% in the year ago period. During the second quarter of 2008, $234 million of trust money market deposits were placed with an outside investment manager, thereby removing certain average earning assets and average funding liabilities that were generating only marginal net interest income while at the same time adding fee income. The 55 basis point decrease to 1.90% from 2.45% in the rate paid on average funding liabilities in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily reflects the decrease in market interest rates and the shift in deposit mix. The rates paid on average deposits decreased 58 basis points in 2008, reflecting decreases of 98 basis points in time deposits and 22 basis points in savings and money market deposits. Average savings and money market deposits and average time deposits comprised 43% and 35%, respectively, of average deposits in 2008 compared to 36% and 41%, respectively, in 2007. The increases in average borrowings and average subordinated notes in 2008 are a result of the Chittenden acquisition. 2007 Compared to 2006 Net interest income increased $105 million, or 27%, and the net interest margin improved 25 basis points to 4.12% for 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in net interest income reflects a $125 million increase in total interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $20 million increase in total interest expense. The increase in net interest margin reflects the investment of $3.3 billion in net proceeds from the second step conversion in short term investments, as well as the benefits from the balance sheet restructuring activities completed during 2006. Average earning assets totaled $11.8 billion in 2007, a $1.9 billion, or 20%, increase from 2006, while the asset mix continued to shift. Average short term investments increased $2.5 billion, reflecting the investment of $3.3 billion in net proceeds from the second step conversion in April 2007; average loans increased $120 million, or 1%; and average securities declined $735 million, reflecting the sale of $1.1 billion of debt securities in 2006. As a result, average loans, average securities and average short term investments comprised 77%, 1% and 22%, respectively, of average earning assets in 2007 compared to 91%, 8% and 1%, respectively, in 2006. The yield earned on the total loan portfolio was 6.27% in 2007 while the yield earned on securities was 5.62%, compared to 6.10% and 3.74%, respectively, in 2006. Excluding adjustable rate residential mortgage loans, which are mostly of the hybrid variety, approximately 31% of the loan portfolio had floating interest rates at December 31, 2007 compared to approximately 29% at the end of 2006. Growth in loans reflects an increase of $348 million, or 9%, in average commercial banking loans, partially offset by decreases of $209 million, or 6%, in average residential mortgage loans and $19 million, or 2%, in average consumer loans for 2007 compared to 2006. The growth in average commercial banking loans in 2007 compared to 2006 reflects increases of $210 million, or 30%, in average PCLC loans, $96 million, or 7%, in average commercial loans and $42 million, or 2%, in average commercial real estate loans. Included in average commercial loans and average commercial real estate loans were increases of $64 million, or 20%, and $78 million, or 38%, in the respective national credits portfolios. 39 Table of Contents The decrease in average residential mortgage loans in 2007 compared to 2006 reflects Peoples United Financials decision in the fourth quarter of 2006 to sell essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. As a result, residential mortgage loan balances are expected to continue to decline in the future until Peoples United Financial resumes adding such loans to its portfolio to an extent that more than offsets repayments. The decrease in average consumer loans primarily reflects a $9 million, or 1%, decline in average home equity loans following a nationwide pattern. The overall 9 basis point improvement in the yield on average earning assets in 2007 primarily reflects the investment of the net proceeds from the second step conversion discussed above, increases in market interest rates and the ongoing shift in asset mix, including the impact of the security sales. Average funding liabilities totaled $9.0 billion in 2007, down $287 million or 3% compared with 2006. Average deposits decreased $45 million, or 1%, to $8.9 billion and comprised 99% of average funding liabilities, compared to 97% in 2006. Average non interest bearing deposits decreased $57 million, or 3%, and average interest bearing deposits increased $12 million, or less than 1%, reflective of Peoples United Financials strategy of funding loan growth with proceeds from maturities, sales and repayments of securities rather than deposits. The 30 basis point increase to 2.45% from 2.15% in the rate paid on average funding liabilities in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily reflects increases in market interest rates prevalent in most of 2007 and the ongoing shift in deposit mix. The rates paid on average deposits increased 38 basis points in 2007, reflecting increases of 65 basis points in time deposits and 6 basis points in savings and money market deposits in response to rising market interest rates prevalent in most of 2007. The change in the mix of average interest bearing deposits reflects a $302 million, or 9%, increase in higher rate time deposits, partially offset by a $290 million, or 8%, decline in savings and money market deposits, reflecting customers preferences for deposit products with higher interest rates. Average time deposits comprised 41% of average deposits in 2007 compared to 37% in 2006. Average borrowings decreased $202 million, or 98%, and average subordinated notes decreased $40 million, or 38%, in 2007 compared to 2006. Average Balance Sheet, Interest and Yield/Rate Analysis The table on the following page presents average balance sheets, interest income, interest expense and the corresponding average yields earned and rates paid for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. The average balances are principally daily averages and, for loans, include both performing and non performing balances. Interest income on loans includes the effect of deferred loan fees and costs accounted for as yield adjustments, but does not include interest on loans for which Peoples United Financial has ceased to accrue interest. Premium amortization and discount accretion (including amounts attributable to purchase accounting adjustments) are also included in the respective interest income and interest expense amounts. The impact of Peoples United Financials use of derivative instruments in managing interest rate risk is also reflected in the table, classified according to the instrument hedged and the related risk management objective. 40 Table of Contents Average Balance Sheet, Interest and Yield/Rate Analysis 2008 2007 2006 Years ended December 31(dollars in millions) AverageBalance Interest Yield/Rate AverageBalance Interest Yield/Rate AverageBalance Interest Yield/Rate Earning assets: Short term investments $ 1,946.7 $ 46.9 2.41 % $ 1,709.4 $ 86.7 5.07 % $ 106.6 $ 5.3 4.97 % Securities purchased under agreements to resell 310.2 7.5 2.43 959.1 48.3 5.03 16.6 0.8 4.98 Securities (1) 1,009.1 30.8 3.05 69.2 3.9 5.62 803.8 30.0 3.74 Loans: Commercial real estate 4,820.8 305.3 6.33 1,807.3 127.7 7.07 1,765.1 126.0 7.14 Commercial 4,011.1 229.8 5.73 2,441.5 167.6 6.86 2,135.7 146.5 6.86 Residential mortgage 3,519.9 189.9 5.40 3,550.3 183.9 5.18 3,758.8 185.2 4.93 Consumer 2,058.4 110.9 5.39 1,268.9 88.9 7.01 1,288.3 88.3 6.85 Total loans 14,410.2 835.9 5.80 9,068.0 568.1 6.27 8,947.9 546.0 6.10 Total earning assets 17,676.2 $ 921.1 5.21 % 11,805.7 $ 707.0 5.99 % 9,874.9 $ 582.1 5.90 % Other assets 2,696.8 945.6 908.2 Total assets $ 20,373.0 $ 12,751.3 $ 10,783.1 Funding liabilities: Deposits: Non interest bearing deposits $ 3,137.9 $ % $ 2,111.4 $ % $ 2,168.6 $ % Savings, interest bearing checking and money market 6,203.9 78.5 1.27 3,186.3 47.5 1.49 3,476.8 49.6 1.43 Time 5,125.0 183.6 3.58 3,639.0 166.1 4.56 3,336.7 130.5 3.91 Total deposits 14,466.8 262.1 1.81 8,936.7 213.6 2.39 8,982.1 180.1 2.01 Borrowings: FHLB advances 16.2 0.8 5.16 0.1 5.04 47.2 2.4 5.15 Repurchase agreements 123.0 2.1 1.72 Federal funds purchased/Other 19.1 0.6 3.01 3.3 0.2 5.23 158.2 7.6 4.78 Total borrowings 158.3 3.5 2.23 3.4 0.2 5.23 205.4 10.0 4.87 Subordinated notes 181.4 15.2 8.34 65.3 6.6 10.15 105.0 9.6 9.10 Total funding liabilities 14,806.5 $ 280.8 1.90 % 9,005.4 $ 220.4 2.45 % 9,292.5 $ 199.7 2.15 % Other liabilities 353.9 168.9 169.0 Toal liabilities 15,160.4 9,174.3 9,461.5 Stockholders equity 5,212.6 3,577.0 1,321.6 Total liabilities and stockholders equity $ 20,373.0 $ 12,751.3 $ 10,783.1 Net interest income/spread (2) $ 640.3 3.31 % $ 486.6 3.54 % $ 382.4 3.75 % Net interest margin 3.62 % 4.12 % 3.87 % (1) Average balances and yields for securities available for sale are based on amortized cost.

For each category of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, information is provided relating to: changes in volume (changes in average balances multiplied by the prior years average interest rate); changes in rates (changes in average interest rates multiplied by the prior years average balance); and the total change. Changes attributable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately. 2008 Compared to 2007Increase (Decrease) 2007 Compared to 2006Increase (Decrease) (in millions) Volume Rate Total Volume Rate Total Interest and dividend income: Short term investments $ 10.7 $ (50.5 ) $ (39.8 ) $ 81.3 $ 0.1 $ 81.4 Securities purchased under agreements to resell (23.1 ) (17.7 ) (40.8 ) 47.4 0.1 47.5 Securities 29.5 (2.6 ) 26.9 (36.4 ) 10.3 (26.1 ) Loans: Commercial real estate 192.1 (14.5 ) 177.6 3.0 (1.3 ) 1.7 Commercial 93.6 (31.4 ) 62.2 21.0 0.1 21.1 Residential mortgage (1.6 ) 7.6 6.0 (10.5 ) 9.2 (1.3 ) Consumer 46.0 (24.0 ) 22.0 (1.3 ) 1.9 0.6 Total loans 330.1 (62.3 ) 267.8 12.2 9.9 22.1 Total change in interest and dividend income 347.2 (133.1 ) 214.1 104.5 20.4 124.9 Interest expense: Deposits: Savings, interest bearing checking andmoney market 39.1 (8.1 ) 31.0 (4.3 ) 2.2 (2.1 ) Time 58.3 (40.8 ) 17.5 12.5 23.1 35.6 Total deposits 97.4 (48.9 ) 48.5 8.2 25.3 33.5 Borrowings: FHLB advances 0.8 0.8 (2.4 ) (2.4 ) Repurchase agreements 2.1 2.1 Federal funds purchased/Other 0.5 (0.1 ) 0.4 (8.0 ) 0.6 (7.4 ) Total borrowings 3.4 (0.1 ) 3.3 (10.4 ) 0.6 (9.8 ) Subordinated notes 9.9 (1.3 ) 8.6 (3.9 ) 0.9 (3.0 ) Total change in interest expense 110.7 (50.3 ) 60.4 (6.1 ) 26.8 20.7 Change in net interest income $ 236.5 $ (82.8 ) $ 153.7 $ 110.6 $ (6.4 ) $ 104.2 42 Table of Contents The following table provides the weighted average yields earned and rates paid for each major category of earning assets and funding liabilities as of December 31, 2008.

Peoples United Financial has focused on enhancing these revenue streams by leveraging its commercial banking relationships, growing existing fee based revenue generating businesses, and strengthening its retail delivery network and products. Total non interest income increased $118.2 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to the effect of the Chittenden acquisition, including increases of $33.7 million in total wealth management income, $34.6 million in bank service charges, and $27.6 million in merchant services (payment processing) income. 43 Table of Contents Securities gains in 2008 include a $6.9 million gain related to the Visa, Inc. IPO and gains of $1.5 million resulting from the sale of securities acquired in the Chittenden acquisition as a result of changes in market interest rates subsequent to January 1, 2008. The proceeds from these securities were subsequently reinvested in securities with shorter durations. In the first quarter of 2008, Peoples United Financial recorded a cash gain of $5.6 million (included in equity security gains) resulting from the mandatory redemption of a portion of its Class B Visa, Inc. shares as part of Visas IPO. Peoples United Financial obtained its ownership in Visa shares as a result of its acquisition of Chittenden, which was a Visa member. In addition, Peoples United Financial recorded a gain of $1.3 million (also included in equity security gains) representing its proportionate share of the litigation reserve escrow account established by Visa in conjunction with its IPO. Peoples United Financial continues to own 206,671 Visa Class B shares at December 31, 2008. Each Class B share was convertible at that date into 0.62957 Class A shares, which are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The conversion ratio will change if additional reserves are required to be established by Visa in order to settle outstanding litigation. The Class B shares carry a three year lock up provision and may not be converted or redeemed during that period. If, as of December 31, 2008, those shares could have been converted into Class A shares, they would have had a fair value of approximately $6.8 million. The Class B shares have a zero carrying amount for financial statement purposes and there is no unrealized gain recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. Net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans increased $3.5 million, or 117%, compared to 2007, reflecting an increase in residential mortgage originations and corresponding sales in 2008 primarily due to the Chittenden acquisition. BOLI income totaled $8.3 million ($12.8 million on a taxable equivalent basis), compared to $10.5 million ($16.2 million on a taxable equivalent basis) in 2007. The $2.2 million, or 21%, decrease primarily reflects the lower interest rate environment in 2008, and death benefits received totaling $0.5 million in 2008 compared to $1.1 million in 2007. The increase in other non interest income compared to 2007 reflects the effect of the Chittenden acquisition, including $3.5 million in payroll services income and $1.6 million mortgage servicing income, as well as a $2.8 million increase in rental income resulting from the higher level of equipment leased to PCLC customers and higher commercial loan fees. In addition, other non interest income in 2008 includes gains totaling $4.0 million recorded in connection with the sale of (i) mortgage servicing rights and (ii) two branches located in northern New England. Total non interest income increased $38.0 million, or 26%, in 2007 compared to 2006, reflecting net security gains of $5.5 million in 2007 and net security losses of $27.2 million in 2006 (as part of balance sheet restructuring activities). Wealth management income increased $1.9 million, or 4%, compared to 2006, reflecting increases in mutual fund and annuity commissions. Bank service charges decreased $0.8 million in 2007, or 1%, compared to 2006, reflecting changes in consumer behavior related to overdrafts and more customers qualifying for free ATM network transactions and free checking. Net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans increased $1.0 million, or 50%, in 2007, reflecting Peoples United Financials decision in the fourth quarter of 2006 to sell essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgages in the current interest rate environment. Residential mortgage sales volume increased 70% compared to 2006. 44 Table of Contents BOLI income totaled $10.5 million in 2007 ($16.1 million on a taxable equivalent basis), compared to $9.1 million ($13.7 million on a taxable equivalent basis) in 2006. The $1.4 million, or 15%, increase primarily reflects death benefits of $1.1 million received in 2007. The increase in other non interest income compared to 2006 reflects a $3.8 million increase in rental income resulting from the higher level of equipment leased to PCLC customers. Other non interest income in 2006 included a $0.7 million net gain from the sale of a large corporate insurance account by RC Knox, a $0.7 million gain from the redemption of common stock received in conjunction with the MasterCard Incorporated initial public offering given Peoples United Financials debit card business and $0.6 million of interest related to the completion of a federal tax audit.

Merger related expenses include asset impairment charges of $19.3 million, costs relating to severance and branch closings of $10.5 million and other accrued liabilities of $6.7 million. During the process of the companys business integration of the Chittenden banks, and as a part of its strategic planning for possible future acquisitions, Peoples United Financial undertook a comprehensive review of its options relating to technology strategy. This re assessment resulted in a determination by management that in order to achieve its acquisition integration goals, the company should discontinue its Connecticut core deposit system replacement project. As a result of this determination, Peoples United Financial recorded the aforementioned asset impairment charge, principally representing a write off of the capitalized costs associated with the replacement project. 45 Table of Contents The efficiency ratio increased to 66.3% in 2008 compared to 56.1% in 2007, reflecting the decline in interest rates that negatively impacted net interest income. The increase in compensation and benefits compared to 2007 primarily reflects the additional Chittenden employees, as well as normal merit increases, higher benefits related costs and $12.0 million of expense related to the 2007 Recognition and Retention Plan and the 2007 Stock Option Plan. Pension expense is expected to increase by approximately $8.0 million in 2009 as a result of recent market events and their impact on pension related actuarial assumptions (see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Increases in occupancy and equipment, professional and outside services, and stationery, printing and postage compared to 2007 primarily reflect the effect of the Chittenden acquisition. Merchant services expense relates to the merchant payment processing operation acquired in connection with the Chittenden acquisition. The increase in amortization of other acquisition related intangibles in 2008 reflects additional amortization of the intangible assets resulting from the Chittenden acquisition. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of the acquisition. Included in other non interest expense in 2008 are (i) one time charges of $11.5 million, including benefit related and other costs associated with the death of Peoples United Financials former President, (ii) a charge of $2.0 million related to the vesting of outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards upon the dissolution of Peoples United Financials Advisory Board, and (iii) a loss of $0.8 million on the sale of a portion of the companys non branch properties located in Bridgeport, Connecticut. On February 27, 2009, the FDIC approved an additional one time special assessment of 20 basis points on deposits, in addition to an increase in regular assessment rates announced previously. As such, FDIC insurance expense is expected to increase significantly in 2009. Total non interest expense in 2007 increased $32.4 million compared to 2006, excluding the $60.0 million contribution to The Peoples United Community Foundation. The improvement in Peoples United Financials efficiency ratio in 2007 compared to 2006 reflects a $112.6 million, or 20%, increase in revenue, partially offset by a $34.2 million, or 10%, increase in operating expenses. The increase in operating revenue reflects the increase in net interest income due to the investment of the net proceeds from the second step conversion. Compensation and benefits increased $12.7 million in 2007 compared to 2006. The increase reflects amortization expense of $6.3 million related to the ESOP that was established in April 2007 and $2.6 million related to grants of restricted stock and stock options in October and December pursuant to the 2007 Recognition and Retention Plan and the 2007 Stock Option Plan, as well as higher compensation expense, reflecting normal merit increases, partially offset by lower pension expenses. In 2007, occupancy and equipment increased $4.9 million compared to the 2006, primarily reflecting higher rent related expense due to rate increases and additional branches. Professional and outside service fees increased $4.5 million compared to 2006, reflecting higher costs for information technology related projects. Advertising and promotion increased $1.8 million compared to 2006, primarily due to costs associated with the rebranding of the Bank as a result of Peoples Bank changing its name to Peoples United Bank on June 6, 2007. The increase in other non interest expense compared to 2006 primarily reflects a $2.8 million increase in the amortization of equipment leased to PCLC customers and higher insurance costs and regulatory assessment fees. 46 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations Peoples United Financial continues to generate recoveries from collection efforts on previously charged off credit card accounts that were not included in the sale of the credit card business. Recoveries, net of collection costs, totaled $2.3 million and $4.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Recoveries occurring subsequent to the sale and through December 31, 2007 were included in income from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Effective January 1, 2008, income from discontinued operations is no longer disclosed separately in the Consolidated Statements of Income as the level of recoveries continues to decline due to the aging and diminishing pool of charged off accounts. Income Taxes Income tax expense from continuing operations totaled $68.0 million, $75.5 million and $57.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Income tax benefits of $1.1 million and $2.4 million are included in income tax expense from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2006, respectively. These benefits relate to (i) a non taxable BOLI death benefit recognized in 2008 and (ii) the completion of federal income tax audits in 2008 and 2005. Excluding these benefits from the respective years, Peoples United Financials effective income tax rate from continuing operations would have been 33.3%, 33.6% and 33.5% for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Peoples United Financials effective income tax rate is expected to increase slightly in 2009 due to a higher level of non deductible expenses and an increase in state income tax liabilities associated with the companys expanded geographic franchise following the Chittenden acquisition. Income tax expense for all three years reflects the state tax benefit resulting from the formation of Peoples Mortgage Investment Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Peoples United Bank. The formation of this subsidiary was a result of Connecticut tax legislation, which became effective on January 1, 1999, that allows for the transfer of mortgage loans to a passive investment subsidiary. The related earnings of the subsidiary, and any dividends it pays to the parent, are not subject to Connecticut income tax. In connection with the acquisition of Chittenden, Peoples United Financial acquired $25 million of limited partnership investments to develop and operate affordable housing units for lower income tenants throughout New England. The cost of these investments is amortized on a straight line basis over the period during which the related federal income tax credits are realized (generally ten years). These credits totaled $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Peoples United Financials management believes that, other than for transitional deployment of excess deposits or excess equity, a large securities portfolio funded with wholesale borrowings provides limited economic value. Peoples United Financial has historically utilized the securities portfolio for earnings generation (in the form of interest and dividend income), liquidity, interest rate risk management, asset diversification and tax planning. Securities available for sale are used as part of Peoples United Financials asset/liability management strategy and may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, factors such as changes in market conditions and interest rates, changes in security prepayment rates, liquidity considerations and regulatory capital requirements. Peoples United Financial invests in debt securities rated in the highest category assigned by a nationally recognized statistical ratings organization. Management has internal guidelines for the credit quality and duration of Peoples United Financials debt securities portfolio and monitors these on a regular basis. The increase in debt securities available for sale in 2008 reflects (i) managements decision to invest in GSE debt securities with maturities ranging from 91 to 180 days as an alternative to overnight federal funds sold, and (ii) the purchase of U.S. agency (GNMA) and GSE mortgage backed securities late in the fourth quarter of 2008 to provide the optimal balance of credit risk (none for GNMA securities), yield and duration. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Peoples United Financial purchased an additional $360 million of U.S. agency (GNMA) and GSE mortgage backed securities. 48 Table of Contents At December 31, 2008, Peoples United Financials securities portfolio totaled $1.9 billion, or 9% of total assets, and had no wholesale borrowings, which represent positions well below industry averages. In 2006, Peoples United Financial sold approximately $1.1 billion of debt securities as part of the restructuring of its balance sheet. Realized losses from these sales of $27.4 million are included in net security losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. At December 31, 2008, the fair value exceeded the book value of the securities available for sale portfolio by $5.1 million, while at December 31, 2007 and 2006, the book value and the fair value of the securities available for sale portfolio were approximately equivalent. All unrealized gains and those unrealized losses representing temporary declines in value are recorded in stockholders equity, net of income taxes. As a result, management anticipates continued fluctuations in stockholders equity due to changes in the fair value of these securities, albeit on a relatively small scale due to the size and short duration of the portfolio. The duration of the debt securities portfolio was approximately 0.4 years at December 31, 2008, compared to 0.02 years at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2008, short term investments included $110 million of GSE debt securities with maturities of 90 days or less. Given the short term maturities of these securities, they are held to maturity and carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Lending Activities Peoples United Financial conducts its lending businesses through its Retail Banking and Small Business, Commercial Banking, and Wealth Management business segments. Peoples United Financials lending activities consist of originating loans secured by residential and commercial properties, and extending secured and unsecured loans to consumer and commercial customers. Total loans increased $5.6 billion in 2008 compared to 2007, after a decrease of 5% in 2007 and an increase of 9% in 2006. The increase in 2008 is primarily due to $5.7 billion in loans acquired in the Chittenden acquisition. The $687 million decrease in residential mortgage loans in 2007 reflects Peoples United Banks decision in the fourth quarter of 2006 to sell essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans due to the low spreads on such loans in the current interest rate environment. The following table summarizes the loan portfolio. Amounts represent gross loans before deducting the allowance for loan losses.

These include conventional fixed rate loans, jumbo fixed rate loans (loans with principal balances greater than established Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae limits), adjustable rate loans, sometimes referred to as ARM loans, interest only loans (loans where payments made by the borrower consist of only interest for a set period of time, before the payments change to principal and interest), as well as Federal Housing Authority insured loans and various state housing finance authority loans. Peoples United Financial originates these loans through its network of branches and calling officers, as well as in the wholesale market, which accounted for approximately 5%, 21% and 66% of Peoples United Financials mortgage loan originations for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decline in wholesale originations reflects Peoples United Financials decision in April 2008 to discontinue using the wholesale market as a source for originating residential mortgage loans. 50 Table of Contents At December 31, 2008 and 2007, 69% and 91%, respectively, of the residential mortgage loan portfolio was secured by properties located in Connecticut. As a result of Peoples United Financials acquisition of Chittenden, approximately 20% of the residential mortgage loan portfolio at December 31, 2008 was secured by properties located in Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts. Included in residential mortgage loans are construction loans totaling $97 million and $96 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In 2008, Peoples United Financials residential mortgage originations totaled $692 million, compared to $431 million in 2007 and $1.1 billion in 2006. The mix and volume of residential mortgage loan originations vary in response to changes in market interest rates and customer preferences. Adjustable rate loans accounted for 22% of total residential mortgage originations in 2008, compared to 27% and 77% for 2007 and 2006, respectively. At December 31, 2008, the residential mortgage loan portfolio included $1.4 billion of interest only loans of which $135 million are stated income loans, compared to $1.8 billion and $158 million respectively, at December 31, 2007. Peoples United Financials underwriting practices and credit review standards for such loans are generally consistent with those applied to other types of residential mortgage loan products. Peoples United Financial began originating interest only residential mortgage loans in March 2003. The underwriting guidelines and requirements are more restrictive for interest only loans than for amortizing adjustable rate mortgages. More specifically, properties must be single family and owner occupied primary residences, loan to value ratios are lower, higher credit scores are required, post closing reserve requirements are greater, and there are limits on cash out refinances as compared to amortizing adjustable rate mortgages. Amortization of an interest only loan begins after the initial interest rate change (e.g. after 5 years for a 5/1 adjustable rate mortgage). Stated income loans represent a form of reduced documentation loan that requires a potential borrower to complete a standard mortgage application with full verification of the borrowers asset information as contained in the loan application, but no verification of the provided income information. As with interest only loans, underwriting guidelines for stated income loans require properties to be single family and owner occupied primary residences with lower loan to value ratios and higher credit scores. In addition, stated income loans require the receipt of an appraisal for the real estate used as collateral and a credit report on the prospective borrower. Peoples United Financials loan loss experience within the residential mortgage portfolio increased in 2008 and continues to be primarily attributable to a small number of loans. Adjustable rate residential mortgage loans at December 31, 2008 decreased $267 million compared to year end 2007, while fixed rate mortgage loans increased $198 million. Excluding the effect of residential mortgage loans acquired in the Chittenden acquisition, residential mortgage loans would have decreased $813 million since December 31, 2007, reflecting Peoples United Financials decision in the fourth quarter of 2006 to begin selling essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. Total adjustable rate residential mortgage loans decreased $682 million in 2007 compared to year end 2006, while fixed rate mortgage loans decreased $5 million. Historically, Peoples United Financial has held virtually all of the adjustable rate residential mortgage loans that it originates on its balance sheet and has sold virtually all of the fixed rate residential mortgage loans that it originates into the secondary market. In 2006, Peoples United Financial completed a reassessment of its pricing with respect to adjustable rate residential mortgage loans in light of the prevailing interest rate environment at that time. As a result, Peoples United Financial made the decision in the fourth quarter of 2006 to sell essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. Peoples United Financial continues to actively offer residential mortgage loans of all types through its extensive distribution system. 51 Table of Contents Residential mortgage loan balances are expected to continue to decline in the future until Peoples United Financial resumes adding such loans to its portfolio to an extent that more than offsets repayments. The continued performance of the residential mortgage loan portfolio in 2009 may be adversely impacted by the level and direction of interest rates, consumer preferences and the regional economy. Residential Mortgage Originations Years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) Residential Mortgage Originations by Product Year ended December 31, 2008 (percent) Consumer Lending Peoples United Financial offers home equity credit lines and second mortgage loans, and to a lesser extent, other forms of installment and revolving credit loans. Future growth of Peoples United Financials consumer loan portfolio is highly dependent upon economic conditions, the interest rate environment and competitors strategies, as well as the success of Peoples United Financials marketing programs and information based strategies. As of December 31 (in millions) 2008 2007 Home equity credit lines $ 1,619.8 $ 938.5 Second mortgages 325.7 285.9 Indirect auto 224.8 Other loans 57.1 26.4 Total consumer $ 2,227.4 $ 1,250.8 The increase in consumer loans in 2008 reflects the Chittenden acquisition, as well as organic growth of $153 million. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, approximately 62% and 99%, respectively, of the consumer loan portfolio was to customers located in Connecticut. At December 31, 2008 approximately 20% of the consumer loan portfolio represents loans to customers located in Vermont. The indirect auto portfolio was acquired in connection with the Chittenden acquisition. 52 Table of Contents Commercial Banking The Commercial Banking lending businesses include commercial real estate, commercial and industrial lending, and equipment financing by PCLC. Shared national credits are included in the commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending portfolios. In January 2008, Peoples United Financial announced its decision to unwind its shared national credits portfolio in an orderly manner over the next two to three years.

Included in commercial real estate loans are shared national credits totaling $290 million and $284 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Peoples United Financials highest loan concentration in the commercial real estate loan portfolio was in the retail sector, which represented 24% of this loan portfolio at both December 31, 2008 and 2007. Commercial Real Estate Portfolio As of December 31 (dollars in millions) At December 31, 2008, approximately 29% of Peoples United Financials commercial real estate portfolio was secured by properties located in Connecticut, compared to approximately 65% at December 31, 2007. In addition, approximately 47% of the commercial real estate portfolio was secured by properties located in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont at December 31, 2008. No other state exposure was greater than 10%. Included in the commercial real estate portfolio are construction loans totaling $902 million and $607 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 53 Table of Contents Commercial real estate is dependent on the successful operation of the related income producing real estate. Accordingly, the income streams generated by this portfolio can be impacted by changes in the real estate market and, to a large extent, New Englands economy. In 2008, the commercial real estate portfolio increased $3.1 billion compared to 2007, and increased $99 million in 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in the commercial real estate portfolio in 2008 reflects the Chittenden acquisition, as well as organic growth of $285 million, or 15%, in the commercial real estate loan portfolio. Peoples United Financial continues to focus on maintaining strong asset quality standards in a competitive market generally characterized by aggressive pricing and less attractive underwriting terms. The growth and performance of this portfolio is largely dependent on the economic environment and may be adversely impacted if the economy continues to slow in 2009.

Commercial products are generally packaged together to create a financing solution specifically tailored to the needs of the customer. Taking a total relationship focused approach with commercial customers to meet their financing needs has resulted in substantial growth in non interest bearing deposits over time, as well as in opportunities to provide other banking services to principals and employees of these commercial customers. 54 Table of Contents The borrowers ability to repay a commercial loan is closely tied to the ongoing profitability and cash flow of the borrowers business. Consequently, a commercial loan tends to be more directly impacted by changes in economic cycles that affect businesses generally and the borrowers business specifically. The availability of adequate collateral is a factor in commercial loan decisions, and loans are generally collateralized and or guaranteed by third parties. In 2008, the commercial and industrial lending portfolio increased $1.4 billion compared to 2007, and increased $125 million in 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in the commercial and industrial lending portfolio in 2008 reflects the Chittenden acquisition, as well as organic growth of $102 million, or 6%, in the commercial and industrial lending portfolio. Included in commercial lending are shared national credits totaling $374 million and $454 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. At December 31, 2008, approximately 39% of the commercial loan portfolio consisted of loans to Connecticut based businesses, compared to approximately 66% at December 31, 2007. Commercial loan exposure in the states of Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont totaled 37% at December 31, 2008. No other state exposure was greater than 6%. While Peoples United Financial continues to focus on asset quality, the performance of the commercial lending portfolio may be adversely impacted if the economy continues to slow in 2009. Commercial and Industrial Lending Diversification As of December 31, 2008 (percent) Commercial and Industrial Lending Portfolio As of December 31 (dollars in millions) 55 Table of Contents Shared National Credits At December 31, 2008, the shared national credits loan portfolio totaled $664 million compared to $738 million at December 31, 2007, and represented 7% and 16% of the total Commercial Banking loan portfolio at the respective dates. As discussed above, included in the shared national credits portfolio at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were commercial loans totaling $374 million and $454 million, respectively, and commercial real estate loans totaling $290 million and $284 million, respectively. In January 2008, Peoples United Financial announced its decision to unwind its shared national credits portfolio in an orderly manner over the next two to three years. At December 31, 2008, the shared national credits loan portfolio consisted only of loans purchased from other financial institutions. At December 31, 2008, approximately $26 million, or 4%, of the shared national credits loan portfolio consisted of borrowers who are headquartered in Connecticut, while approximately $264 million, or 40%, consisted of borrowers located in Washington, California and New York. No other state exposure was greater than 9%.

PCLC will buy or sell portions of financing transactions in the secondary market to manage the concentration risk of the overall portfolio. At December 31, 2008, approximately 38% of the portfolio consisted of loans to customers located in California, Texas, Florida and Illinois. No other state exposure was greater than 5%. The PCLC portfolio grew $245 million, or 25%, in 2008, after increasing $112 million, or 13%, in 2007, reflecting managements decision to grow this portfolio. Operating on a national scale, PCLC represented 13% of the Commercial Banking loan portfolio at December 31, 2008 compared to 22% at year end 2007. While Peoples United Financial continues to focus on asset quality, the performance of the equipment financing portfolio may be adversely impacted if the economy continues to slow in 2009. 56 Table of Contents PCLC Diversification As of December 31, 2008 (percent) PCLC Loan Portfolio As of December 31 (dollars in millions) The following table sets forth the contractual maturity (based on final payment date) and interest rate sensitivity (based on next repricing date) of Peoples United Financials construction loans and commercial loans: As of December 31, 2008 (in millions) One Yearor Less After OneYear ThroughFive Years AfterFive Years Total Contractual maturity: Construction loans: Residential mortgage $ 77.7 $ 13.4 $ 5.6 $ 96.7 Commercial real estate 415.9 310.6 175.8 902.3 Commercial loans 903.0 1,932.1 1,391.3 4,226.4 Total $ 1,396.6 $ 2,256.1 $ 1,572.7 $ 5,225.4 Interest rate sensitivity: Predetermined rates $ 378.2 $ 1,107.1 $ 930.7 $ 2,416.0 Variable rates 1,018.4 1,149.0 642.0 2,809.4 Total $ 1,396.6 $ 2,256.1 $ 1,572.7 $ 5,225.4 57 Table of Contents Asset Quality The past year has been marked by significant volatility in the financial and capital markets initially brought about by the fallout associated with the subprime mortgage market. This disruption led to significant credit and liquidity concerns, which resulted in government intervention within the banking sector and a substantial decline in activity within the secondary mortgage market. All of these issues have been further exacerbated by an accelerated softening of the real estate market and, in more recent months, a worsening recessionary economic environment. These events have, in turn, led to weakness within the commercial sector, prompting the federal government to implement a $787 billion stimulus package in February 2009, with the objective of reviving the U.S. economy. Peoples United Financial does not engage in subprime mortgage lending, which has been the riskiest sector of the residential housing market. Peoples United Financial has virtually no exposure to subprime loans, or to similarly high risk Alt A loans and structured investment vehicles. While Peoples United Financial continues to adhere to prudent underwriting standards, the loan portfolio is geographically diverse and, therefore, is not immune to potential negative consequences arising as a result of general economic weakness and, in particular, a sharp downturn in the housing market on a national scale. Decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for loans. In addition, adverse changes in the economy could have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make scheduled loan payments, which would likely have an adverse impact on earnings. Further, an increase in loan delinquencies may serve to decrease net interest income and adversely impact loan loss experience, resulting in an increased provision and allowance for loan losses. Peoples United Financial actively manages asset quality through its underwriting practices and collection operations. Underwriting practices tend to focus on optimizing the return of a given loan as a result of its risk classification while collection operations focus on minimizing losses once an account becomes delinquent. The allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses charged to income. Losses on loans, including impaired loans, are charged to the allowance for loan losses when all or a portion of a loan is deemed to be uncollectible. Recoveries of loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance for loan losses when realized. Peoples United Financial maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that is deemed adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio, based on a quarterly evaluation of a variety of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to: Peoples United Financials historical loan loss experience and recent trends in that experience; risk ratings assigned by lending personnel to commercial real estate, commercial and PCLC loans, and the results of ongoing reviews of those ratings by Peoples United Financials independent loan review function; an evaluation of delinquent and non performing loans and related collateral values; the probability of loss in view of geographic and industry concentrations and other portfolio risk characteristics; the present financial condition of borrowers; and current economic conditions. While Peoples United Financial seeks to use the best available information to make these evaluations, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions, results of regulatory examinations, further information obtained regarding known problem loans, the identification of additional problem loans and other factors. 58 Table of Contents Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses The following table presents the activity in the allowance for loan losses and ratios: Years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 Beginning allowance for loan losses $ 72.7 $ 74.0 $ 75.0 $ 72.5 $ 70.5 Charge offs: Commercial (5.6 ) (7.0 ) (5.2 ) (0.9 ) (0.6 ) Consumer (3.7 ) (2.7 ) (3.4 ) (4.9 ) (9.7 ) Indirect auto (3.5 ) Commercial real estate (3.4 ) (0.1 ) (3.2 ) PCLC (1.5 ) (1.8 ) (0.6 ) (3.1 ) (1.5 ) Residential mortgage (1.5 ) (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.2 ) Total charge offs (19.2 ) (11.5 ) (9.3 ) (9.1 ) (15.2 ) Recoveries: Commercial 1.3 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.3 Consumer 0.9 1.1 1.6 2.0 2.8 Indirect auto 1.2 Commercial real estate 0.2 0.1 2.5 0.1 0.1 PCLC 0.3 0.1 0.3 0.3 0.5 Residential mortgage 0.4 0.6 0.1 0.2 0.2 Total recoveries 4.3 2.2 4.9 3.0 3.9 Net loan charge offs (14.9 ) (9.3 ) (4.4 ) (6.1 ) (11.3 ) Provision for loan losses 26.2 8.0 3.4 8.6 13.3 Allowance recorded in the Chittenden acquisition 73.5 Ending allowance for loan losses $ 157.5 $ 72.7 $ 74.0 $ 75.0 $ 72.5 Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of: Total loans 1.08 % 0.81 % 0.79 % 0.87 % 0.91 % Non performing loans 186.8 357.8 327.9 352.5 264.6 The provision for loan losses in 2008 totaled $26.2 million, reflecting $14.9 million in net loan charge offs and an $11.3 million increase in the allowance for loan losses, including a $4.5 million increase resulting from the alignment of the former Chittenden allowance for loan losses methodology with that of Peoples United Financial. The provision for loan losses in 2007 totaled $8.0 million, reflecting net loan charge offs of $9.3 million and a $1.3 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses. The increase in net loan charge offs in 2008 is entirely attributable to loans acquired in the Chittenden acquisition. The allowance for loan losses also reflects the allowance of $73.5 million recorded in the Chittenden acquisition with respect to loans not included in the scope of AICPA Statement of Position 03 3, which is discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.08% at December 31, 2008 and 0.81% at December 31, 2007. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average total loans equaled 0.10% in both 2008 and 2007. The very low level of net loan charge offs in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of average loans is unlikely to be sustainable in the future. The provision for loan losses increased $4.6 million in 2007 compared to 2006, reflecting higher net loan charge offs in 2007 and a $1.3 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses in 2007, compared to a $1.0 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses in 2006. Net loan charge offs in 2007 increased $4.9 million compared to 2006. Commercial loan net charge offs in 2007 include a $5.9 million charge off relating to one 59 Table of Contents commercial banking loan that was placed on non accrual status in the fourth quarter of 2006. Commercial real estate net recoveries in 2006 included a $2.3 million cash recovery on one non performing loan that was resolved. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average total loans equaled 0.10% in 2007, up from 0.05% in 2006, reflecting the increase in net loan charge offs in 2007 and the impact on the ratio of a $120 million, or 1%, increase in average loans in 2007.

This assessment is based on a variety of internal and external factors including, but not limited to, the likelihood and severity of loss, portfolio growth and related risk characteristics, and current economic conditions. Non Performing Assets A loan is generally considered non performing when it is placed on non accrual status. A loan is generally placed on non accrual status when it becomes 90 days past due as to interest or principal payments. However, a loan may be placed on non accrual status earlier if such loan has been identified as presenting uncertainty with respect to the collectibility of interest and principal. A loan past due 90 days or more may remain on accruing status if such loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. Peoples United Financials historical 60 Table of Contents experience suggests that a portion of these non performing assets will eventually be recovered. All non performing loans are in various stages of collection, workout, settlement or foreclosure. When loan workout efforts are exhausted and it is determined that the borrower is unable to repay the obligation, Peoples United Financial will complete foreclosure procedures, if applicable. Restructured commercial and commercial real estate loans are those for which concessions to below market terms, such as below market interest rates or deferral of interest, have been granted due to the borrowers financial condition. The following table presents information on non accrual loans, real estate owned and repossessed assets: As of December 31 (dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 Non accrual loans: Commercial real estate $ 29.8 $ 3.7 $ 0.2 $ 5.8 $ 8.7 Residential mortgage 24.2 8.9 6.7 6.7 7.5 Commercial 21.1 1.3 11.9 1.3 5.2 PCLC 5.8 3.1 2.1 6.2 5.1 Consumer 3.3 3.3 1.7 1.3 0.9 Indirect auto 0.1 Total non accrual loans (1) 84.3 20.3 22.6 21.3 27.4 Real estate owned (REO) and repossessed assets, net 9.4 5.8 0.1 0.7 1.2 Total non performing assets $ 93.7 $ 26.1 $ 22.7 $ 22.0 $ 28.6 Non performing loans as a percentage of total loans 0.58 % 0.23 % 0.24 % 0.25 % 0.35 % Non performing assets as a percentage of: Total loans, REO and repossessed assets 0.64 0.29 0.24 0.26 0.36 Stockholders equity and allowance for loan losses 1.76 0.58 1.61 1.62 2.25 (1) Reported net of government guarantees totaling $6.5 million at December 31, 2008 (none for prior periods). Total non performing assets increased $67.6 million from December 31, 2007 and were 0.64% of total loans, real estate owned and repossessed assets at December 31, 2008. The increase in non performing assets from December 31, 2007 primarily reflects additional non performing assets attributable to the acquired Chittenden loan portfolio, and includes increases in non performing commercial real estate loans of $26.1 million, non performing commercial loans of $19.8 million and non performing residential mortgage loans of $15.3 million. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing totaled $8.0 million at December 31, 2008 (none for prior periods). Total non performing assets at December 31, 2007 increased $3.4 million from December 31, 2006 and were 0.29% of total loans, real estate owned and repossessed assets. Increases in non performing commercial real estate loans of $3.5 million, REO and repossessed assets of $5.7 million, non performing PCLC loans of $1.0 million and non performing residential mortgage loans of $2.2 million, were partially offset by a decrease of $10.6 million in non performing commercial loans. The decrease in non performing commercial loans primarily reflects the $5.9 million charge off related to one loan discussed above. The increase in non performing commercial real estate loans reflects one loan totaling $3.4 million that was classified as non performing in 2007. The increase in REO and repossessed assets primarily reflects the repossession of a printing press and ancillary equipment from one borrower and the transfer to real estate owned of the real estate securing the remaining balance of the non performing commercial loan discussed above. The level of non performing assets is expected to fluctuate in response to changing economic and market conditions, and the relative sizes of the respective loan portfolios, along with managements degree of success in resolving problem assets. Management takes a proactive approach with respect to the identification and resolution of problem loans. However, given the current state of the U.S. economy and, more specifically, the real estate market, it is anticipated that the level of non performing assets will increase in 2009. 61 Table of Contents At December 31, 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2004, Peoples United Financials portfolio did not include any loans, not included in the table above, which are troubled debt restructurings as defined in SFAS No. 15, Accounting by Debtors and Creditors for Troubled Debt Restructurings. As of December 31, 2008, if all non accruing loans had been current in accordance with their terms and had been outstanding throughout 2008 or since origination if held for part of the year, the gross interest income that would have been recorded in 2008 on such loans would have amounted to approximately $8.6 million. The amount of interest income on the non accruing loans included in net income in 2008 was $2.4 million. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Detailed discussions pertaining to Peoples United Financials off balance sheet arrangements are included in the following sections: Funding, Liquidity, Capital and Market Risk Management. Funding At the current time, Peoples United Financials primary funding sources are deposits and stockholders equity, which represent 96% of total assets at December 31, 2008. Borrowings also are an available source of funding. Based on Peoples United Banks membership in the FHLB of Boston and the level of qualifying collateral available at December 31, 2008, Peoples United Bank had up to $3.2 billion of borrowing capacity in the form of advances from the FHLB of Boston and Federal Reserve Bank, and repurchase agreements. Peoples United Bank also had unsecured borrowing capacity of $0.5 billion at December 31, 2008.

Peoples United Financial provides customers access to their deposits through over 300 branches, including 79 full service Stop & Shop supermarket branches, over 400 ATMs, telephone banking and an Internet banking site. 62 Table of Contents Deposits equaled 71% and 66% of total assets at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Total deposits increased $5.4 billion from year end 2007 primarily due to $6.2 billion in deposits acquired in the Chittenden acquisition. Deposits and stockholders equity constituted over 98% of Peoples United Financials funding base at December 31, 2008 and over 99% at December 31, 2007. The expansion of Peoples United Financials branch network and its commitment to developing full service relationships with its customers are integral components of Peoples United Financials strategy to leverage the success of its supermarket banking initiative, expand market share and continue growing deposits. At December 31, 2008, Peoples United Financials network of Stop & Shop branches held deposits totaling $2.1 billion and deposits in supermarket branches open for more than one year averaged $28 million per store. Non interest bearing deposits are an important source of low cost funding and fee income for Peoples United Financial. In addition, Peoples United Financial believes that checking accounts represent one of the core relationships between a financial institution and its customers, and it is from these relationships that cross selling of other financial services can be achieved. Non interest bearing deposits equaled 22% and 24% of deposits at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Time deposits of $100,000 or more totaled $1.4 billion at December 31, 2008, of which $533 million mature within three months, $232 million mature after three months but within six months, $577 million mature after six months but within one year and $104 million mature after one year. Brokered certificates of deposit acquired in the Chittenden acquisition totaled $17.1 million at December 31, 2008 (none at December 31, 2007 and 2006).

The increase in borrowings is due to the borrowings acquired in connection with the Chittenden acquisition. Repurchase agreements at December 31, 2008 consisted of transactions with commercial and municipal customers. In previous years, Peoples United Financials primary source for borrowings were federal funds purchased, which are typically unsecured overnight loans among banks, and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, which provides credit for member institutions within its assigned region. Peoples United Financials outstanding Federal Home Loan Bank advances at December 31, 2008 represented less than one half of one percent of total assets. Subordinated Notes Subordinated notes totaled $181 million and $65 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Peoples United Financial assumed liability for subordinated notes with a fair value of $115 million in connection with the Chittenden acquisition. These subordinated notes, which were issued in February 2007, represent unsecured general obligations of Peoples United Financial with interest payable semi annually. The notes have a coupon of 5.80% for the first five years and convert to a variable rate in year six that is tied to three month LIBOR plus 68.5 basis points. Beginning February 14, 2012, Peoples United Financial has the option to redeem some or all of the notes. 64 Table of Contents At December 31, 2008 and 2007, Peoples United Bank had $65 million of 9.875% subordinated notes outstanding. These subordinated notes are due in 2010 and represent unsecured general obligations of Peoples United Bank with interest payable semi annually, are subordinated to the claims of depositors and Peoples United Banks other creditors and are not redeemable prior to maturity without prior approval of the OTS. For regulatory capital purposes, the 9.875% subordinated notes qualify, up to certain limits, as supplementary (tier 2) capital for Peoples United Banks total risk based capital. From time to time, Peoples United Financial may seek to repurchase a portion of these subordinated notes. Repurchases will be made at managements discretion, depending on its assessment of the desirability of alternative uses for the companys capital, the price at which such repurchases may be effected, the companys cash flow and capital levels, and general market conditions. In the fourth quarter of 2008, Peoples United Financial and Peoples United Bank both opted in to the FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, which provides a temporary guarantee of newly issued senior unsecured debt, as defined (the Debt Guarantee Program). As of December 31, 2008, neither Peoples United Financial nor Peoples United Bank had any debt outstanding that qualifies under the Debt Guarantee Program. Peoples United Bank may issue up to approximately $300 million of senior unsecured debt that would qualify under the Debt Guarantee Program. While Peoples United Financial has retained the right to do so, the company does not, at this time, intend to issue senior unsecured debt that would qualify under the Debt Guarantee Program. Contractual Cash Obligations The following table is a summary of Peoples United Financials contractual cash obligations, other than deposit liabilities, including operating leases. Additional information concerning these contractual cash obligations is included in Notes 10, 11 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase obligations included in the table represent those agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions. A substantial majority of Peoples United Financials purchase obligations are renewable on a year to year basis. As such, the purchase obligations included in this table only reflect the contractual commitment.

Similarly, obligations totaling $11.7 million related to limited partnership affordable housing investments are not included in the above table as the timing of the related capital calls cannot be estimated. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of Peoples United Financials unrecognized income tax positions and affordable housing investments. 65 Table of Contents Liquidity Liquidity is defined as the ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet all present and future funding requirements at reasonable costs. Liquidity management addresses Peoples United Financials and Peoples United Banks ability to fund new loans and investments as opportunities arise, to meet customer deposit withdrawals, and to repay borrowings and subordinated notes as they mature. Peoples United Financials, as well as Peoples United Banks, liquidity positions are monitored daily by management. The Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO) of Peoples United Bank has been authorized by the Board of Directors of Peoples United Financial to set guidelines to ensure maintenance of prudent levels of liquidity for Peoples United Financial as well as for Peoples United Bank. ALCO reports to the Treasury and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors of Peoples United Bank. Asset liquidity is provided by: cash; short term investments; proceeds from security sales, maturities and principal repayments; and proceeds from scheduled principal collections, prepayments and sales of loans. In addition, certain securities may be used to collateralize borrowings under repurchase agreements. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows present data on cash provided by and used in Peoples United Financials operating, investing and financing activities. At December 31, 2008, Peoples United Financials liquid assets included $765 million in debt securities available for sale. Peoples United Banks liquid assets included $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents (including $110 million of short term GSE debt securities), $1.1 billion in debt securities available for sale and $21 million in trading account securities. Securities available for sale and short term GSE debt securities, with a combined fair value of $622 million at December 31, 2008, were pledged as collateral for public deposits and for other purposes. Liability liquidity is measured by Peoples United Financials and Peoples United Banks ability to obtain deposits and borrowings at cost effective rates that are diversified with respect to markets and maturities. Deposits, which are considered the most stable source of liability liquidity, totaled $14.3 billion at December 31, 2008 and represented 72% of total funding. Borrowings are used to diversify Peoples United Financials funding mix and to support asset growth. Borrowings totaled $188 million at December 31, 2008, representing 0.9% of total funding. Peoples United Banks current sources of borrowings include: federal funds purchased, advances from the FHLB of Boston and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and repurchase agreements. At December 31, 2008, Peoples United Banks borrowing limit from FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank advances, and repurchase agreements totaled $3.2 billion, based on the level of qualifying collateral available for these borrowing sources. In addition, Peoples United Bank had unsecured borrowing capacity of $0.5 billion at that date. At December 31, 2008, Peoples United Bank had outstanding commitments to originate loans totaling $0.9 billion and approved, but unused, lines of credit extended to customers totaling $4.3 billion (including $2.6 billion of home equity lines of credit). See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 66 Table of Contents The sources of liquidity discussed above are deemed by management to be sufficient to fund outstanding loan commitments and to meet Peoples United Financials and Peoples United Banks other obligations. Earning Asset Mix $17.6 billion as of December 31, 2008 (percent) Funding Base $19.8 billion as of December 31, 2008 (percent) Stockholders Equity and Dividends Peoples United Financials total stockholders equity was $5.18 billion at December 31, 2008, a $730 million increase from December 31, 2007. This increase primarily reflects the issuance of 44.3 million shares of common stock with a fair value of approximately $770 million (net of issuance costs) in connection with the Chittenden acquisition and net income of $139.5 million, partially offset by dividends paid of $194.4 million and a $56.8 million increase in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) since December 31, 2007. The increase in AOCL, net of tax, primarily reflects an increase in the net actuarial loss and other amounts related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans ($78.7 million), partially offset by an increase in the net unrealized gains on derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges ($18.2 million). Stockholders equity equaled 25.7% of total assets at December 31, 2008 and 32.8% at December 31, 2007. Tangible stockholders equity (total stockholders equity less goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles) equaled 19.5% of tangible assets (total assets less goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles) at December 31, 2008 and 32.3% at December 31, 2007. The decline in these ratios from December 31, 2007 primarily reflects the increases in total assets, goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles resulting from the Chittenden acquisition. In April 2008, Peoples United Financials Board of Directors approved an initial repurchase of up to 5%, or approximately 17.3 million shares, of its common stock outstanding as of April 17, 2008. The shares are expected to be purchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Share purchases will be effected at managements discretion, depending on managements assessment of the desirability of alternative uses for the companys capital, the market for the companys common stock, the companys cash flow and capital levels, and economic conditions. The repurchase program is expected to be partially funded by dividends paid by Peoples United Bank to its parent, Peoples United Financial. As of December 31, 2008, no shares had been repurchased. 67 Table of Contents In January 2009, Peoples United Financials Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend on its common stock of $0.15 per share. The dividend was paid on February 15, 2009 to shareholders of record on February 1, 2009. Peoples United Financials total stockholders equity was $4.45 billion at December 31, 2007, a $3.11 billion increase from December 31, 2006. This increase primarily reflects the $3.33 billion of net proceeds from the second step conversion, net income of $150.7 million, a common stock contribution with a fair value of $40.0 million to The Peoples United Community Foundation, and a $29.4 million decrease in AOCL since December 31, 2006, partially offset by purchases of common stock for the ESOP and the Peoples United Financial, Inc. 2007 Recognition and Retention Plan totaling $343.9 million, and dividends paid in 2007 of $131.1 million. The decrease in AOCL, net of tax, reflects a reduction in the net actuarial loss and other amounts related to pension and other postretirement benefits ($16.8 million), and an increase in the net unrealized gain on derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges ($12.6 million). Dividends declared and paid per common share (other than shares on which Peoples Mutual Holdings waived receipt of dividends prior to completing the second step conversion in April 2007) totaled $0.58, $0.52 and $0.46 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Peoples United Financials dividend payout ratio (dividends paid as a percentage of net income) for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was 139.8%, 87.0% and 48.3%, respectively. For periods prior to April 2007 (the date of the second step conversion) the dividend payout ratio reflects the waiver of dividends on the substantial majority of the common shares owned by Peoples Mutual Holdings. Regulatory Capital Requirements OTS capital regulations require federally chartered savings banks, such as Peoples United Bank, to meet three minimum capital ratios: Tangible Capital Ratio A 1.5% tangible capital ratio, calculated as tangible capital to adjusted total assets. Leverage (Core) Capital Ratio A 4% leverage (core) capital ratio, calculated as core capital to adjusted total assets. The minimum leverage (core) capital ratio is reduced to 3% if the savings bank received the highest rating on its most recent safety and soundness examination. Risk Based Capital Ratio An 8% total risk based capital ratio, calculated as total risk based capital to total risk weighted assets. For purposes of this calculation, total risk based capital equals the sum of core and supplementary capital, provided that supplementary capital may not exceed 100% of core capital. In assessing an institutions capital adequacy, the OTS takes into consideration not only these numeric factors but also qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where necessary. Peoples United Bank, as a matter of prudent management, targets as its goal the maintenance of capital ratios which exceed these minimum requirements and that are consistent with Peoples United Banks risk profile. Peoples United Banks tangible capital ratio, leverage (core) capital ratio, and total risk based capital ratios were 10.0%, 10.0% and 13.4%, respectively, at December 31, 2008, compared to 24.1%, 24.1% and 33.4%, respectively, at December 31, 2007. The decrease in these ratios from December 31, 2007 primarily reflects (i) the reduction in Peoples United Banks regulatory capital due to the $1.8 billion in dividends that Peoples United Bank paid to its parent, Peoples United Financial, in 2008, and (ii) increases in Peoples United Banks adjusted total assets (the denominator in the calculation of the leverage (core) capital ratio) and its total risk weighted assets (the denominator in the calculation of the total risk based capital ratio), both as a result of the Chittenden acquisition. 68 Table of Contents The following summary compares Peoples United Banks regulatory capital amounts and ratios as of December 31, 2008 to the OTS minimum requirements. In 2008, Peoples United Bank paid $1.8 billion in dividends to its parent, Peoples United Financial. At December 31, 2008, Peoples United Banks adjusted total assets, as defined, totaled $18.0 billion and its total risk weighted assets, as defined, totaled $14.7 billion. At December 31, 2008, Peoples United Bank exceeded each of its regulatory capital requirements. Regulatory capital amounts and ratios presented are for Peoples United Bank and therefore do not reflect the additional capital residing at Peoples United Financial. As of December 31, 2008 (dollars in millions) Peoples United Bank OTS MinimumRequirements Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Tangible capital $ 1,801.8 (1) 10.0 % $ 270.0 1.5 % Leverage (core) capital 1,801.8 (1) 10.0 720.1 4.0 Total risk based capital 1,968.0 (2) 13.4 1,177.3 8.0 (1) Represents total stockholders equity, excluding (i) after tax net unrealized gains (losses) on certain securities classified as available for sale, (ii) after tax net unrealized gains and losses on derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges, (iii) certain assets not recognized in tier 1 capital (principally goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles), and (iv) the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) relating to SFAS No. 158. (2) Represents tier 1 capital plus subordinated notes, up to certain limits, and the allowance for loan losses up to 1.25% of total risk weighted assets. Generally, a bank is considered well capitalized if it has a leverage (core) capital ratio of at least 5.0%, a tier 1 risk based capital ratio of at least 6.0% (calculated as tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets) and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 10.0%. Peoples United Banks regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2008 exceeded the OTS numeric criteria for classification as well capitalized. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning Peoples United Banks regulatory capital amounts and ratios. Peoples United Bank Capital Ratios Compared to Regulatory Requirements As of December 31, 2008 (percent) 69 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market Risk Management Market risk is the risk of loss to earnings, capital and the fair values of certain assets and liabilities resulting from changes in interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. Interest Rate Risk For Peoples United Financial, the only relevant market risk at this time is interest rate risk (IRR), which is the potential exposure to earnings or capital that may result from changes in interest rates. Peoples United Financial manages its IRR to achieve a balance between risk, earnings volatility and capital preservation. ALCO has primary responsibility for managing Peoples United Financials IRR. To evaluate Peoples United Financials IRR profile, ALCO monitors economic conditions, interest rate trends, liquidity levels and capital ratios. Management also reviews assumptions periodically for projected customer and competitor behavior, in addition to the expected repricing characteristics and cash flow projections for assets, liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments. Actual conditions may vary significantly from Peoples United Financials assumptions. Management evaluates the impact of IRR on Income at Risk using an earnings simulation model to project earnings under multiple interest rate environments over a one year time horizon resulting in a quantification of IRR. Income at Risk includes significant interest rate sensitive income sources, such as net interest income, gains on sales of residential mortgage loans and BOLI income. The earnings projections are based on a static balance sheet and estimates of pricing levels for Peoples United Financials products under multiple scenarios intended to reflect instantaneous yield curve shocks. Peoples United Financial estimates its base case Income at Risk using current interest rates. Internal policy regarding IRR simulations specify that for instantaneous parallel shifts of the yield curve, estimated Income at Risk for the subsequent one year period should not decline by more than: 10% for a 100 basis point shift; 15% for a 200 basis point shift; and 20% for a 300 basis point shift. The following table shows the estimated percentage increase (decrease) in Peoples United Financials Income at Risk over a one year simulation period beginning December 31, 2008. Given the interest rate environment at December 31, 2008, simulations for declines in interest rates below 25 basis points were not deemed to be meaningful. Rate Change (basis points) Percent Change inIncome at Risk +300 29.0 % +200 18.9 +100 8.6 25 (2.6 ) While Income at Risk simulation identifies earnings exposure over a relatively short time horizon, Equity at Risk takes a long term economic perspective when quantifying IRR, thereby identifying possible margin behavior over a longer time horizon. Base case Market Value of Equity (MVE) is calculated by estimating the net present value of all future cash flows from existing assets and liabilities using current interest rates. The base case scenario assumes that future interest rates remain unchanged. Internal policy limits the exposure of a decrease in Equity at Risk resulting from instantaneous parallel shifts of the yield curve in the following manner: for 100 basis points 10% of base case MVE; for 200 basis points 15% of base case MVE; and for 300 basis points 20% of base case MVE. 70 Table of Contents The following table shows the estimated percentage increase (decrease) in Peoples United Financials Equity at Risk, assuming various shifts in interest rates. Given the interest rate environment at December 31, 2008, simulations for declines in interest rates below 25 basis points were not deemed to be meaningful. Rate Change (basis points) Percent Change inEquity at Risk +300 (1.8 )% +200 (1.2 ) +100 (0.8 ) 25 0.1 Peoples United Financials interest rate risk position at December 31, 2008, as set forth in the Income at Risk and Equity at Risk tables above, reflects its significant excess capital position at that date. Managements current posture is to invest a portion of such excess capital in highly liquid, low risk, short term investments. While this strategy does place additional pressure on net interest income in a decreasing rate environment, management views such risk as an acceptable alternative in light of the current credit environment where capital has proven vital to the continued viability of many institutions. Given the uncertainty of the magnitude, timing and direction of future interest rate movements and the shape of the yield curve, actual results may vary from those predicted by Peoples United Financials models. Peoples United Financials asset sensitive balance sheet includes more than just its significant excess capital position. In fact, a 1% increase in interest rates translates to an approximate $50 million improvement in pre tax income. Conversely, if the current 25 basis points targeted federal funds rate is annualized and compared to the 2.10% average federal funds rate experienced in 2008, the resultant 185 basis point differential translates into an approximate $90 million reduction in pre tax income. Peoples United Financial uses derivative financial instruments, including interest rate floors and interest rate swaps, as components of its IRR management. Peoples United Financial has written guidelines that have been approved by its Board of Directors and ALCO governing the use of these financial instruments, including approved counterparties and credit limits. Credit risk associated with these instruments is controlled and monitored though policies and procedures governing collateral management and credit approval. At December 31, 2008, each of Peoples United Financials counterparties had an investment grade credit rating from the major rating agencies and is specifically approved up to a maximum credit exposure. Peoples United Financials counterparty credit exposure on its outstanding derivative contracts, after considering the effect of the bilateral netting arrangements and posted collateral, totaled $22.6 million at December 31, 2008. Derivative financial instruments are primarily used for market risk management purposes (principally interest rate risk). Certain other derivatives are entered into in connection with transactions with commercial customers. Derivatives are not used for speculative purposes. At December 31, 2008, Peoples United Financial was using interest rate floors and interest rate swaps to manage IRR associated with certain interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Peoples United Financial uses interest rate floors to partially manage its exposure to a decrease in interest income resulting from declines in certain interest rates. These interest rate floors offer protection against a decline in interest income if the one month LIBOR index rate used to reprice certain floating rate commercial loans declines below the strike rate on the interest rate floors. If the one month LIBOR index rate falls below the specified strike rate, Peoples United Financial would receive an interest payment on the interest rate floor equal to the difference between the one month LIBOR index rate on the reset date and the strike rate, which in effect, would offset the decline in interest income earned on the hedged floating rate commercial loans from the decline in interest rates. Interest rate floors are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Interest rate swaps are used to match more closely the repricing of fewer than five commercial real estate loans and the funding associated with these loans. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the funding 71 Table of Contents liabilities from a variable interest rate into a fixed interest rate and consequently reduce Peoples United Banks exposure to increases in interest rates and their effect on interest income and interest expense. Interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges. By using derivatives, Peoples United Financial is exposed to credit risk to the extent that counterparties to the derivative contracts do not perform as required. Should a counterparty fail to perform under the terms of a derivative contract, the companys counterparty credit risk is equal to the amount reported as a derivative asset in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. Amounts reported as derivative assets represent derivative contracts in a gain position, net of derivatives in a loss position with the same counterparty (to the extent subject to master netting arrangements) and posted collateral. Peoples United Financial seeks to minimize counterparty credit risk through credit approvals, limits, monitoring procedures, execution of master netting arrangements and obtaining collateral, where appropriate. Counterparty credit risk related to derivatives is considered and, if material, provided for separately. In connection with the September 2008 bankruptcy filing by Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc., Peoples United Financial terminated its $100 million (notional) derivative contract (interest rate floor) with Lehman Brothers. The derivative contract had a fair value of $5.3 million at the time of termination. After considering the master netting arrangement and posted collateral, the net amount due to the company was $1.4 million. Peoples United Financial recognized a $1.2 million charge that is included in other non interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income to reduce this receivable to the amount currently estimated to be realizable. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign exchange forward contracts are commitments to buy or sell foreign currency on a future date at a contractual price. Peoples United Financial uses these instruments on a limited basis to eliminate its exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates on certain of its commercial loans that are denominated in foreign currencies. Gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts substantially offset the translation gains and losses on the related loans. 72 Table of Contents Derivative Financial Instruments The following table summarizes certain information concerning derivative financial instruments utilized by Peoples United Financial in its management of IRR and foreign currency risk. Also see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In order to minimize its risk, these customer derivatives have been offset with essentially matching interest rate swaps with Peoples United Financials counterparties. Changes in the fair value of all such interest rate swaps are recognized in current earnings. The following table summarizes certain information concerning these interest rate swaps: As of and for the year ended December 31, 2008 (dollars in millions) Interest Rate Swaps Customer Counterparty Notional principal amounts $ 60.3 $ 60.3 Weighted average remaining term to maturity (in months) 124 124 Increase (decrease) in pre tax income $ 7.3 $ (6.9 ) Fair value: Recognized as an asset 7.3 Recognized as a liability 6.9 In the first quarter of 2009, Peoples United Financial terminated its remaining $600 million (notional) interest rate floor contracts. The decision to do so was based on managements belief that, in light of the current interest rate environment, the derivative contracts had achieved their stated market risk management objective. Termination of the derivative contracts also served to reduce the companys counterparty credit risk. At the time of termination, the interest rate floors had a fair value (unrealized gain) of $47.5 million. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 133, the unrealized gain is included (on a net of tax basis) as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be recognized over the period during which the hedged items (certain floating rate commercial loans) affect earnings (approximately 2 years). 73 Table of Contents
