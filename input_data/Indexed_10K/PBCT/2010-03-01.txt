Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements Periodic and other filings made by Peoples United Financial with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) may from time to time contain information and statements that are forward looking in nature. Such filings include the Annual Report on Form 10 K, Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q and Current Report on Form 8 K, and may include other forms such as proxy statements. Other written or oral statements made by Peoples United Financial or its representatives from time to time may also contain forward looking statements. In general, forward looking statements usually use words such as may, believe, expect, anticipate, should, plan, estimate, predict, continue and potential or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Examples of forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, estimates with respect to Peoples United Financials financial condition, results of operations and business that are subject to various factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates. Forward looking statements represent managements beliefs, based upon information available at the time the statements are made, with regard to the matters addressed; they are not guarantees of future performance. All forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause Peoples United Financials actual results or financial condition to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such statements. Factors of particular importance to Peoples United Financial include, but are not limited to: (1) changes in general, national or regional economic conditions; (2) changes in interest rates; (3) changes in loan default and charge off rates; (4) changes in deposit levels; (5) changes in levels of income and expense in non interest income and expense related activities; (6) residential mortgage and secondary market activity; (7) changes in accounting and regulatory guidance applicable to banks; (8) price levels and conditions in the public securities markets generally; (9) competition and its effect on pricing, spending, third party relationships and revenues; and (10) the successful integration of acquired companies. All forward looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Consequently, no forward looking statement can be guaranteed. Peoples United Financial does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Recent Market Developments In response to the unprecedented challenges affecting the banking system, the Federal government began implementing several programs in late 2008 designed to address a variety of issues facing the financial sector. Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program On October 3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the EESA) was signed into law. The EESA, which is intended to stabilize and provide liquidity to the U.S. financial markets, authorized the U.S. Treasury, acting in accordance with the provisions of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (the TARP), to (i) purchase up to $700 billion of mortgages, mortgage backed securities, and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions, and (ii) establish a program to guarantee certain assets issued by financial institutions prior to March 14, 2008. The company did not sell any of its assets pursuant to the TARP or participate in the asset guarantee program. 23 Table of Contents On October 14, 2008, the U.S. Treasury announced a plan to employ a portion of its purchasing authority, as provided for by the EESA, in making direct equity investments in qualifying banks and thrifts. Under this program, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program Capital Purchase Program (the TARP CPP), the U.S. Treasury will utilize up to $250 billion of the $700 billion authorized by the EESA to purchase preferred stock in qualifying institutions that request such investments. The preferred stock issued under the TARP CPP contains a number of provisions, some of which could reduce investment returns to participating banks shareholders by restricting dividends to common shareholders, diluting existing shareholders interests, and restricting capital management practices. Peoples United Bank currently exceeds all applicable regulatory capital requirements and remains well capitalized. As such, the company did not apply for equity capital under the TARP CPP. FDIC Insurance Coverage / Assessments The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC) insures deposits at FDIC insured financial institutions up to certain limits, charging premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund (the DIF) at specified levels. Such premiums may vary based on the risk profile of the insured institution and have historically ranged from 0.05% of deposits for an institution in the highest sub category of the highest category to 0.43% of deposits for an institution in the lowest category. Current economic conditions have resulted in an increased number of bank failures and, consequently, greater use of DIF resources. In response, the FDIC authorized higher premium assessments for 2009 pursuant to a restoration plan designed to increase the DIF reserve ratio to required levels. Under the FDICs restoration plan, the premium assessment rate was raised uniformly by seven basis points beginning on January 1, 2009 resulting in an initial base assessment rate of 12 basis points for Peoples United Bank. Furthermore, the premium assessment rate in effect beginning April 1, 2009 is subject to adjustments that are based on each institutions risk profile and may affect its initial base assessment rate. On May 22, 2009, the FDIC adopted a final rule that imposed a special assessment of 5 basis points on each insured financial institutions total assets less Tier 1 capital as of June 30, 2009. As a result, included in other non interest expense in 2009 is an FDIC special assessment charge of $8.4 million. On September 29, 2009, the FDIC adopted a plan that extended the DIF restoration plan from seven years to eight years and on November 12, 2009, the FDIC adopted a final rule that amended the assessment regulations to require insured financial institutions to prepay, on December 30, 2009, their estimated deposit insurance premiums for 2010, 2011 and 2012. This rule, which did not include any additional special assessments, assumes a 5% annual growth rate in each institutions insured deposits (the assessment base) and increases each institutions premium assessment rate by three basis points beginning in 2011. As such, regulatory assessment expense may continue to increase in 2010 and beyond. On December 30, 2009, Peoples United Bank prepaid its estimated deposit insurance premiums totaling $69 million in accordance with FDIC regulations. The EESA increased the FDIC deposit insurance limit from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor through December 31, 2009, and subsequent amendments extended the increased coverage through December 31, 2013. In addition, on October 14, 2008, the FDIC announced the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, which consists of two components: temporary unlimited deposit insurance on funds in non interest bearing transaction deposit accounts not otherwise covered by the increased $250,000 deposit insurance limit (the Transaction Account Guarantee Program) and a temporary guarantee of certain newly issued unsecured debt (the Debt Guarantee Program). All eligible institutions were covered under both programs for the first 30 days without incurring any costs. After the initial 30 day period, institutions participating in the Transaction Account Guarantee Program are assessed a 10 basis point surcharge on the additional insured deposits and institutions participating in the Debt Guarantee Program are subject to an annualized charge equal to 75 basis points. On August 26, 2009, the FDIC adopted a final rule extending the Transaction Account Guarantee Program from December 31, 2009 through June 30, 2010. Institutions that remain in the Transaction Account Guarantee Program will be charged an assessment rate of either 15 basis points, 20 basis points or 25 basis points on the additional insured deposits, depending on the institutions risk category as assigned by the FDIC. 24 Table of Contents The company is participating in the Transaction Account Guarantee Program as it participates in all other FDIC deposit insurance programs. While Peoples United Financial has retained its right to do so, the company does not, at this time, intend to issue senior unsecured debt securities under the Debt Guarantee Program. Based on the increase in the premium assessment rate, the special assessment announced in May 2009, and the companys participation in the Transaction Account Guarantee Program, the companys cost of deposit insurance increased significantly in 2009, and further increases may occur. The actual amount of further increases will be dependent on several factors, including: (i) deposit levels; (ii) Peoples United Banks risk profile; (iii) changes resulting from the FDICs November 2009 final rule; and (iv) whether additional special assessments are imposed in future periods and the manner in which such assessments are determined. The actions described above, together with additional actions announced by the U.S. Treasury and other regulatory agencies continue to develop. It is not clear at this time what impact the EESA, the TARP, the TARP CPP, or other liquidity and funding programs of the U.S. Treasury and bank regulatory agencies, whether previously announced or initiated in the future, will have on the capital markets and the financial services industry. The extreme levels of market volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced could continue to adversely affect the U.S. banking industry and the broader U.S. and global economies for the foreseeable future, which will have an effect on all financial institutions, including Peoples United Financial. General Peoples United Financial, Inc. (Peoples United Financial) is a savings and loan holding company incorporated under the state laws of Delaware and the holding company for Peoples United Bank. On April 16, 2007, Peoples United Financial, Peoples United Bank and Peoples Mutual Holdings completed their second step conversion from a mutual holding company structure to a fully public stock holding company structure. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of the second step conversion. Peoples United Financial is regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision (the OTS) and is subject to OTS examination, supervision and reporting requirements. Peoples United Financial had not engaged in any business through March 31, 2007; accordingly, the financial information for periods prior to March 31, 2007 is that of Peoples United Bank. On June 6, 2007, Peoples Bank changed its name to Peoples United Bank. The name Peoples United Bank is used to refer to the Bank both before and after the name change. On January 1, 2008, Peoples United Financial completed its acquisition of Chittenden Corporation (Chittenden), a multi bank holding company headquartered in Burlington, Vermont. At that time, the six former Chittenden banks all became wholly owned subsidiaries of Peoples United Bank. At December 31, 2007, Chittenden had total assets of $7.4 billion, total loans of $5.7 billion, total deposits of $6.2 billion and 140 branches. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and accordingly, Chittendens assets and liabilities were recorded by Peoples United Financial at their estimated fair values as of January 1, 2008. Financial data for periods prior to the acquisition date do not include the results of Chittenden. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of the acquisition. On January 1, 2009, the separate bank charters of the six former Chittenden banks were consolidated into Peoples United Bank. The former banks, which continue to do business under their existing names as divisions of Peoples United Bank, are: Chittenden Trust Company based in Burlington, Vermont; Flagship Bank and Trust Company based in Worcester, Massachusetts; Maine Bank & Trust based in Portland, Maine; Merrill Merchants Bank based in Bangor, Maine; Ocean Bank based in Portsmouth, New Hampshire; and The Bank of Western Massachusetts based in Springfield, Massachusetts. Peoples United Bank is a federally chartered stock savings bank headquartered in Bridgeport, Connecticut with $20.6 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2009. Peoples United Bank was organized in 1842 as a mutual savings bank, converted to stock form in 1988, and in 2006 converted from a Connecticut chartered stock savings bank to a federally chartered stock savings bank. Deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF of the FDIC. Peoples United Bank is regulated by the OTS. 25 Table of Contents The principal business of Peoples United Financial is to provide, through Peoples United Bank and its subsidiaries, commercial banking, retail and small business banking, and wealth management services to individual, corporate and municipal customers. Traditional banking activities are conducted primarily within New England and include extending secured and unsecured commercial and consumer loans, originating mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial properties, and accepting consumer, commercial and municipal deposits. In addition to traditional banking activities, Peoples United Bank provides specialized financial services tailored to specific markets including: personal, institutional and employee benefit trust; cash management; and municipal banking and finance. Through its non banking subsidiaries, Peoples United Bank offers: brokerage, financial advisory services, investment management services and life insurance through Peoples Securities, Inc.; equipment financing through Peoples Capital and Leasing Corp. (PCLC); and other insurance services through R.C. Knox and Company, Inc. and Chittenden Insurance Group, LLC. This full range of financial services is delivered through a network of nearly 300 branches, including 81 full service Stop & Shop supermarket branches that provide customers with seven day a week banking. In addition, Peoples United Bank operates 39 investment and brokerage offices, 16 commercial banking offices and 10 PCLC offices. Peoples United Banks distribution network also includes online banking and investment trading, a 24 hour telephone banking service and participation in a worldwide ATM network. PCLC maintains a sales presence in seven states to support its equipment financing operations outside of New England. Within the Commercial Banking division, Peoples United Bank maintains a national credits group, which has participated in commercial loans and commercial real estate loans to borrowers in various industries on a national scale. Peoples United Financials results of operations are largely dependent upon revenues generated through net interest income and fee based revenues and, to a much lesser extent, other forms of non interest income such as gains on asset sales. Sources for these revenues are diversified across Peoples United Financials three primary business segments that represent its core businesses, Commercial Banking, Retail Banking and Small Business, and Wealth Management, and to a lesser extent, Treasury. Peoples United Financials results of operations are also significantly affected by the provision for loan losses and the level of non interest expense. In addition, Peoples United Financials results of operations may also be affected by general and local economic conditions, changes in market interest rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Recent Developments On February 19, 2010, Peoples United Financial completed its acquisition of Financial Federal Corporation (Financial Federal), a financial services company that provides collateralized lending, financing and leasing services nationwide to small and medium sized businesses. On the closing date, Financial Federal had total assets of $1.3 billion. Total consideration paid in the Financial Federal acquisition of approximately $699 million consisted of approximately $293 million in cash and 26.0 million shares of Peoples United Financial common stock valued at approximately $406 million. The acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, Financial Federals assets and liabilities will be recorded by Peoples United Financial at their estimated fair values as of the closing date. Results of operations for Financial Federal will be included in the Consolidated Statements of Income beginning with the closing date. Critical Accounting Policies In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, Peoples United Financial is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from Peoples United Financials current estimates, as a result of changing conditions and future events. Several accounting estimates are particularly critical and are susceptible to significant near term change, including the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of derivative financial instruments, and asset impairment judgments, such as other than temporary declines in the value of securities and the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets. The judgments used by Peoples United Financial 26 Table of Contents in applying these critical accounting policies may be affected by a further and prolonged deterioration in the economic environment, which may result in changes to future financial results. For example, subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods, and the inability to collect outstanding principal may result in increased loan losses. Peoples United Financials significant accounting policies and critical estimates are summarized in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses charged to income. Losses on loans, including impaired loans, are charged to the allowance for loan losses when all or a portion of a loan is deemed to be uncollectible. Recoveries of loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance when realized. Peoples United Financial maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that is deemed to be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the respective loan portfolios, based on a quarterly evaluation of a variety of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to: Peoples United Financials historical loan loss experience and recent trends in that experience; risk ratings assigned by lending personnel to commercial real estate, commercial and PCLC loans, and the results of ongoing reviews of those ratings by Peoples United Financials independent loan review function; an evaluation of delinquent and non performing loans and related collateral values; the probability of loss in view of geographic and industry concentrations and other portfolio risk characteristics; the present financial condition of borrowers; and current economic conditions. Peoples United Financial did not change its practices with respect to determining the allowance for loan losses during 2009. While Peoples United Financial seeks to use the best available information to make these evaluations, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions, results of regulatory examinations, further information obtained regarding known problem loans, the identification of additional problem loans and other factors. The allowance for loan losses consists of: (i) an estimated loss allowance for each homogeneous pool of smaller balance loans (residential mortgage and consumer loans) that are evaluated on a collective basis; (ii) an estimated loss allowance for commercial real estate and commercial loans that are not subjected to an individual impairment evaluation; and (iii) a specific loss allowance for certain loans deemed to be impaired. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that Peoples United Financial will be unable to collect all principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan. If the measurement of an impaired loan is less than its recorded investment, an impairment loss is recognized as part of the allowance for loan losses. Loans that are individually evaluated for collectibility are subjected to Peoples United Financials normal loan review procedures. Valuation of Derivative Financial Instruments. Peoples United Financial uses derivative financial instruments as components of its market risk management (principally to manage interest rate risk). Certain other derivatives are entered into in connection with transactions with commercial customers. Derivatives are not used for speculative purposes. Peoples United Financial generally applies hedge accounting to its derivatives used for market risk management purposes. Hedge accounting is permitted only if specific criteria are met, including a requirement that a highly effective relationship exist between the derivative instrument and the hedged item, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis. The hedge accounting method depends upon whether the derivative instrument is classified as a fair value hedge (i.e. hedging an exposure related to a recognized asset or liability, or a firm commitment) or a cash flow hedge (i.e. hedging an exposure related to the variability of future cash flows associated with a recognized asset or liability, or a forecasted transaction). Changes in the fair value of effective fair value hedges are recognized in current earnings (with the change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability also recorded in earnings). Changes in the fair value of effective cash flow hedges are recognized in other comprehensive income or loss until earnings are affected by the variability in cash flows of the designated hedged item. Ineffective portions of hedge results are recognized in current earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied are recognized in current earnings. 27 Table of Contents Peoples United Financial formally documents at inception all relationships between the derivative instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as hedges to specific assets and liabilities, or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. Peoples United Financial also formally assesses, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged items. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective or has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, Peoples United Financial would discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. Gains or losses resulting from the termination of a derivative accounted for as a cash flow hedge remain in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and are amortized to earnings over the remaining period of the former hedging relationship, provided the hedged item continues to be outstanding. Peoples United Financial uses the dollar offset method, regression analysis and scenario analysis to assess hedge effectiveness at inception and on an ongoing basis. Such methods are chosen based on the nature of the hedge strategy and are used consistently throughout the life of the hedging relationship. Interest rate lock commitments extended to borrowers relate to the origination of residential mortgage loans. To mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in these commitments, Peoples United Financial enters into mandatory delivery and best efforts contracts to sell adjustable rate and fixed rate residential mortgage loans (servicing released). Forward commitments to sell and interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans are considered derivatives and their respective estimated fair values are adjusted based on changes in interest rates. Asset Impairment Judgments Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are required to be reviewed for impairment at least annually, with impairment losses charged to expense when they occur. Acquisition related intangible assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives and are periodically reviewed by management to assess recoverability. Impairment losses on other acquisition related intangibles are recognized as a charge to expense if carrying amounts exceed fair values. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. The test is performed as of an annual impairment testing date or more frequently if a triggering event indicates that impairment may have occurred. The goodwill impairment analysis is a two step test. The first step (Step 1) is used to identify potential impairment, and involves comparing each reporting units estimated fair value to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not deemed to be impaired. Should the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceed its estimated fair value, an indicator of potential impairment is deemed to exist and a second step is performed to measure the amount of such impairment, if any. The second step (Step 2) involves calculating the implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which impairment was indicated in Step 1. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to how the amount of goodwill is determined in a business combination (i.e. by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, as determined in Step 1, over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities, and identifiable intangibles applicable to that reporting unit as of the impairment testing date). If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, no impairment exists. If the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to such excess. An impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit, and the loss (write down) establishes a new carrying amount for the goodwill. Subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted. 28 Table of Contents In estimating the fair value of its reporting units, Peoples United Financial uses a present value measurement technique (discounted cash flow analysis based on internal forecasts) and, to a lesser extent, market based trading and transaction multiples. More weight is given to the discounted cash flow analysis as: (i) market based multiples are not deemed directly comparable given the difficulty in identifying operating entities that are substantially similar to the reporting units; (ii) market based multiples are not deemed to be highly reliable in periods of limited capital markets activity (such as that which has existed during the last two years); and (iii) internal forecasts tend to provide a longer term view of performance. The discounted cash flow analysis is based on significant assumptions and judgments including future growth rates and discount rates reflecting managements assessment of market participant views of the risks associated with the projected cash flows of the reporting units. Differences in the identification of reporting units or in the selection of valuation techniques and related assumptions could result in materially different evaluations of goodwill impairment. Securities. Marketable equity and debt securities (other than those reported as short term investments) are classified as either trading account securities, held to maturity securities (applicable only to debt securities) or available for sale securities. Management determines the classification of a security at the time of its purchase. Securities purchased for sale in the near term as well as those held by Peoples Securities (in accordance with the requirements for a broker dealer) are classified as trading account securities and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in non interest income. Debt securities for which Peoples United Financial has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity securities and reported at amortized cost. All other securities are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported on an after tax basis in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Premiums are amortized and discounts are accreted to interest income for debt securities, using the interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity, adjusted for the effect of actual prepayments in the case of mortgage backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and other asset backed securities. Management conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if the decline in fair value of any security is deemed to be other than temporary. Other than temporary impairment losses are recognized on debt securities when: (i) the holder has an intention to sell the security; (ii) it is more likely than not that the security will be required to be sold prior to recovery; or (iii) the holder does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. Other than temporary losses are reflected in earnings as realized losses to the extent the impairment is related to credit losses. The amount of the impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income. Management has the ability and intent to hold the securities classified as held to maturity until they mature, at which time Peoples United Financial expects to receive full value for the securities. Non GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation to GAAP In addition to evaluating Peoples United Financials results of operations in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management routinely supplements this evaluation with an analysis of certain non GAAP financial measures, such as the efficiency and tangible equity ratios, and tangible book value per share. Management believes these non GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding Peoples United Financials underlying operating performance and trends, and facilitates comparisons with the performance of other banks and thrifts. Further, the efficiency ratio is used by management in its assessment of financial performance specifically as it relates to non interest expense control, while the tangible equity ratio and tangible book value per share are used to analyze the relative strength of Peoples United Financials capital position. 29 Table of Contents The efficiency ratio, which represents an approximate measure of the cost required by Peoples United Financial to generate a dollar of revenue, is the ratio of (i) total non interest expense (excluding goodwill impairment charges, amortization of other acquisition related intangibles and fair value adjustments, losses on real estate assets and non recurring expenses) (the numerator) to (ii) net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis (excluding fair value adjustments) plus total non interest income (including the fully taxable equivalent adjustment on bank owned life insurance income, and excluding gains and losses on sales of assets, other than residential mortgage loans, and non recurring income) (the denominator). Peoples United Financial generally considers an item of income or expense to be non recurring if it is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type incurred within the last two years and is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type reasonably expected to be incurred within the following two years. The tangible equity ratio is the ratio of (i) tangible stockholders equity (total stockholders equity less goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles) (the numerator) to (ii) tangible assets (total assets less goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles) (the denominator). Tangible book value per share is calculated by dividing tangible stockholders equity by common shares outstanding (total common shares issued, less common shares classified as treasury shares and unallocated ESOP common shares). In light of diversity in presentation among financial institutions, the methodologies for determining the non GAAP financial measures discussed above may vary significantly. The following table summarizes Peoples United Financials efficiency ratio derived from amounts reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Economic activity in the United States improved in the latter half of 2009, after slowing significantly throughout 2008 and more dramatically in the second half of that year. Real gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of 5.9% in the fourth quarter of 2009, after increasing 2.2% in the third quarter. The national unemployment rate was 10.0% as of December 31, 2009, up from 7.4% at the end of 2008. In response to the significant disruptions in the capital markets brought about by the sub prime mortgage crisis and its after effects, turmoil in the financial sector, and the contracting U.S. economy, the Federal Reserve Board lowered the targeted federal funds rate ten times since September 2007, and established a target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to 0.25 percent as of December 16, 2008, which did not change throughout 2009. The New England region is Peoples United Financials primary market area, with Connecticut and Vermont having the largest concentration of Peoples United Financials loans, deposits and branches. Connecticut is one of the most attractive markets in the United States with a total population of approximately 3.5 million and a median household income of $70,949 as of June 30, 2009, ranking second in the United States and well above the U.S. median income of $54,719, according to estimates from SNL Securities. Fairfield County, where Peoples United Financial is headquartered, is the wealthiest county in Connecticut, with a June 30, 2009 median household income of $87,897 according to estimates from SNL Securities. The states unemployment rate increased to 8.9% as of December 31, 2009 compared to 6.6% at the end of 2008, but still below the national rate. The Connecticut economy experienced a moderate decline in jobs in 2009, with total employment decreasing by 59,000 jobs, or approximately 3.5% from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009 compared to a decrease of 29,300 jobs, or approximately 1.7% from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008. The median household income in Vermont was $54,205 as of June 30, 2009, comparable to the national level, and the states unemployment rate was 6.9% at December 31, 2009, up from 5.9% at the end of 2008 but still below the national rate. The overall outlook for the New England economy in 2010 is consistent with the rest of the United States, with the expectation that the region may experience further increases in unemployment as long as the recessionary environment continues into 2010. 31 Table of Contents Financial Overview Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. Total assets at December 31, 2009 were $21.3 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion from December 31, 2008, reflecting an increase of $2.4 billion in short term investments and securities resale agreements (largely attributable to an increase in total deposits as noted below), partially offset by decreases of $1.0 billion in securities and $332 million in total loans. The decrease in total loans from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009 reflects increases of $432 million in commercial real estate loans and $18 million in consumer loans, which were more than offset by decreases of $598 million in residential mortgage loans and $184 million in commercial loans. The decrease in residential mortgage loans reflects Peoples United Financials decision to sell essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. Residential mortgage loan balances are expected to continue to decline in the future until Peoples United Financial resumes adding such loans to its portfolio to an extent that more than offsets repayments. Residential mortgage loans at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 included loans held for sale (all to be sold servicing released) of $71.3 million and $31.7 million, respectively, which approximate fair value. The increase in loans held for sale from December 31, 2008 reflects a higher backlog associated with an increase in residential mortgage refinancing activity as a result of the historically low interest rate environment. Non performing assets totaled $205.6 million at December 31, 2009, a $111.9 million increase from December 31, 2008, primarily reflecting increases of $42.6 million in non performing commercial real estate loans, $28.5 million in non performing residential mortgage loans, $14.8 million in non performing PCLC loans and $27.4 million in real estate owned (REO) and repossessed assets. The allowance for loan losses totaled $172.5 million at December 31, 2009 compared to $157.5 million at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2009, the allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans was 1.21% and as a percent of non performing loans was 102.2%, compared to 1.08% and 186.8%, respectively, at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2009, liabilities totaled $16.2 billion, a $1.2 billion increase from December 31, 2008, reflecting a $1.2 billion increase in total deposits. Peoples United Financials total stockholders equity was $5.1 billion at December 31, 2009, a $73 million decrease from December 31, 2008. The decrease primarily reflects dividends paid of $203.6 million, partially offset by net income of $101.2 million. As a percentage of total assets, stockholders equity was 24.0% at December 31, 2009 compared to 25.7% at December 31, 2008. Tangible stockholders equity as a percentage of tangible assets was 18.2% at December 31, 2009 compared to 19.5% at December 31, 2008. Peoples United Banks leverage (core) capital ratio, and tier 1 and total risk based capital ratios were 10.0%, 13.1% and 14.1%, respectively, at December 31, 2009, compared to 10.0%, 12.2% and 13.4%, respectively, at December 31, 2008 (see Regulatory Capital Requirements). Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. Peoples United Financial reported net income of $101.2 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $137.8 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, for the year ago period. Included in the 2008 results are merger related expenses of $41.0 million, other one time charges totaling $14.8 million and a $6.9 million gain related to the Visa, Inc. initial public offering (IPO). The net impact of these items reduced 2008 net income by $33.2 million, or $0.10 per diluted share. In 2009, Peoples United Financials return on average tangible assets was 0.53% and return on average tangible stockholders equity was 2.8%, compared to 0.73% and 3.7%, respectively, in 2008. Net interest income decreased $59.6 million from 2008 while the net interest margin declined 43 basis points to 3.19%. The lower net interest margin reflects the interest rate cuts initiated by the Federal Reserve Board throughout 2008, and the companys asset sensitive balance sheet, including its significant excess capital position, which continues to be temporarily invested in low yielding short term investments and securities resale agreements. 32 Table of Contents Average earning assets increased $535 million compared to 2008, reflecting increases of $551 million in average short term investments and securities resale agreements, and $59 million in average loans, partially offset by a decrease of $75 million in average securities. Average funding liabilities increased $431 million compared to 2008, reflecting a $422 million increase in average total deposits. Compared to 2008, total non interest income increased $5.5 million and total non interest expense decreased $24.4 million (see Non Interest Income and Non Interest Expense). The efficiency ratio was 73.5% in 2009 compared to 66.6% in 2008. The provision for loan losses in 2009 was $57.0 million compared to $26.2 million in 2008. The provision for loan losses in 2009 reflected net loan charge offs of $42.0 million and a $15.0 million increase in the allowance for loan losses. The provision for loan losses in 2008 reflected net loan charge offs of $14.9 million and an $11.3 million increase in the allowance for loan losses. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average total loans were 0.29% in 2009 compared to 0.10% in 2008. Peoples United Financial completed its acquisition of Chittenden on January 1, 2008. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, financial data for periods prior to the acquisition date do not include the results of Chittenden and therefore, are not directly comparable to subsequent periods. Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007. Total assets at December 31, 2008 were $20.2 billion, a $6.6 billion increase from December 31, 2007, reflecting increases of $5.6 billion in total loans and $1.4 billion in goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles (resulting from the Chittenden acquisition). The increase in total loans from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008 is primarily due to $5.7 billion in loans acquired in the Chittenden acquisition, and, reflects increases of $3.1 billion in commercial real estate loans ($285 million of organic growth), $1.6 billion in commercial loans ($348 million of organic growth) and $1.0 billion in consumer loans ($153 million of organic growth). Excluding the effect of residential mortgage loans acquired in the Chittenden acquisition, residential mortgage loans would have decreased $813 million since December 31, 2007, reflecting Peoples United Financials decision in the fourth quarter of 2006 to begin selling essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. Non performing assets totaled $93.7 million at December 31, 2008, a $67.6 million increase from year end 2007, primarily reflecting additional non performing assets attributable to the acquired Chittenden loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses totaled $157.5 million at December 31, 2008 compared to $72.7 million at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2008, the allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans was 1.08% and as a percent of non performing loans was 187%, compared to 0.81% and 358%, respectively, at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2008, liabilities totaled $15.0 billion, a $5.9 billion increase from December 31, 2007, reflecting a $5.4 billion increase in total deposits primarily due to $6.2 billion in deposits acquired in the Chittenden acquisition. Peoples United Financials total stockholders equity was $5.2 billion at December 31, 2008, a $729 million increase from December 31, 2007. The increase primarily reflects the issuance of 44.3 million shares of common stock with a fair value of approximately $770 million (net of issuance costs) in connection with the Chittenden acquisition and net income of $137.8 million, partially offset by dividends paid of $194.4 million and a $56.8 million increase in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss since December 31, 2007. As a percentage of total assets, stockholders equity was 25.7% at December 31, 2008 compared to 32.8% at December 31, 2007. Tangible stockholders equity as a percentage of tangible assets was 19.5% at December 31, 2008 compared to 32.3% at December 31, 2007. 33 Table of Contents Peoples United Banks leverage (core) capital ratio, and tier 1 and total risk based capital ratios were 10.0%, 12.2% and 13.4%, respectively, at December 31, 2008, compared to 24.1%, 32.3% and 33.4%, respectively, at December 31, 2007. The decrease in these ratios from December 31, 2007 primarily reflects (i) the reduction in Peoples United Banks regulatory capital due to $1.8 billion in dividends that Peoples United Bank paid to its parent, Peoples United Financial, in 2008 and (ii) increases in Peoples United Banks adjusted total assets and total risk weighted assets, both as a result of the Chittenden acquisition (see Regulatory Capital Requirements). Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007. Peoples United Financial reported net income of $137.8 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $150.7 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, for the year ago period. Included in the 2008 results are merger related expenses of $41.0 million, other one time charges totaling $14.8 million and a $6.9 million gain related to the Visa, Inc. initial public offering (IPO). The net impact of these items reduced 2008 net income by $33.2 million, or $0.10 per diluted share. Results for 2007 included the $60.0 million contribution to The Peoples United Community Foundation, which had the effect of reducing net income in 2007 by $39.6 million, or $0.13 per diluted share. Excluding the effect of these items from the respective years results, earnings would have been $171.0 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, in 2008, compared to $190.3 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, in 2007. In 2008, Peoples United Financials return on average tangible assets was 0.73% and return on average tangible stockholders equity was 3.7%, compared to 1.19% and 4.3%, respectively, in 2007. Net interest income increased $149.8 million from 2007 while the net interest margin declined 50 basis points to 3.62%. The lower net interest margin reflects the interest rate cuts initiated by the Federal Reserve Board in 2008 and 2007, and the companys asset sensitive balance sheet, including its significant excess capital position, which for most of 2008 was temporarily invested in low yielding short term investments and securities resale agreements. Average earning assets increased $5.9 billion, compared to 2007, reflecting increases of $5.3 billion in average loans and $1.0 billion in average securities, partially offset by a decrease of $0.4 billion in average short term investments. Average funding liabilities increased $5.8 billion compared to 2007, primarily reflecting a $5.5 billion increase in average deposits. Compared to 2007, total non interest income increased $118 million and total non interest expense increased $270 million (see Non Interest Income and Non Interest Expense). The efficiency ratio was 66.6% in 2008 compared to 56.1% in 2007. The provision for loan losses was $26.2 million compared to $8.0 million in 2007. The provision for loan losses in 2008 reflects net loan charge offs of $14.9 million and an $11.3 million increase in the allowance for loan losses, including a $4.5 million increase resulting from the alignment of the former Chittenden allowance for loan losses methodology with that of Peoples United Financial. The provision for loan losses in 2007 reflects net loan charge offs of $9.3 million, partially offset by a $1.3 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average loans equaled 0.10% in both 2008 and 2007. 34 Table of Contents Business Segment Results Peoples United Financials operations are divided into three primary business segments that represent its core businesses, Commercial Banking, Retail Banking and Small Business, and Wealth Management. In addition, the Treasury area is responsible for managing Peoples United Financials securities portfolio, short term investments and securities resale agreements, wholesale borrowings, and the funding center. Business Segment Performance Summary Net Income Years ended December 31 (in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Commercial Banking $ 76.9 $ 94.9 $ 45.2 Retail Banking and Small Business 79.3 98.1 55.4 Wealth Management (2.0 ) 5.4 4.2 Total segments 154.2 198.4 104.8 Treasury (68.9 ) (63.6 ) (8.6 ) Other 15.9 3.0 54.5 Total Consolidated $ 101.2 $ 137.8 $ 150.7 Peoples United Financial uses an internal profitability reporting system to generate information by operating segment, which is based on a series of management estimates and allocations regarding funds transfer pricing (FTP), the provision for loan losses, non interest expense and income taxes. These estimates and allocations, some of which can be subjective in nature, are continually being reviewed and refined. Any changes in estimates and allocations that may affect the reported results of any business segment will not affect the consolidated financial position or results of operations of Peoples United Financial as a whole. FTP is used in the calculation of each operating segments net interest income, and measures the value of funds used in and provided by an operating segment. The difference between the interest income on earning assets and the interest expense on funding liabilities, and the corresponding FTP charge for interest income or credit for interest expense, results in net spread income. A five year rolling average net charge off rate is used as the basis for the provision for loan losses for the respective segment. Peoples United Financial allocates a majority of non interest expenses to each business segment using a full absorption costing process. Direct and indirect costs are analyzed and pooled by process and assigned to the appropriate business segment and corporate overhead costs are allocated to the business segments. Income tax expense is allocated to each business segment using a constant rate, based on an estimate of the consolidated effective income tax rate for the year. Total average assets and total average liabilities are reported for each business segment due to managements reliance, in part, on such average balances for purposes of assessing business segment performance. Prior year business segments results have been restated to conform to the current presentation, including reclassifications of (i) merchant services from the Commercial Banking segment to the Retail Banking and Small Business segment (effective in the fourth quarter of 2009) and (ii) corporate trust from the Commercial Banking segment to the Wealth Management segment (effective in the second quarter of 2009). For a more detailed description of the estimates and allocations used to measure business segment performance, see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 35 Table of Contents Commercial Banking consists principally of commercial lending, commercial real estate lending, indirect auto lending, and commercial deposit gathering activities. This segment also includes the equipment financing operations of PCLC, as well as cash management, correspondent banking and municipal banking. Years ended December 31 (in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net interest income $ 248.0 $ 266.5 $ 115.9 Provision for loan losses 22.0 18.7 10.3 Total non interest income 41.4 41.7 25.9 Total non interest expense 153.9 145.9 61.9 Income before income tax expense 113.5 143.6 69.6 Income tax expense 36.6 48.7 24.4 Income from continuing operations $ 76.9 $ 94.9 $ 45.2 Total average assets $ 9,846.0 $ 9,310.4 $ 4,151.0 Total average liabilities 2,423.2 2,397.3 757.3 Commercial Banking income from continuing operations decreased $18.0 million in 2009 compared to 2008, reflecting a decrease in net interest income and increases in the provision for loan losses and non interest expense. The $18.5 million decrease in net interest income in 2009 reflects the negative impact of interest rate cuts initiated by the Federal Reserve Board throughout 2008, partially offset by an increase in average earning assets. Total non interest income in 2009 includes $16.9 million of bank service charges, and reflects an increase in rental income resulting from the higher level of equipment leased to PCLC customers and a decrease in commercial loan fees. The $8.0 million increase in total non interest expense compared to 2008 reflects increased amortization expense on leased equipment, as well as higher direct and allocated support costs due to continued loan growth in Commercial Banking. The increase in total average assets in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily reflects increases of $388 million in commercial real estate loans and $185 million in PCLC loans, partially offset by an $80 million decrease in commercial loans. Commercial Banking income from continuing operations increased $49.7 million in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily as a result of the Chittenden acquisition. The increase in net interest income in 2008 primarily reflects the increase in earning assets and liabilities resulting from the Chittenden acquisition. Total non interest income in 2008 includes $16.1 million of bank service charges, and reflects a $2.8 million increase in rental income resulting from the higher level of equipment leased to PCLC customers. The increase in total non interest expense compared to 2007 reflects a $65.3 million increase in direct and allocated support costs primarily due to the Chittenden acquisition, as well as $8.9 million in amortization expense, reflecting additional amortization of the intangible assets resulting from the Chittenden acquisition. The increases in total average assets and total average liabilities in 2008 compared to 2007 are primarily due to the Chittenden acquisition. The total average commercial banking loan portfolio increased $4.6 billion in 2008, reflecting increases of $3.0 billion in commercial real estate loans (including organic growth of $209 million), $1.5 billion in commercial loans (including organic growth of $100 million) and $0.1 billion in PCLC loans. 36 Table of Contents Retail Banking and Small Business includes, as its principal business lines, consumer and small business deposit gathering activities, consumer lending (including residential mortgage and home equity), small business lending and merchant services. Years ended December 31 (in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net interest income $ 375.1 $ 397.8 $ 264.4 Provision for loan losses 4.8 5.5 3.6 Total non interest income 160.0 155.0 85.9 Total non interest expense 413.1 398.9 261.5 Income before income tax expense 117.2 148.4 85.2 Income tax expense 37.9 50.3 29.8 Income from continuing operations $ 79.3 $ 98.1 $ 55.4 Total average assets $ 5,874.0 $ 6,467.0 $ 4,978.7 Total average liabilities 12,557.1 12,123.3 8,219.3 Retail Banking and Small Business income from continuing operations decreased $18.8 million in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily reflecting a decrease in net interest income and an increase in non interest expense. The $22.7 million decrease in net interest income primarily reflects narrower spreads on deposit products resulting from the negative impact of interest rate cuts initiated by the Federal Reserve Board throughout 2008, and lower residential mortgage interest income, reflecting Peoples United Financials decision to sell essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. Total non interest income in 2009 includes $110.9 million of bank service charges, $24.9 million of merchant services income and $13.9 million of net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans. The increase in total non interest expense compared to 2008 primarily reflects an increase in direct expenses. In 2009, total average assets decreased $593 million compared to 2008, reflecting a $640 million decrease in residential mortgage loans, and total average liabilities increased $434 million reflecting a $422 million increase in average deposits. Retail Banking and Small Business income from continuing operations increased $42.7 million in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily as a result of the Chittenden acquisition. The increase in net interest income in 2008 primarily reflects the increase in earning assets and liabilities resulting from the Chittenden acquisition, partially offset by the decline in the net spread income on deposits. Total non interest income in 2008 includes $102.4 million of bank service charges, $27.6 million of merchant services income, $6.5 million of net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans and a $2.6 million gain on sale of mortgage servicing rights. The increase in total non interest expense compared to 2007 reflects an increase of $80.2 million in direct and allocated support costs primarily due to the Chittenden acquisition, as well as $23.9 million of merchant services expense, and $8.2 million in amortization expense, reflecting additional amortization of the intangible assets resulting from the Chittenden acquisition. The increases in total average assets and total average liabilities compared to 2007 are primarily due to the Chittenden acquisition. Average residential mortgage loans decreased $30 million compared to 2007. Excluding the effect of residential mortgage loans acquired in the Chittenden acquisition, average residential mortgage loans would have decreased $803 million, reflecting Peoples United Financials decision in the fourth quarter of 2006 to begin selling essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. Average consumer loans increased $790 million, including a $541 million increase in average home equity loans, primarily as a result of the Chittenden acquisition. 37 Table of Contents Wealth Management consists of trust services, corporate trust, brokerage, financial advisory services, investment management services and life insurance provided by Peoples Securities, other insurance services provided through R.C. Knox and Chittenden Insurance Group, and private banking. Years ended December 31 (in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net interest income (loss) $ 3.9 $ 4.4 $ (0.9 ) Provision for loan losses 0.1 0.1 Total non interest income 77.2 89.9 56.3 Total non interest expense 84.1 86.1 49.1 (Loss) income before income tax expense (3.1 ) 8.1 6.3 Income tax (benefit) expense (1.1 ) 2.7 2.1 (Loss) income from continuing operations $ (2.0 ) $ 5.4 $ 4.2 Total average assets $ 333.1 $ 298.7 $ 79.7 Total average liabilities 158.2 138.8 55.7 Wealth Managements net loss in 2009 compared to net income in 2008 reflects decreases in net interest income and non interest income, partially offset by a decrease in non interest expense. The decrease in non interest income in 2009 reflects decreases in investment management fees and brokerage commissions, primarily reflecting the uncertainty in the equity markets and broader economic weakness experienced throughout 2009, and a decline in insurance revenue, reflecting the continued soft insurance market resulting from the contracting economy. The decrease in non interest expense primarily reflects a decrease in allocated support costs, partially offset by certain nonrecurring costs in 2009. Assets managed and administered, which are not reported as assets of Peoples United Financial, totaled $16.1 billion at December 31, 2009 compared to $16.2 billion at December 31, 2008. Wealth Management income from continuing operations increased $1.2 million compared to 2007. The increase in net interest income in 2008 is primarily due to the private banking business acquired in connection with the Chittenden acquisition. Total non interest income in 2008 includes $33.5 million of insurance revenue and $33.3 million of investment management fees. The increase in total non interest expense compared to 2007 reflects increases of $26.8 million in direct and allocated support costs primarily due to the Chittenden acquisition, and $4.2 million in amortization expense, reflecting additional amortization of the intangible assets resulting from the Chittenden acquisition. The increases in total average assets and total average liabilities compared to 2007 are primarily due to the Chittenden acquisition. 38 Table of Contents Treasury encompasses the securities portfolio, short term investments and securities resale agreements, wholesale borrowings, and the funding center, which includes the impact of derivative financial instruments used for risk management purposes. The income or loss for the funding center represents the interest rate risk component of Peoples United Financials net interest income as calculated by its FTP model in deriving each business segments net interest income. Under this process, a money desk (the funding center) buys funds from liability generating business lines (such as consumer deposits) and sells funds to asset generating business lines (such as commercial lending). The price at which funds are bought and sold on any given day is set by Peoples United Financials treasury group and is based on the wholesale cost to Peoples United Financial of assets and liabilities with similar maturities. Liability generating businesses sell newly originated liabilities to the money desk and recognize a funding credit, while asset generating businesses buy funding for newly originated assets from the money desk and recognize a funding charge. Once funding for an asset is purchased from or a liability is sold to the money desk, the price that is set by the treasury group will remain with that asset or liability until it matures or reprices, which effectively transfers responsibility for managing interest rate risk to the treasury group. Years ended December 31 (in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net interest loss $ (127.0 ) $ (111.8 ) $ (29.8 ) Total non interest income 28.0 10.4 10.6 Total non interest expense 7.3 (0.7 ) (0.3 ) Loss before income tax benefit (106.3 ) (100.7 ) (18.9 ) Income tax benefit (37.4 ) (37.1 ) (10.3 ) Loss from continuing operations $ (68.9 ) $ (63.6 ) $ (8.6 ) Total average assets $ 3,957.6 $ 3,303.0 $ 2,890.6 Total average liabilities 90.7 181.6 74.4 The increase in Treasurys loss from continuing operations in 2009 compared to 2008 reflects increases in the net interest loss and non interest expense, partially offset by an increase in non interest income. The increase in net interest loss reflects a $27.4 million increase in the funding centers net spread loss, primarily due to the 400 basis point decline in the targeted federal funds rate during 2008 and the asset sensitive position of Peoples United Financials balance sheet. The increase in non interest income reflects revenues relating to derivative transactions entered into with commercial customers, in addition to net security gains of $16.6 million in 2009 (primarily resulting from the sale of residential mortgage backed securities with an amortized cost of $1.03 billion) compared to net security gains of $1.3 million in 2008. The increase in non interest expense in 2009 reflects costs related to derivative transactions entered into with commercial customers. Treasurys loss from continuing operations in 2008 compared to 2007 reflects an $89.0 million increase in net interest loss. The increase in net interest loss in 2008 primarily reflects a $127.1 million increase in the funding centers net spread loss, which is due to the acquisition of Chittenden, the 400 basis points decline in the targeted federal funds rate from December 2007 to December 2008, and the asset sensitive position of Peoples United Financials balance sheet. Total average assets increased $655 million in 2009 compared to 2008. Average short term investments and securities resale agreements increased $551 million, and average securities decreased $75 million. 39 Table of Contents Other includes the residual financial impact from the allocation of revenues and expenses (including the provision for loan losses) and certain revenues and expenses not attributable to a particular segment, and the FTP impact from excess capital. This category also includes: certain nonrecurring items, including a $5.6 million gain related to the sale of the companys remaining holdings of Visa Class B shares (included in total non interest income for the year ended December 31, 2009), $4.5 million of system conversion and merger related expenses as well as $4.4 million of benefit related and other charges (both included in total non interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2009), $6.9 million of gains related to the Visa IPO and a $1.4 million gain on sale of two branches (both included in total non interest income for the year ended December 31, 2008), $51.3 million of merger related expenses and other one time charges, and a $0.8 million loss on sale of certain non branch properties (both included in total non interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2008), $5.4 million of security gains related to the sale of Peoples United Financials entire holdings of MasterCard Incorporated Class B Common Stock (included in non interest income for the year ended December 31, 2007) and the $60.0 million contribution to The Peoples United Community Foundation (included in non interest expense for the year December 31, 2007); income from discontinued operations; and certain income tax benefits. Included in Other are assets such as cash, premises and equipment, and other assets, including pension assets.

Net Interest Margin Years ended December 31 (percent) Net Interest Income FTE Years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) In response to the significant disruptions in the capital markets brought about by the sub prime mortgage crisis and its after effects, turmoil in the financial sector, and the contracting U.S. economy, the Federal Reserve Board lowered the targeted federal funds rate ten times since September 2007, and established a target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to 0.25 percent as of December 16, 2008, which did not change throughout 2009. Given the asset sensitive position of Peoples United Financials balance sheet, including the temporary investment of a portion of the companys significant excess capital position in low yielding short term investments, and the increase in average deposits, there was margin compression in the net interest margin in 2008 and 2009. 2009 Compared to 2008 The net interest margin declined 43 basis points to 3.19% compared to 2008. The lower net interest margin continues to reflect the dramatic actions taken by the Federal Reserve Board and the companys asset sensitive balance sheet, including its significant excess capital position, a portion of which continues to be invested in 41 Table of Contents low yielding short term investments and securities resale agreements. Net interest income (FTE basis) decreased $60.1 million, reflecting a $150.9 million decrease in total interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $90.8 million decrease in total interest expense. Average earning assets totaled $18.2 billion in 2009, a $535 million increase from 2008, reflecting increases in average short term investments and securities resale agreements of $551 million and average loans of $59 million, partially offset by a decrease in average securities of $75 million. Average loans, average securities, and average short term investments and securities resale agreements comprised 79%, 5% and 16%, respectively, of average earning assets in 2009 compared to 82%, 6% and 12%, respectively, in 2008. In 2009, the yield earned on the total loan portfolio was 5.05% and the yield earned on securities, short term investments and securities resale agreements was 1.06%, compared to 5.80% and 2.61%, respectively, in 2008. Excluding adjustable rate residential mortgage loans, which are mostly of the hybrid variety, approximately 44% of the loan portfolio has floating interest rates at December 31, 2009 compared to approximately 42% at the end of 2008. The total average commercial banking loan portfolio increased $493 million, reflecting increases of $388 million in average commercial real estate loans and $185 million in average equipment financing loans, partially offset by an $80 million decrease in average commercial loans. Excluding shared national credits, which Peoples United Financial is in the process of unwinding in an orderly manner over the next two to three years, average commercial banking loans would have increased $577 million in 2009 compared to 2008. At December 31, 2009, the shared national credits loan portfolio totaled $567 million (4.0% of total loans) compared to $684 million (4.7% of total loans) at December 31, 2008. Average residential mortgage loans decreased $640 million compared to 2008, reflecting Peoples United Financials decision to sell essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. As a result, residential mortgage loan balances are expected to continue to decline in the future until Peoples United Financial resumes adding such loans to its portfolio to an extent that more than offsets repayments. Average consumer loans increased $206 million, including a $202 million increase in average home equity loans. Average funding liabilities totaled $15.2 billion in 2009, a $431 million increase compared to 2008, primarily reflecting a $422 million increase in average deposits. Average non interest bearing deposits and average savings and money market deposits increased $73 million and $507 million, respectively, and average time deposits decreased $158 million. The decline in average time deposits is a result of the historically low interest rate environment and Peoples United Financials conscious decision to maintain disciplined pricing on such products, the combined effect of which is discussed further below. Average deposits comprised 98% of average funding liabilities in both 2009 and 2008. The 65 basis point decrease to 1.25% from 1.90% in the rate paid on average funding liabilities in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily reflects the decrease in market interest rates and the shift in deposit mix. The rates paid on average deposits decreased 65 basis points in 2009, reflecting decreases of 106 basis points in time deposits and 55 basis points in savings and money market deposits. Average savings and money market deposits and average time deposits comprised 45% and 33%, respectively, of average total deposits in 2009 compared to 43% and 35%, respectively, in 2008. 2008 Compared to 2007 The net interest margin declined 50 basis points to 3.62% compared to 2007. The lower net interest margin reflects the dramatic actions taken by the Federal Reserve Board during 2007 and 2008 and the companys asset sensitive balance sheet, including its significant excess capital position, a portion of which was invested in low yielding short term investments and securities resale agreements. Net interest income increased $153.7 million, reflecting a $214.1 million increase in total interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $60.4 million increase in total interest expense. 42 Table of Contents Average earning assets totaled $17.7 billion in 2008, a $5.9 billion increase from 2007. Average loans increased $5.3 billion and average securities increased $1.0 billion, primarily as a result of the Chittenden acquisition, while average short term investments and securities resale agreements decreased $0.4 billion. As a result, average loans, average securities, and average short term investments and securities resale agreements comprised 82%, 6% and 12%, respectively, of average earning assets in 2008 compared to 77%, 1% and 22%, respectively, in 2007. The yield earned on the total loan portfolio was 5.80% and the yield earned on securities, short term investments and securities resale agreements was 2.61%, compared to 6.27% and 5.07%, respectively, in 2007. Excluding adjustable rate residential mortgage loans, which are mostly of the hybrid variety, approximately 42% of the loan portfolio had floating interest rates at December 31, 2008 compared to approximately 31% at the end of 2007. The total average commercial banking loan portfolio increased $4.6 billion, reflecting increases of $3.0 billion in commercial real estate loans, $1.5 billion in commercial loans and $0.1 billion in equipment financing loans. Average residential mortgage loans decreased $30 million compared to 2007. Excluding the effect of residential mortgage loans acquired in the Chittenden acquisition, average residential mortgage loans would have decreased $803 million, reflecting Peoples United Financials decision in the fourth quarter of 2006 to begin selling essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. As a result, residential mortgage loan balances are expected to continue to decline in the future until Peoples United Financial resumes adding such loans to its portfolio to an extent that more than offsets repayments. Average consumer loans increased $790 million, including a $541 million increase in average home equity loans, primarily as a result of the Chittenden acquisition. Average funding liabilities totaled $14.8 billion in 2008, a $5.8 billion increase compared to 2007. Average deposits increased $5.5 billion primarily due to the deposits acquired in the Chittenden acquisition. Average non interest bearing deposits increased $1.0 billion and average interest bearing deposits increased $4.5 billion. Average deposits comprised 98% of average funding liabilities in 2008 compared to 99% in the year ago period. During the second quarter of 2008, $234 million of trust money market deposits were placed with an outside investment manager, thereby removing certain average earning assets and average funding liabilities that were generating only marginal net interest income while at the same time adding fee income. The 55 basis point decrease to 1.90% from 2.45% in the rate paid on average funding liabilities in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily reflects the decrease in market interest rates and the shift in deposit mix. The rates paid on average deposits decreased 58 basis points in 2008, reflecting decreases of 98 basis points in time deposits and 22 basis points in savings and money market deposits. Average savings and money market deposits and average time deposits comprised 43% and 35%, respectively, of average deposits in 2008 compared to 36% and 41%, respectively, in 2007. The increases in average borrowings and average subordinated notes in 2008 are a result of the Chittenden acquisition. Average Balance Sheet, Interest and Yield/Rate Analysis The table on the following page presents average balance sheets, interest income, interest expense and the corresponding average yields earned and rates paid for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. The average balances are principally daily averages and, for loans, include both performing and non performing balances. Interest income on loans includes the effect of deferred loan fees and costs accounted for as yield adjustments, but does not include interest on loans for which Peoples United Financial has ceased to accrue interest. Premium amortization and discount accretion (including amounts attributable to purchase accounting adjustments) are also included in the respective interest income and interest expense amounts. The impact of Peoples United Financials use of derivative instruments in managing interest rate risk is also reflected in the table, classified according to the instrument hedged and the related risk management objective. 43 Table of Contents Average Balance Sheet, Interest and Yield/Rate Analysis 2009 2008 2007 Years ended December 31(dollars in millions) AverageBalance Interest Yield/Rate AverageBalance Interest Yield/Rate AverageBalance Interest Yield/Rate Assets: Short term investments $ 2,386.5 $ 6.5 0.27 % $ 1,946.7 $ 46.9 2.41 % $ 1,709.4 $ 86.7 5.07 % Securities purchase under agreements to resell 421.1 0.8 0.19 310.2 7.5 2.43 959.1 48.3 5.03 Securities (1) 934.2 32.4 3.47 1,009.1 30.8 3.05 69.2 3.9 5.62 Loans: Commercial real estate 5,208.5 287.8 5.52 4,820.8 302.1 6.27 1,807.3 127.7 7.07 Commercial 4,116.7 202.3 4.91 4,011.1 233.0 5.81 2,441.5 167.6 6.86 Residential mortgage 2,880.1 145.0 5.04 3,519.9 189.9 5.40 3,550.3 183.9 5.18 Consumer 2,264.4 95.4 4.21 2,058.4 110.9 5.39 1,268.9 88.9 7.01 Total loans 14,469.7 730.5 5.05 14,410.2 835.9 5.80 9,068.0 568.1 6.27 Total earning assets 18,211.5 $ 770.2 4.23 % 17,676.2 $ 921.1 5.21 % 11,805.7 $ 707.0 5.99 % Other assets 2,546.0 2,696.8 945.6 Total assets $ 20,757.5 $ 20,373.0 $ 12,751.3 Liabilities and stockholders equity: Deposits: Non interest bearing deposits $ 3,210.8 $ % $ 3,137.9 $ % $ 2,111.4 $ % Savings, interest bearing checking and money market 6,710.6 48.2 0.72 6,203.9 78.5 1.27 3,186.3 47.5 1.49 Time 4,966.9 125.2 2.52 5,125.0 183.6 3.58 3,639.0 166.1 4.56 Total deposits 14,888.3 173.4 1.16 14,466.8 262.1 1.81 8,936.7 213.6 2.39 Borrowings: Repurchase agreements 151.2 0.7 0.46 123.0 2.1 1.72 FHLB advances 14.8 0.8 5.28 16.2 0.8 5.16 0.1 5.04 Federal funds purchased/other 2.1 1.92 19.1 0.6 3.01 3.3 0.2 5.23 Total borrowings 168.1 1.5 0.90 158.3 3.5 2.23 3.4 0.2 5.23 Subordinated notes 181.2 15.1 8.35 181.4 15.2 8.34 65.3 6.6 10.15 Total funding liabilities 15,237.6 $ 190.0 1.25 % 14,806.5 $ 280.8 1.90 % 9,005.4 $ 220.4 2.45 % Other liabilities 378.5 353.9 168.9 Total liabilities 15,616.1 15,160.4 9,174.3 Stockholders equity 5,141.4 5,212.6 3,577.0 Total liabilities and stockholders equity $ 20,757.5 $ 20,373.0 $ 12,751.3 Net interest income/spread(2) $ 580.2 2.98 % $ 640.3 3.31 % $ 486.6 3.54 % Net interest margin 3.19 % 3.62 % 4.12 % (1) Average balances and yields for securities available for sale are based on amortized cost.

For each category of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, information is provided relating to: changes in volume (changes in average balances multiplied by the prior years average interest rate); changes in rates (changes in average interest rates multiplied by the prior years average balance); and the total change. Changes attributable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately. 2009 Compared to 2008Increase (Decrease) 2008 Compared to 2007Increase (Decrease) (in millions) Volume Rate Total Volume Rate Total Interest and dividend income: Short term investments $ 8.7 $ (49.1 ) $ (40.4 ) $ 10.7 $ (50.5 ) $ (39.8 ) Securities purchased under agreements to resell 2.0 (8.7 ) (6.7 ) (23.1 ) (17.7 ) (40.8 ) Securities (2.4 ) 4.0 1.6 29.5 (2.6 ) 26.9 Loans: Commercial real estate 23.1 (37.4 ) (14.3 ) 190.4 (16.0 ) 174.4 Commercial 6.0 (36.7 ) (30.7 ) 94.4 (29.0 ) 65.4 Residential mortgage (32.8 ) (12.1 ) (44.9 ) (1.6 ) 7.6 6.0 Consumer 10.3 (25.8 ) (15.5 ) 46.0 (24.0 ) 22.0 Total loans 6.6 (112.0 ) (105.4 ) 329.2 (61.4 ) 267.8 Total change in interest and dividend income 14.9 (165.8 ) (150.9 ) 346.3 (132.2 ) 214.1 Interest expense: Deposits: Savings, interest bearing checking andmoney market 6.0 (36.3 ) (30.3 ) 39.1 (8.1 ) 31.0 Time (5.5 ) (52.9 ) (58.4 ) 58.3 (40.8 ) 17.5 Total deposits 0.5 (89.2 ) (88.7 ) 97.4 (48.9 ) 48.5 Borrowings: Repurchase agreements 0.4 (1.8 ) (1.4 ) 2.1 2.1 FHLB advances (0.1 ) 0.1 0.8 0.8 Federal funds purchased/other (0.4 ) (0.2 ) (0.6 ) 0.5 (0.1 ) 0.4 Total borrowings (0.1 ) (1.9 ) (2.0 ) 3.4 (0.1 ) 3.3 Subordinated notes (0.1 ) (0.1 ) 9.9 (1.3 ) 8.6 Total change in interest expense 0.3 (91.1 ) (90.8 ) 110.7 (50.3 ) 60.4 Change in net interest income $ 14.6 $ (74.7 ) $ (60.1 ) $ 235.6 $ (81.9 ) $ 153.7 45 Table of Contents The following table provides the weighted average yields earned and rates paid for each major category of earning assets and funding liabilities as of December 31, 2009.

The declines in investment management fees and brokerage commissions primarily reflect the uncertainty in the equity markets and broader economic weakness experienced throughout 2009. The decrease in insurance revenue primarily reflects the continued soft insurance market resulting from the contracting economy. 46 Table of Contents In 2009, Peoples United Financial sold residential mortgage backed securities with an amortized cost of $1.03 billion and recorded security gains totaling $16.9 million. Proceeds from sales transactions occurring during 2009 were subsequently reinvested in residential mortgage backed securities with substantially equivalent maturities and yields. This investment portfolio repositioning was undertaken to mitigate prepayment risk. Net security gains in 2009 also include a gain of $5.6 million resulting from the sale of Peoples United Financials remaining Class B Visa shares that are described below. In 2008, Peoples United Financial recorded a gain of $5.6 million resulting from the mandatory redemption of a portion of its Class B Visa, Inc. shares as part of Visas IPO. Peoples United Financial obtained its ownership in Visa shares as a result of its acquisition of Chittenden, which was a Visa member. In addition, Peoples United Financial recorded a gain of $1.3 million representing its proportionate share of the litigation reserve escrow account established by Visa in conjunction with its IPO. Securities gains in 2009 include a gain of $5.6 million resulting from the sale of Peoples United Financials remaining Class B Visa shares. The foregoing Visa gains are included in equity securities gains in the above table. Securities gains in 2008 also include gains of $1.5 million resulting from the sale of securities acquired in the Chittenden acquisition as a result of changes in market interest rates subsequent to January 1, 2008. The fluctuation in payment processing volume is the primary driver for the variances in merchant services income. The increase in net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans reflects the higher level of residential mortgage loan sales (a 97% increase in volume from 2008) due to an increase in refinancing activity given the historically low interest rate environment. BOLI income totaled $8.4 million ($12.8 million on a taxable equivalent basis) in 2009, compared to $8.3 million ($12.8 million on a taxable equivalent basis) in 2008. Other non interest income decreased $2.6 million compared to 2008, reflecting lower commercial loan fees and mortgage servicing income in 2009, partially offset by a $3.7 million increase in rental income resulting from a higher level of equipment leased to PCLC customers. In addition, other non interest income in 2008 includes gains totaling $4.0 million recorded in connection with the sale of (i) mortgage servicing rights and (ii) two branches located in northern New England. Total non interest income increased $118.2 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to the effect of the Chittenden acquisition, including increases of $33.7 million in total wealth management income, $34.6 million in bank service charges and $27.6 million in merchant services income. Net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans increased $3.5 million compared to 2007, reflecting an increase in residential mortgage originations and corresponding sales in 2008 primarily due to the Chittenden acquisition. BOLI income totaled $8.3 million ($12.8 million on a taxable equivalent basis), compared to $10.5 million ($16.2 million on a taxable equivalent basis) in 2007. The $2.2 million decrease primarily reflects the lower interest rate environment in 2008, and death benefits received totaling $0.5 million in 2008 compared to $1.1 million in 2007. The increase in other non interest income compared to 2007 reflects the effect of the Chittenden acquisition, including $3.5 million in payroll services income and $1.6 million mortgage servicing income, as well as a $2.8 million increase in rental income resulting from the higher level of equipment leased to PCLC customers and higher commercial loan fees, and $4.0 million of gains described above. 47 Table of Contents Non Interest Expense PercentageIncrease (Decrease) Years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 2009/2008 2008/2007 Compensation and benefits $ 350.5 $ 344.6 $ 215.6 1.7 % 59.8 % Occupancy and equipment 109.8 110.3 67.1 (0.5 ) 64.4 Professional and outside service fees 44.0 48.0 28.8 (8.3 ) 66.7 Merchant services expense 21.0 23.9 (12.1 ) n/m Other non interest expense: Advertising and promotion 14.1 15.2 12.1 (7.2 ) 25.6 Stationery, printing and postage 12.3 13.0 7.9 (5.4 ) 64.6 Amortization of other acquisition related intangibles 20.6 21.3 1.0 (3.3 ) n/m Other 110.3 96.2 46.8 14.7 105.6 Total other non interest expense 157.3 145.7 67.8 8.0 114.9 Total 682.6 672.5 379.3 1.5 77.3 Merger related expenses 2.0 36.5 n/m n/m Contribution to The Peoples United Community Foundation 60.0 n/m n/m Total non interest expense $ 684.6 $ 709.0 $ 439.3 (3.4 )% 61.4 % Efficiency ratio 73.5 % 66.6 % 56.1 % n/m not meaningful Total non interest expense in 2009 increased $10.1 million compared to 2008, excluding the effect of merger related expenses recorded in both years. Merger related expenses in 2008 consisted of asset impairment charges of $19.3 million (principally to write off certain capitalized costs), costs relating to severance and branch closings of $10.5 million and other accrued liabilities of $6.7 million. Included in total non interest expense in 2009 are $2.5 million of system conversion costs. Such costs are expected to total approximately $15 million in 2010. Increases in the efficiency ratio in 2009 and 2008 reflect the decline in interest rates that negatively impacted net interest income (see Non GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation to GAAP). The increase in compensation and benefits compared to 2008 primarily reflects normal merit increases, higher benefits related and stock based compensation costs, partially offset by previously disclosed cost savings initiatives. The fluctuation in payroll processing volume is the primary driver for the decline in merchant services expense. Other non interest expense in 2009 increased $14.1 million compared to 2008, reflecting increases in regulatory assessment expense and amortization expense for leased equipment as well as $4.4 million of benefit related and other one time charges recorded in the first quarter of 2009. The FDIC authorized higher premium assessments for 2009 pursuant to a restoration plan designed to increase the DIF reserve ratio to required levels. Under the FDICs restoration plan, the premium assessment rate was raised uniformly by seven basis points beginning on January 1, 2009 resulting in an initial base assessment rate of 12 basis points for Peoples United Bank. Furthermore, the premium assessment rate in effect beginning April 1, 2009 is subject to adjustments that are based on each institutions risk profile and may affect its initial base assessment rate. On May 22, 2009, the FDIC adopted a final rule that imposed a special assessment of 5 basis points on each insured financial institutions total assets less Tier 1 capital as of June 30, 2009. As a result, included in other non interest expense in 2009 is an FDIC special assessment charge of $8.4 million. 48 Table of Contents On September 29, 2009, the FDIC adopted a plan that extended the DIF restoration plan from seven years to eight years and on November 12, 2009, the FDIC adopted a final rule that amended the assessment regulations to require insured financial institutions to prepay, on December 30, 2009, their estimated deposit insurance premiums for 2010, 2011 and 2012. This rule, which did not include any additional special assessments, assumes a 5% annual growth rate in each institutions insured deposits (the assessment base) and increases each institutions premium assessment rate by three basis points beginning in 2011. As such, regulatory assessment expense may continue to increase in 2010 and beyond. Total non interest expense in 2008 increased $293.2 million compared to 2007, excluding the effect of $36.5 million of merger related expenses recorded in 2008 and the $60.0 million contribution to The Peoples United Community Foundation in 2007, primarily due to the effect of the Chittenden acquisition. The increase in compensation and benefits compared to 2007 primarily reflects the additional Chittenden employees, as well as normal merit increases, higher benefits related costs and $12.0 million of expense related to the 2007 Recognition and Retention Plan and the 2007 Stock Option Plan. Increases in occupancy and equipment, professional and outside services, and stationery, printing and postage compared to 2007 primarily reflect the effect of the Chittenden acquisition. Merchant services expense relates to the merchant payment processing operation acquired in connection with the Chittenden acquisition. The increase in amortization of other acquisition related intangibles in 2008 reflects additional amortization of the intangible assets resulting from the Chittenden acquisition. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of the acquisition. Included in other non interest expense in 2008 are: (i) one time charges of $11.5 million, including benefit related and other costs associated with the death of Peoples United Financials former President; (ii) a charge of $2.0 million related to the vesting of outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards upon the dissolution of Peoples United Financials Advisory Board; and (iii) a loss of $0.8 million on the sale of a portion of the companys non branch properties located in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Discontinued Operations Peoples United Financial continues to generate recoveries from collection efforts on previously charged off credit card accounts that were not included in the sale of the credit card business in March 2004. Recoveries, net of collection costs, totaled $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Recoveries occurring subsequent to the sale and through December 31, 2007 were included in income from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Effective January 1, 2008, income from discontinued operations is no longer disclosed separately in the Consolidated Statements of Income as the level of recoveries continues to decline due to the aging and diminishing pool of charged off accounts. Income Taxes Income tax expense from continuing operations totaled $43.1 million, $67.0 million and $75.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Income tax benefits of $2.0 million and $1.1 million are included in income tax expense from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively (none in 2007). The benefit in 2009 stems from a reduction in the combined state income tax rate following the charter consolidations of the former Chittenden banks while the benefit in 2008 relates to the recognition of a non taxable BOLI death benefit and completion of a federal income tax audit. 49 Table of Contents Excluding these benefits from the respective years, Peoples United Financials effective income tax rate from continuing operations would have been 31.3%, 33.3% and 33.6% for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Peoples United Financials effective income tax rate is expected to increase slightly in 2010 due to a higher level of non deductible expenses and an increase in state income tax liabilities associated with the companys expanded geographic franchise. Income tax expense for all three years reflects the state tax benefit resulting from the formation of Peoples Mortgage Investment Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Peoples United Bank. The formation of this subsidiary was a result of Connecticut tax legislation, which became effective on January 1, 1999, that allows for the transfer of mortgage loans to a passive investment subsidiary. The related earnings of the subsidiary, and any dividends it pays to the parent, are not subject to Connecticut income tax. In connection with the acquisition of Chittenden, Peoples United Financial acquired $25 million of limited partnership investments to develop and operate affordable housing units for lower income tenants throughout New England. The cost of these investments is amortized on a straight line basis over the period during which the related federal income tax credits are realized (generally ten years). These credits totaled $4.2 million and $4.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Peoples United Financials management believes that, other than for transitional deployment of excess deposits or excess equity, a large securities portfolio funded with wholesale borrowings provides limited economic value. 50 Table of Contents Peoples United Financial has historically utilized the securities portfolio for earnings generation (in the form of interest and dividend income), liquidity, interest rate risk management, asset diversification and tax planning. Securities available for sale are used as part of Peoples United Financials asset/liability management strategy and may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, factors such as changes in market conditions and interest rates, changes in security prepayment rates, liquidity considerations and regulatory capital requirements. Peoples United Financial invests in debt securities rated in the highest category assigned by a nationally recognized statistical ratings organization. Management has internal guidelines for the credit quality and duration of Peoples United Financials debt securities portfolio and monitors these on a regular basis. In 2009, Peoples United Financial sold residential mortgage backed securities with an amortized cost of $1.03 billion and recorded security gains totaling $16.9 million. Proceeds from sales occurring during 2009 were subsequently reinvested in residential mortgage backed securities with substantially equivalent maturities and yields. This investment portfolio repositioning was undertaken to mitigate prepayment risk. At December 31, 2009, Peoples United Financials securities portfolio totaled $0.9 billion, or 4% of total assets, and had no wholesale borrowings, which represent positions well below industry averages. At December 31, 2009, the book value exceeded the fair value of the securities available for sale portfolio by $1.7 million. At December 31, 2008, the fair value exceeded the book value of the securities available for sale portfolio by $5.1 million, while at December 31, 2007, the book value and the fair value of the securities available for sale portfolio were approximately equivalent. All unrealized gains and those unrealized losses representing temporary declines in value due to factors other than credit are recorded in stockholders equity, net of income taxes. As a result, management anticipates continued fluctuations in stockholders equity due to changes in the fair value of these securities, albeit on a relatively small scale due to the size and duration of the portfolio. The increase in debt securities available for sale in 2008 compared to 2007 reflects (i) managements decision to invest in government sponsored enterprise (GSE) debt securities with maturities ranging from 91 to 180 days as an alternative to overnight federal funds sold, and (ii) the purchase of U.S. agency (GNMA) and GSE mortgage backed securities late in the fourth quarter of 2008 to provide the optimal balance of credit risk (none for GNMA securities), yield and duration. The duration of the debt securities portfolio was approximately 4.0 years at December 31, 2009 compared to 0.4 years at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, short term investments included $12.0 million and $110.0 million, respectively, of GSE debt securities with maturities of 90 days or less. Given the short duration of these securities, they are held to maturity and carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Lending Activities Peoples United Financial conducts its lending activities through its Commercial Banking, Retail Banking and Small Business, and Wealth Management business segments. Peoples United Financials lending activities consist of originating loans secured by residential and commercial properties, and extending secured and unsecured loans to consumer and commercial customers. Total loans decreased $332 million in 2009 compared to 2008 after increasing $5.6 billion in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase in 2008 is primarily due to $5.7 billion in loans acquired in the Chittenden acquisition. The $598 million decrease in residential mortgage loans in 2009 compared to 2008 reflects Peoples United Banks decision to sell essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans due to the low spreads on such loans in the current interest rate environment. 51 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the loan portfolio.

Shared national credits are included in the commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending portfolios. In January 2008, Peoples United Financial announced its decision to unwind its shared national credits portfolio in an orderly manner over the next two to three years.

Included in commercial real estate loans are shared national credits totaling $270 million and $290 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Peoples United Financials highest loan concentration in the commercial real estate loan portfolio was in the retail sector, which represented 26% and 24% of this loan portfolio at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Commercial Real Estate Portfolio As of December 31 (dollars in millions) At December 31, 2009 and 2008, approximately 29% of Peoples United Financials commercial real estate portfolio was secured by properties located in Connecticut. In addition, approximately 44% and 47% of the commercial real estate portfolio was secured by properties located in Massachusetts, Vermont and New Hampshire at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. No other state exposure was greater than 9%. Included in the commercial real estate portfolio are construction loans totaling $812 million and $902 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 53 Table of Contents Commercial real estate is dependent on the successful operation of the related income producing real estate. Accordingly, the income streams generated by this portfolio can be impacted by changes in the real estate market and, to a large extent, New Englands economy. In 2009, the commercial real estate portfolio (excluding shared national credits) increased $452 million compared to 2008, after increasing $3.1 billion in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase in the commercial real estate portfolio in 2008 reflects the Chittenden acquisition, as well as organic growth of $285 million, or 15%, in the commercial real estate loan portfolio. Peoples United Financial continues to focus on maintaining strong asset quality standards in a competitive market generally characterized by aggressive pricing and less attractive underwriting terms. The growth and performance of this portfolio is largely dependent on the economic environment and may be adversely impacted if the economy continues to slow in 2010. Commercial Real Estate Diversification As of December 31, 2009 (percent) Commercial and Industrial Lending As of December 31 (in millions) 2009 2008 Industry: Finance, insurance and real estate $ 609.7 $ 618.3 Service 595.0 571.4 Manufacturing 514.5 633.3 Wholesale distribution 244.4 289.5 Retail sales 192.7 195.0 Health services 181.7 169.3 Construction 128.2 130.2 Public administration 85.3 107.8 Transportation/utility 77.8 77.7 Arts/entertainment/recreation 67.3 65.3 Agriculture 31.0 33.6 Other 78.1 108.1 Total commercial and industrial lending $ 2,805.7 $ 2,999.5 Peoples United Financial provides diversified products and services to its commercial customers, including short term working capital credit facilities, term financing, asset based loans, letters of credit, cash management services and commercial deposit accounts. Commercial products are generally packaged together to create a financing solution specifically tailored to the needs of the customer. Taking a total relationship focused approach with commercial customers to meet their financing needs has resulted in substantial growth in non interest bearing deposits over time, as well as in opportunities to provide other banking services to principals and employees of these commercial customers. 54 Table of Contents The borrowers ability to repay a commercial loan is closely tied to the ongoing profitability and cash flow of the borrowers business. Consequently, a commercial loan tends to be more directly impacted by changes in economic cycles that affect businesses generally and the borrowers business specifically. The availability of adequate collateral is a factor in commercial loan decisions, and loans are generally collateralized and or guaranteed by third parties. The commercial and industrial lending portfolio (excluding shared national credits) decreased $97 million compared to 2008 and increased $1.4 billion in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase in the commercial and industrial lending portfolio in 2008 reflects the Chittenden acquisition, as well as organic growth of $102 million, or 6%, in the commercial and industrial lending portfolio. Included in commercial lending are shared national credits totaling $297 million and $394 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2009, approximately 42% of the commercial and industrial loan portfolio consisted of loans to Connecticut based businesses, compared to approximately 39% at December 31, 2008. Commercial and industrial loan exposure in the states of Vermont, Massachusetts and New Hampshire totaled approximately 37% at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. No other state exposure was greater than 6%. While Peoples United Financial continues to focus on asset quality, the performance of the commercial lending and industrial portfolio may be adversely impacted if the economy continues to slow in 2010. Commercial and Industrial Lending Diversification As of December 31, 2009 (percent) Commercial and Industrial Lending Portfolio As of December 31 (dollars in millions) 55 Table of Contents Shared National Credits At December 31, 2009, the shared national credits loan portfolio totaled $567 million compared to $684 million at December 31, 2008, and represented 6% and 7% of the total Commercial Banking loan portfolio at the respective dates. As discussed above, included in the shared national credits portfolio at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were commercial loans totaling $297 million and $394 million, respectively, and commercial real estate loans totaling $270 million and $290 million, respectively. In January 2008, Peoples United Financial announced its decision to unwind its shared national credits portfolio in an orderly manner over the next two to three years. At December 31, 2009, the shared national credits loan portfolio consisted only of loans purchased from other financial institutions. At December 31, 2009, approximately $45 million, or 8%, of this loan portfolio consisted of borrowers who are headquartered in Connecticut, while approximately $266 million, or 46%, consisted of borrowers located in New York, Washington and California. No other state exposure was greater than 8%. PCLC As of December 31 (in millions) 2009 2008 Industry: Printing $ 407.1 $ 415.4 Transportation/utility 355.8 339.5 General manufacturing 170.9 166.1 Retail sales 128.4 135.6 Packaging 88.0 87.3 Service 37.8 33.8 Health services 24.6 25.5 Wholesale distribution 24.2 23.7 Total PCLC $ 1,236.8 $ 1,226.9 PCLC provides equipment financing for customers in 47 states, specializing in financing for the printing, transportation/utility, general manufacturing, retail sales and packaging industries. PCLC will buy or sell portions of financing transactions in the secondary market to manage the concentration risk of the overall portfolio. At December 31, 2009, approximately 33% of the portfolio consisted of loans to customers located in California, Texas and Florida. No other state exposure was greater than 5%. The PCLC portfolio increased $10 million in 2009 compared to 2008, after increasing $245 million, or 25%, in 2008, and $112 million, or 13%, in 2007, reflecting managements decision at that time to grow this portfolio. Operating on a national scale, PCLC represented 13% of the Commercial Banking loan portfolio at December 31, 2009 and 2008. While Peoples United Financial continues to focus on asset quality, the performance of the equipment financing portfolio may be adversely impacted if the economy continues to slow in 2010. 56 Table of Contents PCLC Diversification As of December 31, 2009 (percent) PCLC Loan Portfolio As of December 31 (dollars in millions) The following table sets forth the contractual maturity (based on final payment date) and interest rate sensitivity (based on next repricing date) of Peoples United Financials construction loans and commercial and industrial loans: As of December 31, 2009 (in millions) One Yearor Less After OneYearThroughFiveYears After FiveYears Total Contractual maturity: Construction loans: Residential mortgage $ 50.2 $ 10.4 $ 4.8 $ 65.4 Commercial real estate 371.9 256.4 184.1 812.4 Commercial and industrial loans 859.3 1,010.0 936.4 2,805.7 Total $ 1,281.4 $ 1,276.8 $ 1,125.3 $ 3,683.5 Interest rate sensitivity: Predetermined rates $ 404.3 $ 532.4 $ 226.3 $ 1,163.0 Variable rates 2,265.8 221.5 33.2 2,520.5 Total $ 2,670.1 $ 753.9 $ 259.5 $ 3,683.5 57 Table of Contents Residential Mortgage Lending Peoples United Financial offers its customers a wide range of residential mortgage loan products. These include conventional fixed rate loans, jumbo fixed rate loans (loans with principal balances greater than established Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae limits), adjustable rate loans, sometimes referred to as ARM loans, interest only loans (loans where payments made by the borrower consist of only interest for a set period of time, before the payments change to principal and interest), as well as Federal Housing Authority insured loans and various state housing finance authority loans. Peoples United Financial originates these loans through its network of branches and calling officers. Previously, Peoples United Financial also originated loans in the wholesale market, which accounted for approximately 5% and 21% of its mortgage loan originations for 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decline in wholesale originations in 2008 reflects Peoples United Financials decision in April 2008 to discontinue using the wholesale market as a source for originating residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, approximately 96% of the residential mortgage loan portfolio was secured by properties located in New England. Included in residential mortgage loans are construction loans totaling $65 million and $97 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In 2009, Peoples United Financials residential mortgage originations totaled $1.3 billion, compared to $692 million in 2008 and $431 million in 2007. The $648 million increase in loan originations compared to 2008 is primarily due to the low interest rate environment in 2009. The mix and volume of residential mortgage loan originations vary in response to changes in market interest rates and customer preferences. Adjustable rate loans accounted for 13% of total residential mortgage originations in 2009, compared to 22% and 27% for 2008 and 2007, respectively. At December 31, 2009, the residential mortgage loan portfolio included $1.0 billion of interest only loans of which $113 million are stated income loans, compared to $1.4 billion and $135 million respectively, at December 31, 2008. Peoples United Financial began originating interest only residential mortgage loans in March 2003. The underwriting guidelines and requirements for such loans are generally more restrictive than those applied to other types of residential mortgage loans. In general, Peoples United Financials underwriting guidelines for residential mortgage loans require the following: (i) properties must be single family and owner occupied primary residences; (ii) lower loan to value ratios (less than 60% on average); (iii) higher credit scores (greater than 700 on average); and (iv) sufficient post closing reserves. Peoples United Financial has not originated interest only residential mortgage loans that permit negative amortization or optional payment amounts. Amortization of an interest only residential mortgage loan begins after the initial interest rate changes (e.g. after 5 years for a 5/1 adjustable rate mortgage). Stated income loans, which Peoples United Financial has not offered since mid 2007, represent a form of reduced documentation loan that requires a potential borrower to complete a standard mortgage application with full verification of the borrowers asset information as contained in the loan application, but no verification of the provided income information. As with interest only loans, underwriting guidelines for stated income loans require properties to be single family and owner occupied primary residences with lower loan to value ratios and higher credit scores. In addition, stated income loans require the receipt of an appraisal for the real estate used as collateral and a credit report on the prospective borrower. Peoples United Financials loan loss experience within the residential mortgage portfolio increased in 2009 and continues to be primarily attributable to a small number of loans. 58 Table of Contents In 2009, adjustable rate residential mortgage loans decreased $613 million compared to year end 2008, reflecting Peoples United Financials decision to sell essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. Adjustable rate residential mortgage loans at December 31, 2008 decreased $267 million compared to year end 2007, while fixed rate mortgage loans increased $198 million. Excluding the effect of residential mortgage loans acquired in the Chittenden acquisition, residential mortgage loans would have decreased $813 million since December 31, 2007, reflecting Peoples United Financials decision to sell essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. Historically, Peoples United Financial has held virtually all of the adjustable rate residential mortgage loans that it originates on its balance sheet and has sold virtually all of the fixed rate residential mortgage loans that it originates into the secondary market. In 2006, Peoples United Financial completed a reassessment of its pricing with respect to adjustable rate residential mortgage loans in light of the prevailing interest rate environment at that time. As a result, Peoples United Financial made the decision in the fourth quarter of 2006 to sell essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. Peoples United Financial continues to actively offer residential mortgage loans of all types through its extensive distribution system. Residential mortgage loan balances are expected to continue to decline in the future until Peoples United Financial resumes adding such loans to its portfolio to an extent that more than offsets repayments. The continued performance of the residential mortgage loan portfolio in 2010 may be adversely impacted by the level and direction of interest rates, consumer preferences and the regional economy. Residential Mortgage Originations Years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) Residential Mortgage Originations by Product Year ended December 31, 2009 (percent) 59 Table of Contents Peoples United Financial offers home equity credit lines and second mortgage loans, and to a lesser extent, other forms of installment and revolving credit loans. Future growth of Peoples United Financials consumer loan portfolio is highly dependent upon economic conditions, the interest rate environment and competitors strategies, as well as the success of Peoples United Financials marketing programs and information based strategies. Consumer Lending As of December 31 (in millions) 2009 2008 Home equity credit lines $ 1,740.2 $ 1,619.8 Second mortgages 246.1 325.7 Indirect auto 207.3 224.8 Other loans 51.4 57.1 Total consumer $ 2,245.0 $ 2,227.4 The consumer loan portfolio increased $18 million in 2009, after increasing $1.0 billion in 2008, which reflected the Chittenden acquisition and organic growth of $153 million. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, approximately 99% of the consumer loan portfolio was to customers located in New England. The indirect auto portfolio was acquired in connection with the Chittenden acquisition. Asset Quality The past two years have been marked by significant volatility in the financial and capital markets initially brought about by the fallout associated with the subprime mortgage market. This disruption led to significant credit and liquidity concerns, which resulted in government intervention within the banking sector and a substantial decline in activity within the secondary mortgage market. All of these issues have been further exacerbated by an accelerated softening of the real estate market, a worsening recessionary economic environment and, in turn, weakness within the commercial sector. Peoples United Financial does not engage in subprime mortgage lending, which has been the riskiest sector of the residential housing market. Peoples United Financial has virtually no exposure to subprime loans, or to similarly high risk Alt A loans and structured investment vehicles. At December 31, 2009, the loan portfolio included $1.0 billion of interest only residential mortgage loans, of which $113 million are stated income loans, compared to $1.4 billion and $135 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008. Peoples United Financial began originating interest only residential mortgage loans in March 2003. The underwriting guidelines and requirements for such loans are generally more restrictive than those applied to other types of residential mortgage loans. In general, Peoples United Financials underwriting guidelines for residential mortgage loans require the following: (i) properties must be single family and owner occupied primary residences; (ii) lower loan to value ratios (less than 60% on average); (iii) higher credit scores (greater than 700 on average); and (iv) sufficient post closing reserves.

As with interest only loans, underwriting guidelines for stated income loans require properties to be single family and owner occupied primary residences with lower loan to value ratios and higher credit scores. In addition, stated income loans require the receipt of an appraisal for the real estate used as collateral and a credit report on the prospective borrower. 60 Table of Contents While Peoples United Financial continues to adhere to prudent underwriting standards, the loan portfolio is geographically diverse and, therefore, is not immune to potential negative consequences arising as a result of general economic weakness and, in particular, a prolonged downturn in the housing market on a national scale. Decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for loans. In addition, adverse changes in the economy could have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make scheduled loan payments, which would likely have an adverse impact on earnings. Further, an increase in loan delinquencies may serve to decrease net interest income and adversely impact loan loss experience, resulting in an increased provision and allowance for loan losses. Peoples United Financial actively manages asset quality through its underwriting practices and collection operations. Underwriting practices tend to focus on optimizing the return of a given risk classification while collection operations focus on minimizing losses once an account becomes delinquent. Peoples United Financial attempts to minimize losses associated with commercial banking loans by requiring borrowers to pledge adequate collateral and or provide for third party guarantees. Loss mitigation within the residential mortgage loan portfolio is highly dependent on the value of the underlying real estate. Accordingly, Peoples United Financial orders updated independent third party appraisals for residential mortgage loans once they become 90 days past due. At December 31, 2009, non performing residential mortgage loans totaling $5.5 million had current loan to value ratios of more than 100%. The allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses charged to income. Losses on loans, including impaired loans, are charged to the allowance for loan losses when all or a portion of a loan is deemed to be uncollectible. Recoveries of loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance for loan losses when realized. Peoples United Financial maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that is deemed to be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the respective loan portfolios, based on a quarterly evaluation of a variety of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to: Peoples United Financials historical loan loss experience and recent trends in that experience; risk ratings assigned by lending personnel to commercial real estate, commercial and PCLC loans, and the results of ongoing reviews of those ratings by Peoples United Financials independent loan review function; an evaluation of delinquent and non performing loans and related collateral values; the probability of loss in view of geographic and industry concentrations and other portfolio risk characteristics; the present financial condition of borrowers; and current economic conditions. Peoples United Financial did not change its practices with respect to determining the allowance for loan losses during 2009. While Peoples United Financial seeks to use the best available information to make these evaluations, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions, results of regulatory examinations, further information obtained regarding known problem loans, the identification of additional problem loans and other factors. Certain loans whose terms have been modified are considered troubled debt restructures (TDRs). Loans are considered TDRs if the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and is afforded a concession by Peoples United Financial, such as: (i) a below market interest rate; (ii) extension of the loans original contractual term; (iii) capitalization of interest; or (iv) forgiveness of principal or interest. Generally, TDRs are placed on non accrual status (and reported as non performing loans) until the loan qualifies for return to accrual status. Loans qualify for return to accrual status once they have demonstrated performance with the restructured terms of the loan agreement for a minimum of six months. Loans acquired in the Chittenden acquisition that exhibited evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination, such that it was unlikely that all contractually required payments would be collected, were recorded upon acquisition at their estimated fair value, without an allocated allowance for loan losses. Upon acquisition on January 1, 2008, such loans had an outstanding contractual balance of $9.2 million, which has been reduced to $0.7 million at December 31, 2009. The amount of non accretable discount applicable to these loans was not significant. 61 Table of Contents Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses The following table presents the activity in the allowance for loan losses and ratios: Years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 Beginning allowance for loan losses $ 157.5 $ 72.7 $ 74.0 $ 75.0 $ 72.5 Charge offs: Commercial real estate (10.9 ) (3.4 ) (0.1 ) Commercial (9.8 ) (5.6 ) (7.0 ) (5.2 ) (0.9 ) PCLC (8.8 ) (1.5 ) (1.8 ) (0.6 ) (3.1 ) Consumer (6.4 ) (3.7 ) (2.7 ) (3.4 ) (4.9 ) Residential mortgage (5.4 ) (1.5 ) (0.1 ) (0.1 ) Indirect auto (4.2 ) (3.5 ) Total charge offs (45.5 ) (19.2 ) (11.5 ) (9.3 ) (9.1 ) Recoveries: Commercial real estate 0.3 0.2 0.1 2.5 0.1 Commercial 1.0 1.3 0.3 0.4 0.4 PCLC 0.2 0.3 0.1 0.3 0.3 Consumer 0.9 0.9 1.1 1.6 2.0 Residential mortgage 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.1 0.2 Indirect auto 0.9 1.2 Total recoveries 3.5 4.3 2.2 4.9 3.0 Net loan charge offs (42.0 ) (14.9 ) (9.3 ) (4.4 ) (6.1 ) Provision for loan losses 57.0 26.2 8.0 3.4 8.6 Allowance recorded in the Chittenden acquisition 73.5 Ending allowance for loan losses $ 172.5 $ 157.5 $ 72.7 $ 74.0 $ 75.0 Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of: Total loans 1.21 % 1.08 % 0.81 % 0.79 % 0.87 % Non performing loans 102.2 186.8 357.8 327.9 352.5 The provision for loan losses in 2009 totaled $57.0 million, reflecting $42.0 million in net loan charge offs and a $15.0 million increase in the allowance for loan losses. Commercial real estate loan charge offs in 2009 include a $6.1 million partial charge off of a non performing shared national credit. The provision for loan losses in 2008 totaled $26.2 million, reflecting $14.9 million in net loan charge offs and an $11.3 million increase in the allowance for loan losses, including a $4.5 million increase resulting from the alignment of the former Chittenden allowance for loan losses methodology with that of Peoples United Financial. The increase in net loan charge offs in 2008 compared to 2007 is entirely attributable to loans acquired in the Chittenden acquisition. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.21% at December 31, 2009 and 1.08% at December 31, 2008. 62 Table of Contents Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average total loans equaled 0.29% in 2009 and 0.10% in both 2008 and 2007. The very low level of net loan charge offs in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of average loans may not be sustainable in the future.

This assessment is based on a variety of internal and external factors including, but not limited to, the likelihood and severity of loss, portfolio growth and related risk characteristics, and current economic conditions. Management believes that the level of the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2009 is adequate to cover probable losses. 63 Table of Contents Non Performing Assets A loan is generally considered non performing when it is placed on non accrual status. A loan is generally placed on non accrual status when it becomes 90 days past due as to interest or principal payments. However, a loan may be placed on non accrual status earlier if such loan has been identified as presenting uncertainty with respect to the collectibility of interest and principal. A loan past due 90 days or more may remain on accruing status if such loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. Peoples United Financials historical experience suggests that a portion of these non performing assets will eventually be recovered. All non performing loans are in various stages of collection, workout, settlement or foreclosure. When loan workout efforts are exhausted and it is determined that the borrower is unable to repay the obligation, Peoples United Financial will complete foreclosure procedures, if applicable. The following table presents information on non accrual loans, real estate owned and repossessed assets: As of December 31 (dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 Non accrual loans: Commercial real estate $ 72.4 $ 29.8 $ 3.7 $ 0.2 $ 5.8 Residential mortgage 52.7 24.2 8.9 6.7 6.7 PCLC 20.6 5.8 3.1 2.1 6.2 Commercial 17.4 21.1 1.3 11.9 1.3 Consumer 5.7 3.3 3.3 1.7 1.3 Indirect auto 0.1 Total non accrual loans (1) 168.8 84.3 20.3 22.6 21.3 Real estate owned (REO) and repossessed assets, net 36.8 9.4 5.8 0.1 0.7 Total non performing assets $ 205.6 $ 93.7 $ 26.1 $ 22.7 $ 22.0 Non performing loans as a percentage of total loans 1.19 % 0.58 % 0.23 % 0.24 % 0.25 % Non performing assets as a percentage of: Total loans, REO and repossessed assets 1.44 0.64 0.29 0.24 0.26 Tangible stockholders equity and allowance for loan losses 5.47 2.47 0.59 1.74 1.75 (1) Reported net of government guarantees totaling $8.3 million and $6.5 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively (none for prior periods). Total non performing assets increased $111.9 million from December 31, 2008 and equaled 1.44% of total loans, REO and repossessed assets at December 31, 2009. The change in total non performing assets from December 31, 2008 includes increases in non performing commercial real estate loans of $42.6 million, non performing residential mortgage loans of $28.5 million, non performing PCLC loans of $14.8 million and REO and repossessed assets of $27.4 million. The increase in non performing commercial real estate loans primarily reflects the classification of one shared national credit (totaling $16.3 million at December 31, 2009) as non performing and the impact of continued economic weakness on the commercial real estate sector. The increase in non performing residential mortgage loans is primarily a reflection of higher levels of unemployment across Peoples United Financials franchise, while the increase in non performing PCLC loans reflects broader economic weakness. REO and repossessed assets increased by $17.0 million and $10.4 million, respectively. The increase in REO primarily reflects the transfer of one shared national credit (totaling $9.8 million at December 31, 2009) to REO as well as additional commercial properties transferred in 2009. The increase in repossessed assets reflects the higher level of repossessed equipment at PCLC. Total nonperforming assets at December 31, 2008 increased $67.6 million from December 31, 2007 and were 0.64% of total loans, real estate owned and repossessed assets. The increase in non performing assets from December 31, 2007 primarily reflects additional non performing assets attributable to the acquired Chittenden loan portfolio, and includes increases in non performing commercial real estate loans of $26.1 million, non performing commercial loans of $19.8 million and non performing residential mortgage loans of $15.3 million. 64 Table of Contents Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest totaled $11.8 million and $8.0 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively (none for prior periods). The level of non performing assets is expected to fluctuate in response to changing economic and market conditions, and the relative sizes of the respective loan portfolios, along with managements degree of success in resolving problem assets. Management takes a proactive approach with respect to the identification and resolution of problem loans. However, given the current state of the U.S. economy and, more specifically, the real estate market, the level of non performing assets may continue to increase in 2010. If interest payments on all loans classified as non accrual at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 had been made during the respective years in accordance with the loan agreements, interest income of $12.5 million, $8.6 million and $2.3 million would have been recognized on such loans for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Interest income actually recognized on non accrual loans totaled $3.3 million, $2.4 million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Detailed discussions pertaining to Peoples United Financials off balance sheet arrangements are included in the following sections: Funding, Liquidity, Capital and Market Risk Management. Funding At the current time, Peoples United Financials primary funding sources are deposits and stockholders equity, which represent 97% of total assets at December 31, 2009. Borrowings also are an available source of funding. Based on Peoples United Banks membership in the FHLB of Boston and the level of qualifying collateral available at December 31, 2009, Peoples United Bank had up to $2.3 billion of borrowing capacity in the form of advances from the FHLB of Boston and Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and repurchase agreements. Peoples United Bank also had unsecured borrowing capacity of $0.5 billion at December 31, 2009.

Peoples United Financial provides customers access to their deposits through nearly 300 branches, including 81 full service Stop & Shop supermarket branches, over 400 ATMs, telephone banking and an Internet banking site. 65 Table of Contents Deposits equaled 73% and 71% of total assets at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The $1.2 billion increase in total deposits from December 31, 2008 reflects increases in savings, interest bearing checking and money market deposits, and non interest bearing deposits of $1.2 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively, partially offset by a $0.3 billion decrease in time deposits. Deposits and stockholders equity constituted over 98% of Peoples United Financials funding base at December 31, 2009 and 2008. The expansion of Peoples United Financials branch network and its commitment to developing full service relationships with its customers are integral components of Peoples United Financials strategy to leverage the success of its supermarket banking initiative, expand market share and continue growing deposits. At December 31, 2009, Peoples United Financials network of Stop & Shop branches held deposits totaling $2.3 billion and deposits in supermarket branches open for more than one year averaged $29 million per store. Non interest bearing deposits are an important source of low cost funding and fee income for Peoples United Financial. In addition, Peoples United Financial believes that checking accounts represent one of the core relationships between a financial institution and its customers, and it is from these relationships that cross selling of other financial services can be achieved. Non interest bearing deposits equaled 23% and 22% of deposits at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Time deposits of $100,000 or more totaled $1.5 billion at December 31, 2009, of which $528 million mature within three months, $275 million mature after three months but within six months, $438 million mature after six months but within one year and $240 million mature after one year. Brokered certificates of deposit totaled $3.0 million and $17.1 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Peoples United Financial had no borrowings at December 31, 2007. The increase in borrowings in 2008 is due to the borrowings assumed in connection with the Chittenden acquisition. Repurchase agreements at December 31, 2009 and 2008 consisted of transactions with commercial and municipal customers. 67 Table of Contents In previous years, Peoples United Financials primary source for borrowings were federal funds purchased, which are typically unsecured overnight loans among banks, and advances from the FHLB of Boston, which provides credit for member institutions within its assigned region. Peoples United Financials outstanding FHLB advances at December 31, 2009 and 2008 represented less than one half of one percent of total assets. Subordinated Notes Subordinated notes totaled $182 million and $181 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Peoples United Financial assumed liability for subordinated notes with a fair value of $115 million in connection with the Chittenden acquisition. These subordinated notes, which were issued in February 2007, represent unsecured general obligations of Peoples United Financial with interest payable semi annually. The notes have a coupon of 5.80% for the first five years and convert to a variable rate in year six that is tied to three month LIBOR plus 68.5 basis points. Beginning February 14, 2012, Peoples United Financial has the option to redeem some or all of the notes. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, Peoples United Bank had $65 million of 9.875% subordinated notes outstanding. These subordinated notes are due on November 15, 2010 and represent unsecured general obligations of Peoples United Bank with interest payable semi annually, are subordinated to the claims of depositors and Peoples United Banks other creditors and are not redeemable prior to maturity without prior approval of the OTS. In the fourth quarter of 2008, Peoples United Financial and Peoples United Bank both opted in to the FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, which provides a temporary guarantee of newly issued senior unsecured debt, as defined (the Debt Guarantee Program). As of December 31, 2009, neither Peoples United Financial nor Peoples United Bank had any debt outstanding that qualifies under the Debt Guarantee Program. Peoples United Bank may issue up to approximately $300 million of senior unsecured debt that would qualify under the Debt Guarantee Program. While Peoples United Financial has retained the right to do so, the company does not, at this time, intend to issue senior unsecured debt that would qualify under the Debt Guarantee Program. 68 Table of Contents Contractual Cash Obligations The following table is a summary of Peoples United Financials contractual cash obligations, other than deposit liabilities, including operating leases. Additional information concerning these contractual cash obligations is included in Notes 11, 12 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase obligations included in the table represent those agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions. A substantial majority of Peoples United Financials purchase obligations are renewable on a year to year basis. As such, the purchase obligations included in this table only reflect the contractual commitment.

Similarly, obligations totaling $24.9 million related to limited partnership affordable housing investments are not included in the above table as the timing of the related capital calls cannot be estimated. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of Peoples United Financials unrecognized income tax positions and affordable housing investments. Liquidity Liquidity is defined as the ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet all present and future funding requirements at reasonable costs. Liquidity management addresses Peoples United Financials and Peoples United Banks ability to fund new loans and investments as opportunities arise, to meet customer deposit withdrawals, and to repay borrowings and subordinated notes as they mature. Peoples United Financials, as well as Peoples United Banks, liquidity positions are monitored daily by management. The Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO) of Peoples United Bank has been authorized by the Board of Directors of Peoples United Financial to set guidelines to ensure maintenance of prudent levels of liquidity for Peoples United Financial as well as for Peoples United Bank. ALCO reports to the Treasury and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors of Peoples United Bank. Asset liquidity is provided by: cash; short term investments and security resale agreements; proceeds from security sales, maturities and principal repayments; and proceeds from scheduled principal collections, prepayments and sales of loans. In addition, certain securities may be used to collateralize borrowings under repurchase agreements. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows present data on cash provided by and used in Peoples United Financials operating, investing and financing activities. At December 31, 2009, Peoples United Financials (parent company) liquid assets included $400 million in securities purchased under agreements to resell. Peoples United Banks liquid assets included $3.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $740 million in debt securities available for sale and $76 million in trading account securities. Securities available for sale with a fair value of $607 million at December 31, 2009 were pledged as collateral for public deposits and for other purposes. 69 Table of Contents Liability liquidity is measured by Peoples United Financials and Peoples United Banks ability to obtain deposits and borrowings at cost effective rates that are diversified with respect to markets and maturities. Deposits, which are considered the most stable source of liability liquidity, totaled $15.4 billion at December 31, 2009 and represented 74% of total funding (the sum of deposits, borrowings, subordinated notes and stockholders equity). Borrowings are used to diversify Peoples United Financials funding mix and to support asset growth. Borrowings and subordinated notes totaled $159 million and $182 million, respectively, at December 31, 2009, representing 0.8% and 0.9%, respectively, of total funding. Peoples United Banks current sources of borrowings include: federal funds purchased, advances from the FHLB of Boston and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and repurchase agreements. At December 31, 2009, Peoples United Banks total borrowing limit from the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank of New York for advances and repurchase agreements was $2.3 billion, based on the level of qualifying collateral available for these borrowings. In addition, Peoples United Bank had unsecured borrowing capacity of $0.5 billion. At December 31, 2009, Peoples United Bank had outstanding commitments to originate loans totaling $0.5 billion and approved, but unused, lines of credit extended to customers totaling $3.6 billion (including $1.8 billion of home equity lines of credit). The sources of liquidity discussed above are deemed by management to be sufficient to fund outstanding loan commitments and to meet Peoples United Financials and Peoples United Banks other obligations. Earning Asset Mix $18.6 billion as of December 31, 2009 (percent) Funding Base $20.9 billion as of December 31, 2009 (percent) Stockholders Equity and Dividends Peoples United Financials total stockholders equity was $5.10 billion at December 31, 2009, a $74.3 million decrease compared to $5.17 billion at December 31, 2008. This decrease primarily reflects dividends paid of $203.6 million partially offset by net income of $101.2 million. Stockholders equity equaled 24.0% of total assets at December 31, 2009 and 25.7% at December 31, 2008. Tangible stockholders equity (total stockholders equity less goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles) equaled 18.2% of tangible assets (total assets less goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles) at December 31, 2009 and 19.5% at December 31, 20087. The decline in these ratios primarily reflects a $1.1 billion increase in total assets from December 31, 2008. 70 Table of Contents In April 2008, Peoples United Financials Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program. Under the program, up to 5% of Peoples United Financials then outstanding common stock, or up to 17.3 million shares, could be repurchased, either directly or through agents, in the open market at prices and terms satisfactory to management. As of December 31, 2009, no shares had been repurchased under this program. In January 2010, Peoples United Financials Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend on its common stock of $0.1525 per share. The dividend was paid on February 15, 2010 to shareholders of record on February 1, 2010. Peoples United Financials total stockholders equity was $5.17 billion at December 31, 2008, a $729 million increase from December 31, 2007. This increase primarily reflects the issuance of 44.3 million shares of common stock with a fair value of approximately $770 million (net of issuance costs) in connection with the Chittenden acquisition and net income of $137.8 million, partially offset by dividends paid of $194.4 million and a $56.8 million increase in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) since December 31, 2007. The increase in AOCL, net of tax, primarily reflects an increase in the net actuarial loss and other amounts related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans ($78.7 million), partially offset by an increase in the net unrealized gains on derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges ($18.2 million). Dividends declared and paid per common share (other than shares on which Peoples Mutual Holdings waived receipt of dividends prior to completing the second step conversion in April 2007) totaled $0.61, $0.58 and $0.52 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Peoples United Financials dividend payout ratio (dividends paid as a percentage of net income) for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was 201.1%, 141.1% and 87.0%, respectively. For periods prior to April 2007 (the date of the second step conversion) the dividend payout ratio reflects the waiver of dividends on the substantial majority of the common shares owned by Peoples Mutual Holdings. Regulatory Capital Requirements OTS capital regulations require federally chartered savings banks, such as Peoples United Bank, to meet three minimum capital ratios: Tangible Capital Ratio A 1.5% tangible capital ratio, calculated as tangible capital to adjusted total assets. Leverage (Core) Capital Ratio A 4% leverage (core) capital ratio, calculated as core capital to adjusted total assets. The minimum leverage (core) capital ratio is reduced to 3% if the savings bank received the highest rating on its most recent safety and soundness examination. Risk Based Capital Ratio An 8% total risk based capital ratio, calculated as total risk based capital to total risk weighted assets. For purposes of this calculation, total risk based capital equals the sum of core and supplementary capital, provided that supplementary capital may not exceed 100% of core capital. In assessing an institutions capital adequacy, the OTS takes into consideration not only these numeric factors but also qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where necessary. Peoples United Bank, as a matter of prudent management, targets as its goal the maintenance of capital ratios which exceed these minimum requirements and that are consistent with Peoples United Banks risk profile. Peoples United Banks tangible capital ratio, leverage (core) capital ratio, and total risk based capital ratios were 10.0%, 10.0% and 14.1%, respectively, at December 31, 2009, compared to 10.0%, 10.0% and 13.4%, respectively, at December 31, 2008. The increase in the total risk based capital ratio from December 31, 2008 primarily reflects a $136.4 million increase in Peoples United Banks total risk based capital (the numerator in the calculation of the total risk based capital ratio) in 2009. 71 Table of Contents The following summary compares Peoples United Banks regulatory capital amounts and ratios as of December 31, 2009 to the OTS minimum requirements. At December 31, 2009, Peoples United Banks adjusted total assets, as defined, totaled $19.5 billion and its total risk weighted assets, as defined, totaled $14.9 billion. At December 31, 2009, Peoples United Bank exceeded each of its regulatory capital requirements. Regulatory capital amounts and ratios presented are for Peoples United Bank and therefore do not reflect the additional capital residing at Peoples United Financial. Peoples United Bank OTS MinimumRequirements As of December 31, 2009 (dollars in millions) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Tangible capital $ 1,948.2 (1) 10.0 % $ 291.8 1.5 % Leverage (core) capital 1,948.2 (1) 10.0 778.2 4.0 Total risk based capital 2,104.4 (2) 14.1 1,190.8 8.0 (1) Represents total stockholders equity, excluding (i) after tax net unrealized gains (losses) on certain securities classified as available for sale, (ii) after tax net gains on derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges, (iii) certain assets not recognized in tier 1 capital (principally goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles), and (iv) the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) relating to pension and other postretirement benefits. (2) Represents tier 1 capital plus the allowance for loan losses up to 1.25% of total risk weighted assets. Generally, a bank is considered well capitalized if it has a leverage (core) capital ratio of at least 5.0%, a tier 1 risk based capital ratio of at least 6.0% (calculated as tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets) and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 10.0%. Peoples United Banks regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2009 exceeded the OTS numeric criteria for classification as well capitalized. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning Peoples United Banks regulatory capital amounts and ratios.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market Risk Management Market risk is the risk of loss to earnings, capital and the fair values of certain assets and liabilities resulting from changes in interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. Interest Rate Risk For Peoples United Financial, the only relevant market risk at this time is interest rate risk (IRR), which is the potential exposure to earnings or capital that may result from changes in interest rates. Peoples United Financial manages its IRR to achieve a balance between risk, earnings volatility and capital preservation. ALCO has primary responsibility for managing Peoples United Financials IRR. To evaluate Peoples United Financials IRR profile, ALCO monitors economic conditions, interest rate trends, liquidity levels and capital ratios. Management also reviews assumptions periodically for projected customer and competitor behavior, in addition to the expected repricing characteristics and cash flow projections for assets, liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments. Actual conditions may vary significantly from Peoples United Financials assumptions. Management evaluates the impact of IRR on Income at Risk using an earnings simulation model to project earnings under multiple interest rate environments over a one year time horizon resulting in a quantification of IRR. Income at Risk includes significant interest rate sensitive income sources, such as net interest income, gains on sales of residential mortgage loans and BOLI income. The earnings projections are based on a static balance sheet and estimates of pricing levels for Peoples United Financials products under multiple scenarios intended to reflect instantaneous yield curve shocks. Peoples United Financial estimates its base case Income at Risk using current interest rates. Internal policy regarding IRR simulations specify that for instantaneous parallel shifts of the yield curve, estimated Income at Risk for the subsequent one year period should not decline by more than: 10% for a 100 basis point shift; 15% for a 200 basis point shift; and 20% for a 300 basis point shift. The following table shows the estimated percentage increase (decrease) in Peoples United Financials Income at Risk over a one year simulation period beginning December 31, 2009. Given the interest rate environment at December 31, 2009, simulations for declines in interest rates below 25 basis points were not deemed to be meaningful. Rate Change (basis points) Percent Change inIncome at Risk +300 31.2 % +200 20.0 +100 9.2 25 (2.2 ) While Income at Risk simulation identifies earnings exposure over a relatively short time horizon, Equity at Risk takes a long term economic perspective when quantifying IRR, thereby identifying possible margin behavior over a longer time horizon. Base case Market Value of Equity (MVE) is calculated by estimating the net present value of all future cash flows from existing assets and liabilities using current interest rates. The base case scenario assumes that future interest rates remain unchanged. Internal policy limits the exposure of a decrease in Equity at Risk resulting from instantaneous parallel shifts of the yield curve in the following manner: for 100 basis points 10% of base case MVE; for 200 basis points 15% of base case MVE; and for 300 basis points 20% of base case MVE. 73 Table of Contents The following table shows the estimated percentage increase (decrease) in Peoples United Financials Equity at Risk, assuming various shifts in interest rates. Given the interest rate environment at December 31, 2009, simulations for declines in interest rates below 25 basis points were not deemed to be meaningful. Rate Change(basis points) Percent Change inEquity at Risk +300 (0.5 )% +200 +100 0.3 25 (0.3 ) Peoples United Financials interest rate risk position at December 31, 2009, as set forth in the Income at Risk and Equity at Risk tables above, reflects its significant excess capital position at that date. Managements current posture is to invest a portion of such excess capital in highly liquid, low risk, short term investments and securities resale agreements. While this strategy does place additional pressure on net interest income in a low rate environment, management views such risk as an acceptable alternative in light of the current credit environment where capital has proven vital to the continued viability of many institutions. Given the uncertainty of the magnitude, timing and direction of future interest rate movements and the shape of the yield curve, actual results may vary from those predicted by Peoples United Financials models. Peoples United Financials asset sensitive balance sheet includes more than just its significant excess capital position. In fact, a 100 basis point increase in the federal finds interest rate translates to an approximate $100 million improvement in net interest income on an annualized basis. Peoples United Financial uses derivative financial instruments, including interest rate floors (see below) and interest rate swaps, primarily for market risk management purposes (principally interest rate risk). Certain other derivatives are entered into in connection with transactions with commercial customers. Derivatives are not used for speculative purposes. At December 31, 2009, Peoples United Financial used interest rate swaps on a limited basis to manage IRR associated with certain interest earning assets. Interest rate swaps are used to match more closely the repricing of fewer than five commercial real estate loans and the funding associated with these loans. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the fixed rate assets to a variable interest rate and consequently reduce Peoples United Financials exposure to increases in interest rates. Interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges. In the first quarter of 2009, Peoples United Financial terminated its remaining $600 million (notional amount) interest rate floor contracts. The decision to do so was based on managements belief that, in light of the current interest rate environment, the derivative contracts had achieved their stated market risk management objective. Termination of the derivative contracts also served to reduce the companys counterparty credit risk. At the time of termination, the interest rate floors had an unrealized gain of $40.1 million. The gain is included (on a net of tax basis) as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being recognized in income over the period during which the hedged items (certain floating rate commercial loans) affect earnings (approximately 2 years). A total of $19.9 million of this gain was recognized in income during the year ended December 31, 2009 and the remaining unrecognized gain at December 31, 2009 was $20.2 million. The portion of the unrecognized gain at December 31, 2009 that is expected to be recognized in income over the next 12 months totals approximately $19.6 million. 74 Table of Contents In connection with the September 2008 bankruptcy filing by Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc., Peoples United Financial terminated its $100 million (notional) derivative contract (interest rate floor) with Lehman Brothers. The derivative contract had a fair value of $5.3 million at the time of termination. After considering the master netting arrangement and posted collateral, the net amount due from the counterparty was $1.4 million. Peoples United Financial recognized a $1.2 million charge in 2008 and a $0.2 million credit in 2009 to adjust this receivable to the estimated realizable amount. Peoples United Financial has written guidelines that have been approved by its Board of Directors and ALCO governing the use of derivative financial instruments, including approved counterparties and credit limits. Credit risk associated with these instruments is controlled and monitored through policies and procedures governing collateral management and credit approval. By using derivatives, Peoples United Financial is exposed to credit risk to the extent that counterparties to the derivative contracts do not perform as required. Should a counterparty fail to perform under the terms of a derivative contract, the companys counterparty credit risk is equal to the amount reported as a derivative asset in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. Amounts reported as derivative assets represent derivative contracts in a gain position, net of derivatives in a loss position with the same counterparty (to the extent subject to master netting arrangements) and posted collateral. Peoples United Financial seeks to minimize counterparty credit risk through credit approvals, limits, monitoring procedures, execution of master netting arrangements and obtaining collateral, where appropriate. At December 31, 2009, counterparties to Peoples United Financials derivatives primarily represent major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings from the major rating agencies. As such, management believes the risk of incurring losses on derivative contracts related to credit risk is remote and losses, if any, would be immaterial. Certain of Peoples United Financials derivative contracts contain provisions establishing collateral requirements (subject to minimum collateral posting thresholds) based on the companys external credit rating. If the companys senior unsecured debt rating were to fall below the level generally recognized as investment grade, the counterparties to such derivative contracts could require additional collateral on those derivative transactions in a net liability position (after considering the effect of bilateral netting arrangements and posted collateral). The aggregate fair value of derivative instruments with such credit related contingent features that were in a net liability position at December 31, 2009 was $0.5 million, for which Peoples United Financial had posted no collateral in the normal course of business. If the companys senior unsecured debt rating had fallen below investment grade as of that date, no additional collateral would have been required. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign exchange contracts are commitments to buy or sell foreign currency on a future date at a contractual price. Peoples United Financial uses these instruments on a limited basis to eliminate its exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates on certain of its commercial loans that are denominated in foreign currencies. Gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts substantially offset the translation gains and losses on the related loans. 75 Table of Contents Derivative Financial Instruments The following table summarizes certain information concerning derivative financial instruments utilized by Peoples United Financial in its management of IRR and foreign currency risk.
