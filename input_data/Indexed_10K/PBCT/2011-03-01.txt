Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements Periodic and other filings made by Peoples United Financial with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) may from time to time contain information and statements that are forward looking in nature. Such filings include the Annual Report on Form 10 K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q and Current Reports on Form 8 K, and may include other forms such as proxy statements. Other written or oral statements made by Peoples United Financial or its representatives from time to time may also contain forward looking statements. In general, forward looking statements usually use words such as expect, anticipate, believe, should, and similar expressions, and include all statements about Peoples United Financials operating results or financial position for future periods. Forward looking statements represent managements beliefs, based upon information available at the time the statements are made, with regard to the matters addressed; they are not guarantees of future performance. All forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause Peoples United Financials actual results or financial condition to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such statements. Factors of particular importance to Peoples United Financial include, but are not limited to: (1) changes in general, national or regional economic conditions; (2) changes in interest rates; (3) changes in loan default and charge off rates; (4) changes in deposit levels; (5) changes in levels of income and expense in non interest income and expense related activities; (6) residential mortgage and secondary market activity; (7) changes in accounting and regulatory guidance applicable to banks; (8) price levels and conditions in the public securities markets generally; (9) competition and its effect on pricing, spending, third party relationships and revenues; (10) the successful integration of acquired companies; and (11) possible changes in regulation resulting from or relating to recently enacted financial reform legislation. All forward looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Consequently, no forward looking statement can be guaranteed. Peoples United Financial does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Recent Market Developments In response to the unprecedented challenges affecting the banking system, the Federal government began implementing several programs in late 2008 designed to address a variety of issues facing the financial sector. The most noteworthy of these initiatives was the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the EESA). The EESA lead to the Troubled Asset Relief Program (the TARP) and the TARP Capital Purchase Program, neither of which had a direct impact on Peoples United Financial as the company did not participate in these programs. Peoples United Financial did, however, experience a number of changes with respect to deposit insurance coverage and related assessments. FDIC Insurance Coverage / Assessments The FDIC insures deposits at FDIC insured financial institutions up to certain limits, charging premiums to maintain the DIF at specified levels. Such premiums may vary based on the risk profile of the insured institution and have historically ranged from 0.05% of deposits for an institution in the highest sub category of the highest category to 0.43% of deposits for an institution in the lowest category. Current economic conditions have resulted in an increased number of bank failures and, consequently, greater use of DIF resources. In response, the FDIC authorized higher premium assessments for 2009 pursuant to a restoration plan designed to increase the DIF reserve ratio to required levels. Under the FDICs restoration plan, the premium assessment rate was raised uniformly by seven basis points beginning on January 1, 2009 resulting in an initial base assessment rate of 12 basis points for Peoples United Bank. Furthermore, the premium assessment rate in effect beginning April 1, 2009 is subject to adjustments that are based on each institutions risk profile and may affect its initial base assessment rate. 23 On September 29, 2009, the FDIC adopted a plan that extended the DIF restoration plan from seven years to eight years and on November 12, 2009, the FDIC adopted a final rule that amended the assessment regulations to require insured financial institutions to prepay, on December 30, 2009, their estimated deposit insurance premiums for 2010, 2011 and 2012. Under this rule, which did not include any additional special assessments, the prepayment was based on an assumed 5% annual growth rate in each institutions insured deposits (the assessment base) and an assumed increase of three basis points in each institutions premium assessment rate beginning in 2011. As such, deposit insurance expense may continue to increase in the future. On December 30, 2009, Peoples United Bank prepaid its estimated deposit insurance premiums totaling $69 million in accordance with FDIC regulations. After recognizing $23 million of deposit insurance expense in 2010, the prepaid deposit insurance assessment totaled $48 million (including $2 million related to acquired institutions) at December 31, 2010. The EESA increased the FDIC deposit insurance limit from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor through December 31, 2009, and subsequent amendments extended the increased coverage through December 31, 2013. In addition, on October 14, 2008, the FDIC announced the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, which consists of two components: temporary unlimited deposit insurance on funds in non interest bearing transaction deposit accounts not otherwise covered by the increased $250,000 deposit insurance limit (the Transaction Account Guarantee Program) and a temporary guarantee of certain newly issued unsecured debt (the Debt Guarantee Program). All eligible institutions were covered under both programs for the first 30 days without incurring any costs. After the initial 30 day period, institutions participating in the Transaction Account Guarantee Program are assessed a 10 basis point surcharge on the additional insured deposits and institutions participating in the Debt Guarantee Program are subject to an annualized charge equal to 75 basis points. On August 26, 2009, the FDIC adopted a final rule extending the Transaction Account Guarantee Program from December 31, 2009 through June 30, 2010. In April 2010, the Transaction Account Guarantee Program was extended again through December 31, 2010. Institutions remaining in the Transaction Account Guarantee Program will be charged an assessment rate of either 15 basis points, 20 basis points or 25 basis points on the additional insured deposits, depending on the institutions risk category as assigned by the FDIC. Through June 30, 2010, Peoples United Bank participated in the Transaction Account Guarantee Program as it had historically participated in all other FDIC deposit insurance programs. However, Peoples United Bank elected to opt out of future participation in the Transaction Account Guarantee Program effective July 1, 2010. While Peoples United Financial has retained its right to do so, the company does not, at this time, intend to issue senior unsecured debt securities under the Debt Guarantee Program. In February 2011, the FDIC approved a final rule which: changes the assessment base from adjusted domestic deposits to a banks average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity (defined as Tier 1 capital); adopts a new large bank pricing assessment scheme; and sets a target size for the DIF at 2% of insured deposits. The rule, which is effective June 30, 2011, also (i) implements a lower assessment rate schedule when the DIF reaches 1.15 percent and, in lieu of dividends, provides for a lower rate schedule when the reserve ratio reaches 2 percent and 2.5 percent and (ii) creates a scorecard based assessment system for financial institutions with more than $10 billion in assets, including Peoples United Bank. Based on the increase in the premium assessment rate, the special assessment announced in May 2009, and Peoples United Banks participation in the Transaction Account Guarantee Program through June 30, 2010, the companys cost of deposit insurance increased significantly in 2009 and 2010, and further increases may occur. The actual amount of future assessments will be dependent on several factors, including: (i) deposit levels; (ii) Peoples United Banks risk profile; (iii) changes resulting from the FDICs February 2011 final rule; and (iv) whether additional special assessments are imposed in future periods and the manner in which such assessments are determined. 24 Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act As previously discussed in Risk Factors, our business is subject to risk as a result of changes in Federal and State regulation. On July 21, 2010, financial regulatory reform was signed into law by the President as the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act). The Act implements significant changes in the financial regulatory landscape and will impact all financial institutions and their holding companies, including Peoples United Bank and Peoples United Financial. Among the Acts significant regulatory changes, it creates a new financial consumer protection agency, known as the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (the Bureau), that is empowered to promulgate new consumer protection regulations and revise existing regulations in many areas of consumer protection. The Bureau has exclusive authority to issue regulations, orders and guidance to administer and implement the objectives of federal consumer protection laws. The Bureau will also have exclusive supervision over our consumer compliance examinations. Moreover, the Act permits states to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and authorizes state attorneys general to enforce consumer protection rules issued by the Bureau. The Act restricts the authority of the Federal banking regulators to preempt state consumer protection laws applicable to the Bank, and limits the preemption of state laws as they affect subsidiaries and agents of federally chartered banks. The Act provides that the amount of interchange fee that an issuer of debit cards may charge or receive must be reasonable and proportional to the cost of the transaction. The Act directs the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Board) to issue regulations to implement this requirement, and further provides that in determining whether a charge is reasonable and proportional the issuer may generally consider only costs that are specific to the individual transaction. Separately, the Board is authorized to issue regulations that would allow an issuer to adjust interchange fees to reflect the costs associated with fraud mitigation related to debit card transactions, provided that the issuer must comply with fraud related standards to be established by the Board. The Act further provides that a debit card issuer may not restrict the number of payment card networks on which a debit card transaction may be processed to a single network or limit the ability of a merchant to direct the routing of debit card payments for processing. The company expects that the Acts interchange fee provisions will reduce interchange fee revenue, beginning in the third quarter of 2011, but the full impact will not be known until the Board has completed its rule making. It is anticipated that establishment of the Bureau and these other changes will significantly increase the companys regulatory compliance burden and costs and may restrict the financial products and services Peoples United Financial offers to its customers. The Act also imposes stringent capital requirements on bank holding companies by, among other things, imposing leverage ratios on holding companies and prohibiting new trust preferred issuances from counting as Tier I capital. The Act also increases regulation of derivatives and hedging transactions, which could limit the ability of Peoples United Financial to enter into, or increase the costs associated with, interest rate and other hedging transactions. Because many of the Acts provisions require subsequent regulatory rulemaking, the impact that the new regulations will have on Peoples United Bank and Peoples United Financial can not be predicted at this time. The actions noted above, together with additional actions announced by the U.S. Treasury and other regulatory agencies, continue to develop. It is not clear at this time what impact such actions will have on the capital markets and the financial services industry. The extreme levels of market volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced could continue to adversely affect the U.S. banking industry and the broader U.S. and global economies for the foreseeable future, which will have an effect on all financial institutions, including Peoples United Financial. In July 2011, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is expected to assume responsibility for the supervision and regulation of all federally chartered savings banks, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is expected to assume responsibility for the supervision and regulation of all savings and loan holding companies. 25 General Peoples United Financial, Inc. (Peoples United Financial) is a savings and loan holding company incorporated under the state laws of Delaware and the holding company for Peoples United Bank. On April 16, 2007, Peoples United Financial, Peoples United Bank and Peoples Mutual Holdings completed their second step conversion from a mutual holding company structure to a fully public stock holding company structure. Peoples United Financial had not engaged in any business through March 31, 2007; accordingly, the financial information for periods prior to March 31, 2007 is that of Peoples United Bank. Peoples United Financial is regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision (the OTS) and is subject to OTS examination, supervision and reporting requirements. Peoples United Bank is a federally chartered stock savings bank headquartered in Bridgeport, Connecticut with $23.9 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2010. Peoples United Bank was organized in 1842 as a mutual savings bank, converted to stock form in 1988, and in 2006 converted from a Connecticut chartered stock savings bank to a federally chartered stock savings bank. Deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF of the FDIC. Peoples United Bank is regulated by the OTS. Peoples United Financials results of operations are largely dependent upon revenues generated through net interest income and fee based revenues and, to a much lesser extent, other forms of non interest income such as gains on asset sales. Sources for these revenues are diversified across Peoples United Financials three primary business segments that represent its core businesses, Commercial Banking, Retail and Business Banking, and Wealth Management, and to a lesser extent, Treasury. Peoples United Financials results of operations are also significantly affected by the provision for loan losses and the level of non interest expense. In addition, Peoples United Financials results of operations may also be affected by general and local economic conditions, changes in market interest rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Recent Developments On January 20, 2011, Peoples United Financial announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Danvers Bancorp, Inc. (Danvers) based in Danvers, Massachusetts. The acquisition is valued at approximately $493 million, with 55% to be paid in the form of shares of Peoples United Financial common stock and 45% to be paid in cash. At December 31, 2010, Danvers reported total assets of $2.85 billion and total deposits of $2.10 billion, and operates 28 branches in the greater Boston area. The transaction, which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2011, is subject to approval by bank regulatory authorities and by the shareholders of Danvers. Peoples United Financial shareholder approval is not required for the transaction. Acquisitions On November 30, 2010, Peoples United Financial completed its acquisitions of Smithtown Bancorp, Inc. (Smithtown) based in Hauppauge, New York and LSB Corporation (LSB) based in North Andover, Massachusetts. On April 16, 2010, Peoples United Bank entered into a definitive purchase and assumption agreement with the FDIC pursuant to which Peoples United Bank assumed all of the deposits, certain assets and the banking operations of Butler Bank, located in Lowell, Massachusetts. On February 19, 2010, Peoples United Financial completed its acquisition of Financial Federal Corporation (Financial Federal), a financial services company providing collateralized lending, financing and leasing services nationwide to small and medium sized businesses. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in these transactions were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the respective closing dates and Peoples United Financials results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 include the results of these companies beginning with the respective closing dates. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of these acquisitions. 26 On January 1, 2008, Peoples United Financial completed its acquisition of Chittenden Corporation (Chittenden), a multi bank holding company headquartered in Burlington, Vermont. On January 1, 2009, the separate bank charters of the six former Chittenden banks, all previously wholly owned subsidiaries of Peoples United Bank, were consolidated into Peoples United Bank, where they continued to operate as divisions of Peoples United Bank. In June 2010, Peoples United Financial announced a plan to re brand, as Peoples United Bank, the former Chittenden banks in connection with the scheduled completion of its core system conversion in July 2010. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of this acquisition. Critical Accounting Policies In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, Peoples United Financial is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from Peoples United Financials current estimates, as a result of changing conditions and future events. The current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these significant estimates. Several accounting estimates are particularly critical and are susceptible to significant near term change, including the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of derivative financial instruments, and asset impairment judgments, such as the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets, and other than temporary declines in the value of securities. The judgments used by Peoples United Financial in applying these critical accounting policies may be affected by a further and prolonged deterioration in the economic environment, which may result in changes to future financial results. For example, subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods, and the inability to collect outstanding principal may result in increased loan losses. Peoples United Financials significant accounting policies and critical estimates are summarized in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses charged to income. Losses on loans, including impaired loans, are charged to the allowance for loan losses when all or a portion of a loan is deemed to be uncollectible. Recoveries of loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance for loan losses when realized. Peoples United Financial maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that is deemed to be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the respective loan portfolios, based on a quarterly evaluation of a variety of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to: Peoples United Financials historical loan loss experience and recent trends in that experience; risk ratings assigned by lending personnel to commercial real estate, commercial and equipment financing loans, and the results of ongoing reviews of those ratings by Peoples United Financials independent loan review function; an evaluation of delinquent and non performing loans and related collateral values; the probability of loss in view of geographic and industry concentrations and other portfolio risk characteristics; the present financial condition of borrowers; and current economic conditions. The companys allowance for loan losses consists of three elements: (i) an allowance for larger balance, non homogeneous loans that are evaluated on an individual (loan by loan) basis; (ii) an allowance for smaller balance homogeneous loans that are evaluated on a collective basis; and (iii) a specific allowance for individual loans deemed to be impaired. 27 The company establishes a loan loss allowance for its larger balance, non homogeneous loans using a methodology that incorporates (i) the probability of default for a given loan risk rating and (ii) historical default data over a multi year period. In accordance with the companys loan risk rating system, each loan, with the exception of those included in large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans, is assigned a risk rating (using a nine grade scale) by the originating loan officer, credit management, internal loan review or loan committee. Loans rated one represent those loans least likely to default while loans rated nine represent a loss. The probability of loans defaulting for each risk rating, referred to as default factors, are estimated based on the frequency with which loans migrate from one risk rating to another and to default status over time. Estimated loan default factors are multiplied by loan balances within each risk rating category and again multiplied by an historical loss given default estimate for each loan type (which incorporates estimated recoveries) to determine an appropriate level of allowance by loan type. The historical loss given default estimates are updated annually based on actual charge off experience. This approach is applied to the commercial, commercial real estate and equipment financing components of the loan portfolio. In developing this element of the allowance for loan losses, the company also gives consideration to certain qualitative factors, including the macroeconomic environment and any potential imprecision inherent in its loan loss model which may result from having limited historical loan loss data which, in turn, may result in inaccurate probability of default and loss given default factors. In consideration of these factors, the company may adjust the allowance for loan losses upward or downward based on current economic conditions and portfolio trends. In determining the extent of any such adjustment, the company considers both economic and portfolio specific data that correlates with loan losses. The company annually reviews this data to determine that such a correlation continues to exist. Additionally, at interim dates between annual reviews, the company evaluates the factors in order to conclude they continue to be adequate based on current economic conditions. Pools of smaller balance, homogeneous loans with similar risk and loss characteristics are also assessed for probable losses. These loan pools include residential mortgage, home equity and other consumer loans. This element of the allowance for loan losses is established based upon a consideration of recent historical loss experience, delinquency trends, and portfolio specific risk characteristics, including: (i) collateral values/loan to value ratios; (ii) borrower credit scores; (iii) portfolio concentrations; and (iv) other relevant portfolio risk elements. The allowance for loan losses also includes specific allowances for individually impaired loans. Generally, the companys impaired loans consist of (i) classified commercial loans in excess of $250,000 that have been placed on non accrual status and (ii) loans classified as TDRs. Individually impaired loans are measured based upon observable market prices; the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate; or, in the case of collateral dependent loans, fair values of the collateral (based on appraisals and other market information) less costs to sell. If the recorded investment in a loan exceeds the amount measured as described in the preceding sentence, a specific allowance for loan losses would be established as a component of the overall allowance for loan losses or, in the case of a collateral dependent loan, a charge off would be recorded for the difference between the loans recorded investment and managements estimate of the fair value of the collateral (less costs to sell). It would be rare for the company to identify a loan that meets the criteria stated above and requires a specific allowance or a charge off and not deem it impaired solely as a result of the existence of a guarantee. Peoples United Financial performs an analysis of its impaired loans, including collateral dependent impaired loans, on a quarterly basis. Individually impaired collateral dependent loans are measured based upon the appraised value of the underlying collateral and other market information. Generally, the companys policy is to obtain updated appraisals for commercial collateral dependent loans when the loan is downgraded to a risk rating of substandard or doubtful, and the most recent appraisal is more than 12 months old or a determination has been made that the property has experienced a significant decline in value. Appraisals are prepared by independent, licensed third party appraisers and are subject to review by the companys internal commercial appraisal department or external appraisers contracted by the commercial appraisal department. The conclusions of the external appraisal review are reviewed by the companys Chief Commercial Appraiser prior to acceptance. The companys policy with respect to impaired residential mortgage loans is to receive updated appraisals upon the loan being classified as non performing (typically upon becoming 90 days past due). 28 In determining the allowance for loan losses, Peoples United Financial gives appropriate consideration to the age of appraisals through its regular evaluation of other relevant qualitative and quantitative information. Specifically, between scheduled appraisals, property values are monitored within the commercial portfolio by reference to current originations of collateral dependent loans and the related appraisals obtained during underwriting as well as by reference to recent trends in commercial property sales as published by leading industry sources. Property values are monitored within the residential mortgage portfolio by reference to available market indicators, including real estate price indices within the companys primary lending areas. In most situations where a guarantee exists, the guarantee arrangement is not a specific factor in the assessment of the related allowance for loan losses. However, the assessment of a guarantors credit strength is reflected in the companys internal loan risk ratings which, in turn, are an important factor in its allowance for loan loss methodology for loans within the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios. Peoples United Financial did not change its methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses during 2010. While Peoples United Financial seeks to use the best available information in determining the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions, results of regulatory examinations, further information obtained regarding known problem loans, the identification of additional problem loans and other factors. Valuation of Derivative Financial Instruments. Peoples United Financial uses derivative financial instruments as components of its market risk management (principally to manage interest rate risk). Certain other derivatives are entered into in connection with transactions with commercial customers. Derivatives are not used for speculative purposes. Peoples United Financial generally applies hedge accounting to its derivatives used for market risk management purposes. Hedge accounting is permitted only if specific criteria are met, including a requirement that a highly effective relationship exist between the derivative instrument and the hedged item, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis. The hedge accounting method depends upon whether the derivative instrument is classified as a fair value hedge (i.e. hedging an exposure related to a recognized asset or liability, or a firm commitment) or a cash flow hedge (i.e. hedging an exposure related to the variability of future cash flows associated with a recognized asset or liability, or a forecasted transaction). Changes in the fair value of effective fair value hedges are recognized in current earnings (with the change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability also recorded in earnings). Changes in the fair value of effective cash flow hedges are recognized in other comprehensive income or loss until earnings are affected by the variability in cash flows of the designated hedged item. Ineffective portions of hedge results are recognized in current earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied are recognized in current earnings. Peoples United Financial formally documents at inception all relationships between the derivative instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as hedges to specific assets and liabilities, or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. Peoples United Financial also formally assesses, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged items. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective or has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, Peoples United Financial would discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. Gains or losses resulting from the termination of a derivative accounted for as a cash flow hedge remain in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and are amortized to earnings over the remaining period of the former hedging relationship, provided the hedged item continues to be outstanding. Peoples United Financial uses the dollar offset method, regression analysis and scenario analysis to assess hedge effectiveness at inception and on an ongoing basis. Such methods are chosen based on the nature of the hedge strategy and are used consistently throughout the life of the hedging relationship. 29 Interest rate lock commitments extended to borrowers relate to the origination of residential mortgage loans. To mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in these commitments, Peoples United Financial enters into mandatory delivery and best efforts contracts to sell adjustable rate and fixed rate residential mortgage loans (servicing released). Forward commitments to sell and interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans are considered derivatives and their respective estimated fair values are adjusted based on changes in interest rates. Asset Impairment Judgments Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are required to be reviewed for impairment at least annually, with impairment losses charged to expense when they occur. Acquisition related intangible assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives and are periodically reviewed by management to assess recoverability. Impairment losses on other acquisition related intangibles are recognized as a charge to expense if carrying amounts exceed fair values. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. The test is performed as of an annual impairment testing date or more frequently if a triggering event indicates that impairment may have occurred. The goodwill impairment analysis is a two step test. The first step (Step 1) is used to identify potential impairment, and involves comparing each reporting units estimated fair value to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not deemed to be impaired. Should the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceed its estimated fair value, an indicator of potential impairment is deemed to exist and a second step is performed to measure the amount of such impairment, if any. None of the companys identified reporting units are at risk of failing the Step 1 goodwill impairment test at this time. The second step (Step 2) involves calculating the implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which impairment was indicated in Step 1. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to how the amount of goodwill is determined in a business combination (i.e. by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, as determined in Step 1, over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities, and identifiable intangibles applicable to that reporting unit as of the impairment testing date). If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, no impairment exists. If the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to such excess. An impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit, and the loss (write down) establishes a new carrying amount for the goodwill. Subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted. In estimating the fair value of its reporting units, Peoples United Financial uses a present value measurement technique (discounted cash flow analysis based on internal forecasts) and, to a lesser extent, market based trading and transaction multiples. More weight is given to the discounted cash flow analysis as: (i) market based multiples are not deemed directly comparable given the difficulty in identifying operating entities that are substantially similar to the reporting units; (ii) market based multiples are not deemed to be highly reliable in periods of limited capital markets activity (such as that which has existed during the last several years); and (iii) internal forecasts provide an informed view of longer term performance based on the companys business plan and growth strategy. The discounted cash flow analysis is based on significant assumptions and judgments including future growth rates and discount rates reflecting managements assessment of market participant views of the risks associated with the projected cash flows of the reporting units. Differences in the identification of reporting units or in the selection of valuation techniques and related assumptions could result in materially different evaluations of goodwill impairment. Securities. Marketable equity and debt securities (other than those reported as short term investments) are classified as either trading account securities, held to maturity securities (applicable only to debt securities) or available for sale securities. Management determines the classification of a security at the time of its purchase. 30 Securities purchased for sale in the near term as well as those held by PSI (in accordance with the requirements for a broker dealer) are classified as trading account securities and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in non interest income. Debt securities for which Peoples United Financial has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity securities and reported at amortized cost. All other securities are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported on an after tax basis in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Premiums are amortized and discounts are accreted to interest income for debt securities, using the interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity, adjusted for the effect of actual prepayments in the case of mortgage backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and other asset backed securities. Management conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if the decline in fair value of any security is deemed to be other than temporary. Other than temporary impairment losses are recognized on debt securities when: (i) Peoples United Financial has an intention to sell the security; (ii) it is more likely than not that Peoples United Financial will be required to sell the security prior to recovery; or (iii) Peoples United Financial does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. Other than temporary losses are reflected in earnings as realized losses to the extent the impairment is related to credit losses. The amount of the impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income. Management has the ability and intent to hold the securities classified as held to maturity until they mature, at which time Peoples United Financial expects to receive full value for the securities. Non GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation to GAAP In addition to evaluating Peoples United Financials results of operations in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management routinely supplements this evaluation with an analysis of certain non GAAP financial measures, such as the efficiency and tangible equity ratios, tangible book value per share, and operating earnings. Management believes these non GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding Peoples United Financials underlying operating performance and trends, and facilitates comparisons with the performance of other banks and thrifts. Further, the efficiency ratio is used by management in its assessment of financial performance specifically as it relates to non interest expense control, while the tangible equity ratio and tangible book value per share are used to analyze the relative strength of Peoples United Financials capital position. The efficiency ratio, which represents an approximate measure of the cost required by Peoples United Financial to generate a dollar of revenue, is the ratio of (i) total non interest expense (excluding goodwill impairment charges, amortization of other acquisition related intangibles and fair value adjustments, losses on real estate assets and non recurring expenses) (the numerator) to (ii) net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis (excluding fair value adjustments) plus total non interest income (including the fully taxable equivalent adjustment on bank owned life insurance income, and excluding gains and losses on sales of assets, other than residential mortgage loans, and non recurring income) (the denominator). Peoples United Financial generally considers an item of income or expense to be non recurring if it is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type recorded within the last two years and is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type reasonably expected to be recorded within the following two years. Operating earnings exclude from net income those items that management considers to be of such a non recurring or infrequent nature that, by excluding such items (net of income taxes), Peoples United Financials results can be measured and assessed on a more consistent basis from period to period. Items excluded from operating earnings, which include, but are not limited to, merger related expenses, core system conversion costs, and one time charges related to executive level management separation agreements, are generally also excluded when calculating the efficiency ratio. Operating earnings per share is calculated by dividing operating earnings by the weighted average number of dilutive common shares outstanding for the respective period. 31 The tangible equity ratio is the ratio of (i) tangible stockholders equity (total stockholders equity less goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles) (the numerator) to (ii) tangible assets (total assets less goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles) (the denominator). Tangible book value per share is calculated by dividing tangible stockholders equity by common shares (total common shares issued, less common shares classified as treasury shares and unallocated ESOP common shares). In light of diversity in presentation among financial institutions, the methodologies used by Peoples United Financial for determining the non GAAP financial measures discussed above may differ from those used by other financial institutions. The following table summarizes Peoples United Financials efficiency ratio derived from amounts reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Economic Environment Peoples United Financials results are subject to fluctuations based on economic conditions. Economic activity in the United States has improved since the latter half of 2009 after slowing significantly throughout 2008. Real gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of 2.8% in the fourth quarter of 2010, after increasing 2.6% in the third quarter. The national unemployment rate was 9.4% as of December 31, 2010, down from 9.7% at the end of 2009. 33 In response to the significant disruptions in the capital markets brought about by the sub prime mortgage crisis and its after effects, turmoil in the financial sector, and the contracting U.S. economy, the Federal Reserve Board lowered the targeted federal funds rate ten times since September 2007, and established a target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to 0.25 percent as of December 16, 2008, which did not change throughout 2009 or 2010. The New England region is Peoples United Financials primary market area, with Connecticut and Vermont having the largest concentration of Peoples United Financials loans, deposits and branches. Connecticut is one of the most attractive markets in the United States with a total population of approximately 3.5 million and a median household income of $70,340 as of June 30, 2010, ranking second in the United States and well above the U.S. median income of $54,442, according to estimates from SNL Financial. Fairfield County, where Peoples United Financial is headquartered, has the highest median household income in Connecticut of $87,754 as of June 30, 2010 according to estimates from SNL Financial. The states unemployment rate increased to 9.0% as of December 31, 2010 compared to 8.9% at the end of 2009, but remains below the national rate. The Connecticut economy experienced a moderate increase in jobs in 2010, with total employment increasing by 5,300 jobs, or approximately 0.3%, from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010 compared to a decrease of 59,000 jobs, or approximately 3.5%, from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009. The median household income in Vermont was $53,811 as of June 30, 2010, comparable to the national level, and the states unemployment rate was 5.8% at December 31, 2010, down from 6.9% at the end of 2009 and still below the national rate. The overall outlook for the New England economy in 2011 is consistent with the rest of the United States, with the expectation that the region may experience continued high unemployment as long as the recessionary environment continues into 2011. Financial Overview Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009. Total assets at December 31, 2010 were $25.0 billion, a $3.8 billion increase from December 31, 2009, reflecting increases of $3.3 billion in total loans, $2.1 billion in securities and $462 million in goodwill, partially offset by a $2.4 billion decrease in short term investments and securities resale agreements. Peoples United Financial used short term investments of approximately $418 million to fund the cash consideration in the acquisitions completed in 2010 and approximately $845 million to repay borrowings assumed in these acquisitions (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The increase in total loans from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010 reflects the addition of loans acquired in connection with the acquisitions completed in 2010, as well as organic growth of $206 million in commercial real estate loans and $210 million in commercial and industrial loans. In addition, fixed rate residential mortgage loans increased $351 million, reflecting the addition of the acquisitions completed in 2010, as well as organic growth of $188 million, while adjustable rate residential mortgage loans decreased $60 million. Residential mortgage loans at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 included loans held for sale (substantially all to be sold servicing released) of $88.5 million and $71.3 million, respectively, which approximate fair value. At December 31, 2010, the carrying amount of the acquired loan portfolios totaled $2.9 billion. Non performing assets (excluding acquired non performing loans) totaled $303.1 million at December 31, 2010, a $97.5 million increase from December 31, 2009, primarily reflecting increases of $26.1 million in non performing residential mortgage loans, $20.8 million in non performing commercial and industrial loans, $15.4 million in non performing equipment financing loans, $10.1 million in non performing commercial real estate loans and $21.1 million in real estate owned (REO) and repossessed assets, $31.5 million of which resulted from acquisitions completed in 2010. The allowance for loan losses totaled $172.5 million at both December 31, 2010 and 2009. At December 31, 2010, the allowance for loan losses as a percent of originated loans was 1.18% and as a percent of originated non performing loans was 70.3%, compared to 1.21% and 102.2%, respectively, at December 31, 2009. 34 At December 31, 2010, liabilities totaled $19.8 billion, a $3.7 billion increase from December 31, 2009, reflecting increases of $2.5 billion in total deposits and $852 million in total borrowings. Peoples United Financial assumed deposits with a fair value of $2.5 billion in connection with the acquisitions completed in 2010 and retained FHLB advances and term repurchase agreements with fair values of $500 million and $27 million, respectively, in connection with the Smithtown and LSB acquisitions. Peoples United Financials total stockholders equity was $5.2 billion at December 31, 2010, a $119 million increase compared to $5.1 billion at December 31, 2009. This increase primarily reflects the issuance of 28.1 million shares of common stock with a fair value (net of issuance costs) of approximately $431 million in connection with the acquisitions completed in 2010 and net income of $85.7 million, partially offset by dividends paid of $218.1 million and the open market repurchase of 14.3 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $191.2 million. As a percentage of total assets, stockholders equity was 20.8% at December 31, 2010 compared to 24.0% at December 31, 2009. Tangible stockholders equity (total stockholders equity less goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles) as a percentage of tangible assets (total assets less goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles) was 14.1% of tangible assets at December 31, 2010 compared to 18.2% at December 31, 2009. Peoples United Banks leverage (core) capital ratio, and tier 1 and total risk based capital ratios were 11.4%, 13.6% and 14.5%, respectively, at December 31, 2010, compared to 10.0%, 13.1% and 14.1%, respectively, at December 31, 2009 (see Regulatory Capital Requirements). Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009. Peoples United Financial reported net income of $85.7 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $101.2 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, for the year ago period. Included in both the 2010 and 2009 results are pre tax merger related expenses, core system conversion costs and one time charges totaling $58.9 million and $4.5 million, respectively. Excluding the effect of these items, net income would have been $125.4 million, or $0.35 per share, for 2010 and $104.3 million, or $0.31 per share, for 2009. Peoples United Financial completed four acquisitions in 2010 and accordingly, the results of these acquired companies have been included beginning with their respective acquisition dates. Financial data for prior periods has not been restated and therefore, are not directly comparable to subsequent periods. In 2010, Peoples United Financials return on average tangible assets was 0.42% and return on average tangible stockholders equity was 2.4%, compared to 0.53% and 2.8%, respectively, in 2009. Net interest income increased $122.2 million from 2009 while the net interest margin increased 50 basis points to 3.69%. The higher net interest margin reflects higher investment income, the benefit from the Financial Federal acquisition completed in February 2010 and lower deposit costs, partially offset by the low interest rate environment and the companys asset sensitive balance sheet, including its significant excess capital position, a portion of which was invested in low yielding short term investments for most of 2010. Average earning assets increased $835 million compared to 2009, reflecting increases of $816 million in average loans and $645 million in average securities, partially offset by a $626 million decrease in average short term investments and securities resale agreements. Average funding liabilities increased $1.0 billion compared to 2009, reflecting a $925 million increase in average total deposits. Compared to 2009, total non interest income decreased $9.9 million and total non interest expense increased $126.6 million (see Non Interest Income and Non Interest Expense). The efficiency ratio was 73.3% in 2010 compared to 73.5% in 2009. 35 The provision for loan losses in 2010 totaled $60.0 million compared to $57.0 million in 2009. The provision for loan losses in 2010 reflected net loan charge offs of $60.0 million. The provision for loan losses in 2009 reflected net loan charge offs of $42.0 million and a $15.0 million increase in the allowance for loan losses. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average total loans were 0.39% in 2010 compared to 0.29% in 2009. Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. Total assets at December 31, 2009 were $21.3 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion from December 31, 2008, reflecting an increase of $2.4 billion in short term investments and securities resale agreements (largely attributable to an increase in total deposits as noted below), partially offset by decreases of $1.0 billion in securities and $332 million in total loans. The decrease in total loans from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009 reflects increases of $432 million in commercial real estate loans and $18 million in consumer loans, which were more than offset by decreases of $598 million in residential mortgage loans and $184 million in commercial loans. The decrease in residential mortgage loans reflects Peoples United Financials decision, at the time, to sell essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. Residential mortgage loans at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 included loans held for sale (all to be sold servicing released) of $71.3 million and $31.7 million, respectively, which approximate fair value. The increase in loans held for sale from December 31, 2008 reflects a higher backlog associated with an increase in residential mortgage refinancing activity as a result of the historically low interest rate environment. Non performing assets totaled $205.6 million at December 31, 2009, a $111.9 million increase from December 31, 2008, primarily reflecting increases of $42.6 million in non performing commercial real estate loans, $28.5 million in non performing residential mortgage loans, $14.8 million in non performing equipment financing loans and $27.4 million in real estate owned and repossessed assets. The allowance for loan losses totaled $172.5 million at December 31, 2009 compared to $157.5 million at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2009, the allowance for loan losses as a percent of originated loans was 1.21% and as a percent of non performing loans was 102.2%, compared to 1.08% and 186.8%, respectively, at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2009, liabilities totaled $16.2 billion, a $1.2 billion increase from December 31, 2008, reflecting a $1.2 billion increase in total deposits. Peoples United Financials total stockholders equity was $5.1 billion at December 31, 2009, a $73 million decrease from December 31, 2008. The decrease primarily reflects dividends paid of $203.6 million, partially offset by net income of $101.2 million. As a percentage of total assets, stockholders equity was 24.0% at December 31, 2009 compared to 25.7% at December 31, 2008. Tangible stockholders equity as a percentage of tangible assets was 18.2% at December 31, 2009 compared to 19.5% at December 31, 2008. Peoples United Banks leverage (core) capital ratio, and tier 1 and total risk based capital ratios were 10.0%, 13.1% and 14.1%, respectively, at December 31, 2009, compared to 10.0%, 12.2% and 13.4%, respectively, at December 31, 2008 (see Regulatory Capital Requirements). Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. Peoples United Financial reported net income of $101.2 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $137.8 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, for the year ago period. Included in the 2008 results are merger related expenses totaling $41.0 million, other one time charges totaling $14.8 million and a $6.9 million gain related to the Visa, Inc. initial public offering (IPO). The net impact of these items reduced 2008 net income by $33.2 million, or $0.10 per diluted share. In 2009, Peoples United Financials return on average tangible assets was 0.53% and return on average tangible stockholders equity was 2.8%, compared to 0.73% and 3.7%, respectively, in 2008. 36 Net interest income decreased $59.6 million from 2008 while the net interest margin declined 43 basis points to 3.19%. The lower net interest margin reflects the interest rate cuts initiated by the Federal Reserve Board throughout 2008, and the companys asset sensitive balance sheet, including its significant excess capital position, a portion of which was invested in low yielding short term investments and securities resale agreements. Average earning assets increased $535 million compared to 2008, reflecting increases of $551 million in average short term investments and securities resale agreements, and $59 million in average loans, partially offset by a decrease of $75 million in average securities. Average funding liabilities increased $431 million compared to 2008, reflecting a $422 million increase in average total deposits. Compared to 2008, total non interest income increased $5.5 million and total non interest expense decreased $24.4 million (see Non Interest Income and Non Interest Expense). The efficiency ratio was 73.5% in 2009 compared to 66.6% in 2008. The provision for loan losses in 2009 was $57.0 million compared to $26.2 million in 2008. The provision for loan losses in 2009 reflected net loan charge offs of $42.0 million and a $15.0 million increase in the allowance for loan losses. The provision for loan losses in 2008 reflected net loan charge offs of $14.9 million and an $11.3 million increase in the allowance for loan losses, including a $4.5 million increase resulting from the alignment of the former Chittenden allowance for loan losses methodology with that of Peoples United Financial. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average total loans were 0.29% in 2009 compared to 0.10% in 2008. Business Segment Results Peoples United Financials operations are divided into three primary business segments that represent its core businesses: Commercial Banking, Retail and Business Banking, and Wealth Management. In addition, the Treasury area manages Peoples United Financials securities portfolio, short term investments and securities resale agreements, wholesale borrowings and the funding center. Business Segment Performance Summary Net Income Years ended December 31 (in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Commercial Banking $ 94.8 $ 81.8 $ 94.9 Retail and Business Banking 57.0 79.0 98.1 Wealth Management (4.2 ) (1.9 ) 5.4 Total segments 147.6 158.9 198.4 Treasury (33.1 ) (68.8 ) (63.6 ) Other (28.8 ) 11.1 3.0 Total Consolidated $ 85.7 $ 101.2 $ 137.8 Peoples United Financial uses an internal profitability reporting system to generate information by operating segment, which is based on a series of management estimates and allocations regarding funds transfer pricing (FTP), the provision for loan losses, non interest expense and income taxes. These estimates and allocations, some of which can be subjective in nature, are continually being reviewed and refined. Any changes in estimates and allocations that may affect the reported results of any business segment will not affect the consolidated financial position or results of operations of Peoples United Financial as a whole. FTP is used in the calculation of each operating segments net interest income, and measures the value of funds used in and provided by an operating segment. The difference between the interest income on earning assets and the interest expense on funding liabilities, and the corresponding FTP charge for interest income or credit for interest expense, results in net spread income (see Treasury). 37 A five year rolling average net charge off rate is used as the basis for the provision for loan losses for the respective segment. Peoples United Financial allocates a majority of non interest expenses to each business segment using a full absorption costing process. Direct and indirect costs are analyzed and pooled by process and assigned to the appropriate business segment and corporate overhead costs are allocated to the business segments. Income tax expense is allocated to each business segment using a constant rate, based on an estimate of the consolidated effective income tax rate for the year. Total average assets and total average liabilities are reported for each business segment due to managements reliance, in part, on such average balances for purposes of assessing business segment performance. These averages include allocated goodwill and intangible assets. The reported assets of each business segment include allocated goodwill and intangible assets, both of which are reviewed for impairment at least annually. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level and involves a two step test. The first step (Step 1) is used to identify potential impairment, and involves comparing each reporting units estimated fair value to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not deemed to be impaired. Should the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceed its estimated fair value, an indicator of potential impairment is deemed to exist and a second step is performed to measure the amount of such impairment, if any. None of the companys identified reporting units are at risk of failing the Step 1 goodwill impairment test at this time. For a more detailed description of the estimates and allocations used to measure business segment performance, see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Commercial Banking consists principally of commercial and industrial lending, commercial real estate lending and commercial deposit gathering activities. This segment also includes the equipment financing operations of PCLC and PUEFC, as well as cash management, correspondent banking and municipal banking. Years ended December 31 (in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net interest income $ 303.9 $ 255.3 $ 266.5 Provision for loan losses 26.1 22.0 18.7 Total non interest income 56.7 41.3 41.7 Total non interest expense 193.6 153.8 145.9 Income before income tax expense 140.9 120.8 143.6 Income tax expense 46.1 39.0 48.7 Net income $ 94.8 $ 81.8 $ 94.9 Total average assets $ 10,957.0 $ 9,846.0 $ 9,310.4 Total average liabilities 2,226.5 2,423.2 2,397.3 Commercial Banking net income increased $13.0 million in 2010 compared to 2009, reflecting the benefits from the Financial Federal acquisition completed in February 2010. The $48.6 million increase in net interest income reflects an increase in average earning assets (see below) as well as improved spreads on commercial loans, partially offset by narrowing spreads on commercial deposits. The $15.4 million increase in non interest income primarily reflects increases in operating lease income resulting from a higher level of equipment leased to PCLC customers and commercial banking fees. The $39.8 million increase in non interest expense reflects PUEFC non interest expenses in 2010, increases in amortization expense on leased equipment and higher direct expenses due to the continued loan growth in Commercial Banking. The total average commercial banking loan portfolio increased $1.2 billion in 2010 compared to 2009, reflecting the Financial Federal acquisition (average of $903 million in 2010) as well as other acquisitions completed in 2010, and a $386 million increase in average commercial real estate loans. 38 Commercial Banking net income decreased $13.1 million in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily reflecting a decrease in net interest income and increases in the provision for loan losses and non interest expense. The $11.2 million decrease in net interest income in 2009 reflects the negative impact of interest rate cuts initiated by the Federal Reserve Board throughout 2008, partially offset by an increase in average earning assets. The $7.9 million increase in non interest expense compared to 2008 reflects increased amortization expense on leased equipment, as well as higher direct and allocated support costs due to continued loan growth in Commercial Banking. The total average commercial banking loan portfolio increased $493 million in 2009 compared to 2008, reflecting increases of $388 million in average commercial real estate loans and $185 million in average equipment financing loans, partially offset by an $80 million decrease in average commercial loans. Retail and Business Banking includes, as its principal business lines, consumer and business deposit gathering activities, consumer lending (including residential mortgage, home equity and indirect auto lending), business lending and merchant services. Years ended December 31 (in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net interest income $ 383.1 $ 374.9 $ 397.8 Provision for loan losses 6.9 4.8 5.5 Total non interest income 155.7 159.9 155.0 Total non interest expense 447.2 413.2 398.9 Income before income tax expense 84.7 116.8 148.4 Income tax expense 27.7 37.8 50.3 Net income $ 57.0 $ 79.0 $ 98.1 Total average assets $ 5,789.0 $ 5,874.0 $ 6,467.0 Total average liabilities 13,800.3 12,557.1 12,123.3 Retail and Business Banking net income decreased $22.0 million in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily reflecting increases in non interest expense and the provision for loan losses and a decline in non interest income, partially offset by an increase in net interest income. The $8.2 million increase in net interest income primarily reflects the growth in deposit balances (see below) and an increase in the spread on residential mortgages, partially offset by narrower spreads on deposit products resulting from the continued negative impact of a reduced interest rate environment initiated by the Federal Reserve Board in 2008, and lower residential mortgage balances. Average residential mortgage loans decreased $350 million compared to 2009, reflecting Peoples United Financials past practice, through May 2010, of selling essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. The decrease in non interest income compared to 2009 reflects a $1.8 million decline in net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans resulting from the lower level of residential mortgage loan sales in 2010. The $34.0 million increase in non interest expense compared to 2009 reflects increases in direct and allocated expenses associated with expanding the retail deposit franchise through acquisitions as well as organic growth. Average liabilities increased $1.2 billion compared to 2009. Average deposits increased $925 million, reflecting increases of $215 million in average non interest bearing deposits and $1.1 billion in average savings and money market deposits, partially offset by a $433 million decrease in average time deposits. 39 Retail and Business Banking net income decreased $19.1 million in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily reflecting a decrease in net interest income and an increase in non interest expense. The $22.9 million decrease in net interest income primarily reflects narrower spreads on deposit products resulting from the negative impact of interest rate cuts initiated by the Federal Reserve Board throughout 2008, and lower residential mortgage interest income, reflecting Peoples United Financials decision at the time to sell essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. The increase in non interest income in 2009 reflects a $7.4 million increase in net gains on sales of residential mortgages resulting from the higher level of residential mortgage loan sales due to an increase in refinancing activity in 2009 given the historically low interest rate environment at the time. The increase in non interest expense compared to 2008 primarily reflects an increase in direct expenses. In 2009, total average assets decreased $593 million compared to 2008, reflecting a $640 million decrease in residential mortgage loans, and total average liabilities increased $434 million reflecting a $422 million increase in average deposits. Wealth Management consists of trust services, corporate trust, brokerage, financial advisory services, investment management services and life insurance provided by Peoples Securities, Inc., other insurance services provided through Peoples United Insurance Agency, Inc. and private banking.

The decrease in insurance revenue primarily reflects the continued soft insurance market resulting from the contracting economy. The declines in investment management fees and brokerage commissions primarily reflect the uncertainty in the equity markets and broader economic weakness experienced throughout 2009 and 2010. Wealth Managements net loss in 2009 compared to net income in 2008 primarily reflects a decrease in non interest income. The decrease in non interest income in 2009 reflects decreases in investment management fees and brokerage commissions of $4.4 million and $3.8 million, respectively, primarily reflecting the uncertainty in the equity markets and broader economic weakness experienced throughout 2009, and a $3.3 million decline in insurance revenue, reflecting the continued soft insurance market resulting from the contracting economy. Assets managed and administered, which are not reported as assets of Peoples United Financial, totaled $17.0 billion at December 31, 2010 compared to $16.2 billion at December 31, 2009. 40 Treasury encompasses the securities portfolio, short term investments and securities resale agreements, wholesale borrowings, and the funding center, which includes the impact of derivative financial instruments used for risk management purposes. The income or loss for the funding center represents the interest rate risk component of Peoples United Financials net interest income as calculated by its FTP model in deriving each business segments net interest income. Under this process, a money desk (the funding center) buys funds from liability generating business lines (such as consumer deposits) and sells funds to asset generating business lines (such as commercial lending). The price at which funds are bought and sold on any given day is set by Peoples United Financials treasury group and is based on the wholesale cost to Peoples United Financial of assets and liabilities with similar maturities. Liability generating businesses sell newly originated liabilities to the money desk and recognize a funding credit, while asset generating businesses buy funding for newly originated assets from the money desk and recognize a funding charge. Once funding for an asset is purchased from or a liability is sold to the money desk, the price that is set by the treasury group will remain with that asset or liability until it matures or reprices, which effectively transfers responsibility for managing interest rate risk to the treasury group. Years ended December 31 (in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net interest loss $ (53.3 ) $ (127.1 ) $ (111.8 ) Total non interest income 15.4 28.1 10.4 Total non interest expense 11.3 7.3 (0.7 ) Loss before income tax benefit (49.2 ) (106.3 ) (100.7 ) Income tax benefit (16.1 ) (37.5 ) (37.1 ) Net loss $ (33.1 ) $ (68.8 ) $ (63.6 ) Total average assets $ 3,924.7 $ 3,957.6 $ 3,303.0 Total average liabilities 126.4 90.7 181.6 Treasurys net loss in 2010 was reduced by $35.7 million compared to 2009, reflecting a decrease in net interest loss, partially offset by a decrease in non interest income and an increase in non interest expense. The $73.8 million decrease in net interest loss reflects an increase in the funding centers net interest spread, which is primarily due to the historically low interest rate environment over an extended period of time, resulting in long term funding costs declining more than asset yields, reflecting the asset sensitive position of Peoples United Financials balance sheet. The decrease in non interest income primarily reflects net security losses in 2010 of $1.0 million compared to net security gains of $16.6 million in 2009, partially offset by an increase in revenues relating to derivative contracts with commercial customers. The increase in non interest expense primarily reflects higher costs relating to derivative transactions entered into with commercial customers. Total average assets decreased $33 million in 2010 compared to 2009. Average securities increased $645 million and average short term investments and securities resale agreements decreased $626 million. The increase in Treasurys loss in 2009 compared to 2008 reflects increases in the net interest loss and non interest expense, partially offset by an increase in non interest income. The increase in net interest loss reflects a $27.4 million increase in the funding centers net spread loss, primarily due to the 400 basis point decline in the targeted federal funds rate during 2008 and the asset sensitive position of Peoples United Financials balance sheet. 41 The increase in non interest income reflects revenues relating to derivative transactions entered into with commercial customers, in addition to net security gains of $16.6 million in 2009 (primarily resulting from the sale of residential mortgage backed securities with an amortized cost of $1.03 billion) compared to net security gains of $1.3 million in 2008. The increase in non interest expense in 2009 reflects costs related to derivative transactions entered into with commercial customers. Total average assets increased $655 million in 2009 compared to 2008. Average short term investments and securities resale agreements increased $551 million, and average securities decreased $75 million. Other includes the residual financial impact from the allocation of revenues and expenses (including the provision for loan losses) and certain revenues and expenses not attributable to a particular segment, and the FTP impact from excess capital. This category also includes certain nonrecurring items, including merger related expenses, core system conversion costs and one time charges totaling $58.9 million, $4.5 million and $51.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively; $4.4 million of benefit related and other charges for the year ended December 31, 2009 (included in total non interest expense); a $5.6 million gain related to the sale of the companys remaining Class B Visa shares and a $1.4 million gain on sale of two branches (included in total non interest income for the year ended December 31, 2009); and $6.9 million of gains related to the Visa IPO and a $1.4 million gain on sale of two branches (included in total non interest income for the year ended December 31, 2008). Included in Other are assets such as cash, premises and equipment, and other assets, including pension assets.

Net Interest Margin Years ended December 31 (percent) Net Interest Income FTE Years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) In response to the significant disruptions in the capital markets brought about by the sub prime mortgage crisis and its after effects, turmoil in the financial sector, and the contracting U.S. economy, the Federal Reserve Board lowered the targeted federal funds rate ten times beginning in September 2007, and established a target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to 0.25 percent as of December 16, 2008, which did not change throughout 2009 or 2010. The improvement in the net interest margin in 2010 reflects the benefit from an increase in investment income, acquisitions and lower deposit costs. However, the net interest margin continues to be impacted by the historically low interest rate environment, given the asset sensitive position of Peoples United Financials balance sheet, including the investment of a portion of the companys significant excess capital position in low yielding short term investments and securities resale agreements for most of 2010. 43 2010 Compared to 2009 The net interest margin increased 50 basis points to 3.69% compared to 2009. The higher net interest margin reflects higher investment income, the benefit from the Financial Federal acquisition completed in February 2010 and lower deposit costs, partially offset by the low interest rate environment and the companys asset sensitive balance sheet, including its significant excess capital position, a portion of which was invested in low yielding short term investments for most of 2010. Net interest income (FTE basis) increased $122.1 million, reflecting a $61.9 million increase in total interest and dividend income and a $60.2 million decrease in total interest expense. Average earning assets totaled $19.0 billion in 2010, an $835 million increase from 2009, reflecting increases of $816 million in average loans and $645 million in average securities, partially offset by a $626 million decrease in average short term investments and securities resale agreements. Average loans, average short term investments and securities resale agreements, and average securities comprised 80%, 12% and 8%, respectively, of average earning assets in 2010 compared to 79%, 16% and 5%, respectively, in the 2009 period. In 2010, the yield earned on the total loan portfolio was 5.12% and the yield earned on securities, short term investments and securities resale agreements was 1.30%, compared to 5.05% and 1.06%, respectively, in 2009. Excluding adjustable rate residential mortgage loans, which are mostly of the hybrid variety, approximately 45% of the loan portfolio had floating interest rates at December 31, 2010 compared to approximately 44% at December 31, 2009. The total average commercial banking loan portfolio increased $1.2 billion, reflecting the addition of the PUEFC portfolio (average of $903 million in 2010) and other acquisitions completed in 2010, and a $386 million increase in average commercial real estate loans. Average residential mortgage loans decreased $350 million compared to 2009, reflecting Peoples United Financials past practice, through May 2010, of selling essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. Average consumer loans decreased $65 million, reflecting declines of $46 million in average indirect auto loans and $15 million in average home equity loans. Average funding liabilities totaled $16.3 billion in 2010, a $1.0 billion increase compared to 2009, primarily reflecting a $925 million increase in average total deposits. Average savings and money market deposits and average non interest bearing deposits increased $1.1 billion and $215 million, respectively, and average time deposits decreased $433 million. Average total deposits comprised 97% and 98% of average funding liabilities in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 45 basis point decrease to 0.80% from 1.25% in the rate paid on average funding liabilities in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily reflects the decrease in market interest rates and the shift in deposit mix. The rates paid on average total deposits decreased 45 basis points in 2010, reflecting decreases of 108 basis points in time deposits and 12 basis points in savings and money market deposits. Average savings and money market deposits and average time deposits comprised 50% and 29%, respectively, of average total deposits in 2010 compared to 45% and 33%, respectively, in 2009. 44 2009 Compared to 2008 The net interest margin declined 43 basis points to 3.19% compared to 2008. The lower net interest margin reflects the dramatic actions taken by the Federal Reserve Board and the companys asset sensitive balance sheet, including its significant excess capital position, a portion of which was invested in low yielding short term investments and securities resale agreements. Net interest income decreased $60.1 million, reflecting a $150.9 million decrease in total interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $90.8 million decrease in total interest expense. Average earning assets totaled $18.2 billion in 2009, a $535 million increase from 2008, reflecting increases in average short term investments and securities resale agreements of $551 million and average loans of $59 million, partially offset by a decrease in average securities of $75 million. Average loans, average short term investments and securities resale agreements, and average securities comprised 79%, 16% and 5%, respectively, of average earning assets in 2009 compared to 82%, 12% and 6%, respectively, in 2008. In 2009, the yield earned on the total loan portfolio was 5.05% and the yield earned on securities, short term investments and securities resale agreements was 1.06%, compared to 5.80% and 2.61%, respectively, in 2008. The total average commercial banking loan portfolio increased $493 million, reflecting increases of $388 million in average commercial real estate loans and $185 million in average equipment financing loans, partially offset by an $80 million decrease in average commercial loans. Average residential mortgage loans decreased $640 million compared to 2008, reflecting Peoples United Financials decision at the time to sell essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. Average consumer loans increased $206 million, including a $202 million increase in average home equity loans. Average funding liabilities totaled $15.2 billion in 2009, a $431 million increase compared to 2008, primarily reflecting a $422 million increase in average total deposits. Average savings and money market deposits and average non interest bearing deposits increased $507 million and $73 million, respectively, and average time deposits decreased $158 million. Average total deposits comprised 98% of average funding liabilities in both 2009 and 2008. The 65 basis point decrease to 1.25% from 1.90% in the rate paid on average funding liabilities in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily reflects the decrease in market interest rates and the shift in deposit mix. The rates paid on average total deposits decreased 65 basis points in 2009, reflecting decreases of 106 basis points in time deposits and 55 basis points in savings and money market deposits. Average savings and money market deposits and average time deposits comprised 45% and 33%, respectively, of average total deposits in 2009 compared to 43% and 35%, respectively, in 2008. Average Balance Sheet, Interest and Yield/Rate Analysis The table on the following page presents average balance sheets, interest income, interest expense and the corresponding average yields earned and rates paid for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. The average balances are principally daily averages and, for loans, include both performing and non performing balances. Interest income on loans includes the effect of deferred loan fees and costs accounted for as yield adjustments, but does not include interest on loans for which Peoples United Financial has ceased to accrue interest. Premium amortization and discount accretion (including amounts attributable to purchase accounting adjustments) are also included in the respective interest income and interest expense amounts. The impact of Peoples United Financials use of derivative instruments in managing interest rate risk is also reflected in the table, classified according to the instrument hedged and the related risk management objective. 45 Average Balance Sheet, Interest and Yield/Rate Analysis 2010 2009 2008 Years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) AverageBalance Interest Yield/Rate AverageBalance Interest Yield/Rate AverageBalance Interest Yield/Rate Assets: Short term investments $ 1,725.0 $ 4.6 0.27 % $ 2,386.5 $ 6.5 0.27 % $ 1,946.7 $ 46.9 2.41 % Securities purchased under agreements to resell 456.2 0.9 0.20 421.1 0.8 0.19 310.2 7.5 2.43 Securities (1) 1,579.5 43.5 2.76 934.2 32.4 3.47 1,009.1 30.8 3.05 Loans: Commercial real estate 5,594.8 312.1 5.58 5,208.5 287.8 5.52 4,820.8 302.1 6.27 Commercial (2) 4,961.9 269.6 5.43 4,116.7 202.3 4.91 4,011.1 233.0 5.81 Residential mortgage 2,529.7 111.8 4.42 2,880.1 145.0 5.04 3,519.9 189.9 5.40 Consumer 2,199.2 89.6 4.07 2,264.4 95.4 4.21 2,058.4 110.9 5.39 Total loans 15,285.6 783.1 5.12 14,469.7 730.5 5.05 14,410.2 835.9 5.80 Total earning assets 19,046.3 $ 832.1 4.37 % 18,211.5 $ 770.2 4.23 % 17,676.2 $ 921.1 5.21 % Other assets 2,969.9 2,546.0 2,696.8 Total assets $ 22,016.2 $ 20,757.5 $ 20,373.0 Liabilities and stockholders equity: Deposits: Non interest bearing $ 3,426.0 $ % $ 3,210.8 $ % $ 3,137.9 $ % Savings, interest bearing checking and money market 7,853.6 47.4 0.60 6,710.6 48.2 0.72 6,203.9 78.5 1.27 Time 4,533.5 65.4 1.44 4,966.9 125.2 2.52 5,125.0 183.6 3.58 Total deposits 15,813.1 112.8 0.71 14,888.3 173.4 1.16 14,466.8 262.1 1.81 Borrowings: Repurchase agreements 211.7 1.0 0.49 151.2 0.7 0.46 123.0 2.1 1.72 FHLB advances 52.3 1.1 2.22 14.8 0.8 5.28 16.2 0.8 5.16 Federal funds purchased/other 6.5 0.2 2.70 2.1 1.92 19.1 0.6 3.01 Total borrowings 270.5 2.3 0.88 168.1 1.5 0.90 158.3 3.5 2.23 Subordinated notes and debentures 179.6 14.7 8.17 181.2 15.1 8.35 181.4 15.2 8.34 Total funding liabilities 16,263.2 $ 129.8 0.80 % 15,237.6 $ 190.0 1.25 % 14,806.5 $ 280.8 1.90 % Other liabilities 384.7 378.5 353.9 Total liabilities 16,647.9 15,616.1 15,160.4 Stockholders equity 5,368.3 5,141.4 5,212.6 Total liabilities and stockholders equity $ 22,016.2 $ 20,757.5 $ 20,373.0 Net interest income/spread (3) $ 702.3 3.57 % $ 580.2 2.98 % $ 640.3 3.31 % Net interest margin 3.69 % 3.19 % 3.62 % (1) Average balances and yields for securities available for sale are based on amortized cost.

For each category of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, information is provided relating to: changes in volume (changes in average balances multiplied by the prior years average interest rate); changes in rates (changes in average interest rates multiplied by the prior years average balance); and the total change. Changes attributable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately. 2010 Compared to 2009Increase (Decrease) 2009 Compared to 2008Increase (Decrease) (in millions) Volume Rate Total Volume Rate Total Interest and dividend income: Short term investments $ (1.8 ) $ (0.1 ) $ (1.9 ) $ 8.7 $ (49.1 ) $ (40.4 ) Securities purchased under agreements to resell 0.1 0.1 2.0 (8.7 ) (6.7 ) Securities 18.8 (7.7 ) 11.1 (2.4 ) 4.0 1.6 Loans: Commercial real estate 21.5 2.8 24.3 23.1 (37.4 ) (14.3 ) Commercial 44.4 22.9 67.3 6.0 (36.7 ) (30.7 ) Residential mortgage (16.6 ) (16.6 ) (33.2 ) (32.8 ) (12.1 ) (44.9 ) Consumer (2.6 ) (3.2 ) (5.8 ) 10.3 (25.8 ) (15.5 ) Total loans 46.7 5.9 52.6 6.6 (112.0 ) (105.4 ) Total change in interest and dividend income 63.7 (1.8 ) 61.9 14.9 (165.8 ) (150.9 ) Interest expense: Deposits: Savings, interest bearing checking and money market 7.5 (8.3 ) (0.8 ) 6.0 (36.3 ) (30.3 ) Time (10.1 ) (49.7 ) (59.8 ) (5.5 ) (52.9 ) (58.4 ) Total deposits (2.6 ) (58.0 ) (60.6 ) 0.5 (89.2 ) (88.7 ) Borrowings: Repurchase agreements 0.3 0.3 0.4 (1.8 ) (1.4 ) FHLB advances 1.0 (0.7 ) 0.3 (0.1 ) 0.1 Federal funds purchased/other 0.1 0.1 0.2 (0.4 ) (0.2 ) (0.6 ) Total borrowings 1.4 (0.6 ) 0.8 (0.1 ) (1.9 ) (2.0 ) Subordinated notes and debentures (0.1 ) (0.3 ) (0.4 ) (0.1 ) (0.1 ) Total change in interest expense (1.3 ) (58.9 ) (60.2 ) 0.3 (91.1 ) (90.8 ) Change in net interest income $ 65.0 $ 57.1 $ 122.1 $ 14.6 $ (74.7 ) $ (60.1 ) 47 The following table provides the weighted average yields earned and rates paid for each major category of earning assets and funding liabilities as of December 31, 2010.

The level of investment management fees and brokerage commissions in recent years primarily reflects the uncertainty in the equity markets and broader economic weakness experienced throughout 2009 and 2010. The decrease in insurance revenue primarily reflects the continued soft insurance market resulting from the contracting economy. Security losses in 2010 resulted from the sale of securities acquired in the Smithtown and LSB acquisitions as a result of changes in market interest rates occurring subsequent to the acquisition date (November 30, 2010). In 2009, Peoples United Financial sold residential mortgage backed securities with an amortized cost of $1.03 billion and recorded security gains totaling $16.9 million. Proceeds from sales transactions occurring during 2009 were subsequently reinvested in residential mortgage backed securities with substantially equivalent maturities and yields. This investment portfolio repositioning was undertaken to mitigate prepayment risk. Net security gains in 2009 also include a gain of $5.6 million (included in equity securities gains in the above table) resulting from the sale of Peoples United Financials remaining Class B Visa shares that are described below. Including other minor gains and losses, net security gains totaled $22.0 million in 2009. In 2008, Peoples United Financial recorded a gain of $5.6 million resulting from the mandatory redemption of a portion of its Class B Visa, Inc. shares as part of Visas IPO. Peoples United Financial obtained its ownership in Visa shares as a result of its acquisition of Chittenden, which was a Visa member. In addition, Peoples United Financial recorded a gain of $1.3 million representing its proportionate share of the litigation reserve escrow account established by Visa in conjunction with its IPO. The foregoing Visa gains are included in equity securities gains in the above table. Securities gains in 2008 also include gains of $1.5 million resulting from the sale of securities acquired in the Chittenden acquisition as a result of changes in market interest rates occurring subsequent to the acquisition date (January 1, 2008). The fluctuation in payment processing volume is the primary driver for the variances in merchant services income. The decline in net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans in 2010 compared to 2009 reflects the lower level of residential mortgage loan sales (a 20% decline in volume from 2009) due to the lower level of refinancing activity in 2010 and the companys change in strategy to hold certain newly originated residential mortgage loans, while the increase in 2009 compared to 2008 reflects the higher level of residential mortgage loan sales (a 97% increase in volume from 2008) due to an increase in refinancing activity in 2009 given the historically low interest rate environment at the time. BOLI income totaled $6.7 million ($10.3 million on a taxable equivalent basis) in 2010, compared to $8.4 million ($12.9 million on a taxable equivalent basis) in 2009 and $8.3 million ($12.8 million on a taxable equivalent basis) in 2008. The decrease from 2009 primarily reflects a lower crediting rate in 2010. The increases in operating lease income and commercial fees reflect a higher level of equipment leased to PCLC customers and commercial banking fees, while other non interest income reflects an increase in revenues relating to derivative contracts with commercial customers. 49 Non Interest Expense Percentage Increase (Decrease) Years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 2010/2009 2009/2008 Compensation and benefits $ 380.4 $ 350.5 $ 344.6 8.5 % 1.7 % Occupancy and equipment 114.4 109.8 110.3 4.2 (0.5 ) Professional and outside service fees 72.7 44.0 48.0 65.2 (8.3 ) Merchant services expense 21.2 21.0 23.9 1.0 (12.1 ) Other non interest expense: Regulatory 27.7 30.8 8.0 (10.1 ) 285.0 Amortization of other acquisition related intangibles 21.7 20.6 21.3 5.3 (3.3 ) Stationery, printing, postage and telephone 20.5 17.9 19.8 14.5 (9.6 ) Advertising and promotion 17.3 14.1 15.2 22.7 (7.2 ) Amortization of leased equipment 16.1 12.3 8.3 30.9 48.2 Executive level separation agreement 15.3 n/m n/m Other 80.6 61.6 73.1 30.8 (15.7 ) Total other non interest expense 199.2 157.3 145.7 26.6 8.0 Total 787.9 682.6 672.5 15.4 1.5 Merger related expenses 23.3 2.0 36.5 n/m n/m Total non interest expense $ 811.2 $ 684.6 $ 709.0 18.5 % (3.4 )% Efficiency ratio 73.3 % 73.5 % 66.6 % Excluding the effect of merger related expenses recorded in each year, total non interest expense in 2010 increased $105.3 million compared to 2009 and increased $10.1 million in 2009 compared to 2008. Merger related expenses in 2010 consisted of: (i) fees for investment advisory, legal, accounting and valuation services; (ii) debt prepayment costs; (iii) compensatory charges; and (iv) regulatory filings. Merger related expenses in 2008 consisted of asset impairment charges of $19.3 million (principally to write off certain capitalized costs), costs relating to severance and branch closings of $10.5 million and other accrued liabilities of $6.7 million. Included in total non interest expense in 2010 and 2009 are $20.3 million and $2.5 million, respectively, of core system conversion costs. Also included in 2010 is $15.3 million related to costs incurred in connection with the former CEO separation agreement. The higher efficiency ratio in 2010 and 2009 compared to 2008 primarily reflects the decline in interest rates that negatively impacted net interest income (see Non GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation to GAAP). The increase in compensation and benefits in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily reflects normal merit increases, higher benefit related and stock based compensation costs, costs related to the core system conversion and additional compensation and benefit costs from acquisitions completed in 2010. The increase in compensation and benefits in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily reflects normal merit increases, higher benefits related and stock based compensation costs, partially offset by previously disclosed cost savings initiatives. 50 In March 2010, comprehensive health care reform legislation was signed into law under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the Acts). Included among the major provisions of the law is a change in tax treatment of the federal drug subsidy paid with respect to Medicare eligible retirees. The effect of the Acts on the companys other postretirement benefits obligation, which totaled $10.7 million at December 31, 2010, and related net periodic benefit expense, which totaled $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, depends on finalization of related regulatory requirements; however, the impact is not expected to be material. Peoples United Financial will continue to monitor and assess the effect of the Acts as the regulatory requirements are finalized. Costs recorded in 2010 related to the core system conversion and computer system servicing costs, and expenses related to the trade name and rebranding initiative (see below) are the principal reason for the variances in professional and outside services, and advertising and promotion. The fluctuation in payment processing volume is the primary driver for the variances in merchant services expense. In connection with Peoples United Financials acquisition of Chittenden Corporation (Chittenden) in January 2008, a trade name intangible asset with a fair value of $122.7 million was established and assigned an indefinite useful life based on managements intentions at that time. In June 2010, Peoples United Financial announced a plan to re brand, as Peoples United Bank, the former Chittenden banks in connection with the scheduled completion of its core system conversion in July 2010. Management believes the name change better leverages the Peoples United brand and the full range of services available to its customers. As a result of the decision to re brand the Chittenden banks, the useful life of the trade name intangible asset was no longer deemed to be indefinite and management was required to perform a final impairment test prior to amortizing the asset over its estimated remaining useful life beginning July 1, 2010. Peoples United Financial performed its final trade name impairment test as of June 30, 2010 and determined that the fair value of the trade name intangible exceeded its carrying amount. As a result, no impairment loss was recognized. The trade name intangible will be amortized on an accelerated basis over a period of approximately 20 years, reflecting the manner in which the related benefit is realized. The increase in amortization expense of leased equipment in 2010 and 2009 relates to the higher level of equipment leased to PCLC customers. The FDIC authorized higher premium assessments in 2009 pursuant to a restoration plan designed to increase the DIF reserve ratio to required levels. Under the FDICs restoration plan, the premium assessment rate was raised uniformly by seven basis points beginning on January 1, 2009 resulting in an initial base assessment rate of 12 basis points for Peoples United Bank. Furthermore, the premium assessment rate in effect beginning April 1, 2009 was subject to adjustments based on each institutions risk profile, which could affect its initial base assessment rate. On May 22, 2009, the FDIC adopted a final rule that imposed a special assessment of 5 basis points on each insured financial institutions total assets less Tier 1 capital as of June 30, 2009. As a result, included in regulatory expense in 2009 is an FDIC special assessment charge of $8.4 million. On September 29, 2009, the FDIC adopted a plan that extended the DIF restoration plan from seven years to eight years and on November 12, 2009, the FDIC adopted a final rule that amended the assessment regulations to require insured financial institutions to prepay, on December 30, 2009, their estimated deposit insurance premiums for 2010, 2011 and 2012. Under this rule, which did not include any additional special assessments, the prepayment was based on an assumed 5% annual growth rate in each institutions insured deposits (the assessment base) and an assumed increase of three basis points in each institutions premium assessment rate beginning in 2011. 51 In February 2011, the FDIC approved a final rule which: changes the assessment base from adjusted domestic deposits to a banks average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity (defined as Tier 1 capital); adopts a new large bank pricing assessment scheme; and sets a target size for the DIF at 2% of insured deposits. The rule, which is effective June 30, 2011, also (i) implements a lower assessment rate schedule when the DIF reaches 1.15 percent and, in lieu of dividends, provides for a lower rate schedule when the reserve ratio reaches 2 percent and 2.5 percent and (ii) creates a scorecard based assessment system for financial institutions with more than $10 billion in assets, including Peoples United Bank. Peoples United Financial is currently evaluating what effect these new rules will have on regulatory expense in 2011. The increase in other non interest expense in 2010 compared to 2009 reflects higher costs associated with derivative transactions entered into with commercial customers, and expenses related to foreclosed properties. Included in other non interest expense in 2009 is $4.4 million of benefit related and other one time charges. Included in other non interest expense in 2008 are: (i) one time charges of $11.5 million, including benefit related and other costs associated with the death of Peoples United Financials former President; (ii) a charge of $2.0 million related to the vesting of outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards upon the dissolution of Peoples United Financials Advisory Board; and (iii) a loss of $0.8 million on the sale of a portion of the companys non branch properties located in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Income Taxes Income tax expense totaled $41.3 million, $43.1 million and $67.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Income tax benefits of $2.0 million are included in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2009, which stems from a reduction in the combined state income tax rate following the charter consolidations of the former Chittenden banks. Peoples United Financials effective income tax rate was 32.5% and 32.7% for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2008, respectively, and would have been 31.3% for the year ended December 31, 2009 excluding the income tax benefits of $2.0 million described above. Peoples United Financials effective income tax rate is expected to increase slightly in 2011 due to a higher level of non deductible expenses and an increase in state income tax liabilities associated with the companys expanded geographic franchise. The difference between Peoples United Financials effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% is primarily attributable to: (i) federal income tax credits associated with the companys investment in affordable housing limited partnerships; (ii) tax exempt interest earned on certain investments; and (iii) tax exempt income from bank owned life insurance. Peoples United Financial maintains an ownership interest in several limited partnership investments to develop and operate affordable housing units for lower income tenants throughout its franchise area. These investments have historically played a significant role in enabling Peoples United Bank to meet its Community Reinvestment Act requirements while, at the same time, providing federal income tax credits. The cost of these investments is amortized on a straight line basis over the period during which the related federal income tax credits are realized (generally ten years). These credits totaled $4.6 million, $4.2 million and $4.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Income tax expense for all three years reflects the state tax benefit resulting from the formation of Peoples Mortgage Investment Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Peoples United Bank. The formation of this subsidiary was a result of Connecticut tax legislation, which became effective on January 1, 1999, that allows for the transfer of mortgage loans to a passive investment subsidiary. The related earnings of the subsidiary, and any dividends it pays to the parent, are not subject to Connecticut income tax. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning income tax expense. 52 Securities 2010 2009 2008 As of December 31 (in millions) AmortizedCost FairValue AmortizedCost FairValue AmortizedCost FairValue Securities held to maturity: Debt securities: Corporate $ 55.0 $ 55.0 $ 55.0 $ 55.0 $ $ Other 0.1 0.1 0.3 0.3 0.9 0.9 Total securities held to maturity $ 55.1 $ 55.1 $ 55.3 $ 55.3 $ 0.9 $ 0.9 Securities available for sale: Debt securities: U.S. Treasury, agency and GSE $ 476.2 $ 476.3 $ 10.7 $ 10.8 $ 1,469.2 $ 1,472.1 U.S. agency and GSE residential mortgage backed securities and CMOs: GSE and CMOs 2,289.0 2,290.6 729.9 728.1 42.0 42.0 GNMA 331.2 333.4 State and municipal 57.6 58.2 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 Other 4.5 4.5 Total debt securities 2,827.3 2,829.6 740.9 739.2 1,842.7 1,847.8 Equity securities 1.5 1.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 Total securities available for sale $ 2,828.8 $ 2,831.1 $ 741.4 $ 739.7 $ 1,843.2 $ 1,848.3 Peoples United Financial strives to maintain an appropriate balance between loan portfolio growth and deposit funding. Peoples United Financials management believes that, other than for transitional deployment of excess deposits or excess equity, a large securities portfolio funded with wholesale borrowings provides limited economic value. Peoples United Financial has historically utilized the securities portfolio for earnings generation (in the form of interest and dividend income), liquidity, interest rate risk management, asset diversification and tax planning. Securities available for sale are used as part of Peoples United Financials asset/liability management strategy and may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, factors such as changes in market conditions and interest rates, changes in security prepayment rates, liquidity considerations and regulatory capital requirements. Peoples United Financial invests in debt securities rated in the highest category assigned by a nationally recognized statistical ratings organization. Management has internal guidelines for the credit quality and duration of Peoples United Financials debt securities portfolio and monitors these on a regular basis. The increase in debt securities available for sale in 2010 compared to 2009 reflects managements decision to invest in U.S. Treasury and agency securities and government sponsored enterprise (GSE) residential mortgage backed securities and CMOs in the second half of 2010 to provide the optimal balance of credit risk, yield and duration. At December 31, 2010, Peoples United Financials securities available for sale portfolio totaled $2.8 billion, or 11% of total assets, compared to $0.7 billion, or 3% of total assets, at December 31, 2009. In 2009, Peoples United Financial sold residential mortgage backed securities with an amortized cost of $1.03 billion and recorded security gains totaling $16.9 million. Proceeds from sales occurring during 2009 were subsequently reinvested in residential mortgage backed securities with substantially equivalent maturities and yields. This investment portfolio repositioning was undertaken to mitigate prepayment risk. 53 At December 31, 2010, the fair value exceeded the amortized cost of the securities available for sale portfolio by $2.3 million. At December 31, 2009, the amortized cost exceeded the fair value of the securities available for sale portfolio by $1.7 million, while at December 31, 2008, the fair value exceeded the amortized cost of the securities available for sale portfolio by $5.1 million. All unrealized gains and those unrealized losses representing temporary declines in value due to factors other than credit are recorded in stockholders equity, net of income taxes. As a result, management anticipates continued fluctuations in stockholders equity due to changes in the fair value of these securities, albeit on a relatively small scale due to the size and duration of the portfolio. The duration of the debt securities portfolio was approximately 3.4 years at December 31, 2010 compared to 4.0 years at December 31, 2009. Lending Activities Peoples United Financial conducts its lending activities principally through its Commercial Banking and Retail and Business Banking business segments. Peoples United Financials lending activities consist of originating loans secured by commercial and residential properties, and extending secured and unsecured loans to commercial and consumer customers. Total loans increased $3.28 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 after decreasing $332 million in 2009 compared to 2008. Peoples United Financial acquired loans with a total fair value of $3.49 billion from acquisitions completed in 2010. Loans acquired in connection with acquisitions were recorded at fair value, including an estimate of future credit losses, and without carryover of the respective portfolios historical allowance for loan losses. At December 31, 2010, the carrying amount of the acquired loan portfolios totaled $2.88 billion. The following table summarizes the loan portfolio before deducting the allowance for loan losses: As of December 31 (in millions) 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 Commercial Banking: Commercial real estate $ 7,306.3 $ 5,399.4 $ 4,967.3 $ 1,885.6 $ 1,786.7 Commercial and industrial 3,095.6 2,805.7 2,999.5 1,618.9 1,493.8 Equipment financing 2,100.4 1,236.8 1,226.9 981.5 869.8 Total Commercial Banking 12,502.3 9,441.9 9,193.7 4,486.0 4,150.3 Retail: Residential mortgage: Adjustable rate 2,184.2 2,244.5 2,857.2 3,123.8 3,805.6 Fixed rate 653.8 302.4 287.4 89.1 94.5 Total residential mortgage 2,838.0 2,546.9 3,144.6 3,212.9 3,900.1 Consumer: Home equity 1,976.8 1,986.3 1,945.5 1,224.4 1,290.6 Other consumer 201.1 258.7 281.9 26.4 30.7 Total consumer 2,177.9 2,245.0 2,227.4 1,250.8 1,321.3 Total Retail 5,015.9 4,791.9 5,372.0 4,463.7 5,221.4 Total loans $ 17,518.2 $ 14,233.8 $ 14,565.7 $ 8,949.7 $ 9,371.7 Peoples United Financials loan portfolio is primarily concentrated within New England with approximately 68% and 81% of the total loan portfolio representing loans to customers within the New England states at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In addition, approximately 15% of the total loan portfolio represents loans to customers in New York state at December 31, 2010. 54 Total Loans As of December 31 (dollars in millions) The following table presents the contractual maturity of total loans as of December 31, 2010: As of December 31, 2010 (in millions) CommercialBanking Retail Total Amounts due: One year or less $ 1,553.1 $ 261.5 $ 1,814.6 After one year: One to five years 3,931.1 269.5 4,200.6 Over five years 7,018.1 4,484.9 11,503.0 Total due after one year 10,949.2 4,754.4 15,703.6 Total $ 12,502.3 $ 5,015.9 $ 17,518.2 The following table presents, as of December 31, 2010, loan amounts due after December 31, 2011, and whether these loans have adjustable or fixed interest rates: Interest Rate (in millions) Adjustable Fixed Total Commercial Banking $ 4,856.7 $ 6,092.5 $ 10,949.2 Retail 3,839.3 915.1 4,754.4 Total loans due after one year $ 8,696.0 $ 7,007.6 $ 15,703.6 55 Commercial Banking The Commercial Banking lending businesses include commercial real estate, commercial and industrial lending, and equipment financing.

Peoples United Financials highest loan concentration in the commercial real estate loan portfolio is in the office building sector, which represented 25% of this loan portfolio at December 31, 2010. Commercial Real Estate Portfolio As of December 31 (dollars in millions) In 2010, the commercial real estate portfolio increased $1.9 billion compared to 2009, after increasing $432 million in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in 2010 reflects the addition of loans acquired in connection with the acquisitions completed in 2010, as well as organic growth of $206 million, or 4% of the commercial real estate portfolio. Included in the commercial real estate portfolio are construction loans totaling $1.04 billion and $819 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, net of the unadvanced portion of such loan totaling $176 million and $235 million, respectively. 56 At December 31, 2010 and 2009, approximately 28% and 9%, respectively, of Peoples United Financials commercial real estate portfolio was secured by properties located in New York, and approximately 22% and 29%, respectively, was secured by properties located in Connecticut. In addition, approximately 35% of the commercial real estate portfolio was secured by properties located in Massachusetts, Vermont and New Hampshire at December 31, 2010 compared to approximately 44% at December 31, 2009. No other state exposure was greater than 6% at December 31, 2010. Commercial real estate is dependent on the successful operation of the related income producing real estate. Accordingly, the income streams generated by this portfolio can be impacted by changes in the real estate market and, to a large extent, the New England and Metro New York economies. Peoples United Financial continues to focus on maintaining strong asset quality standards in a competitive market generally characterized by aggressive pricing and less attractive underwriting terms. The growth and performance of this portfolio is largely dependent on the economic environment and may be adversely impacted if the economy slows in 2011.

Taking a total relationship focused approach with commercial customers to meet their financing needs has resulted in substantial growth in non interest bearing deposits over time, as well as in opportunities to provide other banking services to principals and employees of these commercial customers. The borrowers ability to repay a commercial loan is closely tied to the ongoing profitability and cash flow of the borrowers business. Consequently, a commercial loan tends to be more directly impacted by changes in economic cycles that affect businesses generally and the borrowers business specifically. The availability of adequate collateral is a factor in commercial loan decisions; and loans are generally collateralized and or guaranteed by third parties. In 2010, the commercial and industrial portfolio increased $290 million compared to 2009, after decreasing $194 million in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in 2010 reflects the addition of loans acquired in connection with the acquisitions completed in 2010, as well as organic growth of $210 million, or 8% of the commercial and industrial portfolio. At December 31, 2010, approximately 44% of the commercial and industrial loan portfolio consisted of loans to Connecticut based businesses, compared to approximately 42% at December 31, 2009. Commercial and industrial loan exposure in the states of Vermont, Massachusetts and New Hampshire totaled approximately 37% at both December 31, 2010 and 2009. No other state exposure was greater than 7%. While Peoples United Financial continues to focus on asset quality, the performance of the commercial lending and industrial portfolio may be adversely impacted if the economy slows in 2011.

PCLC will buy or sell portions of financing transactions in the secondary market to manage the concentration risk of its overall portfolio. In addition, PCLC provides customers with the option to lease equipment. Substantially all (approximately 96% at December 31, 2010 and 2009) of the equipment financing portfolio involves customers outside of New England. At December 31, 2010, approximately 34% of the equipment financing portfolio consisted of loans to customers located in Texas, California and Florida. No other state exposure was greater than 6%. The equipment financing portfolio increased $864 million in 2010 compared to 2009, reflecting the addition of the PUEFC portfolio in 2010. Operating on a national scale, equipment financing represented 17% of the Commercial Banking loan portfolio at December 31, 2010 compared to 13% at December 31, 2009. While Peoples United Financial continues to focus on asset quality, the performance of the equipment financing portfolio may be adversely impacted if the economy slows in 2011.

These include conventional fixed rate loans, jumbo fixed rate loans (loans with principal balances greater than established Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae limits), adjustable rate loans, sometimes referred to as ARM loans, interest only loans (loans where payments made by the borrower consist of only interest for a set period of time, before the payments change to principal and interest), as well as Federal Housing Administration insured loans and various state housing finance authority loans. Peoples United Financial originates these loans through its network of branches and calling officers, as well as in the wholesale market. 60 At December 31, 2010 and 2009, approximately 87% and 96%, respectively, of the residential mortgage loan portfolio was secured by properties located in New England. At December 31, 2010, the residential mortgage loan portfolio included $447 million of interest only loans of which $59 million are stated income loans, compared to $1.0 billion and $113 million, respectively, at December 31, 2009. See Asset Quality for further discussion of interest only and stated income loans. Also included in residential mortgage loans are construction loans totaling $94 million and $65 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Peoples United Financials residential mortgage originations totaled $1.2 billion in 2010, compared to $1.3 billion in 2009 and $692 million in 2008. The decrease in loan originations in 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily due to the lower level of refinancing activity in 2010, while the increase in 2009 compared to 2008 is primarily due to the low interest environment in 2009. The mix and volume of residential mortgage loan originations vary in response to changes in market interest rates and customer preferences. Adjustable rate residential mortgage loans accounted for 20% of total residential mortgage originations in 2010, compared to 13% in 2009 and 22% in 2008. In 2010, adjustable rate residential mortgage loans decreased $60 million compared to 2009 and decreased $613 million in 2009 compared to 2008, reflecting Peoples United Financials past practice, through May 2010, of selling essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. Fixed rate residential mortgage loans increased $351 million in 2010 compared to 2009 and increased $15 million in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in 2010 reflects the addition of the acquisitions completed in 2010, as well as organic growth of $188 million, or 62% of fixed rate residential mortgage loans. Residential mortgage loans at December 31, 2010 and 2009 included loans held for sale (substantially all to be sold servicing released) of $88 million and $71 million, respectively, which approximate fair value. Historically, Peoples United Financial has held virtually all of the adjustable rate residential mortgage loans that it originates on its balance sheet and has sold virtually all of the fixed rate residential mortgage loans that it originates into the secondary market. In 2006, Peoples United Financial completed a reassessment of its pricing with respect to adjustable rate residential mortgage loans in light of the prevailing interest rate environment at that time. As a result, Peoples United Financial made the decision in the fourth quarter of 2006 to sell essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. Peoples United Financial continues to actively offer residential mortgage loans of all types through its extensive distribution system. In May 2010, Peoples United Financial made the decision to retain in its portfolio most of its originated adjustable rate and 15 year fixed rate residential mortgage loans. Accordingly, residential mortgage loan balances are expected to increase in 2011. Peoples United Financials loan loss experience within the residential mortgage portfolio continues to be primarily attributable to a small number of loans. The continued performance of the residential mortgage loan portfolio in 2011 may be adversely impacted by the level and direction of interest rates, consumer preferences and the regional economy. Residential Mortgage Originations Years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 61 Residential Mortgage Originations by Product Year ended December 31, 2010 (percent) Consumer Lending Peoples United Financial offers home equity credit lines and second mortgage loans, and to a lesser extent, other forms of installment and revolving credit loans. Future growth of Peoples United Financials consumer loan portfolio is highly dependent upon economic conditions, the interest rate environment and competitors strategies, as well as the success of Peoples United Financials marketing programs and information based strategies. As of December 31 (in millions) 2010 2009 Home equity credit lines $ 1,759.2 $ 1,740.2 Second mortgages 217.6 246.1 Indirect auto 155.2 207.3 Other loans 45.9 51.4 Total consumer $ 2,177.9 $ 2,245.0 The consumer loan portfolio decreased $67 million in 2010 compared to 2009 and increased $18 million in 2009 compared to 2008. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, approximately 96% and 99%, respectively, of the consumer loan portfolio was to customers located in New England. Asset Quality Recent Trends The past several years have been marked by significant volatility in the financial and capital markets initially brought about by the fallout associated with the subprime mortgage market. This disruption led to significant credit and liquidity concerns, which resulted in government intervention within the banking sector and a substantial decline in activity within the secondary mortgage market. All of these issues have been further exacerbated by an accelerated softening of the real estate market, a worsening recessionary economic environment and, in turn, weakness within the commercial sector. While Peoples United Financial continues to adhere to prudent underwriting standards, the loan portfolio is geographically diverse and, therefore, is not immune to potential negative consequences arising as a result of general economic weakness and, in particular, a prolonged downturn in the housing market on a national scale. Decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for loans. In addition, adverse changes in the economy could have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make scheduled loan payments, which would likely have an adverse impact on earnings. Further, an increase in loan delinquencies may serve to decrease net interest income and adversely impact loan loss experience, resulting in an increased provision and allowance for loan losses. 62 Peoples United Financial actively manages asset quality through its underwriting practices and collection operations. Underwriting practices tend to focus on optimizing the return of a given risk classification while collection operations focus on minimizing losses once an account becomes delinquent. Peoples United Financial attempts to minimize losses associated with commercial banking loans by requiring borrowers to pledge adequate collateral and or provide for third party guarantees. Loss mitigation within the residential mortgage loan portfolio is highly dependent on the value of the underlying real estate. During the recent credit cycle, Peoples United Financial has experienced an increase in the number of loan modification requests. Certain loans whose terms have been modified are considered troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). Loans are considered TDRs if the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and is afforded a concession by Peoples United Financial, such as, but not limited to: (i) a reduction of the stated interest rate for the remaining contractual life of the loan; (ii) an extension of the loans original contractual term at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for a new loan with similar risk; (iii) capitalization of interest; or (iv) forgiveness of principal or interest. Generally, TDRs are placed on non accrual status (and reported as non performing loans) until the loan qualifies for return to accrual status. Loans qualify for return to accrual status once they have demonstrated performance with the restructured terms of the loan agreement for a minimum of six months. Loans may continue to be reported as TDRs after they are returned to accrual status. Portfolio Risk Elements Residential Mortgage Lending Peoples United Financial does not engage in subprime mortgage lending, which has been the riskiest sector of the residential housing market. Peoples United Financial has virtually no exposure to subprime loans, or to similarly high risk Alt A loans and structured investment vehicles. At December 31, 2010, the loan portfolio included $447 million of interest only residential mortgage loans, of which $59 million are stated income loans. Peoples United Financial began originating interest only residential mortgage loans in March 2003. The underwriting guidelines and requirements for such loans are generally more restrictive than those applied to other types of residential mortgage loans. In general, Peoples United Financials underwriting guidelines for residential mortgage loans require the following: (i) properties must be single family and owner occupied primary residences; (ii) lower loan to value ratios (less than 60% on average); (iii) higher credit scores (greater than 700 on average); and (iv) sufficient post closing reserves. Peoples United Financial has not originated interest only residential mortgage loans that permit negative amortization or optional payment amounts. Amortization of an interest only residential mortgage loan begins after the initial interest rate changes (e.g. after 5 years for a 5/1 adjustable rate mortgage). Stated income loans, which Peoples United Financial has not offered since mid 2007, represent a form of reduced documentation loan that requires a potential borrower to complete a standard mortgage application with full verification of the borrowers asset information as contained in the loan application, but no verification of the provided income information. As with interest only loans, underwriting guidelines for stated income loans require properties to be single family and owner occupied primary residences with lower loan to value ratios and higher credit scores. In addition, stated income loans require the receipt of an appraisal for the real estate used as collateral and a credit report on the prospective borrower. Peoples United Financial orders updated independent third party appraisals for residential mortgage loans once a loan becomes 90 days past due. At December 31, 2010, non performing residential mortgage loans totaling $1.7 million had current loan to value ratios of more than 100%. 63 The foreclosure practices of several of the nations largest residential mortgage loan servicers have recently come under the scrutiny of state attorneys general and various regulatory authorities. Certain of these servicers had self imposed moratoriums on foreclosure activities in light of allegations of robo signing (signing foreclosure affidavits without an appropriate review) and other issues related to their foreclosure practices. In light of these developments, the company has reviewed its foreclosure policies and procedures and found no systemic concerns or instances of robo signing with respect to its loan servicing activities. We believe that our established procedures for reviewing foreclosure affidavits and validating information contained in related loan documentation are sound and consistently applied, and that our foreclosure affidavits are accurate. As a result, Peoples United Bank has not found it necessary to interrupt or suspend foreclosure proceedings. We have also considered the effect of representations and warranties that we made to third party investors in connection with whole loan sales, and believe our representations and warranties were true and correct and do not expose Peoples United Bank to any material loss. The aforementioned foreclosure issues and the potential for additional legal and regulatory action could impact future foreclosure activities, including lengthening the time required for residential mortgage lenders, including Peoples United Bank, to initiate and complete the foreclosure process. In recent years, foreclosure timelines have increased as a result of, among other reasons, (i) delays associated with the significant increase in the number of foreclosure cases as a result of the economic crisis, (ii) additional consumer protection initiatives related to the foreclosure process and (iii) voluntary and or mandatory programs intended to permit or require lenders to consider loan modifications or other alternatives to foreclosure. Further increases in the foreclosure timeline may have an adverse effect on collateral values and our ability to minimize losses. Portfolio Risk Elements Commercial Real Estate Lending In general, construction loans originated by Peoples United Financial are used to finance improvements to commercial, industrial or residential property. Repayment is typically derived from the sale of the property as a whole, the sale of smaller individual units, or by a take out from a permanent mortgage. The term of the construction period generally does not exceed two years. Loan commitments are based on established construction budgets which represent an estimate of total costs to complete the proposed project, including both hard (direct) costs (building materials, labor, etc.) and soft (indirect) costs (legal and architectural fees, etc.). In addition, project costs may include an appropriate level of interest reserve to carry the project through to completion. If established, such interest reserves are determined based on (i) a percentage of the committed loan amount, (ii) the loan term, and (iii) the applicable interest rate. Regardless of whether a loan contains an interest reserve, the total project cost statement serves as the basis for underwriting and determining which items will be funded by the loan and which items will be funded through borrower equity. Construction loans are funded, at the request of the borrower, not more than once per month, based on the extent of work completed, and are monitored, throughout the life of the project, by an independent professional construction engineer and the companys commercial real estate lending department. Interest is advanced to the borrower, upon request, based upon the progress of the project toward completion. The amount of interest advanced is added to the total outstanding principal under the loan commitment. Should the project not progress as scheduled, the adequacy of the interest reserve necessary to carry the project through to completion is subject to close monitoring by management. Should the interest reserve be deemed to be inadequate, the borrower is required to fund the deficiency. Similarly, once a loan is fully funded, the borrower is required to fund all interest payments. 64 Peoples United Financials outstanding construction loan portfolio totaled $1.04 billion (approximately 6% of total loans) at December 31, 2010. The total committed amount at that date, including both the outstanding balance and the unadvanced portion of such loans, totaled $1.22 billion. In some cases, a portion of the total committed amount includes an accompanying interest reserve. At December 31, 2010, outstanding construction loans totaling $333 million had remaining available interest reserves totaling $17 million. At that date, the company had $15 million of construction loans with interest reserves that were on non accrual status and included in non performing loans. The recent economic downturn has resulted in an increase in the number of extension requests for commercial real estate and construction loans, some of which have related repayment guarantees. Modifications of commercial real estate loans involving maturity extensions are evaluated according to the companys normal underwriting standards and are classified as TDRs if the company does not receive a current market interest rate commensurate with current underwriting for a new loan with similar risk. Peoples United Financial had approximately $6 million of restructured construction loans as of December 31, 2010. An extension may be granted to allow for the completion of the project, marketing or sales of completed units, or to provide for permanent financing, and is based on a re underwriting of the loan and managements assessment of the borrowers ability to perform according to the agreed upon terms. Typically, at the time of an extension, borrowers are performing in accordance with contractual loan terms. Extension terms generally do not exceed 12 to 18 months and typically require that the borrower provide additional economic support in the form of partial repayment, additional collateral or guarantees. In cases where the fair value of the collateral or the financial resources of the borrower are deemed insufficient to repay the loan, reliance may be placed on the support of a guarantee, if applicable. However, such guarantees are never considered the sole source of repayment. Peoples United Financial evaluates the financial condition of guarantors based on the most current financial information available. Most often, such information takes the form of (i) personal financial statements of net worth, cash flow statements and tax returns (for individual guarantors) and (ii) financial and operating statements, tax returns and financial projections (for legal entity guarantors). The companys evaluation is primarily focused on various key financial metrics, including net worth, leverage ratios, and liquidity. It is the companys policy to update such information annually, or more frequently as warranted, over the life of the loan. While Peoples United Financial does not specifically track the frequency with which it has pursued guarantor performance under a guarantee, the companys underwriting process, both at origination and upon extension, as applicable, includes an assessment of the guarantors reputation, creditworthiness and willingness to perform. Historically, when the company has found it necessary to seek performance under a guarantee, it has been able to effectively mitigate its losses. In considering the impairment status of such loans, an evaluation is made of the collateral and future cash flow of the borrower as well as the anticipated support of any repayment guarantor. In the event that the guarantor is unwilling or unable to perform, a legal remedy is pursued. When performance under the loan terms is deemed to be uncertain, including performance of the guarantor, all or a portion of the loan may be charged off, typically based on the fair value of the collateral securing the loan. 65 Allowance and Provision for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses charged to income. Losses on loans, including impaired loans, are charged to the allowance for loan losses when all or a portion of a loan is deemed to be uncollectible. Recoveries of loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance for loan losses when realized. Peoples United Financial maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that is deemed to be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the respective loan portfolios, based on a quarterly evaluation of a variety of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to: Peoples United Financials historical loan loss experience and recent trends in that experience; risk ratings assigned by lending personnel to commercial real estate, commercial and equipment financing loans, and the results of ongoing reviews of those ratings by Peoples United Financials independent loan review function; an evaluation of delinquent and non performing loans and related collateral values; the probability of loss in view of geographic and industry concentrations and other portfolio risk characteristics; the present financial condition of borrowers; and current economic conditions. For a more detailed discussion of the companys allowance for loan losses methodology and related policies, see Critical Accounting Policies. Loans acquired in a business combination that have evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination and for which it is probable, at acquisition, that the company will be unable to collect all contractually required payment receivable are initially recorded at fair value without a carryover of the related allowance for loan losses. Fair value is determined using market participant assumptions in estimating the amount and timing of both principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected on such loans and then applying a market based discount rate to those cash flows. The excess of the undiscounted expected cash flows at the acquisition date over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable yield, which is recognized into interest income over the remaining lives of the acquired loans. The difference between contractually required principal and interest payments at the acquisition date and the undiscounted cash flows expected to be collected at the acquisition date is referred to as the nonaccretable difference, which includes an estimate of future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the portfolio. Decreases in the expected cash flows in subsequent periods require the establishment of an allowance for loan losses. Improvements in expected cash flows in future periods result in a reduction of the nonaccretable difference, with such amount reclassified as part of the accretable yield and subsequently recognized into interest income over the remaining lives of the acquired loans. Charge offs on acquired loans are first applied to the nonaccretable difference and then to any allowance for loan losses recognized subsequent to acquisition Selected asset quality metrics presented below distinguish between the originated portfolio and the acquired portfolio. All loans acquired in connection with the acquisitions completed in 2010 comprise the acquired loan portfolio; all other loans of the company comprise the originated portfolio, including originations subsequent to the respective acquisition dates. 66 Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses The following table presents the activity in the allowance for loan losses and ratios: Years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 Beginning allowance for loan losses $ 172.5 $ 157.5 $ 72.7 $ 74.0 $ 75.0 Charge offs: Commercial Banking: Commercial real estate (27.5 ) (10.9 ) (3.4 ) Commercial and industrial (14.3 ) (9.8 ) (5.6 ) (7.0 ) (5.2 ) Equipment financing (9.5 ) (8.8 ) (1.5 ) (1.8 ) (0.6 ) Retail: Residential mortgage (4.3 ) (5.4 ) (1.5 ) (0.1 ) Home equity (3.8 ) (3.5 ) (1.0 ) (0.4 ) (0.3 ) Other consumer (5.3 ) (7.1 ) (6.2 ) (2.3 ) (3.1 ) Total charge offs (64.7 ) (45.5 ) (19.2 ) (11.5 ) (9.3 ) Recoveries: Commercial Banking: Commercial real estate 0.8 0.3 0.2 0.1 2.5 Commercial and industrial 1.0 1.0 1.3 0.3 0.4 Equipment financing 0.3 0.2 0.3 0.1 0.3 Retail: Residential mortgage 0.6 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.1 Home equity 0.4 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.1 Other consumer 1.6 1.6 2.0 1.0 1.5 Total recoveries 4.7 3.5 4.3 2.2 4.9 Net loan charge offs (60.0 ) (42.0 ) (14.9 ) (9.3 ) (4.4 ) Provision for loan losses 60.0 57.0 26.2 8.0 3.4 Allowance recorded in the Chittenden acquisition 73.5 Ending allowance for loan losses $ 172.5 $ 172.5 $ 157.5 $ 72.7 $ 74.0 Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of: Originated loans 1.18 % 1.21 % 1.08 % 0.81 % 0.79 % Originated non performing loans 70.3 102.2 186.8 357.8 327.9 The provision for loan losses in 2010 totaled $60.0 million, reflecting $60.0 million in net loan charge offs. Commercial real estate loan charge offs in 2010 include (i) two construction loans totaling $9.8 million, both of which carried specific reserves totaling $9.0 million, and (ii) partial charge offs totaling $4.8 million related to two shared national credits. Commercial and industrial charge offs in 2010 include a $6.0 million partial charge off of a single commercial and industrial loan. The provision for loan losses in 2009 totaled $57.0 million, reflecting $42.0 million in net loan charge offs and a $15.0 million increase in the allowance for loan losses. Commercial real estate loan charge offs in 2009 include a $6.1 million partial charge off of a non performing shared national credit. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of originated loans was 1.18% at December 31, 2010 and 1.21% at December 31, 2009. Loan Charge Offs The companys charge off policies, which comply with standards established by banking regulators, are consistently applied from period to period. Charge offs are recorded on a monthly basis. Partially charged off loans continue to be evaluated on a monthly basis and additional charge offs or loan loss provisions may be recorded on the remaining loan balance based on the same criteria. 67 For unsecured consumer loans, charge offs generally occur when the loan is deemed to be uncollectible or 120 days past due, whichever occurs first. For consumer loans secured by real estate, including residential mortgage loans, charge offs generally occur when the loan is deemed to be uncollectible or 180 days past due, whichever occurs first, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that repayment will occur regardless of the delinquency status. Factors that demonstrate an ability to repay may include (i) a loan that is secured by adequate collateral and is in the process of collection, (ii) a loan supported by a valid guarantee or insurance, or (iii) a loan supported by a valid claim against a solvent estate. For commercial banking loans, a charge off is recorded when the company determines that it will not collect all amounts contractually due based on the fair value of the collateral (less costs to sell), or the present value of expected future cash flows. The decision whether to charge off all or a portion of a loan rather than record a specific or general loss allowance is based on an assessment of all available information which aids in determining the loans net realizable value. Typically this involves consideration of both (i) the fair value of any collateral securing the loan, including whether the estimate of fair value has been derived from an appraisal or other market information, and (ii) other factors affecting the likelihood of repayment, including the existence of guarantees and insurance. If the amount by which the companys recorded investment in the loan exceeds its net realizable value is deemed to be a confirmed loss, a charge off is recorded. Otherwise, a specific or general reserve is established, as applicable. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average total loans equaled 0.39% in 2010, 0.29% in 2009 and 0.10% in 2008. The comparatively low level of net loan charge offs in recent years, in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of average loans, may not be sustainable in the future.

This assessment is based on a variety of internal and external factors including, but not limited to, the likelihood and severity of loss, portfolio growth and related risk characteristics, and current economic conditions. Management believes that the level of the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2010 is adequate to cover probable losses. Non Performing Assets A loan is generally considered non performing when it is placed on non accrual status. A loan is generally placed on non accrual status when it becomes 90 days past due as to interest or principal payments. Past due status is based on the contractual payment terms of the loan. A loan may be placed on non accrual status before it reaches 90 days past due if such loan has been identified as presenting uncertainty with respect to the collectibility of interest and principal. A loan past due 90 days or more may remain on accruing status if such loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. All previously accrued but unpaid interest on non accrual loans is reversed from interest income in the period in which interest accrual is discontinued. Interest payments received on non accrual loans (including impaired loans) are generally applied as a reduction of principal if future collections are doubtful, although such interest payments may be recognized as income. A loan remains on non accrual status until the factors that indicated doubtful collectability no longer exist or until a loan is determined to be uncollectible and is charged off against the allowance for loan losses. 69 The following table presents information on non performing loans, real estate owned (REO) and repossessed assets: As of December 31 (dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 Originated non performing loans: Commercial Banking: Commercial real estate $ 82.5 $ 72.4 $ 29.8 $ 3.7 $ 0.2 Commercial and industrial 38.2 17.4 21.1 1.3 11.9 Equipment financing 36.0 20.6 5.8 3.1 2.1 Retail: Residential mortgage 78.8 52.7 24.2 8.9 6.7 Home equity 9.1 5.3 2.8 3.1 1.5 Other consumer 0.6 0.4 0.6 0.2 0.2 Total originated non performing loans (1) 245.2 168.8 84.3 20.3 22.6 REO 39.8 23.9 7.0 3.2 Repossessed assets 18.1 12.9 2.4 2.6 0.1 Total non performing assets $ 303.1 $ 205.6 $ 93.7 $ 26.1 $ 22.7 Acquired non performing loans (2) $ 359.8 $ $ $ $ Originated non performing loans as a percentage of originated loans (3) 1.67 % 1.19 % 0.58 % 0.23 % 0.24 % Non performing assets as a percentage of: Originated loans, REO and repossessed assets (3) 2.06 1.44 0.64 0.29 0.24 Tangible stockholders equity and allowance for loan losses 5.62 5.47 2.47 0.59 1.74 (1) Reported net of government guarantees totaling $9.4 million, $8.3 million and $6.5 million at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. (2) Represents acquired loans that meet Peoples United Financials definition of a non performing loan but for which the risk of credit loss has been considered by virtue of our estimate of acquisition date fair value and or the existence of an FDIC loss share agreement. (3) Calculations exclude acquired loans. Including acquired loans and acquired non performing loans at December 31, 2010, non performing loans were 3.45% of total loans, and non performing assets were 3.77% of total loans, REO and repossessed assets. Total non performing assets increased $97.5 million in 2010 from December 31, 2009 and equaled 2.06% of originated loans, REO and repossessed assets at December 31, 2010. The change in total non performing assets from December 31, 2009 includes increases in non performing residential mortgage loans of $26.1 million, non performing commercial and industrial loans of $20.8 million, non performing equipment financing loans of $15.4 million, non performing commercial real estate loans of $10.1 million, REO of $15.9 million and repossessed assets of $5.2 million. The increase in non performing residential mortgage loans is a reflection of the continued higher levels of unemployment across Peoples United Financials franchise and slower resolution of the foreclosure process. The increases in the commercial banking portfolios reflect broader economic weakness. The increase in repossessed assets reflects the addition of repossessed assets acquired in the Financial Federal acquisition ($11.7 million at December 31, 2010). The increase in REO primarily reflects the addition of $19.8 million of REO in connection with the acquisitions completed in 2010. Loans past due 90 days and still accruing totaled $1.2 million at December 31, 2010 compared to $11.8 million at December 31, 2009. All loans and REO acquired in the Butler Bank acquisition are subject to an FDIC loss share agreement. The loss share agreement provides for coverage by the FDIC, up to certain limits, on all such covered assets. The FDIC is obligated to reimburse the company for 80% of any future losses on covered assets up to $34.0 million. The company will reimburse the FDIC for 80% of recoveries with respect to losses for which the FDIC paid the company 80% reimbursement under the loss sharing coverage. 70 Total non performing assets increased $111.9 million in 2009 from December 31, 2008 and equaled 1.44% of originated loans, REO and repossessed assets at December 31, 2009. The change in total non performing assets from December 31, 2008 includes increases in non performing commercial real estate loans of $42.6 million, non performing residential mortgage loans of $28.5 million, non performing equipment financing loans of $14.8 million, REO of $16.9 million and repossessed assets of $10.5 million. The increase in non performing commercial real estate loans primarily reflects the classification of one shared national credit (totaling $16.3 million at December 31, 2009) as non performing and the impact of continued economic weakness on the commercial real estate sector. The increase in non performing residential mortgage loans is primarily a reflection of higher levels of unemployment across Peoples United Financials franchise, while the increase in non performing equipment financing loans reflects broader economic weakness. The increase in REO primarily reflects the transfer of one shared national credit (totaling $9.8 million at December 31, 2009) to REO as well as additional commercial properties transferred in 2009. The increase in repossessed assets reflects the higher level of repossessed equipment at PCLC. In addition to the originated non performing loans discussed above, Peoples United Financial has also identified approximately $464 million in originated potential problem loans at December 31, 2010. Originated potential problem loans represent loans that are currently performing, but for which known information about possible credit deterioration on the part of the related borrowers causes management to have concerns as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with contractual loan repayment terms and which may result in the disclosure of such loans as non performing at some time in the future. The originated potential problem loans are generally loans that, although performing, have been classified as substandard in accordance with Peoples United Financials loan rating system, which is consistent with guidelines established by banking regulators. At December 31, 2010, originated potential problem loans consisted of $210 million of commercial real estate loans, $134 million of commercial and industrial loans, and $120 million of equipment financing loans. Such loans are closely monitored by management and have remained in performing status for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, delinquency status, borrower payment history and fair value of the underlying collateral. Management cannot predict the extent to which economic conditions may worsen or whether other factors may adversely impact the ability of these borrowers to make payments. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that originated potential problem loans will not become 90 days or more past due, be placed on non accrual status, be restructured, or require additional provisions for loan losses. The levels of non performing assets and potential problem loans are expected to fluctuate in response to changing economic and market conditions, and the relative sizes of the respective loan portfolios, along with managements degree of success in resolving problem assets. Management takes a proactive approach with respect to the identification and resolution of problem loans. However, given the current state of the U.S. economy and, more specifically, the real estate market, the level of non performing assets may continue to increase in 2011. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Detailed discussions pertaining to Peoples United Financials off balance sheet arrangements are included in the following sections: Funding, Liquidity, Stockholders Equity and Dividends, and Market Risk Management. Funding At the current time, Peoples United Financials primary funding sources are deposits and stockholders equity, which represent 92% of total assets at December 31, 2010. Borrowings also are an available source of funding. Based on Peoples United Banks membership in the FHLB of Boston and the level of qualifying collateral available at December 31, 2010, Peoples United Bank had up to $2.7 billion of borrowing capacity in the form of advances from the FHLB of Boston and Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and repurchase agreements. Peoples United Bank also had unsecured borrowing capacity of $0.6 billion at December 31, 2010. 71 Deposits 2010 2009 2008 As of December 31 (dollars in millions) Amount WeightedAverageRate Amount WeightedAverageRate Amount WeightedAverageRate Non interest bearing $ 3,872.6 % $ 3,509.0 % $ 3,173.4 % Savings, interest bearing checking and money market 8,897.8 0.51 7,327.9 0.65 6,214.7 1.01 Total 12,770.4 0.36 10,836.9 0.44 9,388.1 0.67 Time deposits maturing: Within 6 months 2,357.9 1.14 2,244.3 1.60 2,147.1 2.60 After 6 months but within 1 year 1,485.2 1.29 1,441.9 1.67 2,266.1 3.35 After 1 but within 2 years 840.0 1.69 757.1 1.90 325.2 2.99 After 2 but within 3 years 195.7 2.66 78.2 2.80 63.8 3.46 After 3 years 283.9 2.78 87.2 3.16 79.1 3.71 Total 5,162.7 1.42 4,608.7 1.72 4,881.3 3.00 Total deposits $ 17,933.1 0.66 % $ 15,445.6 0.82 % $ 14,269.4 1.47 % Peoples United Financials strategy is to focus on increasing deposits by providing a wide range of convenient services to commercial, retail, business and wealth management customers. Peoples United Financial provides customers access to their deposits through nearly 340 branches, including 84 full service Stop & Shop supermarket branches, more than 500 ATMs, telephone banking and an Internet banking site. Deposits equaled 72% and 73% of total assets at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Peoples United Financial assumed deposits with a fair value of $2.5 billion in connection with the acquisitions completed in 2010. Deposits and stockholders equity constituted over 95% of Peoples United Financials funding base at both December 31, 2010 and 2009. The expansion of Peoples United Financials branch network and its commitment to developing full service relationships with its customers are integral components of Peoples United Financials strategy to leverage the success of its supermarket banking initiative, expand market share and continue growing deposits. At December 31, 2010, Peoples United Financials network of Stop & Shop branches held deposits totaling $2.3 billion and deposits in supermarket branches open for more than one year averaged $29 million per store. Non interest bearing deposits are an important source of low cost funding and fee income for Peoples United Financial. In addition, Peoples United Financial believes that checking accounts represent one of the core relationships between a financial institution and its customers, and it is from these relationships that cross selling of other financial services can be achieved. Non interest bearing deposits equaled 22% and 23% of total deposits at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Time deposits of $100,000 or more totaled $1.9 billion at December 31, 2010, of which $565 million mature within three months, $303 million mature after three months but within six months, $519 million mature after six months but within one year and $513 million mature after one year. Brokered certificates of deposit totaled $7.9 million and $3.0 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 72 Total Deposits As of December 31 (dollars in millions) The following table presents Peoples United Financials time deposits by rate category: As of December 31 (in millions) 2010 1.25% or less $ 2,778.7 1.26% to 2.00% 1,552.3 2.01% to 2.50% 282.9 2.51% to 3.00% 270.2 3.01% to 3.50% 85.9 3.51% to 4.00% 109.7 4.01% and greater 83.0 Total $ 5,162.7 The following table presents, by rate category, the remaining period to maturity of time deposits outstanding as of December 31, 2010.

Peoples United Financial retained FHLB advances and term repurchase agreements with fair values of $500 million and $27 million, respectively, which were assumed in connection with the Smithtown and LSB acquisitions. FHLB advances and repurchase agreements both represented 2% of total assets at December 31, 2010. Repurchase agreements at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 primarily consisted of transactions with commercial and municipal customers. In previous years, Peoples United Financials primary source for borrowings were federal funds purchased, which are typically unsecured overnight loans among banks, in addition to advances from the FHLB of Boston, which provides credit for member institutions within its assigned region. Subordinated Notes and Debentures Subordinated notes and debentures totaled $182 million at both December 31, 2010 and 2009. Peoples United Financial and Peoples United Bank assumed subordinated notes and debentures with fair values of $36 million and $29 million, respectively, in connection with the acquisitions completed in 2010 and Peoples United Financial assumed subordinated notes with a fair value of $115 million in connection with the Chittenden acquisition in 2008. In the first quarter of 2011, Peoples United Bank redeemed $6 million of its 8.5% fixed rate subordinated notes due in 2016. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning subordinated notes and debentures. In the fourth quarter of 2008, Peoples United Financial and Peoples United Bank both opted in to the FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, which provides a temporary guarantee of newly issued senior unsecured debt, as defined (the Debt Guarantee Program). As of December 31, 2010, neither Peoples United Financial nor Peoples United Bank had any debt outstanding that qualifies under the Debt Guarantee Program. Peoples United Bank may issue up to approximately $300 million of senior unsecured debt that would qualify under the Debt Guarantee Program. While Peoples United Financial has retained the right to do so, the company does not, at this time, intend to issue senior unsecured debt that would qualify under the Debt Guarantee Program. 74 Contractual Cash Obligations The following table is a summary of Peoples United Financials contractual cash obligations, other than deposit liabilities, including operating leases. Additional information concerning these contractual cash obligations is included in Notes 10, 11 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase obligations included in the table below represent those agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions. A substantial majority of Peoples United Financials purchase obligations are renewable on a year to year basis. As such, the purchase obligations included in this table only reflect the contractual commitment.

Similarly, obligations totaling $14.1 million related to limited partnership affordable housing investments are not included in the above table as the timing of the related capital calls cannot be estimated. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of Peoples United Financials unrecognized income tax positions and affordable housing investments. Liquidity Liquidity is defined as the ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet all present and future funding requirements at reasonable costs. Liquidity management addresses Peoples United Financials and Peoples United Banks ability to fund new loans and investments as opportunities arise, to meet customer deposit withdrawals, and to repay borrowings and subordinated notes as they mature. Peoples United Financials, as well as Peoples United Banks, liquidity positions are monitored daily by management. The Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO) of Peoples United Bank has been authorized by the Board of Directors of Peoples United Financial to set guidelines to ensure maintenance of prudent levels of liquidity for Peoples United Financial as well as for Peoples United Bank. ALCO reports to the Treasury and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors of Peoples United Bank. Asset liquidity is provided by: cash; short term investments and security resale agreements; proceeds from security sales, maturities and principal repayments; and proceeds from scheduled principal collections, prepayments and sales of loans. In addition, certain securities may be used to collateralize borrowings under repurchase agreements. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows present data on cash provided by and used in Peoples United Financials operating, investing and financing activities. At December 31, 2010, Peoples United Financial (parent company) liquid assets included $520 million in securities purchased under agreements to resell and $437 million in debt securities available for sale. Peoples United Banks liquid assets included $955 million in cash and cash equivalents, $2.4 billion in debt securities available for sale and $84 million in trading account securities. Securities available for sale with a fair value of $1.43 billion at December 31, 2010 were pledged as collateral for public deposits and for other purposes. 75 Liability liquidity is measured by Peoples United Financials and Peoples United Banks ability to obtain deposits and borrowings at cost effective rates that are diversified with respect to markets and maturities. Deposits, which are considered the most stable source of liability liquidity, totaled $17.9 billion at December 31, 2010 and represented 74% of total funding (the sum of total deposits, total borrowings, subordinated notes and debentures, and stockholders equity). Borrowings are used to diversify Peoples United Financials funding mix and to support asset growth. Borrowings and subordinated notes and debentures totaled $1.0 billion and $182 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010, representing 4.2% and 0.7%, respectively, of total funding at that date. Peoples United Banks current sources of borrowings include: federal funds purchased, advances from the FHLB of Boston and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and repurchase agreements. At December 31, 2010, Peoples United Banks total borrowing limit from the FHLB of Boston and Federal Reserve Bank of New York for advances, and repurchase agreements, was $2.7 billion, based on the level of qualifying collateral available for these borrowings. In addition, Peoples United Bank had unsecured borrowing capacity of $0.6 billion at that date. At December 31, 2010, Peoples United Bank had outstanding commitments to originate loans totaling $0.8 billion and approved, but unused, lines of credit extended to customers totaling $3.6 billion (including $1.8 billion of home equity lines of credit). The sources of liquidity discussed above are deemed by management to be sufficient to fund outstanding loan commitments and to meet Peoples United Financials and Peoples United Banks other obligations. Earning Asset Mix $21.7 billion as of December 31, 2010 (percent) Funding Base $24.3 billion as of December 31, 2010 (percent) 76 Stockholders Equity and Dividends Peoples United Financials total stockholders equity was $5.22 billion at December 31, 2010, a $119 million increase compared to $5.10 billion at December 31, 2009. This increase primarily reflects the issuances of 26.0 million shares of common stock with a fair value (net of issuance costs) of approximately $405 million in connection with the Financial Federal acquisition and 2.1 million shares of common stock with a fair value (net of issuance costs) of approximately $26 million in connection with the Smithtown acquisition, and net income of $85.7 million, partially offset by dividends paid of $218.1 million, the open market repurchase of 14.3 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $191.2 million, and a $24.2 million increase in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss since December 31, 2009. Stockholders equity equaled 20.8% of total assets at December 31, 2010 and 24.0% at December 31, 2009. Tangible stockholders equity (total stockholders equity less goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles) equaled 14.1% of tangible assets (total assets less goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles) at December 31, 2010 and 18.2% at December 31, 2009. In January 2011, Peoples United Financials Board of Directors authorized an additional repurchase of common stock. Under the new repurchase authorization, up to 5% of Peoples United Financials then outstanding common stock, or up to 17.5 million shares, may be repurchased, either directly or through agents, in the open market at prices and terms satisfactory to management. Also in January 2011, Peoples United Financials Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend on its common stock of $0.1550 per share. The dividend was paid on February 15, 2011 to shareholders of record on February 1, 2011. In April 2008, Peoples United Financials Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 5% of Peoples United Financials then outstanding common stock, or up to a maximum of 17.3 million shares. Such shares may be repurchased, either directly or through agents, in the open market at prices and terms satisfactory to management. Through December 31, 2010, a total of 14.3 million shares of Peoples United Financial common stock had been repurchased under the stock repurchase authorization at a total cost of $191.2 million. In February 2011, Peoples United Financial completed the repurchase of the maximum number of common stock authorized in April 2008 and began repurchasing common stock under the authorization announced in January 2011. Also in February 2011, Peoples United Financial filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for 144,400 shares of its common stock. Such shares are issuable to the selling shareholders upon the exercise of outstanding warrants previously issued by Smithtown. The exercise price is approximately $37.83 per share, subject to certain adjustments. Peoples United Financials total stockholders equity was $5.10 billion at December 31, 2009, a $74 million decrease compared to $5.17 billion at December 31, 2008. This decrease primarily reflects dividends paid of $203.6 million partially offset by net income of $101.2 million. Dividends declared and paid per common share totaled $0.6175, $0.6075 and $0.5833 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Peoples United Financials dividend payout ratio (dividends paid as a percentage of net income) for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was 254.5%, 201.1% and 141.1%, respectively. Regulatory Capital Requirements OTS capital regulations require federally chartered savings banks, such as Peoples United Bank, to meet three minimum capital ratios: Tangible Capital Ratio A 1.5% tangible capital ratio, calculated as tangible capital to adjusted total assets. Leverage (Core) Capital Ratio A 4% leverage (core) capital ratio, calculated as core capital to adjusted total assets. The minimum leverage (core) capital ratio is reduced to 3% if the savings bank received the highest rating on its most recent safety and soundness examination. 77 Risk Based Capital Ratio An 8% total risk based capital ratio, calculated as total risk based capital to total risk weighted assets. For purposes of this calculation, total risk based capital equals the sum of core and supplementary capital, provided that supplementary capital may not exceed 100% of core capital. In assessing an institutions capital adequacy, the OTS takes into consideration not only these numeric factors but also qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where necessary. Peoples United Bank, as a matter of prudent management, targets as its goal the maintenance of capital ratios that exceed these minimum requirements and that are consistent with Peoples United Banks risk profile. Peoples United Banks tangible capital ratio, leverage (core) capital ratio and total risk based capital ratios were 11.4%, 11.4% and 14.5%, respectively, at December 31, 2010, compared to 10.0%, 10.0% and 14.1%, respectively, at December 31, 2009. The improvement in these ratios from December 31, 2009 reflects a $981 million increase in Peoples United Banks total equity capital in 2010, primarily attributable to the additional capital resulting from the acquisitions completed in 2010. The following summary compares Peoples United Banks regulatory capital amounts and ratios as of December 31, 2010 to the OTS minimum requirements. At December 31, 2010, Peoples United Banks adjusted total assets, as defined, totaled $22.1 billion and its total risk weighted assets, as defined, totaled $18.5 billion. At December 31, 2010, Peoples United Bank exceeded each of its regulatory capital requirements. Regulatory capital amounts and ratios presented are for Peoples United Bank and therefore do not reflect the additional capital residing at Peoples United Financial. As of December 31, 2010 (dollars in millions) Peoples UnitedBank OTS MinimumRequirements Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Tangible capital $ 2,522.2 (1) 11.4 % $ 331.3 1.5 % Leverage (core) capital 2,522.2 (1) 11.4 883.4 4.0 Total risk based capital 2,693.1 (2) 14.5 1,481.4 8.0 (1) Represents total stockholders equity, excluding: (i) after tax net unrealized gains (losses) on certain securities classified as available for sale; (ii) after tax net gains on derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges; (iii) certain assets not recognized in tier 1 capital (principally goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles); and (iv) the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) relating to pension and other postretirement benefits. (2) Represents tier 1 capital plus subordinated notes and debentures, up to certain limits, and the allowance for loan losses up to 1.25% of total risk weighted assets. Generally, a bank is considered well capitalized if it has a leverage (core) capital ratio of at least 5.0%, a tier 1 risk based capital ratio of at least 6.0% (calculated as tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets) and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 10.0%. Peoples United Banks regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2010 exceeded the OTS numeric criteria for classification as well capitalized. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning Peoples United Banks regulatory capital amounts and ratios. In September 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision released revisions to recommended capital requirements, which are referred to as Basel III. Peoples United Banks capital ratios at December 31, 2010 were well in excess of these new capital requirements. These new capital ratio requirements are still considered preliminary, and there is a prolonged implementation time frame. Management will monitor any proposed clarifications of the benchmarks. 78 Peoples United Bank Capital Ratios Compared to Regulatory Requirements As of December 31, 2010 (percent) Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market Risk Management Market risk is the risk of loss to earnings, capital and the fair values of certain assets and liabilities resulting from changes in interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. Interest Rate Risk For Peoples United Financial, the only relevant market risk at this time is interest rate risk (IRR), which is the potential exposure to earnings or capital that may result from changes in interest rates. Peoples United Financial manages its IRR to achieve a balance between risk, earnings volatility and capital preservation. ALCO has primary responsibility for managing Peoples United Financials IRR. To evaluate Peoples United Financials IRR profile, ALCO monitors economic conditions, interest rate trends, liquidity levels and capital ratios. Management also reviews assumptions periodically for projected customer and competitor behavior, in addition to the expected repricing characteristics and cash flow projections for assets, liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments. Actual conditions may vary significantly from Peoples United Financials assumptions. Management evaluates the impact of IRR on Income at Risk using an earnings simulation model to project earnings under multiple interest rate environments over a one year time horizon resulting in a quantification of IRR. Income at Risk includes significant interest rate sensitive income sources, such as net interest income, gains on sales of residential mortgage loans and BOLI income. The earnings projections are based on a static balance sheet and estimates of pricing levels for Peoples United Financials products under multiple scenarios intended to reflect instantaneous yield curve shocks. Peoples United Financial estimates its base case Income at Risk using current interest rates. Internal policy regarding IRR simulations currently specifies that for instantaneous parallel shifts of the yield curve, estimated Income at Risk for the subsequent one year period should not decline by more than: 7% for a 100 basis point shift; 10% for a 200 basis point shift; and 15% for a 300 basis point shift. 79 The following table shows the estimated percentage change in Peoples United Financials Income at Risk over a one year simulation period beginning December 31, 2010. Given the interest rate environment at December 31, 2010, simulations for declines in interest rates below 25 basis points were not deemed to be meaningful. Rate Change (basis points) Percent Change inIncome at Risk +300 16.1 % +200 10.5 +100 4.5 25 (0.8 ) While Income at Risk simulation identifies earnings exposure over a relatively short time horizon, Net Present Value of Equity at Risk takes a long term economic perspective when quantifying IRR, thereby identifying possible margin behavior over a longer time horizon. Base case Net Present Value (NPV) is calculated by estimating the net present value of all future cash flows from existing assets and liabilities using current interest rates. The base case scenario assumes that future interest rates remain unchanged. Internal policy currently limits the exposure of a decrease in Net Present Value of Equity at Risk resulting from instantaneous parallel shifts of the yield curve in the following manner: 5% for 100 basis points shift; 10% for 200 basis points shift; and 15% for 300 basis points. The following table shows the estimated percentage change in Peoples United Financials Net Present Value of Equity at Risk, assuming various shifts in interest rates. Given the interest rate environment at December 31, 2010, simulations for declines in interest rates below 25 basis points were not deemed to be meaningful. Rate Change (basis points) Percent Change inNet Present Value +300 (3.1 )% +200 (1.0 ) +100 (0.5 ) 25 (0.1 ) Peoples United Financials interest rate risk position at December 31, 2010, as set forth in the Income at Risk and Net Present Value of Equity at Risk tables above, reflects its significant excess capital position at that date. Managements current posture is to invest a portion of such excess capital in liquid, short term investments and securities resale agreements. While this strategy places additional pressure on net interest income in a low rate environment, management views such risk as an acceptable alternative in light of the current credit environment. Given the uncertainty of the magnitude, timing and direction of future interest rate movements and the shape of the yield curve, actual results may vary from those predicted by Peoples United Financials models. Peoples United Financials asset sensitive balance sheet includes more than just its significant excess capital position. In fact, a 100 basis point increase in the federal funds interest rate translates to an approximate $40 million improvement in net interest income on an annualized basis. Peoples United Financial uses derivative financial instruments, including interest rate floors (see below) and interest rate swaps, primarily for market risk management purposes (principally interest rate risk). Certain other derivatives are entered into in connection with transactions with commercial customers. Derivatives are not used for speculative purposes. 80 At December 31, 2010, Peoples United Financial used interest rate swaps on a limited basis to manage IRR associated with certain interest earning assets. Interest rate swaps are used to match more closely the repricing of fewer than five commercial real estate loans and the funding associated with these loans. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the fixed rate assets to a variable interest rate and consequently reduce Peoples United Financials exposure to increases in interest rates. Interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges. In the first quarter of 2009, Peoples United Financial terminated its remaining $600 million (notional amount) interest rate floor contracts. The decision to do so was based on managements belief that, in light of the current interest rate environment, the derivative contracts had achieved their stated market risk management objective. Termination of the derivative contracts also served to reduce the companys counterparty credit risk. At the time of termination, the interest rate floors had an unrealized gain of $40.1 million. The gain is included (on a net of tax basis) as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being recognized in income over the period during which the hedged items (certain floating rate commercial loans) affect earnings (approximately 2 years). A total of $19.6 million of this gain was recognized in income during the year ended December 31, 2010 and the remaining unrecognized gain at December 31, 2010 was $0.6 million, which is expected to be recognized in income in the first quarter of 2011. In connection with the September 2008 bankruptcy filing by Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc., Peoples United Financial terminated its $100 million (notional) derivative contract (interest rate floor) with Lehman Brothers. The derivative contract had a fair value of $5.3 million at the time of termination. After considering the master netting arrangement and posted collateral, the net amount due from the counterparty was $1.4 million. After impairment adjustments, the carrying amount of this receivable was $0.4 million at December 31, 2010. Peoples United Financial has written guidelines that have been approved by its Board of Directors and ALCO governing the use of derivative financial instruments, including approved counterparties and credit limits. Credit risk associated with these instruments is controlled and monitored through policies and procedures governing collateral management and credit approval. By using derivatives, Peoples United Financial is exposed to credit risk to the extent that counterparties to the derivative contracts do not perform as required. Should a counterparty fail to perform under the terms of a derivative contract, the companys counterparty credit risk is equal to the amount reported as a derivative asset in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. Amounts reported as derivative assets represent derivative contracts in a gain position, net of derivatives in a loss position with the same counterparty (to the extent subject to master netting arrangements) and posted collateral. Peoples United Financial seeks to minimize counterparty credit risk through credit approvals, limits, monitoring procedures, execution of master netting arrangements and obtaining collateral, where appropriate. Counterparties to Peoples United Financials derivatives include major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings from the major rating agencies. As such, management believes the risk of incurring credit losses on derivative contracts with those counterparties is remote and losses, if any, would be immaterial. Certain of Peoples United Financials derivative contracts contain provisions establishing collateral requirements (subject to minimum collateral posting thresholds) based on the companys external credit rating. If the companys senior unsecured debt rating were to fall below the level generally recognized as investment grade, the counterparties to such derivative contracts could require additional collateral on those derivative transactions in a net liability position (after considering the effect of bilateral netting arrangements and posted collateral). The aggregate fair value of derivative instruments with such credit related contingent features that were in a net liability position at December 31, 2010 was $2.7 million, for which Peoples United Financial had posted $2.2 million of collateral in the normal course of business. If the companys senior unsecured debt rating had fallen below investment grade as of that date, $0.5 million in additional collateral would have been required. 81 Foreign Currency Risk Foreign exchange contracts are commitments to buy or sell foreign currency on a future date at a contractual price. Peoples United Financial uses these instruments on a limited basis to eliminate its exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates on certain of its commercial loans that are denominated in foreign currencies. Gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts substantially offset the translation gains and losses on the related loans. Effective in the first quarter of 2010, Peoples United Financial no longer designates foreign exchange contracts as hedging instruments.
