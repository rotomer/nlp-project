Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements Periodic and other filings made by Peoples United Financial with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act may, from time to time, contain information and statements that are forward looking in nature. Such filings include the Annual Report on Form 10 K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q and Current Reports on Form 8 K, and may include other forms such as proxy statements. Other written or oral statements made by Peoples United Financial or its representatives from time to time may also contain forward looking statements. In general, forward looking statements usually use words such as expect, anticipate, believe, should, and similar expressions, and include all statements about Peoples United Financials operating results or financial position for future periods. Forward looking statements represent managements beliefs, based upon information available at the time the statements are made, with regard to the matters addressed; they are not guarantees of future performance. All forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause Peoples United Financials actual results or financial condition to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such statements. Factors of particular importance to Peoples United Financial include, but are not limited to: (1) changes in general, international, national or regional economic conditions; (2) changes in interest rates; (3) changes in loan default and charge off rates; (4) changes in deposit levels; (5) changes in levels of income and expense in non interest income and expense related activities; (6) residential mortgage and secondary market activity; (7) changes in accounting and regulatory guidance applicable to banks; (8) price levels and conditions in the public securities markets generally; (9) competition and its effect on pricing, spending, third party relationships and revenues; (10) the successful integration of acquired companies; and (11) changes in regulation resulting from or relating to financial reform legislation. All forward looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Consequently, no forward looking statement can be guaranteed. Peoples United Financial does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Recent Market Developments In response to the unprecedented challenges affecting the banking system, the federal government began implementing several programs in late 2008 designed to address a variety of issues facing the financial sector. The most noteworthy of these initiatives was the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the EESA). The EESA led to the Troubled Asset Relief Program (the TARP) and the TARP Capital Purchase Program, neither of which had a direct impact on Peoples United Financial as the Company did not participate in these programs. Peoples United Financial did, however, experience a number of changes with respect to deposit insurance coverage and related assessments. 21 Table of Contents FDIC Insurance Coverage / Assessments The FDIC insures deposits at FDIC insured financial institutions up to certain limits, charging premiums to maintain the DIF at specified levels. Such premiums may vary based on the risk profile of the insured institution and have historically ranged from 0.05% of deposits for an institution in the highest sub category of the highest category to 0.43% of deposits for an institution in the lowest category. Adverse economic conditions over the past several years has resulted in an increased number of bank failures and, consequently, greater use of DIF resources. In response, beginning in 2009, the FDIC authorized higher premium assessments (including a special assessment in 2009) pursuant to a restoration plan designed to increase the DIF reserve ratio to required levels. In November 2009, the FDIC adopted a final rule that amended the assessment regulations to require insured financial institutions to prepay, on December 30, 2009, their estimated deposit insurance premiums for 2010, 2011 and 2012. Under this rule, which did not include any additional special assessments, the prepayment was based on an assumed 5% annual growth rate in each institutions insured deposits (the assessment base) and an assumed increase of three basis points in each institutions premium assessment rate beginning in 2011. On December 30, 2009, Peoples United Bank prepaid its estimated deposit insurance premiums totaling $69 million in accordance with FDIC regulations. The prepaid deposit insurance assessment at December 31, 2011 was $33 million, which includes balances acquired in connection with recent business combinations. The EESA increased the FDIC deposit insurance limit from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor through December 31, 2009, and subsequent amendments extended the increased coverage through December 31, 2013. In February 2011, the FDIC approved a final rule which: (i) changes the assessment base from adjusted domestic deposits to a banks average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity (defined as Tier 1 capital); (ii) adopts a new large bank pricing assessment scheme; and (iii) sets a target size for the DIF at 2% of insured deposits. The rule, which was effective beginning with the quarterly assessment period ended June 30, 2011, also (i) implements a lower assessment rate schedule when the DIF reaches 1.15 percent and, in lieu of dividends, provides for a lower rate schedule when the reserve ratio reaches 2 percent and 2.5 percent and (ii) creates a scorecard based assessment system for financial institutions with more than $10 billion in assets, including Peoples United Bank. The actual amount of future assessments will be dependent on several factors, including: (i) Peoples United Banks average total assets and average tangible equity; (ii) Peoples United Banks risk profile; and (iii) whether additional special assessments are imposed in future periods and the manner in which such assessments are determined. Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 The DFA, which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, implements significant changes in the financial regulatory landscape and will impact all financial institutions and their holding companies, including Peoples United Bank and Peoples United Financial. Among the DFAs significant regulatory changes, it creates a new federal consumer protection agency, the CFPB, that is empowered to promulgate new consumer protection regulations and revise existing regulations in many areas of consumer protection. The CFPB has exclusive authority to issue regulations, orders and guidance to administer and implement the objectives of federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB will also have exclusive supervision over our consumer compliance examinations. Moreover, the DFA permits states to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and authorizes state attorneys general to enforce consumer protection rules issued by the CFPB. The DFA restricts the authority of the federal banking regulators to preempt state consumer protection laws applicable to the Bank and limits the preemption of state laws as they affect subsidiaries and agents of federally chartered banks. 22 Table of Contents The DFA provides that the amount of interchange fee that an issuer of debit cards may charge or receive must be reasonable and proportional to the cost of the transaction. The DFA directs the FRB to issue regulations to implement this requirement, and further provides that in determining whether a charge is reasonable and proportional the issuer may generally consider only costs that are specific to the individual transaction. Separately, the FRB is authorized to issue regulations that would allow an issuer to adjust interchange fees to reflect the costs associated with fraud mitigation related to debit card transactions, provided that the issuer must comply with fraud related standards to be established by the FRB. The DFA further provides that a debit card issuer may not restrict the number of payment card networks on which a debit card transaction may be processed to a single network or limit the ability of a merchant to direct the routing of debit card payments for processing. The interchange fee provisions became effective in the fourth quarter of 2011 (see Non Interest Income). It is anticipated that establishment of the CFPB and these other changes will significantly increase the Companys regulatory compliance burden and costs and may restrict the financial products and services Peoples United Financial offers to its customers. All federal prohibitions on the ability of financial institutions to pay interest on demand deposit accounts were repealed as part of the DFA. As a result, beginning on July 21, 2011, financial institutions could begin offering interest on demand deposits. As of December 31, 2011, Peoples United Banks non interest bearing deposits totaled $4.5 billion, or 22% of total deposits. The Companys interest expense may increase and our net interest margin may decrease if we begin to offer higher rates of interest than we currently offer on demand deposits. The DFA also imposes stringent capital requirements on bank holding companies by, among other things, imposing leverage ratios on holding companies and prohibiting new trust preferred issuances from counting as Tier I capital. The DFA also increases regulation of derivatives and hedging transactions, which could limit the ability of Peoples United Financial to enter into, or increase the costs associated with, interest rate and other hedging transactions. The actions noted above, together with additional actions announced by the U.S. Treasury and other regulatory agencies, continue to develop. It is not clear at this time what impact such actions will have on the capital markets and the financial services industry. The extreme levels of market volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced could continue to adversely affect the U.S. banking industry and the broader U.S. and global economies for the foreseeable future, which will have an effect on all financial institutions, including Peoples United Financial. The DFA transferred all supervisory functions, including ongoing supervision, examination and regulation, for savings and loan holding companies and their non depository subsidiaries to the FRB, effective July 21, 2011, and on the same day, the OCC assumed responsibility for the supervision, examination and regulation of all federally chartered savings banks. In October 2011, Peoples United Bank filed an application with the OCC to convert to a national bank charter. In connection with this conversion, Peoples United Financial intends to submit an application to the FRB NY to convert to a bank holding company. In connection with doing so, Peoples United Financial expects to make an election for financial holding company status. General Peoples United Financial is a savings and loan holding company incorporated under the state laws of Delaware and the holding company for Peoples United Bank. The principal business of Peoples United Financial is to provide, through Peoples United Bank and its subsidiaries, commercial banking, retail and business banking, and wealth management services to individual, corporate and municipal customers. 23 Table of Contents Peoples United Bank is a federally chartered stock savings bank headquartered in Bridgeport, Connecticut with $27.6 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2011. Peoples United Bank was organized in 1842 as a mutual savings bank, converted to stock form in 1988, and in 2006 converted from a Connecticut chartered stock savings bank to a federally chartered stock savings bank. Its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC under the DIF. Until July 2011, Peoples United Bank was subject to regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements by the OTS as its chartering agency, and by the FDIC as the deposit insurer. On July 21, 2011, primary supervisory responsibility for Peoples United Bank was transferred from the OTS to the OCC. Peoples United Financials results of operations are largely dependent upon revenues generated through net interest income and fee based revenues and, to a much lesser extent, other forms of non interest income such as gains on asset sales. Sources for these revenues are diversified across Peoples United Financials three primary business segments that represent its core businesses, Commercial Banking, Retail and Business Banking, and Wealth Management, and to a lesser extent, Treasury. Peoples United Financials results of operations are also significantly affected by the provision for loan losses and the level of non interest expense. In addition, Peoples United Financials results of operations may also be affected by general and local economic conditions, changes in market interest rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Other Recent Developments On February 28, 2012, Peoples United Financial announced a definitive agreement by which Peoples United Bank will acquire 56 branches from Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Citizens) and assume $325 million in deposits associated with these branches. Fifty two of the branches are situated in Stop & Shop supermarkets and four are traditional branches. All of the branches are located in the state of New York, with 29 on Long Island, eight in Westchester County and six in the boroughs of New York City. Peoples United Bank, which currently operates 87 Stop & Shop branch locations throughout Connecticut, will pay Citizens a 1% premium on the assumed deposits. The all cash transaction is valued at $3.25 million and includes all existing Citizens branches in Long Island and New York City, as well as certain locations in New York states Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Orange, Dutchess and Ulster Counties. Peoples United Bank has agreed that all employees at the acquired Citizens branches will be offered comparable positions at Peoples United Bank. Completion of the transaction is anticipated late in the second quarter of 2012 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals. Acquisitions After the close of business on June 30, 2011, Peoples United Financial acquired Danvers based in Danvers, Massachusetts. The transaction was effective July 1, 2011. Total consideration paid in the Danvers acquisition of approximately $462 million consisted of approximately $214 million in cash and 18.5 million shares of Peoples United Financial common stock with a fair value of approximately $248 million. Cash consideration was paid at the rate of $23.00 per share of Danvers common stock and stock consideration was paid at the rate of 1.624 shares of Peoples United Financial common stock per share of Danvers common stock. At the acquisition date, Danvers operated 28 branches in the greater Boston area. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of this acquisition. On November 30, 2010, Peoples United Financial completed its acquisitions of Smithtown based in Hauppauge, New York and LSB based in North Andover, Massachusetts. On April 16, 2010, Peoples United Bank entered into a definitive purchase and assumption agreement with the FDIC pursuant to which Peoples United Bank assumed all of the deposits, certain assets and the banking operations of Butler Bank, located in Lowell, Massachusetts. On February 19, 2010, Peoples United Financial completed its acquisition of Financial Federal, a financial services company providing collateralized lending, financing and leasing services nationwide to small and medium sized businesses. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of these acquisitions. On January 1, 2008, Peoples United Financial completed its acquisition of Chittenden, a multi bank holding company headquartered in Burlington, Vermont. Peoples United Financials results of operations include the results of the acquired entities beginning with their respective closing dates. 24 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, Peoples United Financial is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from Peoples United Financials current estimates, as a result of changing conditions and future events. The current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these significant estimates. Several accounting estimates are particularly critical and are susceptible to significant near term change, including the allowance for loan losses and asset impairment judgments, such as the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets, and other than temporary declines in the value of securities. The judgments used by Peoples United Financial in applying these critical accounting policies may be affected by a further and prolonged deterioration in the economic environment, which may result in changes to future financial results. For example, subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods, and the inability to collect outstanding principal may result in increased loan losses. Peoples United Financials significant accounting policies and critical estimates are summarized in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses charged to income. Losses on loans, including impaired loans, are charged to the allowance for loan losses when all or a portion of a loan is deemed to be uncollectible. Recoveries of loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance for loan losses when realized. Peoples United Financial maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that is deemed to be appropriate to absorb probable losses inherent in the respective loan portfolios, based on a quarterly evaluation of a variety of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to: (i) Peoples United Financials historical loan loss experience and recent trends in that experience; (ii) risk ratings assigned by lending personnel to commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans and equipment financing loans, and the results of ongoing reviews of those ratings by Peoples United Financials independent loan review function; (iii) an evaluation of delinquent and non performing loans and related collateral values; (iv) the probability of loss in view of geographic and industry concentrations and other portfolio risk characteristics; (v) the present financial condition of borrowers; and (vi) current economic conditions. The Companys allowance for loan losses consists of three elements: (i) an allowance for larger balance, non homogeneous loans that are evaluated on an individual (loan by loan) basis; (ii) an allowance for smaller balance homogeneous loans that are evaluated on a collective basis; and (iii) a specific allowance for individual loans deemed to be impaired, including originated loans classified as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). Larger balance, Non homogeneous Loans. The Company establishes a loan loss allowance for its larger balance, non homogeneous loans using a methodology that incorporates (i) the probability of default for a given loan risk rating and (ii) historical default data over a multi year period. In accordance with the Companys loan risk rating system, each loan, with the exception of those included in large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans, is assigned a risk rating (using a nine grade scale) by the originating loan officer, credit management, internal loan review or loan committee. Loans rated one represent those loans least likely to default while loans rated nine represent a loss. The probability of loans defaulting for each risk rating, referred to as default factors, are estimated based on the frequency with which loans migrate from one risk rating to another and to default status over time. Estimated loan default factors are multiplied by loan balances within each risk rating category and again multiplied by an historical loss given default estimate for each loan type to determine an appropriate level of allowance by loan type. The historical loss given default estimates are updated annually (or more frequently, if necessary) based on actual charge off experience. This approach is applied to the commercial, commercial real estate and equipment financing components of the loan portfolio. 25 Table of Contents In developing the allowance for loan losses for larger balance, non homogeneous loans, the Company also gives consideration to certain qualitative factors, including the macroeconomic environment and any potential imprecision inherent in its loan loss model which may result from having limited historical loan loss data which, in turn, may result in inaccurate probability of default and loss given default factors. In consideration of these factors, the Company may adjust the allowance for loan losses upward or downward based on current economic conditions and portfolio trends. In determining the extent of any such adjustment, the Company considers both economic and portfolio specific data that correlates with loan losses. The Company annually reviews this data to determine that such a correlation continues to exist. Additionally, at interim dates between annual reviews, the Company evaluates the factors in order to conclude that they continue to be adequate based on current economic conditions. Smaller balance, Homogeneous Loans. Pools of smaller balance, homogeneous loans with similar risk and loss characteristics are also assessed for probable losses. These loan pools include residential mortgage, home equity and other consumer loans that are not assigned individual loan risk ratings. Rather, the assessment of these portfolios is based upon a consideration of recent historical loss experience, delinquency trends and portfolio specific risk characteristics, the combination of which determines whether a loan is classified as High risk, Moderate risk or Low risk. The allowance for loan losses for these smaller balance, homogeneous portfolios is developed using a build up approach that includes components attributable to: (i) historical portfolio loss experience; (ii) portfolio specific risk elements; and (iii) other qualitative factors. The risk characteristics considered include (i) collateral values/loan to value ratios (above and below 70%); (ii) borrower credit scores under the FICO scoring system (above and below a score of 680); and (iii) other relevant portfolio risk elements such as income verification at the time of underwriting (stated income vs. non stated income) and the propertys intended use (owner occupied, non owner occupied, second home, etc.). In classifying a loan as either High, Moderate or Low risk, the combination of each of the aforementioned risk characteristics is considered for that loan, resulting, effectively, in a matrix approach to its risk classification. In establishing the allowance for loan losses for residential mortgage loans, the Company principally considers historical portfolio loss experience of the most recent 1 and 3 year periods, as we believe this provides a reasonable basis for estimating the inherent probable losses within our residential mortgage portfolio. In establishing the allowance for loan losses for home equity loans, the Company principally considers historical portfolio loss experience of the most recent 12 month period. With respect to portfolio stratification based on the aforementioned portfolio specific risk characteristics, each risk category is currently assigned an applicable reserve factor. For residential mortgage loans, the Moderate (or baseline) reserve factor represents the portfolios net charge off rate for the preceding fiscal year. For home equity loans, the Moderate (or baseline) reserve factor represents an average of the portfolios monthly net charge off rates for the preceding three months. This component of the allowance employs a shorter look back period as it is intended to identify emerging portfolio trends in credit quality as determined by reference to a loans initial underwriting as well as subsequent changes in property values and borrower credit scores. Accordingly, the shorter look back period is deemed to provide a better basis on which to analyze such trends. Within each respective portfolio, the loan population deemed to be High risk is subject to a reserve factor equal to two times that of the applicable baseline factor, while the loan population deemed to be Low risk is subject to a reserve factor equal to one third of the applicable baseline factor. These adjustments around the baseline factor are intended to reflect the higher or lower probability of loss inherent in the corresponding portfolio stratification. The reserve factor multiples for the High and Low risk categories were determined by reference to actual historical portfolio loss experience and are generally reflective of the range of losses incurred over each portfolios respective look back period. As such, we believe these multiples, which are reassessed annually (or more frequently, if necessary) provide a reasonable basis for estimating the inherent probable losses within each risk classification category. 26 Table of Contents In addition to the portfolio specific quantitative measures described above, the Company considers a variety of qualitative factors in establishing its allowance for loan losses that, generally, are based on managements assessment of economic, market and industry conditions. Such qualitative factors include, but are not limited to: (i) present and forecasted economic conditions, including unemployment rates, new jobs creation, and consumer confidence levels; (ii) changes in industry trends, including the impact of new regulations, the origination market, the U.S. homeownership rate, and potential homebuyer levels; and (iii) trends in property values, including housing market indicators, foreclosure activity, housing inventory and distressed sale levels, and median sales prices/average market time. In completing the build up approach to the allowance for loan losses for smaller balance, homogeneous loans, the amount reflecting our consideration of these various qualitative factors is added to the amounts attributable to historical portfolio loss experience and portfolio specific risk elements. In this manner, historical charge off data (whether periods or amounts) is not adjusted and the allowance for loan losses always includes a component attributable to qualitative factors, the degree of which may change from period to period as such qualitative factors indicate improving or worsening trends. There were no significant changes in the qualitative factor component of the related allowance for loan losses during 2011. Individually Impaired Loans. The allowance for loan losses also includes specific allowances for individually impaired loans. Generally, the Companys impaired loans consist of (i) classified commercial loans in excess of $250,000 that have been placed on non accrual status and (ii) originated loans classified as TDRs. Individually impaired loans are measured based upon observable market prices; the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate; or, in the case of collateral dependent loans, fair value of the collateral (based on appraisals and other market information) less cost to sell. If the recorded investment in a loan exceeds the amount measured as described in the preceding sentence, a specific allowance for loan losses would be established as a component of the overall allowance for loan losses or, in the case of a collateral dependent loan, a charge off would be recorded for the difference between the loans recorded investment and managements estimate of the fair value of the collateral (less cost to sell). It would be rare for the Company to identify a loan that meets the criteria stated above and requires a specific allowance or a charge off and not deem it impaired solely as a result of the existence of a guarantee. Peoples United Financial performs an analysis of its impaired loans, including collateral dependent impaired loans, on a quarterly basis. Individually impaired collateral dependent loans are measured based upon the appraised value of the underlying collateral and other market information. Generally, the Companys policy is to obtain updated appraisals for commercial collateral dependent loans when the loan is downgraded to a risk rating of substandard or doubtful, and the most recent appraisal is more than 12 months old or a determination has been made that the property has experienced a significant decline in value. Appraisals are prepared by independent, licensed third party appraisers and are subject to review by the Companys internal commercial appraisal department or external appraisers contracted by the commercial appraisal department. The conclusions of the external appraisal review are reviewed by the Companys Chief Commercial Appraiser prior to acceptance. The Companys policy with respect to impaired residential mortgage loans is to receive updated appraisals upon the loan being classified as non performing (typically upon becoming 90 days past due). In determining the allowance for loan losses, Peoples United Financial gives appropriate consideration to the age of appraisals through its regular evaluation of other relevant qualitative and quantitative information. Specifically, between scheduled appraisals, property values are monitored within the commercial portfolio by reference to current originations of collateral dependent loans and the related appraisals obtained during underwriting as well as by reference to recent trends in commercial property sales as published by leading industry sources. Property values are monitored within the residential mortgage portfolio by reference to available market indicators, including real estate price indices within the Companys primary lending areas. 27 Table of Contents In most situations where a guarantee exists, the guarantee arrangement is not a specific factor in the assessment of the related allowance for loan losses. However, the assessment of a guarantors credit strength is reflected in the Companys internal loan risk ratings which, in turn, are an important factor in its allowance for loan loss methodology for loans within the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios. Peoples United Financial did not change its methodologies with respect to determining the allowance for loan losses during 2011. While Peoples United Financial seeks to use the best available information to make these determinations, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions, results of regulatory examinations, further information obtained regarding known problem loans, the identification of additional problem loans and other factors. Asset Impairment Judgments Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are required to be reviewed for impairment at least annually, with impairment losses charged to expense when they occur. Acquisition related intangible assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives and are periodically reviewed by management to assess recoverability. Impairment losses on other acquisition related intangibles are recognized as a charge to expense if carrying amounts exceed fair values. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. The test is performed as of an annual impairment testing date or more frequently if a triggering event indicates that impairment may have occurred. The goodwill impairment analysis is a two step test. The first step (Step 1) is used to identify potential impairment, and involves comparing each reporting units estimated fair value to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not deemed to be impaired. Should the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceed its estimated fair value, an indicator of potential impairment is deemed to exist and a second step is performed to measure the amount of such impairment, if any. None of the Companys identified reporting units are at risk of failing the Step 1 goodwill impairment test at this time. The second step (Step 2) involves calculating the implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which impairment was indicated in Step 1. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to how the amount of goodwill is determined in a business combination (i.e. by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, as determined in Step 1, over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities, and identifiable intangibles applicable to that reporting unit as of the impairment testing date). If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, no impairment exists. If the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to such excess. An impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit, and the loss (write down) establishes a new carrying amount for the goodwill. Subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment losses are not permitted. The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units based on an appropriate weighting of values based on (i) a present value measurement technique (discounted cash flow analysis based on internal forecasts) and (ii) market based trading and transaction multiples. The discounted cash flow analysis is based on significant assumptions and judgments including future growth rates and discount rates reflecting managements assessment of market participant views of the risks associated with the projected cash flows of the reporting units. The market based trading and transaction multiples are derived from the market prices of stocks of companies that are actively traded and engaged in the same or similar businesses as the Company and the respective reporting unit. The derived multiples are then applied to the reporting units financial metrics to produce an indication of value. Differences in the identification of reporting units or in the selection of valuation techniques and related assumptions could result in materially different evaluations of goodwill impairment. 28 Table of Contents Securities. Marketable equity and debt securities (other than those reported as short term investments) are classified as either trading account securities, held to maturity securities (applicable only to debt securities) or available for sale securities. Management determines the classification of a security at the time of its purchase. Securities purchased for sale in the near term as well as those held by PSI (in accordance with the requirements for a broker dealer) are classified as trading account securities and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in non interest income. Debt securities for which Peoples United Financial has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity securities and reported at amortized cost. All other securities are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported on an after tax basis in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Premiums are amortized and discounts are accreted to interest income for debt securities, using the interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity, adjusted for the effect of actual prepayments in the case of mortgage backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) and other asset backed securities. Management conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if the decline in fair value of any security is deemed to be other than temporary. Other than temporary impairment losses are recognized on debt securities when: (i) Peoples United Financial has an intention to sell the security; (ii) it is more likely than not that Peoples United Financial will be required to sell the security prior to recovery; or (iii) Peoples United Financial does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. Other than temporary losses on debt securities are reflected in earnings as realized losses to the extent the impairment is related to credit losses. The amount of the impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income. Management has the ability and intent to hold the securities classified as held to maturity until they mature, at which time Peoples United Financial expects to receive full value for the securities. FHLB stock is a non marketable equity security and is, therefore, reported at cost, which equals par value (the amount at which shares have been redeemed in the past). The investment is periodically evaluated for impairment based on, among other things, the capital adequacy of the FHLB and its overall financial condition. Non GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation to GAAP In addition to evaluating Peoples United Financials results of operations in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management routinely supplements this evaluation with an analysis of certain non GAAP financial measures, such as the efficiency and tangible equity ratios, tangible book value per share and operating earnings metrics. Management believes these non GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding Peoples United Financials underlying operating performance and trends, and facilitates comparisons with the performance of other banks and thrifts. Further, the efficiency ratio and operating earnings metrics are used by management in its assessment of financial performance, including non interest expense control, while the tangible equity ratio and tangible book value per share are used to analyze the relative strength of Peoples United Financials capital position. The efficiency ratio, which represents an approximate measure of the cost required by Peoples United Financial to generate a dollar of revenue, is the ratio of (i) total non interest expense (excluding goodwill impairment charges, amortization of other acquisition related intangibles and certain purchase accounting related fair value adjustments, losses on real estate assets and non recurring expenses) (the numerator) to (ii) net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis (excluding certain purchase accounting related fair value adjustments) plus total non interest income (including the FTE adjustment on bank owned life insurance (BOLI) income, and excluding gains and losses on sales of assets other than residential mortgage loans, and non recurring income) (the denominator). Peoples United Financial generally considers an item of income or expense to be non recurring if it is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type incurred within the last two years and is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type reasonably expected to be incurred within the following two years. 29 Table of Contents Operating earnings exclude from net income those items that management considers to be of such a non recurring or infrequent nature that, by excluding such items (net of income taxes), Peoples United Financials results can be measured and assessed on a more consistent basis from period to period. Items excluded from operating earnings, which include, but are not limited to, merger related expenses, core system conversion costs, charges related to executive level management separation costs, severance related costs and real estate asset writedowns, are generally also excluded when calculating the efficiency ratio. Operating earnings per share is calculated by dividing operating earnings by the weighted average number of dilutive common shares outstanding for the respective period. Operating return on average assets is calculated by dividing operating earnings (annualized) by average assets. Operating return on average tangible stockholders equity is calculated by dividing operating earnings (annualized) by average tangible stockholders equity. The operating dividend payout ratio is calculated by dividing dividends paid by operating earnings for the respective period. Operating net interest margin excludes from the net interest margin those items that management considers to be of such an infrequent nature that, by excluding such items, Peoples United Financials net interest margin can be measured and assessed on a more consistent basis from period to period. Items excluded from operating net interest margin include, but are not limited to, cost recovery income on acquired loans and changes in the accretable yield on acquired loans stemming from periodic cash flow reassessments. Operating net interest margin is calculated by dividing operating net interest income (annualized) by average earning assets. The tangible equity ratio is the ratio of (i) tangible stockholders equity (total stockholders equity less goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles) (the numerator) to (ii) tangible assets (total assets less goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles) (the denominator). Tangible book value per share is calculated by dividing tangible stockholders equity by common shares (total common shares issued, less common shares classified as treasury shares and unallocated ESOP common shares). In light of diversity in presentation among financial institutions, the methodologies used by Peoples United Financial for determining the non GAAP financial measures discussed above may differ from those used by other financial institutions. 30 Table of Contents The following table summarizes Peoples United Financials efficiency ratio derived from amounts reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income: Years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 Total non interest expense $ 871.9 $ 782.0 $ 659.8 $ 685.0 $ 439.3 Adjustments: Amortization of: Other acquisition related intangibles (25.8 ) (21.7 ) (20.6 ) (21.3 ) (1.0 ) Purchase accounting relatedfair value adjustments (1) (3.2 ) (3.2 ) (3.1 ) (3.2 ) Merger related expenses (42.9 ) (23.3 ) (2.0 ) (36.5 ) Severance related costs (5.3 ) Real estate writedowns (4.8 ) Executive level separation agreement (3.8 ) (15.3 ) FDIC special assessment (8.4 ) Other one time charges (14.8 ) Contribution to The Peoples United Community Foundation (60.0 ) Other (2) (10.3 ) (9.4 ) (6.5 ) (2.6 ) (1.0 ) Total $ 775.8 $ 709.1 $ 619.2 $ 606.6 $ 377.3 Net interest income (FTE basis) $ 931.4 $ 702.3 $ 580.2 $ 640.3 $ 486.6 Total non interest income 307.6 270.0 284.3 279.6 185.4 Total revenues 1,239.0 972.3 864.5 919.9 672.0 Adjustments: BOLI FTE adjustment 3.1 3.6 4.5 4.5 5.7 Purchase accounting related fair value adjustments (1) (23.0 ) 3.0 6.5 10.4 Net security (gains) losses (8.8 ) 1.0 (22.0 ) (8.3 ) (5.5 ) Gains on sales of acquired loans (7.5 ) Other (3) 2.2 (1.9 ) (4.3 ) Total $ 1,205.0 $ 979.9 $ 851.6 $ 922.2 $ 672.2 Efficiency ratio 64.4 % 72.4 % 72.7 % 65.8 % 56.1 % (1) Reflects the impact of amortization and accretion associated with certain purchase accounting related fair value adjustments recognized in connection with past business combinations. Amounts deducted from non interest expense represent the impact of adjustments made to acquired premises and equipment to reflect the fair value of such assets and which generally have a remaining life of approximately 6 years at December 31, 2011. Amounts added to (deducted from) total revenues represent the impact of adjustments made to loans acquired prior to January 1, 2010 and liabilities assumed (i.e. time deposits, FHLB advances, repurchase agreements and subordinated notes and debentures) as a result of interest rate related changes applicable to such instruments and which generally have a weighted average remaining life of approximately 7 years at December 31, 2011. These adjustments are made because management believes such income and expense amounts are not relevant for purposes of evaluating operating efficiency. (2) Items classified as other and deducted from non interest expense include, as applicable, certain franchise taxes, REO expenses and contract termination costs. (3) Items classified as other and added to (deducted from) total revenues include, as applicable, asset write offs, gains associated with the sale of branch locations and mortgage servicing rights, and interest on an income tax refund. 31 Table of Contents The following tables summarizes Peoples United Financials operating earnings, operating earnings per share, operating return on average

$ 15.07 Economic Environment In response to the significant disruptions in the capital markets brought about by the sub prime mortgage crisis and its after effects, turmoil in the financial sector, and the contracting U.S. economy, the Federal Reserve Board lowered the targeted federal funds rate ten times since September 2007, and established a target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to 0.25 percent as of December 16, 2008, which has not changed since. Peoples United Financials results are subject to fluctuations based on economic conditions. Economic activity in the United States has improved modestly since the latter half of 2009 after slowing significantly throughout 2008. Real gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of 2.8% in the fourth quarter of 2011, after increasing 1.8% in the third quarter. The national unemployment rate was 8.5% as of December 31, 2011, down from 9.4% at the end of 2010. The New England region is Peoples United Financials primary market area, with Connecticut, Massachusetts and Vermont having the largest concentration of Peoples United Financials loans, deposits and branches. Connecticut is one of the most attractive banking markets in the United States. With a total population of approximately 3.5 million and a median household income of $70,340, Connecticut ranks second in the United States, well above the U.S. median household income of $54,442, according to the 2010 Census and SNL Financial. Fairfield County, where Peoples United Financial is headquartered, has the highest median household income in Connecticut of $87,754 according to the 2010 Census and SNL Financial. The states unemployment rate decreased to 7.6% as of December 31, 2011 compared to 8.6% at the end of 2010, and remains below the national rate. 34 Table of Contents The Connecticut economy experienced a moderate increase in jobs in 2011, with total seasonally adjusted employment increasing by 11,265 jobs, or approximately 0.7%, from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011, compared to an increase of 7,248 jobs, or approximately 0.4%, from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010. The median household income in Massachusetts was $67,515, according to the 2010 Census and SNL Financial, and the states unemployment rate was 6.5% at December 31, 2011, down from 8.0% at the end of 2010. The median household income in Vermont was $53,811 according to the 2010 Census and SNL Financial, and the states unemployment rate was 4.9% at December 31, 2011, down from 5.6% at the end of 2010. The overall outlook for the New England economy in 2012 is improving, with the expectation that the region may experience a stronger recovery than the rest of the United States as a whole. Financial Overview Peoples United Financial completed its acquisition of Danvers on June 30, 2011, effective July 1, 2011. Peoples United Financial acquired Smithtown and LSB on November 30, 2010, Butler Bank on April 16, 2010 and Financial Federal on February 19, 2010. The results of operations for these acquired companies have been included beginning as of their respective closing dates. Financial data for prior periods has not been restated to include Danvers, Smithtown, LSB, Butler Bank and Financial Federal and therefore, are not directly comparable to subsequent periods. Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2011 and 2010. Total assets at December 31, 2011 were $27.6 billion, a $2.5 billion increase from December 31, 2010, reflecting increases of $3.1 billion in total loans and $228 million in goodwill, partially offset by decreases of $709 million in short term investments and securities purchased under agreements to resell and $102 million in total securities. The increase in total loans from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011 reflects increases of $2.1 billion in commercial banking loans and $981 million in residential mortgage loans. Originated loans increased $2.3 billion from December 31, 2010 to $16.8 billion (commercial banking loans increased $1.5 billion and retail loans increased $832 million) and acquired loans increased $724 million. At the acquisition date, the fair value of Danvers loans totaled $1.9 billion. At December 31, 2011, the carrying amount of the acquired loan portfolio totaled $3.6 billion. The decrease in total securities reflects the sale of 15 year mortgage backed securities with an amortized cost of $507 million that were sold to reduce book value at risk due to an expected increase in prepayments, partially offset by purchases of short duration agency issued CMOs backed by collateral that is expected to exhibit lower prepayment risk. Non performing assets (excluding acquired non performing loans) totaled $336.7 million at December 31, 2011, a $33.6 million increase from year end 2010, primarily reflecting a $52.1 million increase in non performing commercial banking loans partially offset by a $13.0 million decrease in real estate owned (REO). The allowance for loan losses on originated loans was $175.5 million at December 31, 2011, reflecting a $3.0 million increase from December 31, 2010 in response to growth in the commercial and residential mortgage loan portfolios. The allowance for loan losses on acquired loans was $7.4 million at December 31, 2011 (none at December 31, 2010). At December 31, 2011, the originated allowance for loan losses as a percent of originated loans was 1.04% and as a percent of originated non performing loans was 59.7%, compared to 1.19% and 70.3%, respectively, at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, liabilities totaled $22.3 billion, a $2.5 billion increase from December 31, 2010, reflecting a $2.9 billion increase in total deposits, partially offset by decreases of $181 million in other liabilities and $154 million in total borrowings. At the acquisition date, the fair value of Danvers deposits totaled $2.1 billion. The decrease in total borrowings primarily reflects the repayment of callable FHLB advances assumed in recent acquisitions and the decrease in other liabilities primarily reflects the settlement of securities purchased at the end of 2010. 35 Table of Contents Peoples United Financials total stockholders equity was $5.2 billion at December 31, 2011, a $6 million increase from December 31, 2010. This increase primarily reflects the issuance of 18.5 million shares of common stock with a fair value of approximately $248 million in connection with the Danvers acquisition and net income of $198.8 million, essentially offset by dividends paid of $220.9 million and open market repurchases of 20.4 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $247.2 million. As a percentage of total assets, stockholders equity was 19.0% at December 31, 2011 compared to 20.8% at December 31, 2010. Tangible stockholders equity as a percentage of tangible assets was 12.0% at December 31, 2011 compared to 14.1% at December 31, 2010. Peoples United Financials (consolidated) tier 1 and total risk based capital ratios were 14.8% and 16.2%, respectively, at December 31, 2011, compared to 17.5% and 19.3%, respectively, at December 31, 2010. Peoples United Banks leverage (core) capital ratio, and tier 1 and total risk based capital ratios were 11.1%, 13.1% and 14.0%, respectively, at December 31, 2011, compared to 11.4%, 13.6% and 14.5%, respectively, at December 31, 2010. Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. Peoples United Financial reported net income of $198.8 million, or $0.57 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $85.7 million, or $0.24 per share, for the year ago period. Operating earnings were $237.1 million, or $0.68 per share, for 2011, compared to $125.4 million, or $0.35 per share, for 2010. Included in the 2011 and 2010 results are $38.3 million and $39.7 million (after tax), respectively, of merger related expenses, core system conversion costs and one time charges. Earnings in 2011 continue to reflect organic loan and deposit growth, improvement in net interest income, continued positive results in fee related businesses and tighter expense control. Peoples United Financials operating return on average assets was 0.91% for 2011 compared to 0.57% for 2010. Operating return on average tangible stockholders equity was 7.4% for 2011 compared to 3.5% for the year ago period. FTE net interest income increased $229.1 million from the year ago period while the net interest margin improved 44 basis points to 4.14%. The higher net interest margin primarily reflects the benefits from recent acquisitions, a 15 basis point reduction in the cost of deposits and the deployment of a portion of the Companys excess capital that was previously invested in relatively low yielding short term investments and securities purchased under agreements to resell, partially offset by the effect of the historically low interest rate environment. Compared to 2010, average earning assets increased $3.5 billion, reflecting increases of $3.6 billion in average loans and $1.3 billion in average securities, partially offset by a $1.4 billion decrease in average short term investments and securities purchased under agreements to resell. Average funding liabilities increased $4.2 billion, primarily reflecting increases of $3.5 billion in average total deposits and $709 million in average total borrowings. Total non interest income increased $37.6 million and total non interest expense increased $89.9 million compared to the year ago period. The efficiency ratio was 64.4% for 2011 compared to 72.4% for the year ago period. The provision for loan losses in 2011 totaled $63.7 million compared to $60.0 million in the year ago period. The provision for loan losses in 2011 reflected net loan charge offs of $53.3 million, a $3.0 million increase in the originated allowance for loan losses and a $7.4 million increase in the acquired allowance for loan losses. The provision for loan losses in 2010 reflected net loan charge offs of $60.0 million. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average total loans were 0.28% in 2011 compared to 0.40% in 2010. Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Total assets at December 31, 2010 were $25.0 billion, a $3.8 billion increase from December 31, 2009, reflecting increases of $3.2 billion in total loans, $2.1 billion in securities and $462 million in goodwill, partially offset by a $2.4 billion decrease in short term investments and securities purchased under agreements to resell. Peoples United Financial used short term investments totaling approximately $418 million to fund the cash consideration in the acquisitions completed in 2010 and approximately $845 million to repay borrowings assumed in these acquisitions. 36 Table of Contents The increase in total loans from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010 reflects the addition of loans acquired in connection with the acquisitions completed in 2010, as well as organic growth of $206 million in commercial real estate loans and $210 million in commercial and industrial loans. In addition, fixed rate residential mortgage loans increased $347 million, reflecting the addition of the acquisitions completed in 2010, as well as organic growth of $184 million, while adjustable rate residential mortgage loans decreased $112 million. At December 31, 2010, the carrying amount of the acquired loan portfolios totaled $2.9 billion. Non performing assets (excluding acquired non performing loans) totaled $303.1 million at December 31, 2010, a $97.5 million increase from December 31, 2009, primarily reflecting increases of $26.1 million in non performing residential mortgage loans, $20.8 million in non performing commercial and industrial loans, $15.4 million in non performing equipment financing loans, $10.1 million in non performing commercial real estate loans and $21.1 million in REO and repossessed assets, $31.5 million of which resulted from acquisitions completed in 2010. The allowance for loan losses totaled $172.5 million at both December 31, 2010 and 2009. At December 31, 2010, the allowance for loan losses as a percent of originated loans was 1.19% and as a percent of originated non performing loans was 70.3%, compared to 1.22% and 102.2%, respectively, at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2010, liabilities totaled $19.8 billion, a $3.7 billion increase from December 31, 2009, reflecting increases of $2.5 billion in total deposits and $852 million in total borrowings. Peoples United Financial assumed deposits with a fair value of $2.5 billion in connection with the acquisitions completed in 2010 and retained FHLB advances and term repurchase agreements with fair values of $500 million and $27 million, respectively, in connection with the Smithtown and LSB acquisitions. Peoples United Financials total stockholders equity was $5.2 billion at December 31, 2010, a $119 million increase compared to $5.1 billion at December 31, 2009. This increase primarily reflects the issuance of 28.1 million shares of common stock with a fair value (net of issuance costs) of approximately $431 million in connection with the acquisitions completed in 2010 and net income of $85.7 million, partially offset by dividends paid of $218.1 million and the open market repurchase of 14.3 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $191.2 million. As a percentage of total assets, stockholders equity was 20.8% at December 31, 2010 compared to 24.0% at December 31, 2009. Tangible stockholders equity as a percentage of tangible assets was 14.1% of tangible assets at December 31, 2010 compared to 18.2% at December 31, 2009. Peoples United Banks leverage (core) capital ratio, and tier 1 and total risk based capital ratios were 11.4%, 13.6% and 14.5%, respectively, at December 31, 2010, compared to 10.0%, 13.1% and 14.1%, respectively, at December 31, 2009. Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Peoples United Financial reported net income of $85.7 million, or $0.24 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $101.2 million, or $0.30 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2009. Operating earnings were $125.4 million, or $0.35 per share, for 2010, compared to $104.3 million, or $0.31 per share, for 2009. Included in the 2010 and 2009 results are $39.7 million and $3.1 million (after tax), respectively, of merger related expenses, core system conversion costs and one time charges. In 2010, Peoples United Financials return on average tangible assets was 0.42% and return on average tangible stockholders equity was 2.4%, compared to 0.53% and 2.8%, respectively, in 2009. FTE net interest income increased $122.1 million from 2009 while the net interest margin increased 50 basis points to 3.70%. The higher net interest margin reflects higher investment income, the benefit from the Financial Federal acquisition completed in February 2010 and lower deposit costs, partially offset by the low interest rate environment and the Companys asset sensitive balance sheet, including its significant excess capital position, a portion of which was invested in low yielding short term investments for most of 2010. 37 Table of Contents Average earning assets increased $832 million compared to 2009, reflecting increases of $829 million in average loans and $645 million in average securities, partially offset by a $626 million decrease in average short term investments and securities purchased under agreements to resell. Average funding liabilities increased $1.0 billion compared to 2009, reflecting a $925 million increase in average total deposits. Compared to 2009, total non interest income decreased $14.3 million and total non interest expense increased $122.2 million. The efficiency ratio was 72.4% in 2010 compared to 72.7% in 2009. The provision for loan losses in 2010 totaled $60.0 million compared to $57.0 million in 2009. The provision for loan losses in 2010 reflected net loan charge offs of $60.0 million. The provision for loan losses in 2009 reflected net loan charge offs of $42.0 million and a $15.0 million increase in the allowance for loan losses. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average total loans were 0.40% in 2010 compared to 0.29% in 2009. Business Segment Results Peoples United Financials operations are divided into three primary business segments that represent its core businesses: Commercial Banking; Retail and Business Banking; and Wealth Management. In addition, the Treasury area manages Peoples United Financials securities portfolio, short term investments and securities purchased under agreements to resell, wholesale borrowings and the funding center. The Companys operating segments have been aggregated into reportable segments that have been identified and organized based on the nature of the products and services offered by the respective segment. Business Segment Performance Summary Net Income Years ended December 31 (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Commercial Banking $ 186.6 $ 94.8 $ 81.8 Retail and Business Banking 61.4 57.0 79.0 Wealth Management (3.2 ) (4.2 ) (1.9 ) Total segments 244.8 147.6 158.9 Treasury (4.3 ) (33.0 ) (68.8 ) Other (41.7 ) (28.9 ) 11.1 Total Consolidated $ 198.8 $ 85.7 $ 101.2 Peoples United Financial uses an internal profitability reporting system to generate information by operating segment, which is based on a series of management estimates and allocations regarding funds transfer pricing (FTP), the provision for loan losses, non interest expense and income taxes. These estimates and allocations, some of which can be subjective in nature, are continually being reviewed and refined. Any changes in estimates and allocations that may affect the reported results of any business segment will not affect the consolidated financial position or results of operations of Peoples United Financial as a whole. FTP is used in the calculation of each operating segments net interest income, and measures the value of funds used in and provided by an operating segment. The difference between the interest income on earning assets and the interest expense on funding liabilities, and the corresponding FTP charge for interest income or credit for interest expense, results in net spread income (see Treasury). Beginning in the third quarter of 2011, the Company modified its FTP methodology relating to certain deposit products, which resulted in the allocation of a larger credit to net interest income within Commercial Banking and Retail and Business Banking, with the offset allocated to Treasury. Prior period segment results continue to reflect the previous FTP methodology. 38 Table of Contents A five year rolling average net charge off rate is used as the basis for the provision for loan losses for the respective segment in order to present a level of portfolio credit cost that is representative of the Companys historical experience, without presenting the potential volatility from year to year changes in credit conditions. While this method of allocation allows management to more effectively assess the longer term profitability of a business segment, it may result in a measure of segment provision for loan losses that does not reflect actual incurred losses for the periods presented. Peoples United Financial allocates a majority of non interest expenses to each business segment using a full absorption costing process (i.e. all expenses are fully allocated to the segments). Direct and indirect costs are analyzed and pooled by process and assigned to the appropriate business segment and corporate overhead costs are allocated to the business segments. Income tax expense is allocated to each business segment using a constant rate, based on an estimate of the consolidated effective income tax rate for the year. Total average assets and total average liabilities are reported for each business segment due to managements reliance, in part, on such average balances for purposes of assessing business segment performance. These averages include allocated goodwill and intangible assets. For a more detailed description of the estimates and allocations used to measure business segment performance, see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Commercial Banking consists principally of commercial real estate lending, commercial and industrial lending, and commercial deposit gathering activities. This segment also includes the equipment financing operations of PCLC and PUEFC, as well as cash management, correspondent banking and municipal banking.

The $141.4 million increase in net interest income reflects an increase in average earning assets, improved spreads on commercial loans due to loan mix and the benefit from the change in FTP methodology discussed previously, partially offset by narrowing spreads on commercial deposits. Non interest income reflects increases in operating lease income resulting from a higher level of equipment leased to PCLC customers, commercial banking fees and a $7.5 million net gain on sale of acquired loans in 2011. The increase in non interest expense reflects additional non interest expenses resulting from recent acquisitions and an increase in amortization expense on leased equipment. Average assets increased $2.6 billion in 2011 compared to 2010, reflecting organic loan growth and recent acquisitions. The $13.0 million increase in Commercial Banking net income in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily reflects the benefit from the Financial Federal acquisition completed in February 2010. The $48.6 million increase in net interest income reflects an increase in average earning assets as well as improved spreads on commercial loans, partially offset by narrowing spreads on commercial deposits. The $15.6 million increase in non interest income primarily reflects increases in operating lease income resulting from a higher level of equipment leased to PCLC customers and commercial banking fees. The $40.0 million increase in non interest expense reflects PUEFC non interest expenses in 2010, increases in amortization expense on leased equipment and higher direct expenses due to the continued loan growth in Commercial Banking. 39 Table of Contents The total average commercial banking loan portfolio increased $1.2 billion in 2010 compared to 2009, reflecting the Financial Federal acquisition (average of $903 million in 2010) as well as other acquisitions completed in 2010, and a $386 million increase in average commercial real estate loans. Retail and Business Banking includes, as its principal business lines, business lending, consumer and business deposit gathering activities, consumer lending (including residential mortgage and home equity lending), and merchant services.

The $85.3 million increase in net interest income primarily reflects growth in deposit balances, an increase in the spread on residential mortgages and consumer loans and the benefit from the change in FTP methodology discussed previously, partially offset by narrower spreads on deposit products resulting from the continued negative impact of a reduced interest rate environment initiated by the Federal Reserve Board in 2008. The increase in non interest income compared to 2010 primarily reflects an increase in retail bank service charges, partially offset by a decrease in net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans resulting from the lower level of residential mortgage loan sales in 2011. The $82.6 million increase in non interest expense compared to 2010 reflects increases in direct and allocated expenses associated with expanding the retail deposit franchise through acquisitions as well as organic growth. Average assets increased $1.3 billion and average liabilities increased $3.4 billion in 2011 compared to 2010, reflecting organic loan and deposit growth, and recent acquisitions. Retail and Business Banking net income decreased $22.0 million in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily reflecting increases in non interest expense and the provision for loan losses and a decline in non interest income, partially offset by an increase in net interest income. The $8.2 million increase in net interest income primarily reflects the growth in deposit balances (see below) and an increase in the spread on residential mortgages, partially offset by narrower spreads on deposit products resulting from the continued negative impact of a reduced interest rate environment initiated by the Federal Reserve Board in 2008, and lower residential mortgage balances. Average residential mortgage loans decreased $338 million compared to 2009, reflecting Peoples United Financials past practice, through May 2010, of selling essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. The decrease in non interest income compared to 2009 reflects a $1.8 million decline in net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans resulting from the lower level of residential mortgage loan sales in 2010. The $34.0 million increase in non interest expense compared to 2009 reflects increases in direct and allocated expenses associated with expanding the retail deposit franchise through recent acquisitions as well as organic growth. Average liabilities increased $1.2 billion in 2010 compared to 2009, reflecting a $925 million increase in average deposits primarily due to organic growth. 40 Table of Contents Wealth Management consists of trust services, corporate trust, brokerage, financial advisory services, investment management services and life insurance provided by PSI, other insurance services provided through PUIA and private banking.

Within non interest income, insurance revenue increased $1.9 million, reflecting a higher level of insurance renewals, investment management fees increased $1.2 million and brokerage commissions increased $0.6 million. The increase in non interest expense primarily reflects an increase in professional and outside services as well as an increase in allocated expenses. The increase in Wealth Managements net loss in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily reflects a $2.5 million decrease in non interest income, including decreases of $1.2 million in insurance revenue, $0.9 million in brokerage commissions and $0.4 million in investment management fees. The decrease in insurance revenue primarily reflects the continued soft insurance market resulting from the contracting economy. The declines in investment management fees and brokerage commissions primarily reflect the uncertainty in the equity markets and broader economic weakness experienced throughout 2009 and 2010. Assets under administration and those under full discretionary management, neither of which are reported as assets of Peoples United Financial, totaled $12.5 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2011 compared to $12.6 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2010. Treasury encompasses the securities portfolio, short term investments and securities purchased under agreements to resell, wholesale borrowings, and the funding center, which includes the impact of derivative financial instruments used for risk management purposes. The income or loss for the funding center represents the interest rate risk component of Peoples United Financials net interest income as calculated by its FTP model in deriving each business segments net interest income. Under this process, a money desk (the funding center) buys funds from liability generating business lines (such as consumer deposits) and sells funds to asset generating business lines (such as commercial lending). The price at which funds are bought and sold on any given day is set by Peoples United Financials Treasury group and is based on the wholesale cost to Peoples United Financial of assets and liabilities with similar maturities. Liability generating businesses sell newly originated liabilities to the money desk and recognize a funding credit, while asset generating businesses buy funding for newly originated assets from the money desk and recognize a funding charge. Once funding for an asset is purchased from or a liability is sold to the money desk, the price that is set by the Treasury group will remain with that asset or liability until it matures or reprices, which effectively transfers responsibility for managing interest rate risk to the Treasury group. 41 Table of Contents Years ended December 31 (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net interest loss $ (21.1 ) $ (53.3 ) $ (127.1 ) Total non interest income 14.1 7.3 24.3 Total non interest expense (1.2 ) 3.1 3.5 Loss before income tax benefit (5.8 ) (49.1 ) (106.3 ) Income tax benefit (1.5 ) (16.1 ) (37.5 ) Net loss $ (4.3 ) $ (33.0 ) $ (68.8 ) Total average assets $ 3,870.3 $ 3,924.7 $ 3,957.6 Total average liabilities 699.0 126.4 90.7 Treasurys net loss improved in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily reflecting a decrease in net interest loss and an increase in non interest income. The improvement in net interest loss reflects an increase in the funding centers net interest spread, primarily resulting from the benefit of an increase in investment income in 2011, partially offset by the impact of the change in FTP methodology discussed previously. Included in total non interest income in 2011 are $9.1 million of gross security gains resulting from the sale of mortgage backed securities with a book value of $507 million. Total average assets decreased $54 million in 2011 compared to the year ago period, reflecting a $1.4 billion increase in average securities offset by a $1.4 billion decrease in average short term investments and average securities purchased under agreements to resell. The increase in total average liabilities primarily reflects increases in average total borrowings and average subordinated notes and debentures assumed in connection with recent acquisitions. Treasurys net loss in 2010 was reduced by $35.8 million compared to 2009, reflecting an improvement in net interest loss partially offset by a decrease in non interest income. The $73.8 million decrease in net interest loss reflects an increase in the funding centers net interest spread, which is primarily due to the historically low interest rate environment over an extended period of time, resulting in long term funding costs declining more than asset yields, reflecting the asset sensitive position of Peoples United Financials balance sheet. The decrease in non interest income primarily reflects net security losses in 2010 of $1.0 million compared to net security gains of $16.6 million in 2009. Total average assets decreased $33 million in 2010 compared to 2009, reflecting a $645 million increase in average securities and a $626 million decrease in average short term investments and average securities purchased under agreements to resell. Other includes the residual financial impact from the allocation of revenues and expenses (including the provision for loan losses) and certain revenues and expenses not attributable to a particular segment; reversal of the FTE adjustment since net interest income for each segment is presented on an FTE basis; and the FTP impact from excess capital.

Included in Other are assets such as cash, premises and equipment, and other assets, including pension assets. Net Interest Income Net interest income and net interest margin are affected by many factors, including changes in average balances; interest rate fluctuations and the slope of the yield curve; sales of loans and securities; residential mortgage loan and mortgage backed security prepayment rates; product pricing; competitive forces; the relative mix, repricing characteristics and maturity of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities; non interest bearing sources of funds; hedging activities; and asset quality. Net Interest Margin Years ended December 31 (percent) Net Interest Income FTE Years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 43 Table of Contents Since December 2008, the Federal Reserve Board has not changed its targeted range for the federal funds rate of 0 to 0.25 percent. The improvement in the net interest margin in 2011 and 2010 primarily reflects the benefits from the acquisitions completed over the past two years, an increase in investment income and lower deposit costs. However, the net interest margin has been impacted by the historically low interest rate environment and the Companys continued investment of a portion of its excess capital in relatively low yielding short term investments and securities purchased under agreements to resell. 2011 Compared to 2010 The net interest margin increased 44 basis points to 4.14% compared to 2010. The higher net interest margin primarily reflects the benefits from recent acquisitions, an increase in investment income and lower deposit costs. Net interest income (FTE basis) increased $229.1 million, reflecting a $227.8 million increase in total interest and dividend income and a $1.3 million decrease in total interest expense. Net interest income in 2011 included (i) $11.2 million of interest related to changes in the accretable yield on acquired loans stemming from periodic cash flow reassessments and (ii) $5.0 million of cost recovery income on acquired loans (representing cash receipts in excess of carrying amount). Excluding these two items, the operating net interest margin in 2011 was 4.07%. Average earning assets totaled $22.5 billion in 2011, a $3.5 billion increase from 2010, reflecting increases of $3.6 billion in average loans and $1.4 billion in average securities, partially offset by a $1.4 billion decrease in average short term investments and securities purchased under agreements to resell. Average loans, average securities, and average short term investments and securities purchased under agreements to resell comprised 84%, 13% and 3%, respectively, of average earning assets in 2011 compared to 80%, 8% and 12%, respectively, in 2010. In 2011, the yield earned on the total loan portfolio was 5.18% and the yield earned on securities, short term investments and securities purchased under agreements to resell was 2.35%, compared to 5.14% and 1.30%, respectively, in the year ago period. Excluding adjustable rate residential mortgage loans, which are mostly of the hybrid variety, approximately 48% of the loan portfolio had floating interest rates at December 31, 2011 compared to approximately 45% at December 31, 2010. The total average commercial banking loan portfolio increased $2.9 billion compared to 2010, reflecting loans acquired through recent acquisitions as well as organic growth. Average residential mortgage loans increased $698 million compared to the year ago period, reflecting recent acquisitions and Peoples United Financials decision in May 2010 to begin retaining newly originated residential mortgage loans. Average consumer loans decreased $9 million compared to 2010, reflecting a $40 million decline in average indirect auto loans partially offset by a $35 million increase in average home equity loans. Average funding liabilities totaled $20.4 billion in 2011, a $4.2 billion increase compared to 2010, including increases of $3.5 billion in average total deposits and $709 million in average borrowings, reflecting acquisitions and growth. Average savings and money market deposits, average time deposits and average non interest bearing deposits increased $2.1 billion, $743 million and $607 million, respectively. Average total deposits comprised 94% and 97% of average funding liabilities in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The 17 basis point decrease to 0.63% from 0.80% in the rate paid on average funding liabilities in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily reflects the decrease in market interest rates and the shift in deposit mix. The rate paid on average deposits decreased 15 basis points in 2011, reflecting decreases of 37 basis points in time deposits and 9 basis points in savings and money market deposits. Average savings and money market deposits and average time deposits comprised 52% and 27%, respectively, of average total deposits in 2011 compared to 50% and 29%, respectively, in 2010. 44 Table of Contents 2010 Compared to 2009 The net interest margin increased 50 basis points to 3.70% compared to 2009. The higher net interest margin reflects higher investment income, the benefit from the Financial Federal acquisition completed in February 2010 and lower deposit costs, partially offset by the low interest rate environment and the Companys asset sensitive balance sheet, including its significant excess capital position, a portion of which was invested in low yielding short term investments for most of 2010. Net interest income (FTE basis) increased $122.1 million, reflecting a $61.9 million increase in total interest and dividend income and a $60.2 million decrease in total interest expense. Average earning assets totaled $19.0 billion in 2010, an $832 million increase from 2009, reflecting increases of $829 million in average loans and $645 million in average securities, partially offset by a $626 million decrease in average short term investments and securities purchased under agreements to resell. Average loans, average short term investments and securities purchased under agreements to resell, and average securities comprised 80%, 12% and 8%, respectively, of average earning assets in 2010 compared to 79%, 16% and 5%, respectively, in 2009. In 2010, the yield earned on the total loan portfolio was 5.14% and the yield earned on securities, short term investments and securities purchased under agreements to resell was 1.30%, compared to 5.07% and 1.06%, respectively, in 2009. The total average commercial banking loan portfolio increased $1.2 billion, reflecting the addition of the PUEFC portfolio (average of $903 million in 2010) and other acquisitions completed in 2010, and a $386 million increase in average commercial real estate loans. Average residential mortgage loans decreased $337 million compared to 2009, reflecting Peoples United Financials past practice, through May 2010, of selling essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. Average consumer loans decreased $65 million, reflecting declines of $46 million in average indirect auto loans and $15 million in average home equity loans. Average funding liabilities totaled $16.3 billion in 2010, a $1.0 billion increase compared to 2009, primarily reflecting a $925 million increase in average total deposits. Average savings and money market deposits and average non interest bearing deposits increased $1.1 billion and $215 million, respectively, and average time deposits decreased $433 million. Average total deposits comprised 97% and 98% of average funding liabilities in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 45 basis point decrease to 0.80% from 1.25% in the rate paid on average funding liabilities in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily reflects the decrease in market interest rates and the shift in deposit mix. The rates paid on average total deposits decreased 45 basis points in 2010, reflecting decreases of 108 basis points in time deposits and 12 basis points in savings and money market deposits. Average savings and money market deposits and average time deposits comprised 50% and 29%, respectively, of average total deposits in 2010 compared to 45% and 33%, respectively, in 2009. Average Balance Sheet, Interest and Yield/Rate Analysis The table on the following page presents average balance sheets, FTE basis interest income, interest expense and the corresponding average yields earned and rates paid for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. The average balances are principally daily averages and, for loans, include both performing and non performing balances. Interest income on loans includes the effect of deferred loan fees and costs accounted for as yield adjustments, but does not include interest on loans for which Peoples United Financial has ceased to accrue interest. Premium amortization and discount accretion (including amounts attributable to purchase accounting adjustments) are also included in the respective interest income and interest expense amounts. The impact of Peoples United Financials use of derivative instruments in managing interest rate risk is also reflected in the table, classified according to the instrument hedged and the related risk management objective. 45 Table of Contents Average Balance Sheet, Interest and Yield/Rate Analysis 2011 2010 2009 Years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) AverageBalance Interest Yield/Rate AverageBalance Interest Yield/Rate AverageBalance Interest Yield/Rate Assets: Short term investments $ 743.1 $ 2.0 0.28 % $ 1,725.0 $ 4.6 0.27 % $ 2,386.5 $ 6.5 0.27 % Securities purchased underagreements to resell 27.3 0.1 0.17 456.2 0.9 0.20 421.1 0.8 0.19 Securities (1) 2,933.3 85.1 2.90 1,579.5 43.5 2.76 934.2 32.4 3.47 Loans held for sale 38.8 2.1 5.42 43.4 2.4 5.59 59.0 3.0 5.13 Loans: Commercial real estate 6,971.8 392.4 5.63 5,594.8 312.1 5.58 5,208.5 287.8 5.52 Commercial (2) 6,465.4 364.9 5.64 4,961.9 269.6 5.43 4,116.7 202.3 4.91 Residential mortgage 3,126.8 129.1 4.13 2,428.6 109.4 4.51 2,766.2 142.0 5.13 Consumer 2,190.1 84.2 3.85 2,199.2 89.6 4.07 2,264.4 95.4 4.21 Total loans 18,754.1 970.6 5.18 15,184.5 780.7 5.14 14,355.8 727.5 5.07 Total earning assets 22,496.6 $ 1,059.9 4.71 % 18,988.6 $ 832.1 4.38 % 18,156.6 $ 770.2 4.24 % Other assets 3,531.6 3,027.6 2,600.9 Total assets $ 26,028.2 $ 22,016.2 $ 20,757.5 Liabilities and stockholders equity: Deposits: Non interest bearing $ 4,032.8 $ % $ 3,426.0 $ % $ 3,210.8 $ % Savings, interest bearing checking and money market 9,970.1 51.0 0.51 7,853.6 47.4 0.60 6,710.6 48.2 0.72 Time 5,276.6 56.4 1.07 4,533.5 65.4 1.44 4,966.9 125.2 2.52 Total deposits 19,279.5 107.4 0.56 15,813.1 112.8 0.71 14,888.3 173.4 1.16 Borrowings: Retail repurchase agreements 486.6 2.0 0.41 209.2 1.0 0.48 151.2 0.7 0.46 FHLB advances 456.1 6.7 1.48 52.3 1.1 2.22 14.8 0.8 5.28 Federal funds purchased andother borrowings 36.6 0.3 0.75 9.0 0.2 2.20 2.1 1.92 Total borrowings 979.3 9.0 0.92 270.5 2.3 0.88 168.1 1.5 0.90 Subordinated notes and debentures 170.4 12.1 7.08 179.6 14.7 8.17 181.2 15.1 8.35 Total funding liabilities 20,429.2 $ 128.5 0.63 % 16,263.2 $ 129.8 0.80 % 15,237.6 $ 190.0 1.25 % Other liabilities 327.7 384.7 378.5 Total liabilities 20,756.9 16,647.9 15,616.1 Stockholders equity 5,271.3 5,368.3 5,141.4 Total liabilities and stockholders equity $ 26,028.2 $ 22,016.2 $ 20,757.5 Net interest income/spread (3) $ 931.4 4.08 % $ 702.3 3.58 % $ 580.2 2.99 % Net interest margin 4.14 % 3.70 % 3.20 % (1) Average balances and yields for securities available for sale are based on amortized cost.

For each category of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, information is provided relating to: changes in volume (changes in average balances multiplied by the prior years average interest rate); changes in rates (changes in average interest rates multiplied by the prior years average balance); and the total change. Changes attributable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately. 2011 Compared to 2010Increase (Decrease) 2010 Compared to 2009Increase (Decrease) (in millions) Volume Rate Total Volume Rate Total Interest and dividend income: Short term investments $ (2.7 ) $ 0.1 $ (2.6 ) $ (1.8 ) $ (0.1 ) $ (1.9 ) Securities purchased under agreements to resell (0.7 ) (0.1 ) (0.8 ) 0.1 0.1 Securities 39.2 2.4 41.6 18.8 (7.7 ) 11.1 Loans held for sale (0.3 ) (0.3 ) (0.9 ) 0.3 (0.6 ) Loans: Commercial real estate 77.5 2.8 80.3 21.5 2.8 24.3 Commercial 84.5 10.8 95.3 44.4 22.9 67.3 Residential mortgage 29.4 (9.7 ) 19.7 (16.3 ) (16.3 ) (32.6 ) Consumer (0.4 ) (5.0 ) (5.4 ) (2.6 ) (3.2 ) (5.8 ) Total loans 191.0 (1.1 ) 189.9 47.0 6.2 53.2 Total change in interest and dividend income 226.5 1.3 227.8 63.1 (1.2 ) 61.9 Interest expense: Deposits: Savings, interest bearing checkingand money market 11.5 (7.9 ) 3.6 7.5 (8.3 ) (0.8 ) Time 9.6 (18.6 ) (9.0 ) (10.1 ) (49.7 ) (59.8 ) Total deposits 21.1 (26.5 ) (5.4 ) (2.6 ) (58.0 ) (60.6 ) Borrowings: Retail repurchase agreements 6.1 (0.5 ) 5.6 0.3 0.3 FHLB advances 1.1 (0.1 ) 1.0 1.0 (0.7 ) 0.3 Federal funds purchased and other borrowings 0.3 (0.2 ) 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.2 Total borrowings 7.5 (0.9 ) 6.6 1.4 (0.6 ) 0.8 Subordinated notes and debentures (0.7 ) (1.9 ) (2.6 ) (0.1 ) (0.3 ) (0.4 ) Total change in interest expense 27.9 (29.2 ) (1.3 ) (1.3 ) (58.9 ) (60.2 ) Change in net interest income $ 198.6 $ 30.5 $ 229.1 $ 64.4 $ 57.7 $ 122.1 47 Table of Contents The following table provides the weighted average yields earned and rates paid for each major category of earning assets and funding liabilities as of December 31, 2011.

The improvement in total non interest income in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily reflects the benefits from acquisitions completed in 2011 and 2010, net security gains in 2011 and higher commercial banking fees in 2011. The decrease in total non interest income in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily reflects net security losses of $1.0 million in 2010 and net security gains of $22.0 million in 2009 (see below). Within non interest income, the expenses related to the Companys merchant services business and customer derivative activities are presented on a net basis for all periods, along with the respective revenues. The increase in bank service charges in 2011 primarily reflects improvements in commercial and retail fees, partially offset by a $5.0 million decline in interchange fees resulting from certain provisions of the DFA, which took effect in October 2011. Bank service charges are expected to decline by approximately $20 million on an annualized basis as a result of certain provisions of the DFA (see Recent Market Developments). The level of investment management fees and brokerage commissions in recent years primarily reflects the uncertainty in the equity markets and broader economic weakness experienced throughout the past few years, while the level of insurance revenue primarily reflects the continued soft insurance market. In 2011, Peoples United Financial sold mortgage backed securities with an amortized cost of $507 million, in order to reduce book value at risk resulting from higher prepayment speeds, and recorded $9.1 million of gross security gains. Security losses in 2010 resulted from the sale of securities acquired in the Smithtown and LSB acquisitions as a result of changes in market interest rates occurring subsequent to the acquisition date (November 30, 2010). In 2009, Peoples United Financial sold residential mortgage backed securities with an amortized cost of $1.03 billion and recorded security gains totaling $16.9 million. Proceeds from sales transactions occurring during 2009 were subsequently reinvested in residential mortgage backed securities with substantially equivalent maturities and yields. This investment portfolio repositioning was undertaken to mitigate prepayment risk. Net security gains in 2009 also include a gain of $5.6 million (included in equity securities gains in the above table) resulting from the sale of Peoples United Financials remaining Class B Visa, Inc. shares as part of Visas IPO. Peoples United Financial obtained its ownership in Visa shares as a result of its acquisition of Chittenden, which was a Visa member. The decline in net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans in 2011 compared to 2010 reflects a lower level of residential mortgage loan sales in 2011 (a 30% decline in volume from 2010) due to the lower level of refinancing activity in 2011 as well as the Companys decision in May 2010 to portfolio residential mortgage loans. The decline in net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans in 2010 compared to 2009 reflects a lower level of residential mortgage loan sales (a 20% decline in volume from 2009) due to the lower level of refinancing activity in 2010 and the Companys change in strategy to hold certain newly originated residential mortgage loans. Net gains on sales of acquired loans in 2011 reflect sales of acquired loans with contractual balances of approximately $152 million (carrying amounts of approximately $106 million). BOLI income totaled $6.3 million ($9.4 million on a taxable equivalent basis) in 2011 compared to $6.7 million ($10.3 million on a taxable equivalent basis) in 2010 and $8.4 million ($12.9 million on a taxable equivalent basis) in 2009. The decrease in BOLI income in 2011 and 2010 primarily reflects a lower crediting rate in both years. The fluctuation in payment processing volume is the primary driver for the variances in merchant services income. The increases in commercial banking fees and operating lease income reflect higher levels of commercial fees and equipment leased to PCLC customers. 49 Table of Contents Non Interest Expense PercentageIncrease (Decrease) Years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 Compensation and benefits $ 429.0 $ 380.4 $ 350.5 12.8 % 8.5 % Occupancy and equipment 133.3 114.4 109.8 16.5 4.2 Professional and outside service fees 70.6 72.7 44.0 (2.9 ) 65.2 Other non interest expense: Regulatory 30.1 27.7 30.8 8.7 (10.1 ) Amortization of other acquisition related intangibles 25.8 21.7 20.6 18.9 5.3 Stationery, printing, postage and telephone 21.6 20.5 17.9 5.4 14.5 Amortization of leased equipment 20.8 16.1 12.3 29.2 30.9 Advertising and promotion 17.2 17.3 14.1 (0.6 ) 22.7 Executive level separation costs 3.8 15.3 n/m n/m Other 76.8 72.6 57.8 5.8 25.6 Total other non interest expense 196.1 191.2 153.5 2.6 24.6 Total 829.0 758.7 657.8 9.3 15.3 Merger related expenses 42.9 23.3 2.0 84.1 n/m Total non interest expense $ 871.9 $ 782.0 $ 659.8 11.5 % 18.5 % Efficiency ratio 64.4 % 72.4 % 72.7 % n/m not meaningful Excluding the effect of merger related expenses recorded in each year, total non interest expense increased $70.3 million in 2011 compared to 2010 and increased $100.9 million in 2010 compared to 2009. Merger related expenses consist of: (i) fees for investment advisory, legal, accounting and valuation services; (ii) debt prepayment costs; (iii) compensatory charges; and (iv) regulatory filings. Merger related expenses in 2011 include a $9.3 million charge related to the prepayment of $284 million of callable FHLB advances. Included in total non interest expense in 2010 and 2009 are $20.3 million and $2.5 million, respectively, of core system conversion costs. Also included in 2010 is $15.3 million related to costs incurred in connection with the former CEOs separation agreement. The lower efficiency ratio in 2011 compared to 2010 reflects a 23% increase in operating revenue partially offset by a 9% increase in operating expenses (see Non GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation to GAAP). The increase in compensation and benefits in 2011 compared to 2010 reflects additional compensation and benefit costs resulting from the acquisitions completed in 2011 and 2010, normal merit increases and higher benefit related costs. The increase in compensation and benefits in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily reflects normal merit increases, higher benefit related and stock based compensation costs, costs related to the core system conversion and additional compensation and benefit costs from acquisitions completed in 2010. In July 2011, Peoples United Bank amended its defined benefit pension plan (the Plan) to freeze, effective December 31, 2011, the accrual of pension benefits for Plan participants. As such, Plan participants will not earn any additional benefits after that date. Instead, effective January 1, 2012, Peoples United Bank will make a contribution on behalf of these participants to a qualified defined contribution plan in an annual amount equal to 3% of the employees eligible compensation. Also in July 2011, other cost saving initiatives were announced, including the elimination of selected positions primarily within corporate functions, non core lending businesses and the former Bank of Smithtown. The annual cost savings expected to be realized as a result of these initiatives is approximately $20 million beginning in 2012. 50 Table of Contents In March 2010, comprehensive health care reform legislation was signed into law under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the Acts). Included among the major provisions of the Acts is a change in tax treatment of the federal drug subsidy paid with respect to Medicare eligible retirees. The effect of the Acts on the Companys other postretirement benefits obligation, which totaled $12.1 million at December 31, 2011, and related net periodic benefit expense, which totaled $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, is not expected to be material. The increase in occupancy and equipment expense in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily reflects the incremental costs associated with the continued geographic expansion of Peoples United Financials franchise as well as the acquisitions completed in 2011 and 2010. Costs recorded in 2010 related to the core system conversion and computer system servicing costs, and expenses related to the trade name and rebranding initiative (see below) are the principal reason for the variances in professional and outside services, and advertising and promotion. The increase in amortization expense of leased equipment in 2011 and 2010 relates to the higher level of equipment leased to PCLC customers. In connection with Peoples United Financials acquisition of Chittenden in January 2008, a trade name intangible asset with a fair value of $122.7 million was established and assigned an indefinite useful life based on managements intentions at that time. In June 2010, Peoples United Financial announced a plan to re brand, as Peoples United Bank, the former Chittenden banks in connection with the scheduled completion of its core system conversion in July 2010. Management believes the name change better leverages the Peoples United brand and the full range of services available to its customers. As a result of the decision to re brand the Chittenden banks, the useful life of the trade name intangible asset was no longer deemed to be indefinite and management was required to perform a final impairment test prior to amortizing the asset over its estimated remaining useful life beginning July 1, 2010. Peoples United Financial performed its final trade name impairment test as of June 30, 2010 and determined that the fair value of the trade name intangible exceeded its carrying amount. As a result, no impairment loss was recognized. The trade name intangible is being amortized on an accelerated basis over a period of approximately 20 years, reflecting the manner in which the related benefit is realized. Scheduled amortization expense attributable to other acquisition related intangible assets for each of the next five years is as follows: $26.4 million in 2012; $25.7 million in 2013; $24.3 million in 2014; $23.3 million in 2015; and $13.0 million in 2016. The FDIC authorized higher premium assessments in 2009 pursuant to a restoration plan designed to increase the DIF reserve ratio to required levels. In May 2009, the FDIC adopted a final rule that imposed a special assessment of 5 basis points on each insured financial institutions total assets less Tier 1 capital as of June 30, 2009. As a result, included in regulatory expense in 2009 is an FDIC special assessment charge of $8.4 million. In November 2009, the FDIC adopted a final rule that amended the assessment regulations to require insured financial institutions to prepay, on December 30, 2009, their estimated deposit insurance premiums for 2010, 2011 and 2012. Under this rule, which did not include any additional special assessments, the prepayment was based on an assumed 5% annual growth rate in each institutions insured deposits (the assessment base) and an assumed increase of three basis points in each institutions premium assessment rate beginning in 2011. In February 2011, the FDIC approved a final rule (which was effective June 30, 2011) that: changes the assessment base from adjusted domestic deposits to a banks average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity (defined as Tier 1 capital); adopts a new large bank pricing assessment scheme; and sets a target size for the DIF at 2% of insured deposits. The rule also (i) implements a lower assessment rate schedule when the DIF reaches 1.15 percent and, in lieu of dividends, provides for a lower rate schedule when the reserve ratio reaches 2 percent and 2.5 percent and (ii) creates a scorecard based assessment system for financial institutions with more than $10 billion in assets, including Peoples United Bank. 51 Table of Contents The increase in other non interest expense in 2011 compared to 2010 reflects (i) a $4.8 million charge in 2011 associated with the planned consolidation of approximately 15 branches and other office space during 2012, which is expected to result in approximately $5 million of annualized operating expense savings and (ii) a higher level of expenses in 2011 related to foreclosed properties. Income Taxes Income tax expense totaled $96.8 million, $41.3 million and $43.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Income tax benefits of $2.0 million are included in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2009, which stems from a reduction in the combined state income tax rate following the charter consolidations of the former Chittenden banks. Peoples United Financials effective income tax rate was 32.7% and 32.5% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and would have been 31.3% for the year ended December 31, 2009 excluding the income tax benefits of $2.0 million described above. The effective income tax rate in 2011 reflects $0.6 million (net) of tax reserves that were released as a result of closed tax years. Peoples United Financials effective income tax rate is expected to increase slightly in 2012 primarily due to an increase in state income tax liabilities associated with the Companys further expansion into states with higher corporate income tax rates. The difference between Peoples United Financials effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% is primarily attributable to: (i) federal income tax credits associated with the Companys investment in affordable housing limited partnerships; (ii) tax exempt interest earned on certain investments; (iii) tax exempt income from bank owned life insurance; and (iv) state income taxes. Peoples United Financial maintains an ownership interest in several limited partnership investments to develop and operate affordable housing units for lower income tenants throughout its franchise area. These investments have historically played a significant role in enabling Peoples United Bank to meet its Community Reinvestment Act requirements while, at the same time, providing federal income tax credits. The cost of these investments is amortized on a straight line basis over the period during which the related federal income tax credits are realized (generally ten years). These credits totaled $6.6 million, $4.6 million and $4.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Income tax expense for all three years reflects the state tax benefit resulting from the formation of Peoples Mortgage Investment Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Peoples United Bank. The formation of this subsidiary was a result of Connecticut tax legislation, which became effective on January 1, 1999, that allows for the transfer of mortgage loans to a passive investment subsidiary. The related earnings of the subsidiary, and any dividends it pays to the parent, are not subject to Connecticut income tax. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning income tax expense. 52 Table of Contents Securities 2011 2010 2009 As of December 31 (in millions) AmortizedCost Fair Value AmortizedCost Fair Value AmortizedCost FairValue Securities held to maturity: Debt securities: Corporate $ 55.0 $ 61.1 $ 55.0 $ 55.0 $ 55.0 $ 55.0 Other 1.4 1.4 0.1 0.1 0.3 0.3 Total securities held to maturity $ 56.4 $ 62.5 $ 55.1 $ 55.1 $ 55.3 $ 55.3 Securities available for sale: Debt securities: U.S. Treasury and agency $ 80.5 $ 81.0 $ 476.2 $ 476.3 $ 10.7 $ 10.8 GSE residential mortgage backed securities and CMOs 2,388.9 2,447.8 2,289.0 2,290.6 729.9 728.1 State and municipal 127.8 137.7 57.6 58.2 0.3 0.3 Corporate 57.4 56.5 Other 2.6 2.3 4.5 4.5 Total debt securities 2,657.2 2,725.3 2,827.3 2,829.6 740.9 739.2 Equity securities 0.2 0.2 1.5 1.5 0.5 0.5 Total securities available for sale $ 2,657.4 $ 2,725.5 $ 2,828.8 $ 2,831.1 $ 741.4 $ 739.7 Peoples United Financial strives to maintain an appropriate balance between loan portfolio growth and deposit funding. Peoples United Financials management believes that, other than for transitional deployment of excess deposits or excess equity, a large securities portfolio funded with wholesale borrowings provides limited economic value. Peoples United Financial has historically utilized the securities portfolio for earnings generation (in the form of interest and dividend income), liquidity, interest rate risk management, asset diversification and tax planning. Securities available for sale are used as part of Peoples United Financials asset/liability management strategy and may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, factors such as changes in market conditions and interest rates, changes in security prepayment rates, liquidity considerations and regulatory capital requirements. Peoples United Financial invests in debt securities rated in the highest categories assigned by a nationally recognized statistical ratings organization. Management has internal guidelines for the credit quality and duration of Peoples United Financials debt securities portfolio and monitors these on a regular basis. At December 31, 2011, Peoples United Financials securities available for sale portfolio totaled $2.7 billion, or 10% of total assets, compared to $2.8 billion, or 11% of total assets, at December 31, 2010 and $0.7 billion, or 3% of total assets, at December 31, 2009. In 2011, the Company sold 15 year mortgage backed securities with an amortized cost of $507 million to reduce book value at risk due to an expected increase in prepayments and recorded gross realized gains totaling $9.1 million. Subsequently, the Company purchased short duration agency issued CMOs backed by collateral that is expected to exhibit lower prepayment risk. The increase in debt securities available for sale in 2010 compared to 2009 reflects managements decision to invest in U.S. Treasury and agency securities and government sponsored enterprise (GSE) residential mortgage backed securities and CMOs in the second half of 2010 to provide the optimal balance of credit risk, yield and duration. 53 Table of Contents In 2009, Peoples United Financial sold residential mortgage backed securities with an amortized cost of $1.03 billion and recorded security gains totaling $16.9 million. Proceeds from sales occurring during 2009 were subsequently reinvested in residential mortgage backed securities with substantially equivalent maturities and yields. This investment portfolio repositioning was undertaken to mitigate prepayment risk. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the fair value exceeded the amortized cost of the securities available for sale portfolio by $68.1 million and $2.3 million, respectively, while at December 31, 2009, the amortized cost exceeded the fair value of the securities available for sale portfolio by $1.7 million. All unrealized gains and those unrealized losses representing temporary declines in value due to factors other than credit are recorded in stockholders equity, net of income taxes. As a result, management anticipates continued fluctuations in stockholders equity due to changes in the fair value of these securities, albeit on a relatively small scale due to the duration of the portfolio. The duration of the debt securities portfolio was approximately 2.8 years, 3.4 years and 4.0 years at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Lending Activities Peoples United Financial conducts its lending activities principally through its Commercial Banking and Retail and Business Banking business segments. Peoples United Financials lending activities consist of originating loans secured by commercial and residential properties, and extending secured and unsecured loans to commercial and consumer customers. Total loans increased $3.07 billion in 2011 compared to 2010 and increased $3.23 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. Peoples United Financial acquired loans with a fair value of $1.87 billion in 2011 and $3.49 billion in 2010. Loans acquired in connection with business combinations beginning in 2010 are referred to as acquired loans as a result of the manner in which they are accounted for (see further discussion under Acquired Loans in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). All other loans are referred to as originated loans. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the carrying amount of the acquired loan portfolio totaled $3.60 billion and $2.88 billion, respectively. 54 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the loan portfolio before deducting the allowance for loan losses: As of December 31 (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 Commercial Banking: Commercial real estate (1) $ 7,172.2 $ 7,306.3 $ 5,399.4 $ 4,967.3 $ 1,885.6 Commercial and industrial (1) 5,352.6 3,095.6 2,805.7 2,999.5 1,618.9 Equipment financing 2,029.4 2,100.4 1,236.8 1,226.9 981.5 Total Commercial Banking 14,554.2 12,502.3 9,441.9 9,193.7 4,486.0 Retail: Residential mortgage: Adjustable rate 2,947.7 2,117.9 2,230.2 2,850.3 3,106.7 Fixed rate 680.7 529.6 182.4 275.6 50.0 Total residential mortgage 3,628.4 2,647.5 2,412.6 3,125.9 3,156.7 Consumer: Home equity 2,057.7 1,976.8 1,986.3 1,945.5 1,224.4 Other consumer 159.7 201.1 258.7 281.9 26.4 Total consumer 2,217.4 2,177.9 2,245.0 2,227.4 1,250.8 Total Retail 5,845.8 4,825.4 4,657.6 5,353.3 4,407.5 Total loans $ 20,400.0 $ 17,327.7 $ 14,099.5 $ 14,547.0 $ 8,893.5 (1) Following the Companys 2010 acquisitions and core system conversion, the Company undertook a portfolio review to ensure consistent classification of commercial loans in an effort to align policy across the Companys expanded franchise and better conform to industry practice for such loans. As a result, approximately $875 million of loans secured, in part, by owner occupied commercial properties were reclassified from commercial real estate loans to commercial and industrial loans as of March 31, 2011. The primary collateral for these loans generally consists of the borrowers general business assets (i.e. non real estate collateral) and the loans were underwritten principally on the basis of the adequacy of business cash flows. This reclassification is being applied prospectively as it was deemed impracticable to do so for prior periods due to the fact that the underlying loan information is no longer available as it previously resided on legacy loan systems that are no longer utilized or supported following the Companys core system conversion. Peoples United Financials loan portfolio is primarily concentrated within New England with approximately 71% and 68% of the total loan portfolio representing loans to customers within the New England states at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and approximately 12% and 15% represents loans to customers in New York state at those dates. 55 Table of Contents Total Loans As of December 31 (dollars in millions) The following table presents the contractual maturity of total loans as of December 31, 2011: As of December 31, 2011 (in millions) CommercialBanking Retail Total Amounts due: One year or less $ 2,411.0 $ 39.8 $ 2,450.8 After one year: One to five years 5,444.6 280.0 5,724.6 Over five years 6,698.6 5,526.0 12,224.6 Total due after one year 12,143.2 5,806.0 17,949.2 Total $ 14,554.2 $ 5,845.8 $ 20,400.0 The following table presents, as of December 31, 2011, loan amounts due after December 31, 2012, and whether these loans have adjustable or fixed interest rates: Interest Rate Total (in millions) Adjustable Fixed Commercial Banking $ 5,817.3 $ 6,325.9 $ 12,143.2 Retail 4,676.0 1,130.0 5,806.0 Total loans due after one year $ 10,493.3 $ 7,455.9 $ 17,949.2 56 Table of Contents Commercial Banking The Commercial Banking lending businesses include commercial real estate, commercial and industrial lending, and equipment financing.

Peoples United Financials highest loan concentration in the commercial real estate loan portfolio is in the office building sector, which represented 30% and 25% of this loan portfolio at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Commercial Real Estate Portfolio As of December 31 (dollars in millions) The commercial real estate portfolio decreased $134 million in 2011 compared to 2010, reflecting the reclassification of approximately $875 million of loans secured, in part, by owner occupied commercial properties from commercial real estate loans to commercial and industrial loans in 2011 and a decrease in acquired commercial real estate loans, partially offset by the addition of loans acquired in connection with the Danvers acquisition completed in 2011, as well as organic growth of $756 million, or 10% of the commercial real estate portfolio. The commercial real estate portfolio increased $1.9 billion in 2010 compared to 2009, reflecting the addition of loans acquired in connection with the acquisition completed in 2010, as well as organic growth of $206 million, or 4% of the commercial real estate portfolio. Included in the commercial real estate portfolio are construction loans totaling $653 million and $1.04 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, net of the unadvanced portion of such loan totaling $281 million and $176 million, respectively. In 2011, the Company sold acquired loans with an outstanding balance of $152 million (carrying amount of $105 million) and recognized a net gain on sale of $7.5 million. 57 Table of Contents At December 31, 2011 and 2010, approximately 26% and 22%, respectively, of Peoples United Financials commercial real estate portfolio was secured by properties located in Connecticut, and approximately 23% and 28%, respectively, was secured by properties located in New York. In addition, approximately 33% of the commercial real estate portfolio was secured by properties located in Massachusetts, Vermont and New Hampshire at December 31, 2011 compared to approximately 35% at December 31, 2010. No other state exposure was greater than 5% at December 31, 2011. Commercial real estate is dependent on the successful operation of the related income producing real estate. Accordingly, the income streams generated by this portfolio can be impacted by changes in the real estate market and, to a large extent, the New England and Metro New York economies. Peoples United Financial continues to focus on maintaining strong asset quality standards in a competitive market generally characterized by aggressive pricing and less attractive underwriting terms. The growth and performance of this portfolio is largely dependent on the economic environment and may be adversely impacted if the economy weakens in 2012.

Commercial products are generally packaged together to create a financing solution specifically tailored to the needs of the customer. Taking a total relationship focused approach with commercial customers to meet their financing needs has resulted in substantial growth in non interest bearing deposits over time, as well as in opportunities to provide other banking services to principals and employees of these commercial customers. The borrowers ability to repay a commercial loan is closely tied to the ongoing profitability and cash flow of the borrowers business. Consequently, a commercial loan tends to be more directly impacted by changes in economic cycles that affect businesses generally and the borrowers business specifically. The availability of adequate collateral is a factor in commercial loan decisions; and loans are generally collateralized and or guaranteed by third parties. In 2011, the commercial and industrial portfolio increased $2.3 billion compared to 2010, reflecting the reclassification of approximately $875 million of loans secured, in part, by owner occupied commercial properties from commercial real estate loans to commercial and industrial loans in 2011, the addition of loans acquired in connection with the Danvers acquisition, as well as organic growth of $461 million, or 15% of the commercial and industrial portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in acquired commercial and industrial loans. In 2010, the commercial and industrial portfolio increased $290 million compared to 2009, reflecting the addition of loans acquired in connection with the acquisitions completed in 2010, as well as organic growth of $210 million, or 8% of the commercial and industrial portfolio. At December 31, 2011, the commercial and industrial portfolio included $274 million of asset based lending loans, essentially all of which are to customers within the Companys geographic footprint. Approximately 86% of these loans were acquired in connection with the Danvers acquisition. The commercial and industrial portfolio also includes $344 million of mortgage warehouse loans at December 31, 2011, compared to $55 million at December 31, 2010. Such loans represent lines of credit extended to a loan originator to fund a mortgage that a borrower initially used to purchase a property. The extension of credit generally lasts from the loans point of origination to the point when the loan is sold into the secondary market. Approximately 30% of the mortgage warehouse loans are to customers within the Companys footprint. At December 31, 2011, approximately 25% of the commercial and industrial loan portfolio consisted of loans to Connecticut based businesses, compared to approximately 44% at December 31, 2010. Commercial and industrial loan exposure in the states of Vermont, Massachusetts and New Hampshire totaled approximately 50% and 37% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. No other state exposure was greater than 8%. While Peoples United Financial continues to focus on asset quality, the performance of the commercial lending and industrial portfolio may be adversely impacted if the economy weakens in 2012. 59 Table of Contents Commercial and Industrial Diversification As of December 31, 2011 (percent) Commercial and Industrial Portfolio As of December 31 (dollars in millions) Equipment Financing As of December 31 (in millions) 2011 2010 Industry: Transportation/utility $ 614.7 $ 630.2 Construction 412.2 427.8 Printing 331.7 381.0 Waste 136.6 135.0 General manufacturing 134.0 176.4 Retail sales 114.3 103.6 Packaging 92.1 89.9 Wholesale distribution 49.3 35.1 Service 47.9 43.9 Health services 41.6 21.8 Food services 32.3 30.6 Other 22.7 25.1 Total equipment financing $ 2,029.4 $ 2,100.4 60 Table of Contents PCLC and PUEFC provide equipment financing for customers in all 50 states, specializing in financing for the transportation/utility, construction, printing and general manufacturing industries. PCLC will buy or sell portions of financing transactions in the secondary market to manage the concentration risk of its overall portfolio. In addition, PCLC provides customers with the option to lease equipment. Substantially the entire equipment financing portfolio (approximately 97% and 96% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively) involves customers outside of New England. At December 31, 2011, approximately 33% of the equipment financing portfolio consisted of loans to customers located in Texas, California and New York and no other state exposure was greater than 6%. The equipment financing portfolio decreased $71 million in 2011 compared to 2010, reflecting organic loan growth of $300 million, offset by a $371 million, or 54%, decrease in the PUEFC acquired loan portfolio since December 31, 2010. Operating on a national scale, equipment financing represented 14% of the Commercial Banking loan portfolio at December 31, 2011 compared to 17% at December 31, 2010.

These include conventional fixed rate loans, jumbo fixed rate loans (loans with principal balances greater than established Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae limits), adjustable rate loans, sometimes referred to as ARM loans, interest only loans (loans where payments made by the borrower consist of only interest for a set period of time, before the payments change to principal and interest), as well as Federal Housing Administration insured loans and various state housing finance authority loans. Peoples United Financial originates these loans through its network of branches and calling officers, as well as in the wholesale market. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, approximately 92% and 87%, respectively, of the residential mortgage loan portfolio was secured by properties located in New England. At December 31, 2011, the residential mortgage loan portfolio included $547 million of interest only loans of which $24 million are stated income loans, compared to $447 million and $59 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010. See Asset Quality for further discussion of interest only and stated income loans. Also included in residential mortgage loans are construction loans totaling $55 million and $94 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Peoples United Financials residential mortgage originations totaled $1.2 billion in both 2011 and 2010 and $1.3 billion in 2009. The mix and volume of residential mortgage loan originations vary in response to changes in market interest rates and customer preferences. Adjustable rate residential mortgage loans accounted for 61% of total residential mortgage originations in 2011, compared to 20% in 2010 and 13% in 2009. In 2011, adjustable rate residential mortgage loans increased $830 million compared to 2010, reflecting the addition of loans acquired in connection with the Danvers acquisition, as well as organic growth of $777 million, or 37% of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans. In 2010, adjustable rate residential mortgage loans decreased $112 million compared to 2009, reflecting Peoples United Financials past practice, through May 2010, of selling essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. Fixed rate residential mortgage loans increased $151 million in 2011 compared to 2010 and increased $347 million in 2010 compared to 2009. These increases reflect the addition of the acquisitions completed in 2011 and 2010, as well as organic growth of $82 million, or 15% of fixed rate residential mortgage loans in 2011, and $184 million, or 101% of fixed rate residential mortgage loans in 2010. 62 Table of Contents Historically, Peoples United Financial held virtually all of the adjustable rate residential mortgage loans that it originated on its balance sheet and has sold virtually all of the fixed rate residential mortgage loans that it originated into the secondary market. In 2006, Peoples United Financial completed a reassessment of its pricing with respect to adjustable rate residential mortgage loans in light of the prevailing interest rate environment at that time. As a result, Peoples United Financial made the decision in the fourth quarter of 2006 to sell essentially all of its newly originated residential mortgage loans. Peoples United Financial continued to actively offer residential mortgage loans of all types through its extensive distribution system and, in May 2010, Peoples United Financial made the decision to retain in its portfolio most of its originated adjustable rate and fixed rate residential mortgage loans. The Company currently retains in its portfolio most of its originated adjustable rate and 10 year fixed rate residential mortgage loans. Peoples United Financials loan loss experience within the residential mortgage portfolio continues to be primarily attributable to a small number of loans. The continued performance of the residential mortgage loan portfolio in 2012 may be adversely impacted by the level and direction of interest rates, consumer preferences and the regional economy.

At both December 31, 2011 and 2010, approximately 96% of the consumer loan portfolio was to customers located in New England. Asset Quality Recent Trends The past several years have been marked by significant volatility in the financial and capital markets initially brought about by the fallout associated with the subprime mortgage market. This disruption led to significant credit and liquidity concerns, which resulted in government intervention within the banking sector and a substantial decline in activity within the secondary mortgage market. All of these issues have been further exacerbated by an accelerated softening of the real estate market, a worsening recessionary economic environment and, in turn, weakness within the commercial sector. While Peoples United Financial continues to adhere to prudent underwriting standards, the loan portfolio is geographically diverse and, therefore, is not immune to potential negative consequences arising as a result of general economic weakness and, in particular, a prolonged downturn in the housing market on a national scale. Decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for loans. In addition, adverse changes in the economy could have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make scheduled loan payments, which would likely have an adverse impact on earnings. Further, an increase in loan delinquencies may serve to decrease net interest income and adversely impact loan loss experience, resulting in an increased provision and allowance for loan losses. Peoples United Financial actively manages asset quality through its underwriting practices and collection operations. Underwriting practices tend to focus on optimizing the return of a given risk classification while collection operations focus on minimizing losses once an account becomes delinquent. Peoples United Financial attempts to minimize losses associated with commercial banking loans by requiring borrowers to pledge adequate collateral and or provide for third party guarantees. Loss mitigation within the residential mortgage loan portfolio is highly dependent on the value of the underlying real estate. 64 Table of Contents During the recent credit cycle, Peoples United Financial has experienced an increase in the number of loan modification requests. Certain originated loans whose terms have been modified are considered TDRs. Acquired loans that are modified are not considered for TDR classification because they are evaluated for impairment on a pool basis. Originated loans are considered TDRs if the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and is afforded a concession by Peoples United Financial, such as, but not limited to: (i) payment deferral; (ii) a reduction of the stated interest rate for the remaining contractual life of the loan; (iii) an extension of the loans original contractual term at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for a new loan with similar risk; (iv) capitalization of interest; or (v) forgiveness of principal or interest. Generally, TDRs are placed on non accrual status (and reported as non performing loans) until the loan qualifies for return to accrual status. Loans qualify for return to accrual status once they have demonstrated performance with the restructured terms of the loan agreement for a minimum of six months. Loans may continue to be reported as TDRs after they are returned to accrual status. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we performed 24 loan modifications that were not classified as TDRs. In each case, we concluded that the modification did not result in the granting of a concession based on one or more of the following considerations: (i) the receipt of additional collateral (the nature and amount of which was deemed to serve as adequate compensation for other terms of the restructuring) and or guarantees; (ii) the borrower having access to funds at a market rate for debt with similar risk characteristics as the restructured debt; and (iii) the restructuring resulting in a delay in payment that is insignificant in relation to the other terms of the obligation. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures relating to TDRs. Portfolio Risk Elements Residential Mortgage Lending Peoples United Financial does not engage in subprime mortgage lending, which has been the riskiest sector of the residential housing market. Peoples United Financial has virtually no exposure to subprime loans, or to similarly high risk Alt A loans and structured investment vehicles. At December 31, 2011, the loan portfolio included $547 million of interest only residential mortgage loans, of which $24 million are stated income loans. Peoples United Financial began originating interest only residential mortgage loans in March 2003. The underwriting guidelines and requirements for such loans are generally more restrictive than those applied to other types of residential mortgage loans. In general, Peoples United Financials underwriting guidelines for residential mortgage loans require the following: (i) properties must be single family and owner occupied primary residences; (ii) lower loan to value ratios (less than 60% on average); (iii) higher credit scores (greater than 700 on average); and (iv) sufficient post closing reserves. Peoples United Financial has not originated interest only residential mortgage loans that permit negative amortization or optional payment amounts. Amortization of an interest only residential mortgage loan begins after the initial interest rate changes (e.g. after 5 years for a 5/1 adjustable rate mortgage). Stated income loans, which Peoples United Financial has not offered since mid 2007, represent a form of reduced documentation loan that requires a potential borrower to complete a standard mortgage application with full verification of the borrowers asset information as contained in the loan application, but no verification of the provided income information. As with interest only loans, underwriting guidelines for stated income loans require properties to be single family and owner occupied primary residences with lower loan to value ratios and higher credit scores. In addition, stated income loans require the receipt of an appraisal for the real estate used as collateral and a credit report on the prospective borrower. Updated property values are obtained from an independent third party for residential mortgage loans 90 days past due. At December 31, 2011, non performing residential mortgage loans totaling $7.1 million had current loan to value ratios of more than 100%. 65 Table of Contents Several of the nations largest residential mortgage loan servicers have come under the scrutiny of state attorneys general and various regulatory authorities, in light of allegations of robo signing (signing foreclosure affidavits without an appropriate review) and other issues related to their foreclosure practices. In light of these developments, the Company has reviewed its foreclosure policies and procedures and found no systemic concerns or instances of robo signing with respect to its loan servicing activities. We believe that our established procedures for reviewing foreclosure affidavits and validating information contained in related loan documentation are sound and consistently applied, and that our foreclosure affidavits are accurate. As a result, Peoples United Bank has not found it necessary to interrupt or suspend foreclosure proceedings. We have also considered the effect of representations and warranties that we made to third party investors in connection with whole loan sales, and believe our representations and warranties were true and correct and do not expose Peoples United Bank to any material loss. During 2011, we repurchased from GSEs and other third party investors a total of 20 residential mortgage loans that we had previously sold to such parties. The total balance of the loans at the time of repurchase was $3.5 million and we incurred $0.3 million in related fees and expenses. During that same time period, we issued investor refunds and or make whole payments, including payments under contractual obligations as a result of early payoffs, totaling $0.7 million related to 21 loans. Based on the limited number of repurchase requests we have historically received, the immaterial cost associated with such repurchase requests, and managements view that this past experience is consistent with our current and near term estimate of such exposure, the Company has not established a related liability. The aforementioned foreclosure issues and the potential for additional legal and regulatory action could impact future foreclosure activities, including lengthening the time required for residential mortgage lenders, including Peoples United Bank, to initiate and complete the foreclosure process. In recent years, foreclosure timelines have increased as a result of, among other reasons: (i) delays associated with the significant increase in the number of foreclosure cases as a result of the economic crisis; (ii) additional consumer protection initiatives related to the foreclosure process; and (iii) voluntary and or mandatory programs intended to permit or require lenders to consider loan modifications or other alternatives to foreclosure. Further increases in the foreclosure timeline may have an adverse effect on collateral values and our ability to minimize losses. Portfolio Risk Elements Home Equity Lending The majority of our home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have an initial draw period of 9 1/2 years followed by a 20 year repayment phase. During the initial draw period, interest only payments are required, after which the disbursed balance is fully amortized over a 20 year repayment term. HELOCs carry variable rates indexed to the Prime Rate with a lifetime interest rate ceiling and floor, and are secured by first or second liens on the borrowers primary residence. The rate used to qualify borrowers is the Prime Rate plus 5.00%, even though the initial rate may be substantially lower. The maximum loan to value ratio is 80% on a single family property, 70% on a two family property and 65% on a condominium. Lower loan to value ratios are required on larger line amounts. The minimum FICO credit score is 680. The borrower has the ability to convert the entire balance or a portion of the balance to a fixed rate term loan during the draw period. There is a limit of three term loans that must be fully amortized over a term not to exceed the original HELOC maturity date. A smaller portion of our HELOC portfolio has an initial draw period of 10 years with a variable rate interest only payment, after which there is a 5 year amortization period. An additional small portion of our HELOC portfolio has a 5 year draw period which, at our discretion, may be renewed for an additional 5 year interest only draw period. 66 Table of Contents The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2011, the amount of HELOCs scheduled to have the draw period end during the years shown: December 31, (in millions) Credit Lines 2012 $ 123.8 2013 275.2 2014 356.7 2015 387.8 2016 391.4 Later years 2,127.8 Total $ 3,662.7 Essentially all of our HELOCs (98%) are presently in their draw period. Our default and delinquency statistics indicate a higher level of occurrence for converted amortizing payment loans when compared to HELOCs that are still in the draw period. Delinquency statistics for the HELOC portfolio at December 31, 2011 are as follows: PortfolioBalance Delinquencies (dollars in millions) Amount Percent HELOC status: Still in draw period $ 1,826.5 $ 28.4 1.55 % Amortizing payment 35.8 2.0 5.59 For the three months ended December 31, 2011, approximately 35% of our borrowers with balances outstanding under HELOCs paid only the minimum amount due. The majority of our home equity loan (HEL) portfolio fully amortizes over terms ranging from 5 to 20 years. HELs are limited to first or second liens on a borrowers primary residence. The maximum loan to value ratio is 80% on a single family property, 70% on a two family property and 65% on a condominium. Lower loan to value ratios are required on larger line amounts. We are not able, at this time, to develop statistics for the entire HEL portfolio with respect to first liens serviced by third parties that have priority over our junior liens, as lien position data has not historically been captured on our loan servicing systems. As of December 31, 2011, full and complete first lien position data was not readily available for approximately 88% of the HEL portfolio. Effective January 2011, we began tracking lien position data for all new originations and our Collections Department continues to add lien position data once a loan reaches 75 days past due in connection with our updated assessment of combined loan to value (CLTV) exposure, which takes place for loans 90 days past due. In addition, when we are notified that the holder of a superior lien has commenced a foreclosure action, our home equity account is identified in the collections system for ongoing monitoring of the legal action. As of December 31, 2011, the portion of the HEL portfolio greater than 90 days past due with a CLTV greater than 80% was $8.2 million. When the first lien is held by a third party, we can, in some cases, obtain an indication that a first lien is in default through information reported to credit bureaus. However, because more than one mortgage may be reported in a borrowers credit report and there may not be a corresponding property address associated with reported mortgages, we are often unable to associate a specific first lien with our junior lien. As of December 31, 2011, there were 64 loans totaling $4.0 million for which we have received notification that the holder of a superior lien has commenced foreclosure action. For 21 of the loans (totaling $0.9 million), our second lien position was performing at the time such foreclosure action was commenced. The total estimated loss related to those 21 loans was $0.4 million as of December 31, 2011. It is important to note that the percentage of new home equity originations for which we hold the first lien has increased steadily from approximately 40% in 2009 to approximately 60% in 2011. 67 Table of Contents We believe there are several factors that serve to mitigate the potential risk associated with the limitations on available first lien data. Most importantly, our underwriting guidelines for home equity loans, which have been, and continue to be, consistently applied, generally require the following: (i) properties located within our geographic footprint; (ii) lower loan to value ratios; and (iii) higher credit scores. Notwithstanding the maximum loan to value ratios and minimum FICO scores discussed previously, actual loan to value ratios at origination were less than 60% on average and current FICO scores of our borrowers are greater than 750 on average. In addition, as of December 31, 2011, approximately 72% of the portfolio balance relates to originations that occurred since 2005, which is generally recognized as the peak of the recent housing bubble. We believe these factors are a primary reason for the portfolios relatively low level of non performing loans and net loan charge offs, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of average loans. Each month, all home equity and second mortgage loans greater than 180 days past due (regardless of our lien position) are analyzed in order to determine the amount by which the balance outstanding (including any amount subject to a first lien) exceeds the underlying collateral value. To the extent a shortfall exists, a charge off is recognized. This charge off activity is reflected in our established allowance for loan losses for home equity and second mortgage loans as part of the component attributable to historical portfolio loss experience, which considers losses incurred over the most recent 12 month period. While the limitations on available first lien data could impact the accuracy of our loan loss estimates, we believe that our methodology results in an allowance for loan losses that appropriately estimates the inherent probable losses within the portfolio, including those loans originated prior to January 2011 for which certain lien position data is not available. Portfolio Risk Elements Commercial Real Estate Lending In general, construction loans originated by Peoples United Financial are used to finance improvements to commercial, industrial or residential property. Repayment is typically derived from the sale of the property as a whole, the sale of smaller individual units, or by a take out from a permanent mortgage. The term of the construction period generally does not exceed two years. Loan commitments are based on established construction budgets which represent an estimate of total costs to complete the proposed project, including both hard (direct) costs (building materials, labor, etc.) and soft (indirect) costs (legal and architectural fees, etc.). In addition, project costs may include an appropriate level of interest reserve to carry the project through to completion. If established, such interest reserves are determined based on: (i) a percentage of the committed loan amount; (ii) the loan term; and (iii) the applicable interest rate. Regardless of whether a loan contains an interest reserve, the total project cost statement serves as the basis for underwriting and determining which items will be funded by the loan and which items will be funded through borrower equity. Construction loans are funded, at the request of the borrower, not more than once per month, based on the extent of work completed, and are monitored, throughout the life of the project, by an independent professional construction engineer and the Companys commercial real estate lending department. Interest is advanced to the borrower, upon request, based upon the progress of the project toward completion. The amount of interest advanced is added to the total outstanding principal under the loan commitment. Should the project not progress as scheduled, the adequacy of the interest reserve necessary to carry the project through to completion is subject to close monitoring by management. Should the interest reserve be deemed to be inadequate, the borrower is required to fund the deficiency. Similarly, once a loan is fully funded, the borrower is required to fund all interest payments. Peoples United Financials construction loan portfolio totaled $653 million (approximately 3% of total loans) at December 31, 2011. The total committed amount at that date, including both the outstanding balance and the unadvanced portion of such loans, totaled $933 million. In some cases, a portion of the total committed amount includes an accompanying interest reserve. At December 31, 2011, construction loans totaling $223 million had remaining available interest reserves totaling $20 million. At that date, the Company had construction loans with interest reserves totaling $1 million that were on non accrual status and included in non performing loans. 68 Table of Contents The recent economic downturn has resulted in an increase in the number of extension requests for commercial real estate and construction loans, some of which have related repayment guarantees. Modifications of originated commercial real estate loans involving maturity extensions are evaluated according to the Companys normal underwriting standards and are classified as TDRs if the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and is afforded a concession by Peoples United Financial similar to those discussed previously. Peoples United Financial had approximately $18 million of restructured construction loans as of December 31, 2011. An extension may be granted to allow for the completion of the project, marketing or sales of completed units, or to provide for permanent financing, and is based on a re underwriting of the loan and managements assessment of the borrowers ability to perform according to the agreed upon terms. Typically, at the time of an extension, borrowers are performing in accordance with contractual loan terms. Extension terms generally do not exceed 12 to 18 months and typically require that the borrower provide additional economic support in the form of partial repayment, additional collateral or guarantees. In cases where the fair value of the collateral or the financial resources of the borrower are deemed insufficient to repay the loan, reliance may be placed on the support of a guarantee, if applicable. However, such guarantees are never considered the sole source of repayment. Peoples United Financial evaluates the financial condition of guarantors based on the most current financial information available. Most often, such information takes the form of (i) personal financial statements of net worth, cash flow statements and tax returns (for individual guarantors) and (ii) financial and operating statements, tax returns and financial projections (for legal entity guarantors). The Companys evaluation is primarily focused on various key financial metrics, including net worth, leverage ratios and liquidity. It is the Companys policy to update such information annually, or more frequently as warranted, over the life of the loan. While Peoples United Financial does not specifically track the frequency with which it has pursued guarantor performance under a guarantee, the Companys underwriting process, both at origination and upon extension, as applicable, includes an assessment of the guarantors reputation, creditworthiness and willingness to perform. Historically, when the Company has found it necessary to seek performance under a guarantee, it has been able to effectively mitigate its losses. In considering the impairment status of such loans, an evaluation is made of the collateral and future cash flow of the borrower as well as the anticipated support of any repayment guarantor. In the event that the guarantor is unwilling or unable to perform, a legal remedy is pursued. When performance under the loan terms is deemed to be uncertain, including performance of the guarantor, all or a portion of the loan may be charged off, typically based on the fair value of the collateral securing the loan. Allowance and Provision for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses charged to income. Losses on loans, including impaired loans, are charged to the allowance for loan losses when all or a portion of a loan is deemed to be uncollectible. Recoveries of loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance for loan losses when realized. Peoples United Financial maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that is deemed to be appropriate to absorb probable losses inherent in the respective loan portfolios, based on a quarterly evaluation of a variety of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to: (i) Peoples United Financials historical loan loss experience and recent trends in that experience; (ii) risk ratings assigned by lending personnel to commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, and equipment financing loans, and the results of ongoing reviews of those ratings by Peoples United Financials independent loan review function; (iii) an evaluation of delinquent and non performing loans and related collateral values; (iv) the probability of loss in view of geographic and industry concentrations and other portfolio risk characteristics; (v) the present financial condition of borrowers; and (vi) current economic conditions. 69 Table of Contents For a more detailed discussion of the Companys allowance for loan losses methodology and related policies, see Critical Accounting Policies. Acquired loans that have evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination and for which it is probable, at acquisition, that all contractually required payments will not be collected are initially recorded at fair value without recording an allowance for loan losses. Fair value of the loans is determined using market participant assumptions in estimating the amount and timing of both principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected, as adjusted for an estimate of future credit losses and prepayments, and then applying a market based discount rate to those cash flows. Acquired loans are generally accounted for on a pool basis, with pools formed based on the loans common risk characteristics, such as loan collateral type and accrual status. Each pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. Under the accounting model for acquired loans, the excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the carrying amount of the loans, referred to as the accretable yield, is accreted into interest income over the life of the loans in each pool using the effective yield method. Accordingly, acquired loans are not subject to classification as non accrual in the same manner as originated loans. Rather, acquired loans are considered to be accruing loans because their interest income relates to the accretable yield recognized at the pool level and not to contractual interest payments at the loan level. The difference between contractually required principal and interest payments and the cash flows expected to be collected, referred to as the nonaccretable difference, includes estimates of both the impact of prepayments and future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loans in each pool. As such, charge offs on acquired loans are first applied to the nonaccretable difference and then to any allowance for loan losses recognized subsequent to acquisition. A decrease in expected cash flows in subsequent periods may indicate that the loan pool is impaired which would require the establishment of an allowance for loan losses by a charge to the provision for loan losses. At December 31, 2011, the allowance for loan losses on acquired loans was $7.4 million (none at December 31, 2010). Selected asset quality metrics presented below distinguish between the originated portfolio and the acquired portfolio. All loans acquired in connection with acquisitions beginning in 2010 comprise the acquired loan portfolio; all other loans of the Company comprise the originated portfolio, including originations subsequent to the respective acquisition dates. 70 Table of Contents Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses The following table presents the activity in the allowance for loan losses and ratios: Years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 Allowance for loan losses on originated loans: Balance at beginning of period $ 172.5 $ 172.5 $ 157.5 $ 72.7 $ 74.0 Charge offs: Commercial Banking: Commercial real estate (21.7 ) (27.5 ) (10.9 ) (3.4 ) Commercial and industrial (12.6 ) (14.3 ) (9.8 ) (5.6 ) (7.0 ) Equipment financing (9.0 ) (9.5 ) (8.8 ) (1.5 ) (1.8 ) Total (43.3 ) (51.3 ) (29.5 ) (10.5 ) (8.8 ) Retail: Residential mortgage (7.4 ) (4.3 ) (5.4 ) (1.5 ) Home equity (3.8 ) (3.8 ) (3.5 ) (1.0 ) (0.4 ) Other consumer (3.6 ) (5.3 ) (7.1 ) (6.2 ) (2.3 ) Total (14.8 ) (13.4 ) (16.0 ) (8.7 ) (2.7 ) Total charge offs (58.1 ) (64.7 ) (45.5 ) (19.2 ) (11.5 ) Recoveries: Commercial Banking: Commercial real estate 0.5 0.8 0.3 0.2 0.1 Commercial and industrial 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.3 0.3 Equipment financing 0.2 0.3 0.2 0.3 0.1 Total 1.7 2.1 1.5 1.8 0.5 Retail: Residential mortgage 1.0 0.6 0.2 0.4 0.6 Home equity 0.4 0.4 0.2 0.1 0.1 Other consumer 1.7 1.6 1.6 2.0 1.0 Total 3.1 2.6 2.0 2.5 1.7 Total recoveries 4.8 4.7 3.5 4.3 2.2 Net loan charge offs (53.3 ) (60.0 ) (42.0 ) (14.9 ) (9.3 ) Provision for loan losses 56.3 60.0 57.0 26.2 8.0 Allowance recorded in the Chittenden acquisition 73.5 Balance at end of period $ 175.5 $ 172.5 $ 172.5 $ 157.5 $ 72.7 Allowance for loan losses on acquired loans: Balance at beginning of period $ $ $ $ $ Provision for loan losses 7.4 Balance at end of period $ 7.4 $ $ $ $ Allowance for loan losses on originated loans as a percentage of: Originated loans 1.04 % 1.19 % 1.22 % 1.08 % 0.82 % Originated non performing loans 59.7 70.3 102.2 186.8 357.8 Commercial banking allowance for loan losses asa percentage of originated commercial banking loans 1.39 1.61 1.72 1.61 1.58 Retail allowance for loan losses as a percentage oforiginated retail loans 0.29 0.25 0.14 0.11 0.04 71 Table of Contents The provision for loan losses on originated loans in 2011 totaled $56.3 million, reflecting $53.3 million in net loan charge offs (including $19.6 million against previously established specific reserves) and an increase in the originated allowance for loan losses in response to loan growth in the commercial and residential mortgage loan portfolios. The provision for loan losses on acquired loans in 2011 reflects loan impairment attributable to certain acquired loans. The provision for loan losses in 2010 totaled $60.0 million, reflecting $60.0 million in net loan charge offs. Commercial real estate loan charge offs in 2010 include (i) two construction loans totaling $9.8 million, both of which carried specific reserves totaling $9.0 million, and (ii) partial charge offs totaling $4.8 million related to two shared national credits. Commercial and industrial charge offs in 2010 include a $6.0 million partial charge off of a single commercial and industrial loan. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of originated loans was 1.04% at December 31, 2011 and 1.19% at December 31, 2010. Loan Charge Offs The Companys charge off policies, which comply with standards established by banking regulators, are consistently applied from period to period. Charge offs are recorded on a monthly basis. Partially charged off loans continue to be evaluated on a monthly basis and additional charge offs or loan loss provisions may be recorded on the remaining loan balance based on the same criteria. For unsecured consumer loans, charge offs are generally recorded when the loan is deemed to be uncollectible or 120 days past due, whichever occurs first. For consumer loans secured by real estate, including residential mortgage loans, charge offs are generally recorded when the loan is deemed to be uncollectible or 180 days past due, whichever occurs first, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that repayment will occur regardless of the delinquency status. Factors that demonstrate an ability to repay may include: (i) a loan that is secured by adequate collateral and is in the process of collection; (ii) a loan supported by a valid guarantee or insurance; or (iii) a loan supported by a valid claim against a solvent estate. For commercial banking loans, a charge off is recorded when the Company determines that it will not collect all amounts contractually due based on the fair value of the collateral less cost to sell, or the present value of expected future cash flows. The decision whether to charge off all or a portion of a loan rather than to record a specific or general loss allowance is based on an assessment of all available information which aids in determining the loans net realizable value. Typically this involves consideration of both (i) the fair value of any collateral securing the loan, including whether the estimate of fair value has been derived from an appraisal or other market information, and (ii) other factors affecting the likelihood of repayment, including the existence of guarantees and insurance. If the amount by which the Companys recorded investment in the loan exceeds its net realizable value is deemed to be a confirmed loss, a charge off is recorded. Otherwise, a specific or general reserve is established, as applicable. Net loan charge offs as a percentage of average total loans equaled 0.28% in 2011, 0.40% in 2010 and 0.29% in 2009. The comparatively low level of net loan charge offs in recent years, in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of average loans, may not be sustainable in the future. 72 Table of Contents Net Loan Charge Offs (Recoveries) as a Percentage of Average Total Loans Years ended December 31 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 Commercial Banking: Commercial real estate 0.30 % 0.48 % 0.20 % 0.07 % (0.01 )% Commercial and industrial 0.26 0.47 0.31 0.15 0.44 Equipment financing 0.44 0.44 0.70 0.12 0.19 Retail: Residential mortgage 0.21 0.15 0.19 0.03 (0.02 ) Home equity 0.17 0.17 0.17 0.05 0.02 Other consumer 0.93 1.57 1.90 1.44 3.89 Total portfolio 0.28 % 0.40 % 0.29 % 0.10 % 0.10 % The following table presents, by class of loan, the allocation of the allowance for loan losses on originated loans and the percentage of loans in each class to total loans: 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 As of December 31 (dollars in millions) Amount Percentof LoanPortfolio Amount Percentof LoanPortfolio Amount Percentof LoanPortfolio Amount Percentof LoanPortfolio Amount Percentof LoanPortfolio Commercial Banking: Commercial real estate $ 70.5 35.2 % $ 82.0 42.2 % $ 91.0 38.3 % $ 84.7 34.2 % $ 27.9 21.2 % Commercial and industrial 69.4 26.2 53.2 17.9 52.8 19.9 54.0 20.6 24.7 18.2 Equipment financing 20.5 9.9 26.3 12.1 21.8 8.8 12.7 8.4 18.3 11.0 Retail: Residential mortgage 8.8 17.8 5.8 15.3 4.0 17.1 2.8 21.5 0.7 35.5 Home equity 4.3 10.1 2.7 11.4 1.8 14.1 1.7 13.4 0.5 13.8 Other consumer 2.0 0.8 2.5 1.1 1.1 1.8 1.6 1.9 0.6 0.3 Total originated allowance for loan losses $ 175.5 100.0 % $ 172.5 100.0 % $ 172.5 100.0 % $ 157.5 100.0 % $ 72.7 100.0 % The allocation of the allowance for loan losses on originated loans at December 31, 2011 reflects managements assessment of credit risk and probable loss within each portfolio. This assessment is based on a variety of internal and external factors including, but not limited to, the likelihood and severity of loss, portfolio growth and related risk characteristics, and current economic conditions. With respect to the originated portfolio, an allocation of a portion of the allowance to one loan segment does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in another loan segment. Management believes that the level of the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2011 is appropriate to cover probable losses. Non Performing Assets A loan is generally considered non performing when it is placed on non accrual status. A loan is generally placed on non accrual status when it becomes 90 days past due as to interest or principal payments. Past due status is based on the contractual payment terms of the loan. A loan may be placed on non accrual status before it reaches 90 days past due if such loan has been identified as presenting uncertainty with respect to the collectibility of interest and principal. A loan past due 90 days or more may remain on accruing status if such loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest totaled $1.2 million and $11.8 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively (none at December 31, 2011). 73 Table of Contents All previously accrued but unpaid interest on non accrual loans is reversed from interest income in the period in which the accrual of interest is discontinued. Interest payments received on non accrual loans (including impaired loans) are generally applied as a reduction of principal if future collections are doubtful, although such interest payments may be recognized as income. A loan remains on non accrual status until the factors that indicated doubtful collectability no longer exist or until a loan is determined to be uncollectible and is charged off against the allowance for loan losses.

These government guarantees relate, almost entirely, to guarantees provided by the Small Business Administration as well as selected other federal agencies and represent the carrying value of the loans that are covered by such guarantees, the extent of which (i.e. full or partial) varies by loan. At December 31, 2011, the principal loan classes to which these government guarantees relate are commercial and industrial loans (approximately 85%) and commercial real estate loans (approximately 15%). The preceding table excludes acquired loans that are (i) accounted for as purchased credit impaired loans or (ii) covered by an FDIC loss share agreement totaling $235 million and $14 million, respectively, at December 31, 2011 and $342 million and $18 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010 (none in prior periods). Such loans meet Peoples United Financials definition of a non performing loan but are excluded given that the risk of credit loss has been considered by virtue of our estimate of acquisition date fair value and or the existence of an FDIC loss share agreement. The discounts arising from recording these loans at fair value were due, in part, to credit quality. The acquired loans are generally accounted for on a pool basis and the accretable yield on the pools is being recognized as interest income over the life of the loans based on expected cash flows at the pool level. 74 Table of Contents Total non performing assets increased $33.6 million from December 31, 2010 and equaled 2.00% of originated loans, REO and repossessed assets at December 31, 2011. The increase in total non performing assets from December 31, 2010 reflects increases in non performing commercial real estate loans of $24.2 million, non performing commercial and industrial loans of $21.0 million, non performing equipment financing loans of $6.9 million and non performing consumer loans of $6.4 million, essentially offset by decreases in non performing residential mortgage loans of $9.9 million, REO of $13.0 million and repossessed assets of $2.0 million. Included in non performing commercial real estate loans at December 31, 2011 is a previously disclosed loan with a remaining balance of $23 million that was placed on non accrual status during the second quarter of 2011. All loans and REO acquired in the Butler Bank acquisition are subject to an FDIC loss share agreement. The loss share agreement provides for coverage by the FDIC, up to certain limits, on all such covered assets. The FDIC is obligated to reimburse the Company for 80% of any future losses on covered assets up to $34.0 million. The Company will reimburse the FDIC for 80% of recoveries with respect to losses for which the FDIC paid the Company 80% reimbursement under the loss sharing coverage. In addition to the originated non performing loans discussed above, Peoples United Financial has also identified approximately $598 million in originated potential problem loans at December 31, 2011. Originated potential problem loans represent loans that are currently performing, but for which known information about possible credit deterioration on the part of the related borrowers causes management to have concerns as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with contractual loan repayment terms and which may result in the disclosure of such loans as non performing at some time in the future. The originated potential problem loans are generally loans that, although performing, have been classified as substandard in accordance with Peoples United Financials loan rating system, which is consistent with guidelines established by banking regulators. At December 31, 2011, originated potential problem loans consisted of $254 million of commercial and industrial loans, $237 million of commercial real estate loans and $107 million of equipment financing loans. Such loans are closely monitored by management and have remained in performing status for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, delinquency status, borrower payment history and fair value of the underlying collateral. Management cannot predict the extent to which economic conditions may worsen or whether other factors may adversely impact the ability of these borrowers to make payments. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that originated potential problem loans will not become 90 days or more past due, be placed on non accrual status, be restructured, or require additional provisions for loan losses. The levels of non performing assets and potential problem loans are expected to fluctuate in response to changing economic and market conditions, and the relative sizes of the respective loan portfolios, along with managements degree of success in resolving problem assets. Management takes a proactive approach with respect to the identification and resolution of problem loans. However, given the current state of the U.S. economy and, more specifically, the real estate market, the level of non performing assets may continue to increase in 2012. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Detailed discussions pertaining to Peoples United Financials off balance sheet arrangements are included in the following sections: Funding, Liquidity, Stockholders Equity and Dividends, and Market Risk Management. Funding At the current time, Peoples United Financials primary funding sources are deposits and stockholders equity, which represent 94% of total assets at December 31, 2011. Borrowings also are an available source of funding. Based on Peoples United Banks membership in the FHLB of Boston and the level of qualifying collateral available at December 31, 2011, Peoples United Bank had up to $3.6 billion of borrowing capacity in the form of advances from the FHLB of Boston and Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and repurchase agreements. Peoples United Bank also had unsecured borrowing capacity of $0.8 billion at December 31, 2011. 75 Table of Contents Deposits 2011 2010 2009 As of December 31 (dollars in millions) Amount WeightedAverageRate Amount WeightedAverageRate Amount WeightedAverageRate Non interest bearing $ 4,506.2 % $ 3,872.6 % $ 3,509.0 % Savings, interest bearing checking and money market 10,970.4 0.37 8,897.8 0.51 7,327.9 0.65 Total 15,476.6 0.26 12,770.4 0.36 10,836.9 0.44 Time deposits maturing: Within 3 months 1,397.2 0.99 1,437.2 1.10 1,355.3 1.59 After 3 but within 6 months 929.5 0.94 920.7 1.20 889.0 1.60 After 6 months but within 1 year 1,281.9 1.04 1,485.2 1.29 1,441.9 1.67 After 1 but within 2 years 757.3 1.66 840.0 1.69 757.1 1.90 After 2 but within 3 years 308.0 2.09 195.7 2.66 78.2 2.80 After 3 years 665.3 2.53 283.9 2.78 87.2 3.16 Total 5,339.2 1.35 5,162.7 1.42 4,608.7 1.72 Total deposits $ 20,815.8 0.54 % $ 17,933.1 0.66 % $ 15,445.6 0.82 % Peoples United Financials strategy is to focus on increasing deposits by providing a wide range of convenient services to commercial, retail, business and wealth management customers. Peoples United Financial provides customers access to their deposits through 372 branches, including 87 full service Stop & Shop supermarket branches, 569 ATMs, telephone banking and an Internet banking site. Deposits equaled 76% and 72% of total assets at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Peoples United Financial assumed deposits with fair values of $2.1 billion and $2.5 billion in connection with the acquisitions completed in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Deposits and stockholders equity constituted over 96% and 95% of Peoples United Financials funding base at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The expansion of Peoples United Financials branch network and its commitment to developing full service relationships with its customers are integral components of Peoples United Financials strategy to leverage the success of its supermarket banking initiative, expand market share and continue growing deposits. At December 31, 2011, Peoples United Financials network of Stop & Shop branches held deposits totaling $2.5 billion and deposits in supermarket branches open for more than one year averaged $30 million per store. Non interest bearing deposits are an important source of low cost funding and fee income for Peoples United Financial. In addition, Peoples United Financial believes that checking accounts represent one of the core relationships between a financial institution and its customers, and it is from these relationships that cross selling of other financial services can be achieved. Non interest bearing deposits equaled 22% of total deposits at both December 31, 2011 and 2010. Time deposits of $100,000 or more totaled $2.2 billion at December 31, 2011, of which $571 million mature within three months, $342 million mature after three months but within six months, $486 million mature after six months but within one year and $792 million mature after one year. Brokered certificates of deposit totaled $7.9 million at December 31, 2010 (none as of December 31, 2011). 76 Table of Contents Total Deposits As of December 31 (dollars in millions) The following table presents Peoples United Financials time deposits by rate category: As of December 31 (in millions) 2011 1.25% or less $ 3,158.5 1.26% to 2.00% 1,076.1 2.01% to 2.50% 450.4 2.51% to 3.00% 445.5 3.01% to 3.50% 76.2 3.51% to 4.00% 71.7 4.01% and greater 60.8 Total $ 5,339.2 The following table presents, by rate category, the remaining period to maturity of time deposits outstanding as of December 31, 2011: Period to Maturity from December 31, 2011 (in millions) Withinthreemonths Overthree tosix months Over sixmonths toone year Overone totwo years Overtwo tothree years Overthreeyears Total 1.25% or less $ 960.0 $ 772.0 $ 1,001.1 $ 404.2 $ 20.5 $ 0.7 $ 3,158.5 1.26% to 2.00% 387.0 127.0 207.6 128.3 151.2 75.0 1,076.1 2.01% to 2.50% 32.5 14.8 34.1 95.4 61.7 211.9 450.4 2.51% to 3.00% 3.5 3.6 7.7 46.9 42.6 341.2 445.5 3.01% to 3.50% 2.4 1.1 2.0 20.3 25.2 25.2 76.2 3.51% to 4.00% 7.4 6.9 9.9 34.1 3.0 10.4 71.7 4.01% and greater 4.4 4.1 19.5 28.1 3.8 0.9 60.8 Total $ 1,397.2 $ 929.5 $ 1,281.9 $ 757.3 $ 308.0 $ 665.3 $ 5,339.2 77 Table of Contents Borrowings 2011 2010 2009 As of December 31 (dollars in millions) Amount WeightedAverageRate Amount WeightedAverageRate Amount WeightedAverageRate Retail repurchase agreements maturing: Within 1 month $ 496.2 0.32 % $ 472.2 0.43 % $ 144.1 0.48 % Within 1 year 1.0 0.35 1.0 0.80 Total retail repurchase agreements 497.2 0.32 473.2 0.43 144.1 0.48 Fixed rate FHLB advances maturing: Within 1 year 27.8 3.27 7.7 3.98 After 1 but within 2 years 56.4 2.55 15.4 5.17 1.7 3.97 After 2 but within 3 years 65.9 2.65 After 3 but within 4 years 1.2 4.37 16.8 4.50 After 4 but within 5 years 1.5 4.37 After 5 years 274.8 2.68 380.9 3.05 5.4 2.04 Total FHLB advances 332.4 2.82 508.3 3.13 14.8 3.28 Federal funds purchased and otherborrowings maturing: Within 1 year 26.1 4.78 After 1 but within 2 years 28.1 4.78 After 3 but within 4 years 1.0 1.75 After 4 but within 5 years 1.0 1.75 Total federal funds purchased and other borrowings 27.1 4.66 29.1 4.67 Total borrowings $ 856.7 1.43 % $ 1,010.6 1.91 % $ 158.9 0.74 % At December 31, 2011, total borrowings equaled 3% of total assets compared to 4% at December 2010 and less than 1% at December 31, 2009. In 2011, Peoples United Financial repaid a total of $284 million of callable FHLB advances, including $155 million assumed in the Danvers acquisition and $129 million assumed in acquisitions completed in 2010. Peoples United Financial retained FHLB advances and term repurchase agreements with fair values of $500 million and $27 million, respectively, which were assumed in connection with the Smithtown and LSB acquisitions. FHLB advances and retail repurchase agreements represented 1% and 2% of total assets at December 31, 2011, respectively. Retail repurchase agreements primarily consist of transactions with commercial and municipal customers. Peoples United Financials primary source for borrowings were federal funds purchased, which are typically unsecured overnight loans among banks, in addition to advances from the FHLB of Boston, which provides credit for member institutions within its assigned region. Subordinated Notes and Debentures Subordinated notes and debentures totaled $160 million and $182 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Peoples United Financial and Peoples United Bank assumed subordinated notes and debentures with total fair values of $36 million and $29 million, respectively, in connection with the acquisitions completed in 2010 and Peoples United Financial assumed subordinated notes with a fair value of $115 million in connection with the Chittenden acquisition in 2008. In 2011, Peoples United Financial and Peoples United Bank repaid $17 million and $6 million, respectively, of subordinated notes. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning subordinated notes and debentures. 78 Table of Contents In the fourth quarter of 2008, Peoples United Financial and Peoples United Bank both opted in to the FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, which provides a temporary guarantee of newly issued senior unsecured debt, as defined (the Debt Guarantee Program). As of December 31, 2011, neither Peoples United Financial nor Peoples United Bank had any debt outstanding that qualifies under the Debt Guarantee Program. Peoples United Bank may issue up to approximately $300 million of senior unsecured debt that would qualify under the Debt Guarantee Program. While Peoples United Financial has retained the right to do so, the Company does not, at this time, intend to issue senior unsecured debt that would qualify under the Debt Guarantee Program. Contractual Cash Obligations The following table is a summary of Peoples United Financials contractual cash obligations, other than deposit liabilities, including operating leases. Additional information concerning these contractual cash obligations is included in Notes 10, 11 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase obligations included in the table below represent those agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions. A substantial majority of Peoples United Financials purchase obligations are renewable on a year to year basis. As such, the purchase obligations included in this table only reflect the contractual commitment.

Similarly, obligations totaling $17.2 million related to limited partnership affordable housing investments are not included in the above table as the timing of the related capital calls cannot be estimated. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of Peoples United Financials unrecognized income tax positions and affordable housing investments. Liquidity Liquidity is defined as the ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet all present and future funding requirements at reasonable costs. Liquidity management addresses Peoples United Financials and Peoples United Banks ability to fund new loans and investments as opportunities arise, to meet customer deposit withdrawals, and to repay borrowings and subordinated notes as they mature. Peoples United Financials, as well as Peoples United Banks, liquidity positions are monitored daily by management. The Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO) of Peoples United Bank has been authorized by the Board of Directors of Peoples United Financial to set guidelines to ensure maintenance of prudent levels of liquidity for Peoples United Financial as well as for Peoples United Bank. ALCO reports to the Treasury and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors of Peoples United Bank. 79 Table of Contents Asset liquidity is provided by: cash; short term investments and security resale agreements; proceeds from security sales, maturities and principal repayments; and proceeds from scheduled principal collections, prepayments and sales of loans. In addition, certain securities may be used to collateralize borrowings under repurchase agreements. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows present data on cash provided by and used in Peoples United Financials operating, investing and financing activities. At December 31, 2011, Peoples United Financial (parent company) liquid assets included $53 million in debt securities available for sale. Peoples United Banks liquid assets included $781 million in cash and cash equivalents, $2.7 billion in debt securities available for sale and $72 million in trading account securities. Securities available for sale with a fair value of $1.44 billion at December 31, 2011 were pledged as collateral for public deposits and for other purposes. Liability liquidity is measured by Peoples United Financials and Peoples United Banks ability to obtain deposits and borrowings at cost effective rates that are diversified with respect to markets and maturities. Deposits, which are considered the most stable source of liability liquidity, totaled $20.8 billion at December 31, 2011 and represented 77% of total funding (the sum of total deposits, total borrowings, subordinated notes and debentures, and stockholders equity). Borrowings are used to diversify Peoples United Financials funding mix and to support asset growth. Borrowings and subordinated notes and debentures totaled $857 million and $160 million, respectively, at December 31, 2011, representing 3.2% and 0.6%, respectively, of total funding at that date. Peoples United Banks current sources of borrowings include: federal funds purchased, advances from the FHLB of Boston and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and repurchase agreements. At December 31, 2011, Peoples United Banks total borrowing limit from the FHLB of Boston and Federal Reserve Bank of New York for advances, and repurchase agreements, was $3.6 billion, based on the level of qualifying collateral available for these borrowings. In addition, Peoples United Bank had unsecured borrowing capacity of $0.8 billion at that date. At December 31, 2011, Peoples United Bank had outstanding commitments to originate loans totaling $1.1 billion and approved, but unused, lines of credit extended to customers totaling $4.1 billion (including $1.8 billion of home equity lines of credit). The sources of liquidity discussed above are deemed by management to be sufficient to fund outstanding loan commitments and to meet Peoples United Financials and Peoples United Banks other obligations. Earning Asset Mix $23.8 billion as of December 31, 2011 (percent) Funding Base $27.1 billion as of December 31, 2011 (percent) 80 Table of Contents Stockholders Equity and Dividends Peoples United Financials total stockholders equity was $5.23 billion at December 31, 2011, a $6 million increase from December 31, 2010. This increase primarily reflects the issuances of 18.5 million shares of common stock with a fair value of approximately $248 million in connection with the Danvers acquisition and net income of $198.8 million, essentially offset by open market repurchases of 20.4 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $247.2 million and dividends paid of $220.9 million. Stockholders equity equaled 19.0% of total assets at December 31, 2011 and 20.8% at December 31, 2010. Tangible stockholders equity equaled 12.0% of tangible assets at December 31, 2011 compared to 14.1% at December 31, 2010. In April 2008, Peoples United Financials Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 5% of the Companys then outstanding common stock, or 17.3 million shares. In January 2011, Peoples United Financials Board of Directors authorized an additional repurchase of common stock for up to 5% of the Companys then outstanding common stock, or 17.5 million shares. Under both authorizations, such shares may be repurchased either directly or through agents, in the open market at prices and terms satisfactory to management. In 2011, the Company completed the repurchase of the maximum number of shares of common stock authorized in April 2008 and January 2011, by repurchasing 20.4 million shares of Peoples United Financial common stock at a total cost of $247.2 million. In October 2011, Peoples United Financials Board of Directors authorized an additional repurchase of common stock. Under the new repurchase authorization, up to 5% of the Companys common stock outstanding, or 18.0 million shares, may be repurchased, either directly or through agents, in the open market at prices and terms satisfactory to management. Through February 24, 2012, 3.5 million shares of Peoples United Financials common stock had been repurchased under this program at a total cost of $44 million. Peoples United Financials total stockholders equity was $5.22 billion at December 31, 2010, a $119 million increase compared to $5.10 billion at December 31, 2009. This increase primarily reflects the issuances of 26.0 million shares of common stock with a fair value of approximately $405 million in connection with the Financial Federal acquisition and 2.1 million shares of common stock with a fair value of approximately $26 million in connection with the Smithtown acquisition, and net income of $85.7 million, partially offset by dividends paid of $218.1 million, the open market repurchase of 14.3 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $191.2 million, and a $24.2 million increase in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss since December 31, 2009. Dividends declared and paid per common share totaled $0.6275, $0.6175 and $0.6075 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Peoples United Financials dividend payout ratio (dividends paid as a percentage of net income) for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was 111.1%, 254.5%, and 201.1%, respectively. Peoples United Financials operating dividend payout ratio for the year ended December 31, 2011 was 93.2%. The Companys Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend on its common stock of $0.1575 per share. The dividend was paid on February 15, 2012 to shareholders of record on February 1, 2012. In 2011, Peoples United Bank paid a cash dividend of $160 million to Peoples United Financial and expects to pay a cash dividend of $40 million in March 2012. 81 Table of Contents Regulatory Capital Requirements OCC capital regulations require federally chartered savings banks, such as Peoples United Bank, to meet three minimum capital ratios: Tangible Capital Ratio A 1.5% tangible capital ratio, calculated as tangible capital to adjusted total assets. Leverage (Core) Capital Ratio A 4% leverage (core) capital ratio, calculated as core capital to adjusted total assets. The minimum leverage (core) capital ratio is reduced to 3% if the savings bank received the highest rating on its most recent safety and soundness examination. Risk Based Capital Ratio An 8% total risk based capital ratio, calculated as total risk based capital to total risk weighted assets. For purposes of this calculation, total risk based capital equals the sum of core and supplementary capital, provided that supplementary capital may not exceed 100% of core capital. In assessing an institutions capital adequacy, the OCC takes into consideration not only these numeric factors but also qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where necessary. Peoples United Bank, as a matter of prudent management, targets as its goal the maintenance of capital ratios that exceed these minimum requirements and that are consistent with Peoples United Banks risk profile. Peoples United Banks tangible capital ratio, leverage (core) capital ratio and total risk based capital ratios were 11.1%, 11.1% and 14.0%, respectively, at December 31, 2011, compared to 11.4%, 11.4% and 14.5%, respectively, at December 31, 2010. The following summary compares Peoples United Banks regulatory capital amounts and ratios as of December 31, 2011 to the OCC minimum requirements. The leverage and risk based capital requirements of the OCC are substantially the same as those of the OTS, Peoples United Banks previous regulator. At December 31, 2011, Peoples United Banks adjusted total assets, as defined, totaled $25.3 billion and its total risk weighted assets, as defined, totaled $21.4 billion. At December 31, 2011, Peoples United Bank exceeded each of its regulatory capital requirements. Peoples United Bank OCC MinimumRequirements As of December 31, 2011 (dollars in millions) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Tangible capital $ 2,808.6 (1) 11.1 % $ 379.5 1.5 % Leverage (core) capital 2,808.6 (1) 11.1 1,011.9 4.0 Total risk based capital 2,988.7 (2) 14.0 1,711.3 8.0 (1) Represents total stockholders equity, excluding: (i) after tax net unrealized gains (losses) on certain securities classified as available for sale; (ii) after tax net gains on derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges; (iii) certain assets not recognized in tier 1 capital (principally goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles); and (iv) the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) relating to pension and other postretirement benefits. (2) Represents tier 1 capital plus subordinated notes and debentures, up to certain limits, and the allowance for loan losses up to 1.25% of total risk weighted assets. Generally, a bank is considered well capitalized if it has a leverage (core) capital ratio of at least 5.0%, a tier 1 risk based capital ratio of at least 6.0% (calculated as tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets) and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 10.0%. Peoples United Banks regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2011 exceeded the OCC numeric criteria for classification as well capitalized. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning Peoples United Banks regulatory capital amounts and ratios. 82 Table of Contents Peoples United Bank Capital Ratios Compared to Regulatory Requirements As of December 31, 2011 (percent) The following table summarizes Peoples United Financials capital ratios on a consolidated basis: December 31,2011 December 31,2010 Tangible equity to tangible assets 12.0 % 14.1 % Leverage (Tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets) 12.5 14.5 Tier 1 common equity to total risk weighted assets (1) 14.3 17.0 Tier 1 risk based capital to total risk weighted assets 14.8 17.5 Total risk based capital to total risk weighted assets 16.2 19.3 (1) Tier 1 common equity represents total stockholders equity, excluding goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles. In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision released its final framework for capital requirements, which are referred to as Basel III. When implemented by the U.S. banking agencies and fully phased in, Basel III will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital, with a greater emphasis on common equity. The implementation of the Basel III final framework will commence January 1, 2013. Peoples United Banks capital ratios at December 31, 2011 were in excess of these new capital requirements. The Basel III final capital framework, among other things: (i) introduces as a new capital measure Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1); (ii) specifies that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments meeting specified requirements; (iii) defines CET1 narrowly by requiring that most adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital; and (iv) expands the scope of the adjustments as compared to existing regulations. When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, Basel III requires financial institutions to maintain: (i) as a newly adopted international standard, a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 4.5% CET1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk weighted assets of at least 7%); (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 83 Table of Contents capital to risk weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation); (iii) a minimum ratio of Total (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to risk weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation); and (iv) as a newly adopted international standard, a minimum leverage ratio of 3%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital balance sheet exposures plus certain off balance sheet exposures (computed as the average for each quarter of the month end ratios for the quarter). The U.S. banking agencies have yet to propose regulations implementing Basel III. In addition to Basel III, the DFA requires or permits federal banking agencies to adopt regulations affecting banking institutions capital requirements in a number of respects, including potentially more stringent capital requirements for systemically important financial institutions. Accordingly, the regulations ultimately applicable to financial institutions may be substantially different from the Basel III final framework as published in December 2010. Management will continue to monitor any proposed regulations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market Risk Management Market risk is the risk of loss to earnings, capital and the fair values of certain assets and liabilities resulting from changes in interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. Interest Rate Risk For Peoples United Financial, the only relevant market risk at this time is interest rate risk (IRR), which is the potential exposure to earnings or capital that may result from changes in interest rates. Peoples United Financial manages its IRR to achieve a balance between risk, earnings volatility and capital preservation. ALCO has primary responsibility for managing Peoples United Financials IRR. To evaluate Peoples United Financials IRR profile, ALCO monitors economic conditions, interest rate trends, liquidity levels and capital ratios. Management also reviews assumptions periodically for projected customer and competitor behavior, in addition to the expected repricing characteristics and cash flow projections for assets, liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments. Actual conditions may vary significantly from Peoples United Financials assumptions. Management evaluates the impact of IRR on Income at Risk using an earnings simulation model to project earnings under multiple interest rate environments over a one year time horizon resulting in a quantification of IRR. The earnings projections are based on a dynamic balance sheet and estimates of pricing levels for Peoples United Financials products under multiple scenarios intended to reflect instantaneous yield curve shocks. Peoples United Financial estimates its base case Income at Risk using current interest rates. Internal policy regarding IRR simulations currently specifies that for instantaneous parallel shifts of the yield curve, estimated Income at Risk for the subsequent one year period should not decline by more than: 7% for a 100 basis point shift; 10% for a 200 basis point shift; and 15% for a 300 basis point shift. The following table shows the estimated percentage change in Peoples United Financials Income at Risk over a one year simulation period beginning December 31, 2011. Given the interest rate environment at that date, simulations for declines in interest rates below 25 basis points were not deemed to be meaningful. Rate Change (basis points) Percent Change inIncome at Risk +300 18.4 % +200 12.1 +100 5.5 25 (1.1 ) 84 Table of Contents While Income at Risk simulation identifies earnings exposure over a relatively short time horizon, Economic Value of Equity at Risk takes a long term economic perspective when quantifying IRR, thereby identifying possible margin behavior over a longer time horizon. Base case Economic Value of Equity at Risk is calculated by estimating the net present value of all future cash flows from existing assets and liabilities using current interest rates. The base case scenario assumes that future interest rates remain unchanged. Internal policy currently limits the exposure of a decrease in Economic Value of Equity at Risk resulting from instantaneous parallel shifts of the yield curve in the following manner: 5% for 100 basis points shift; 10% for 200 basis points shift; and 15% for 300 basis points shift. The following table shows the estimated percentage change in Peoples United Financials Economic Value of Equity at Risk, assuming various shifts in interest rates. Given the interest rate environment at December 31, 2011, simulations for declines in interest rates below 25 basis points were not deemed to be meaningful. Rate Change (basis points) Percent Change inEconomic Value ofEquity at Risk +300 % +200 (0.4 ) +100 (0.7 ) 25 0.3 Peoples United Financials interest rate risk position at December 31, 2011, as set forth in the Income at Risk and Economic Value of Equity at Risk tables above, reflects an asset sensitive Income at Risk position and a neutral Economic Value of Equity at Risk position at that date. Managements current posture is to invest a portion of the Companys excess capital in liquid short term investments. While this strategy places pressure on net interest income in a low interest rate environment, management views such risk as an acceptable alternative in light of the current low interest rate environment. Based on the Companys current interest rate position, an immediate 100 basis points increase in interest rates translates to an approximate $50 million increase in net interest income on an annualized basis. Given the uncertainty of the magnitude, timing and direction of future interest rate movements and the shape of the yield curve, actual results may vary from those predicted by Peoples United Financials models. Peoples United Financial uses derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, primarily for market risk management purposes (principally interest rate risk). Certain other derivatives are entered into in connection with transactions with commercial customers. Derivatives are not used for speculative purposes. At December 31, 2011, Peoples United Financial used interest rate swaps on a limited basis to manage IRR associated with certain interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Interest rate swaps associated with interest earning assets are used to match more closely the repricing of fewer than five commercial real estate loans and the funding associated with these loans. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the fixed rate assets to a variable interest rate and consequently reduces Peoples United Financials exposure to increases in interest rates. These interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges. Peoples United Financial has entered into an interest rate swap to hedge the LIBOR based floating interest rate payments on the Companys $125 million subordinated notes, which begin in February 2012. The subordinated notes pay a fixed interest rate of 5.80% until February 2012, at which time the interest rate converts to the three month LIBOR plus 68.5 basis points. Specifically, Peoples United Financial has agreed with the swap counterparty to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed rate (1.99%) and floating rate interest amounts calculated based on a notional amount of $125 million. The floating rate interest amounts received under the interest rate swap are calculated using the same floating rate paid on the subordinated notes. The interest rate swap effectively converts the variable rate subordinated notes to a fixed interest rate and consequently reduces Peoples United Financials exposure to increases in interest rates. This interest rate swap is accounted for as a cash flow hedge. Peoples United Financial has written guidelines that have been approved by its Board of Directors and ALCO governing the use of derivative financial instruments, including approved counterparties and credit limits. Credit risk associated with these instruments is controlled and monitored through policies and procedures governing collateral management and credit approval. 85 Table of Contents By using derivatives, Peoples United Financial is exposed to credit risk to the extent that counterparties to the derivative contracts do not perform as required. Should a counterparty fail to perform under the terms of a derivative contract, the Companys counterparty credit risk is equal to the amount reported as a derivative asset in the Consolidated Statements of Condition, less any posted collateral. Amounts reported as derivative assets represent derivative contracts in a gain position, net of derivatives in a loss position with the same counterparty (to the extent subject to master netting arrangements). Peoples United Financial seeks to minimize counterparty credit risk through credit approvals, limits, monitoring procedures, execution of master netting arrangements and obtaining collateral, where appropriate. Counterparties to Peoples United Financials derivatives include major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings from the major rating agencies. As such, management believes the risk of incurring credit losses on derivative contracts with those counterparties is remote and losses, if any, would be immaterial. Certain of Peoples United Financials derivative contracts contain provisions establishing collateral requirements (subject to minimum collateral posting thresholds) based on the Companys external credit rating. If the Companys senior unsecured debt rating were to fall below the level generally recognized as investment grade, the counterparties to such derivative contracts could require additional collateral on those derivative transactions in a net liability position (after considering the effect of master netting arrangements and posted collateral). The aggregate fair value of derivative instruments with such credit related contingent features that were in a net liability position at December 31, 2011 was $11.2 million, for which Peoples United Financial had posted $10.1 million collateral in the normal course of business. If the Companys senior unsecured debt rating had fallen below investment grade as of that date, $1.1 million in additional collateral would have been required. In the first quarter of 2009, Peoples United Financial terminated its remaining $600 million (notional amount) interest rate floor contracts. The decision to do so was based on managements belief that, in light of the current interest rate environment, the derivative contracts had achieved their stated market risk management objective. Termination of the derivative contracts also served to reduce the Companys counterparty credit risk. At the time of termination, the interest rate floors had an unrealized gain of $40.1 million. The gain was included (on a net of tax basis) as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and was recognized in income over the period during which the hedged items (certain floating rate commercial loans) affected earnings (approximately 2 years). Foreign Currency Risk Foreign exchange contracts are commitments to buy or sell foreign currency on a future date at a contractual price. Peoples United Financial uses these instruments on a limited basis to eliminate its exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates on certain of its commercial loans that are denominated in foreign currencies. Gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts substantially offset the translation gains and losses on the related loans. Effective in the first quarter of 2010, Peoples United Financial no longer designates foreign exchange contracts as hedging instruments.
