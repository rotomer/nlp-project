ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We continue to build on the core activities that support our strong competitive position in integrated mail and document management solutions. We operate in three reportable segments: Global Mailing, Enterprise Solutions and Capital Services. Our Global Mailing segment includes worldwide revenue and related expenses from the rental of postage meters and the sale, rental and financing of mailing equipment, including mail finishing and software based mail creation equipment. We also include in this segment software based shipping, transportation and logistics systems, related supplies and services, presort mail services, postal payment solutions and supply chain solutions such as order management and fulfillment support. Our Enterprise Solutions segment comprises Pitney Bowes Management Services (PBMS) and Document Messaging Technologies (DMT). PBMS includes revenue and related expenses from facilities management contracts for advanced mailing, reprographic, document management and other high value services. DMT includes revenue and related expenses from the sale, service and financing of high speed, software enabled production mail systems, sortation equipment, incoming mail systems, electronic statement, billing and payment solutions, and mailing software. Our Capital Services segment consists of external financing for non Pitney Bowes equipment, including the strategic financing of third party equipment. It comprises primarily asset and fee based income generated by financing or arranging transactions of critical large ticket customer assets. In January 2003, we announced that we would stop active pursuit of, and growth in, long term Capital Services financing transactions, including long term financing for postal and related equipment. We will continue to provide lease financing for our products through our internal financing operations. During 2002, we completed the acquisition of PSI Group, Inc. (PSI), the nations largest mail presort company with operating centers across the U.S. This increased our presence in the domestic market for mail related services. During 2001, we completed several acquisitions that increased our presence in both domestic and international markets and that we believe will better position the company for long term growth and enhanced shareholder value. These acquisitions included the following: Secap SA (Secap), a mailing systems company based in France. Danka Services International (DSI), a provider of on and off site document management services in the U.S. and Europe. Bell & Howells International Mail and Messaging Technologies (MMT) business in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. On December 3, 2001, we completed the spin off of our office systems business to stockholders as an independent, publicly traded company under the name of Imagistics International Inc. (IGI). On that date, we paid a special stock dividend of IGI common stock to our common shareholders. Through this special dividend, we distributed 100% of the shares of IGI stock to common shareholders of the company. The historical carrying amount of the IGI net assets distributed to our shareholders on the spin off date has been recorded as a stock dividend of $311.7 million. We have segregated the operating results of IGI and reported them as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income. In connection with the spin off, we recorded a loss of approximately $26.0 million (net of taxes of $12.2 million) for the year ended December 31, 2001. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. On January 14, 2000, we sold Atlantic Mortgage & Investment Corporation (AMIC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, to ABN AMRO North America. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a gain of $12.5 million (net of taxes of $7.4 million) for the year ended December 31, 2002. This gain resulted from the favorable resolution of certain contingent liabilities recorded at the time of sale. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. On October 30, 1998, Colonial Pacific Leasing Corporation (CPLC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, transferred the operations, employees and substantially all assets related to its broker oriented external financing business to General Electric Capital Corporation, a subsidiary of the General Electric Company. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a gain of $25.5 million (net of taxes of $15.0 million) for the year ended December 31, 2002. This gain resulted from the favorable resolution of certain contingent liabilities recorded at the time of sale. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. 10 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations. We discuss the impact and any associated risks on our results of operations related to these policies throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include, but are not limited to customer cancellations, bad debts, inventories, investments, useful lives of long lived assets, intangible assets, income taxes, financing operations, warranty obligations, restructuring, pensions and other postretirement benefits, and contingencies and litigation. Our actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue recognition We derive our revenue from the following sources: sales; business services; rentals and financing; and support services In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we recognize revenue from these sources as follows: Sales revenue Sales of equipment We sell equipment to our customers, as well as to distributors and dealers (re sellers) throughout the world. Revenue from these sales is recognized upon the transfer of title, which is at the point of shipment. We do not offer any rights of return or stock balancing rights. Our sales revenue from customized equipment and software enabled mail creation equipment and shipping products is generally recognized when installed. Sales of supplies Revenue related to supplies is recognized at the point of title transfer, which is upon shipment. Software licenses and integration services We recognize revenue related to off the shelf software licenses upon transfer of title, which is upon shipment. We recognize revenue from software requiring integration services at the point of customer acceptance. Business services revenue Business services Business services revenue includes revenue from PBMS and PSI. Management services, which includes outsourcing of mailrooms, copy centers, or other document management functions, are typically annual or longer contracts that contain a monthly service fee and in many cases a click charge based on the number of copies made, machines in use, etc. Revenue is recognized over the term of the agreement, based on monthly service charges, with the exception of the click charges, which are recognized as incurred. Presort mail services include the preparation, sortation and aggregation of mail to earn postal discounts and expedite delivery for our customers. Revenue is recognized over the term of the agreement as earned. 11 Table of Contents Rentals revenue Product rentals We rent equipment to our customers, primarily postage meters, mailing equipment and shipping systems under short term rental agreements, generally for periods of three months to three years. We invoice in advance the charges for equipment rental. We defer the billed revenue and include it initially in advance billings. Rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the rental agreement. Financing revenue Product financing arrangements We provide lease financing of our products in the U.S. and outside the U.S. through sales type leases. When a sales type lease is consummated, we record the gross finance receivable, unearned income and the estimated residual value of the leased equipment. Unearned income represents the excess of the gross finance receivable plus the estimated residual value over the sales price of the equipment. We recognize the equipment sale at the inception of the lease. We recognize unearned income as earned using the interest method over the term of the transaction. Earned income is included in rentals and financing revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Capital Services revenue We provide financing for non Pitney Bowes equipment through direct financing leases and leveraged leases. When a direct financing lease is consummated, we record the gross finance receivable, unearned income and the estimated residual value of the leased equipment. Unearned income represents the excess of the gross receivable plus the estimated residual value over the cost of the equipment. We account for initial direct costs incurred in consummating a transaction as part of the investment in the lease and appropriately amortize these costs using the interest method over the term of the lease. We recognize unearned income as earned using the interest method over the term of the transaction. Earned income is included in financing revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income. From time to time, we sell selected finance assets. We follow Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, when accounting for our sale of finance assets. We recognize all assets obtained or liabilities incurred in consideration as proceeds of the sale and recognize any gain or loss on the sale in earnings. Our investment in leveraged leases consists of rentals receivable net of principal and interest on the related nonrecourse debt, estimated residual value of the leased property and unearned income. We recognize the unearned income as leveraged lease revenue over the lease term. Earned income is included in financing revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Support services revenue Equipment maintenance agreements We provide support services to our customers primarily through extended maintenance contracts. Revenue related to these agreements is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement. Multiple element arrangements Certain of our transactions are consummated at the same time. The usual form of this transaction involves the sale or lease of equipment, a cancelable meter rental and or a cancelable equipment maintenance agreement. In these cases, fair value of the various elements is determined by using the residual method. In applying this method, the fair values of any meter rental or equipment maintenance agreement are determined to be equivalent to the price charged in a standalone or renewal transaction. Any remaining consideration is allocated to the value of the equipment. Allowance for doubtful accounts We estimate our accounts receivable risks and provide allowances for doubtful accounts accordingly. We believe that our credit risk for accounts receivable is limited because of the large number of our customers and the relatively small account balances for most of our customers. Also, our customers are dispersed across different businesses and geographic areas. We believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient. 12 Table of Contents We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on a periodic basis. Our evaluation includes historical loss experience, adverse situations that may affect a customers ability to repay, and prevailing economic conditions. We make adjustments to our allowance if the evaluation of allowance requirements differs from the actual aggregate reserve. This evaluation is inherently subjective because our estimates may be revised as more information becomes available. Allowance for credit losses We estimate our finance receivables risks and provide allowances for credit losses accordingly. Our financial services businesses establish credit approval limits based on the credit quality of the customer and the type of equipment financed. We charge finance receivables through the allowance for credit losses after collection efforts are exhausted and we deem the account uncollectible. Our financial services businesses base credit decisions primarily on a customers financial strength. We believe that our concentration of credit risk for finance receivables in our internal financing division is limited because of our large number of customers, small account balances and customer geographic and industry diversification. In addition, in our Capital Services programs, we may also consider collateral values. Our general policy for finance receivables contractually past due for over 90 to 120 days is to discontinue revenue recognition. We resume revenue recognition when payments reduce the account to 60 days or less past due. In our Capital Services programs, we discontinue revenue recognition as soon as it is apparent that the obligor will not be making payments in accordance with lease terms, such as in the event of bankruptcy. Otherwise, we discontinue revenue recognition when accounts are over 90 days past due. We evaluate the adequacy of allowance for credit losses on a periodic basis. Our evaluation includes historical loss experience, the nature and volume of our portfolios, adverse situations that may affect a customers ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. We make adjustments to our allowance for credit losses if the evaluation of reserve requirements differs from the actual aggregate reserve. This evaluation is inherently subjective because our estimates may be revised as more information becomes available. Accounting for income taxes When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We record this amount as a provision for our taxes in accordance with FAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This process requires us to make the following assessments: we estimate our actual current tax liability in each jurisdiction. we estimate our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as lease revenue and related depreciation, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we include within our Consolidated Balance Sheet. we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and if we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. At any time, our provision for taxes could be impacted by changes in tax law and interpretations by governments or courts. Long lived assets Long lived assets include: Property, plant and equipment We state property, plant and equipment at cost. We depreciate property, plant and equipment principally using the straight line method over estimated useful lives: machinery and equipment principally three to 15 years and buildings up to 50 years. We capitalize major improvements which add to productive capacity or extend the life of an asset and we charge to expense as incurred repairs and maintenance. We depreciate rental equipment on the straight line method over appropriate periods, principally three to ten years. Changes in regulatory provisions or technology may impact the useful lives of these assets. We depreciate other depreciable assets using either the straight line method or accelerated methods. We amortize properties leased under capital leases on a straight line basis over the primary lease terms. We capitalize certain costs of internally developed software. These costs include purchased materials and services, payroll and payroll related costs and interest costs. We amortize internally developed software on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life, which is principally three to ten years. We do not capitalize software development costs related to software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed due to the fact that the period between establishment and testing of a working model and the general availability of our software has historically been short and the related software development costs qualifying for capitalization in accordance with FAS No. 86 Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed have been insignificant. 13 Table of Contents Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the value of net tangible and other intangible assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill acquired under business combinations completed prior to June 30, 2001 has been amortized, through December 31, 2001, using the straight line method over its estimated useful life, principally 40 years. Goodwill acquired under business combinations completed after June 30, 2001 has not been amortized. Other intangible assets Intangible assets with finite lives, acquired under business combinations, are amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives, principally five to 15 years. Impairment review Periodically, we assess the carrying value of our long lived and intangible assets. Our assessment involves comparing the carrying value of the asset on our Consolidated Balance Sheet to the cash flows we expect to generate in the future by that asset. We forecast the cash flows based on our assessment of our business. If the expected cash flows are less than the assets carrying value, we record an impairment charge on that asset. We believe that we have no impairment to our assets as of December 31, 2002. However, future events and circumstances, some of which are described below, may result in an impairment charge: changes in postal regulations governing the types of meters allowable for use. However, recent regulations were issued in November 2001, and therefore we do not expect new regulations for the foreseeable future. new technological developments that provide significantly enhanced benefits over current digital technology significant negative economic or industry trends changes in our business strategy that alter the expected usage of the related assets significant increase or decrease in our cost of capital future terrorist or other actions that significantly impact the volume of mail future economic results that are below our expectations used in the current assessments. Special Items Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.81, $2.08 and $2.18 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Diluted earnings per share in 2002 included Capital Services charges of 56 cents per diluted share, related to a write down of our investments in commercial passenger aircraft leasing and to increase our provision for credit losses primarily related to the rapid deterioration of the U.S. airline industry. Diluted earnings per share in 2001 included a charge of 68 cents per diluted share related to assets associated with our non networked mailing technology, a charge of 30 cents per diluted share related to restructuring initiatives and a net gain of 82 cents per diluted share from legal settlements. Diluted earnings per share in 2000 includes a charge of 4 cents per diluted share related to restructuring initiatives and a gain of 5 cents per diluted share related to state tax law changes. Excluding the impact of these special items, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.37, $2.25 and $2.17 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. A discussion of these items is as follows: Capital Services charges In 2002, we recorded a non cash pre tax charge of approximately $213 million, to write down our investments in commercial passenger aircraft leases primarily with US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways) and United Air Lines (United) and to increase our provision for credit losses primarily related to commercial passenger aircraft leasing investments in the U.S. The charge was composed of the following: A write down of U.S. aircraft lease receivables and residuals of approximately $110 million Additional credit loss reserves related to U.S. aircraft lease investments of approximately $82 million Other costs related to our aircraft leasing investments of approximately $1 million; and Additional credit loss reserves related to non aircraft Capital Services investments of approximately $20 million. The decision of US Airways and United to file for bankruptcy exacerbated an already difficult environment in the airline industry. As a result of the rapid deterioration of the U.S. airline industry as well as our revised Capital Services strategy, we recorded a charge of 14 Table of Contents approximately $82 million to increase our provision for credit losses related to our aircraft leasing investments in the U.S. As a result of these events, combined with both the deteriorating financial condition in various other industries and the change in our Capital Services strategy, we also recorded a charge of approximately $20 million to increase our provision for credit losses related to non aircraft leasing investments, including investments in the telecommunications industry. A further breakdown of the charge related to aircraft lease investments by individual airline is presented on page 24. Meter transition In 2001, we adopted a formal plan to transition to the next generation of networked mailing technology. The information capture and exchange, made possible by advanced technology, turns the postage meter into an intelligent terminal that networks the mailer to postal and carrier information and systems. This two way information architecture, in turn, enables convenient access to and delivery of value added services such as tracking, delivery confirmation and rate information. The adoption of this plan was facilitated by our expanded access to technology and our ability to move to networked products combined with our expectations that the U.S. and postal services around the world will continue to encourage the migration of mailing systems to networked digital technologies. In connection with this plan, we recorded non cash pre tax charges of $268.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, related to assets associated with our non networked mailing technology. We have segregated these charges in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2001. In November 2001, postal regulations were issued, consistent with our meter transition plan, defining the meter migration process and timing. See Regulatory Matters. Restructuring charges In 2001, we adopted a formal restructuring plan to implement a common, streamlined business infrastructure across the corporation as a result of our decisions to spin off our office systems business and align our mailing business on a global basis, as well as cost saving opportunities resulting from strategic acquisitions and partnerships, and additional benefits attained from the consolidation of our information technology organization and enterprise wide resource planning initiatives. In connection with this plan, we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $149.3 million in 2001, of which $116.1 million was related to continuing operations and the remaining $33.2 million was related to discontinued operations. We have segregated the restructuring charges related to continuing operations in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2001. The restructuring charges related to discontinued operations are included in discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2001. In 2000, we recorded a pre tax charge of approximately $19 million related to the consolidation of information technology staff and infrastructure. We have segregated this charge in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2000. Legal settlements, net In 2001, the company and Hewlett Packard announced that they had reached an agreement resolving a lawsuit filed by us in 1995. The lawsuit arose out of a dispute over print technology patents. Under the terms of the agreement, the companies resolved all pending patent litigation without admission of infringement and we received $400 million in cash and ten year supply and technology agreements. We recorded the cash payment, net of legal fees and related expenses of $37.8 million, as other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2001. In 2001, we recorded a pre tax charge of approximately $24 million associated with the settlement of a lawsuit related to lease upgrade pricing in the early to mid 1990s. The $24 million charge relates to the following settlement costs: award certificates to be provided to members of the class for purchase of office products through the Pitney Bowes supply line and the cost of legal fees and related expenses of $8.3 million. We included this charge in other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2001. State tax benefits In 2000, we recorded a one time tax benefit of $12 million related primarily to state tax law changes. 15 Table of Contents The following table reconciles GAAP to Proforma income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively: (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) 2002 2001 2000 GAAP income from continuing operations before income taxes, as reported $ 619,445 $ 766,384 $ 802,848 Special items: Capital services charges 213,182 Restructuring charges 116,142 18,667 Cost of meter transition 268,300 Legal settlements, net (338,097 ) Proforma income from continuing operations before income taxes 832,627 812,729 821,515 Proforma provision for income taxes 260,616 256,455 259,190 Proforma income from continuing operations $ 572,011 $ 556,274 $ 562,325 Results of Continuing Operations 2002 Compared to 2001 In 2002, our revenue increased 7%, income from continuing operations decreased 15% and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 13% to $1.81 compared with $2.08 for 2001. Excluding special items in both periods, as identified on page 14, income from continuing operations increased 3% and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 5% to $2.37 compared with $2.25 for 2001. Excluding the acquisitions of PSI, Secap, DSI, and MMT, our revenue increased 1%. These acquisitions increased our operating profit, but including related financing costs, did not materially affect earnings either on a per share or aggregate basis. Revenue The following table shows revenue in 2002 and 2001 by segment: (Dollars in millions) 2002 2001 % change Global Mailing $ 3,012 $ 2,847 6 % Enterprise Solutions 1,218 1,083 12 % Total Messaging Solutions 4,230 3,930 8 % Capital Services 180 192 (6 )% $ 4,410 $ 4,122 7 % Total Messaging Solutions revenue grew 8% over the prior year. The revenue increase came from growth in the Global Mailing and Enterprise Solutions segments of 6% and 12%, respectively, over 2001. Approximately 77% of our total revenue in 2002 is recurring revenue, which we believe is a continuing good indicator of potential repeat business. Excluding the acquisitions of PSI, Secap and MMT, Global Mailing revenue increased 2%. Global Mailing revenue in the U.S. benefited from the placement of new digital mailing systems and the demand for our mail creation and distribution solutions products. Our new DM Series of digital mailing systems featuring IntellilinkTM technology has experienced strong customer satisfaction. Within the Global Mailing segment, international mailing revenue grew 17 percent, driven by revenue from the acquisition of Secap, improved revenue trends in the U.K. and Canada and the favorable impact of foreign currency. Excluding revenue from the acquisition of Secap and the favorable impact of foreign currency, international mailing revenue grew 2%. This revenue growth was achieved despite lower revenue in Germany and several other European countries, where demand has been slower for mailing equipment in a post meter migration environment, and where the company has not yet launched its new DM SeriesTM. Enterprise Solutions revenue growth of 12% over the prior year was driven by a 19% increase at PBMS primarily as a result of the acquisition of DSI. Excluding the acquisition of DSI, PBMS revenue grew 4%. PBMS continues to improve its competitive position and generate strong growth in new written business, particularly in the higher value document management services, but this growth was partially offset by the continued contraction of large enterprise accounts, especially in the financial services and legal sectors. DMT revenue decreased 7% over the prior year as businesses continue to delay large capital spending decisions, which in turn slowed worldwide demand for our high speed, software enabled production mail equipment and mail processing software. Capital Services revenue decreased 6% due to our previously stated strategy to concentrate on fee based income opportunities. 16 Table of Contents Operating profit The following table shows operating profit in 2002 and 2001: (Dollars in millions) 2002 2001 % change Global Mailing $ 894 $ 860 4 % Enterprise Solutions 83 77 7 % Total Messaging Solutions 977 937 4 % Capital Services 76 73 4 % $ 1,053 $ 1,010 4 % Operating profit grew 4% over the prior year which reflected contributions from the acquisitions, as well as our continuing emphasis on reducing costs and controlling operating expenses. Operating profit grew 4% in the Global Mailing segment and 7% in the Enterprise Solutions segment. Global Mailing operating profit grew 4% supported by revenue growth and the effect of our continued emphasis on reducing costs and controlling operating expenses. Operating profit was adversely affected by moderating customer orders and upgrades due to the continuing weak economy and a shift to lower margin products and services. The operating profit growth in our Enterprise Solutions segment came from 11% operating profit growth at PBMS offset by a 5% operating profit decrease at DMT. The operating profit growth at PBMS was supported by strong revenue growth. Operating profit was adversely affected by costs associated with acquiring new accounts, and investments in product technology and infrastructure, especially in Europe. DMTs operating profit decline was driven by slower placements of high margin equipment, an increase in lower margin service revenue and continued investment in new product development. Operating profit increased 4% in the Capital Services segment due primarily to the decline in interest rates. The following table shows revenue in 2002 and 2001 by source of revenue: (Dollars in millions) 2002 2001 % change Sales $ 1,309 $ 1,304 Business services 1,011 821 23 % Rentals 828 784 6 % Financing 680 677 Support services 582 536 9 % $ 4,410 $ 4,122 7 % Sales revenue remained flat in 2002. Sales growth was adversely affected by the continued slowdown of the global economy which has resulted in moderating customer orders and upgrades at Global Mailing and DMT. Additionally, sales growth was adversely affected by our focus on rentals revenue, which should provide a more stable revenue stream over time. Business services revenue includes revenue from PBMS and PSI. Business Services revenue increased 23% due mainly to the acquisitions of DSI and PSI. Excluding the acquisition, business services revenue grew 3% due to growth in new written business. Revenue growth at PBMS was adversely affected by the continued contraction of large enterprise accounts, especially in the financial services and legal sectors. Rentals revenue increased 6% primarily due to strong placements of our stand alone meters and new digital meters. At December 31, 2002, digital meters represented approximately 58% of our U.S. meter base, up from 50% in 2001 and electronic meters represented approximately 42% of our U.S. meter base. We no longer place mechanical meters, which is in line with USPS guidelines. As previously mentioned, in 2001 we adopted a formal plan to transition to the next generation of networked mailing technology. See Legal and Regulatory Matters. We do not expect this transition to have a material adverse impact on rentals revenue. Financing revenue remained flat. Financing revenue growth was adversely affected by our strategies to reduce our exposure to our Capital Services segment. In total, we financed 52% and 54% of all sales in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Support services revenue increased 9% in 2002. Despite competitive pricing pressures, Global Mailing achieved a strong increase in support services revenue due to a larger population of equipment maintenance agreements and the impact of acquisitions in 2002. DMT had growth in support services revenue due to an increased service contract base and on site contracts. Ongoing support services revenue continues to be partially dependent on equipment sales levels. 17 Table of Contents Costs and Expenses The following table shows cost of sales as a percentage of sales revenue in 2002 and 2001: (Dollars in millions) 2002 2001 % change $ 593 $ 611 (3 )% Percentage of sales revenue 45.3 % 46.8 % Cost of sales, as a percentage of sales revenue, decreased primarily due to a favorable product mix at our U.S. and international mailing businesses including margin improvements from the launch of our DM seriesTM of digital mailing systems. The following table shows cost of business services as a percentage of business services revenue in 2002 and 2001: (Dollars in millions) 2002 2001 % change $ 814 $ 660 23 % Percentage of business services revenue 80.5 % 80.4 % Cost of business services revenue, as a percentage of business services revenue, increased slightly, primarily due to costs associated with acquiring new management services accounts that have not yet generated a full year of revenue. The following table shows cost of rentals as a percentage of rentals revenue in 2002 and 2001: (Dollars in millions) 2002 2001 % change $ 178 $ 151 18 % Percentage of rentals revenue 21.5 % 19.2 % Cost of rentals, as a percentage of rentals revenue, increased compared with 2001, as a result of higher depreciation costs. We expect this ratio to continue to increase in 2003 due to the timing of our customers transition to digital meters. The following table shows cost of financing as a percentage of financing revenue in 2002 and 2001: (Dollars in millions) 2002 2001 % change $ 188 $ 200 (6 )% Percentage of financing revenue 27.7 % 29.6 % Cost of financing, as a percentage of financing revenue, decreased compared with 2001, due primarily to the lower mix of Capital Services revenue. Selling, service and administrative expenses The following table shows selling, service and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2002 and 2001: (Dollars in millions) 2002 2001 % change $ 1,483 $ 1,370 8 % Percentage of total revenue 33.6 % 33.2 % Selling, service and administrative expenses were 33.6% of total revenue in 2002 compared with 33.2% in 2001. The increase in this ratio was primarily due to the higher mix of support services revenue and costs associated with investments in infrastructure and growth initiatives. 18 Table of Contents Research and development expenses The following table shows our research and development expenses in 2002 and 2001: (Dollars in millions) 2002 2001 % change $ 141 $ 133 6 % Research and development expenses increased 6% in 2002 to $141 million, reflecting continued investment in developing new technologies and enhancing features for all our products. The 2002 increase represents expenditures for digital document delivery systems, new digital meters and mailing machines, billing and statement software, distribution and logistics software, advanced inserting equipment and mail sorting equipment. We expect similar levels of investment in research and development in 2003. Net interest expense The following table shows our net interest expense in 2002 and 2001: (Dollars in millions) 2002 2001 % change $ 179 $ 184 (3 )% Net interest expense decreased due to lower average interest rates during 2002 compared with 2001. This decrease was partially offset by higher average borrowings associated with our investment in leasing and rental products, acquisitions, dividends, and our stock repurchase program. Our variable and fixed rate debt mix, after adjusting for the effect of interest rate swaps, was 32% and 68%, respectively, at December 31, 2002. Based on current borrowing levels, a 25 basis point change in interest rates would impact annual interest expense by approximately $3 million to $4 million. Effective tax rate The following table shows the effective tax rate in 2002 and 2001: 2002 2001 29.3 % 32.9 % Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 31.3% in 2002 compared with 31.6% in 2001, reflecting continued tax benefits from leasing and financing activities. The tax rate is also favorably affected by our international expansion and our continued investment in developing new technologies. Our provision for taxes could be affected by tax law changes and interpretations by governments or courts. We expect our effective tax rate to increase as we implement our Capital Services strategy outlined on page 23. Income from continuing operations decreased 15% and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 13% in 2002. Excluding special items in 2002 and 2001, income from continuing operations increased 3% and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 5% in 2002. The increase in diluted earnings per share outperformed the increase in income from continuing operations due to the companys share repurchase program. During the year, we repurchased 7.9 million shares, approximately 3% of the average common and potential common shares outstanding at the end of 2001. Excluding special items in 2002 and 2001, income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue decreased to 13.0% in 2002 from 13.5% in 2001 due primarily to the higher mix of lower margin revenue. Results of Continuing Operations 2001 Compared to 2000 In 2001, revenue increased 6%, income from continuing operations decreased 9% and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 5% to $2.08 compared with $2.18 for 2000. Excluding special items in both periods, income from continuing operations decreased 1% and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 3% to $2.25 compared with $2.17 for 2000. Excluding the acquisitions of Secap, DSI, and MMT, revenue increased 1%. These acquisitions did not materially affect earnings either on a per share or an aggregate basis. Revenue The following table shows revenue in 2001 and 2000 by segment: (Dollars in millions) 2001 2000 % change Global Mailing $ 2,847 $ 2,831 1 % Enterprise Solutions 1,083 862 26 % Total Messaging Solutions 3,930 3,693 6 % Capital Services 192 188 2 % $ 4,122 $ 3,881 6 % 19 Table of Contents Total Messaging Solutions revenue grew 6% over the prior year. The revenue increase came from growth in the Global Mailing and Enterprise Solutions segments of 1% and 26%, respectively, over 2000. Approximately 75% of our total revenue in 2001 is recurring revenue, which we believe is a continuing good indicator of potential repeat business. Excluding the acquisitions of Secap and MMT, Global Mailing revenue decreased 2%. Global Mailing revenue growth, particularly in the U.S. was adversely affected by moderating customer orders and upgrades due to the slow economic environment, especially for shipping and system related products. Within the Global Mailing segment, international mailing revenue grew at a strong pace, fueled by revenue from the recent acquisitions of Secap and MMT plus continued strong demand for mailing products in Europe. However, revenue was also adversely impacted by weaker performance in the U.K. and Canada, as both countries were affected by slowing economic activity and a lull in those countries meter migration programs. Enterprise Solutions revenue growth was driven by a 34% increase at PBMS as a result of higher volume in the core business and the acquisition of DSI. Excluding the acquisition of DSI, Enterprise Solutions revenue grew 11%. DMT revenue increased 5% over the prior year; however, our performance continues to be affected by a worldwide slowdown in capital spending, which has caused many of our customers to delay purchases of higher margin customized inserting systems. Capital Services revenue increased 2% primarily due to higher revenue associated with the strategic financing of equipment for posts around the world. Operating profit The following table shows operating profit in 2001 and 2000: (Dollars in millions) 2001 2000 % change Global Mailing $ 860 $ 844 2 % Enterprise Solutions 77 73 6 % Total Messaging Solutions 937 917 2 % Capital Services 73 65 11 % $ 1,010 $ 982 3 % Operating profit grew 3% over the prior year, which reflected contributions from acquisitions. Operating profit grew 2% in the Global Mailing segment and 6% in the Enterprise Solutions segment. The operating profit growth in the Global Mailing segment came from improved profit margins at Pitney Bowes Small Business Solutions (SBS). Operating profit growth was moderated by the events of September 11, 2001 and the continued slowdown of the economy. This was particularly true for higher volume mail creation and shipping products. The acquisitions of Secap SA and MMT did not materially impact Global Mailing operating profit. The operating profit growth in our Enterprise Solutions segment came from double digit operating profit growth at PBMS. Excluding the acquisition of DSI, Enterprise Solutions operating profit decreased 11%. Enterprise Solutions operating profit was negatively affected by lower operating profit at DMT, due to higher expenses associated with the introduction and marketing of new products and lower placements of higher margin customized production mail equipment as a result of the slowdown in worldwide capital spending. Operating profit increased 11% in the Capital Services segment due primarily to the higher revenue and the previously stated strategic shift to concentrate on fee based income opportunities. The following table shows revenue in 2001 and 2000 by source of revenue: (Dollars in millions) 2001 2000 % change Sales $ 1,304 $ 1,273 3 % Business services 821 610 35 % Rentals 784 834 (6 )% Financing 677 671 1 % Support services 536 493 9 % $ 4,122 $ 3,881 6 % Sales revenue increased 3% in 2001 due mainly to the acquisitions of Secap and MMT. Excluding these acquisitions, sales declined 1%. Sales growth was moderated as a result of the contraction and downsizing of operations of some of our customers resulting in reduced demand for some of our higher value mailing products. The negative impact of foreign currency reduced sales growth by slightly more than 1%. U.S. and U.K. Mailing Systems sales decreased due to softness in the high end shipping and mail creation product lines as the economy and slower customer decision making process for the higher value, more complex products adversely impacted growth. 20 Table of Contents Business services revenue increased 35% in 2001 due mainly to the acquisition of DSI and higher volume in the core business. Excluding this acquisition, revenue grew 13%. Revenue growth was moderated as a result of the contraction and downsizing of operations of some of our customers resulting in reduced demand for some of our outsourcing services. The negative impact of foreign currency reduced services revenue growth by slightly less than 1%. Increases in value added services to both new and existing customers, as part of the companys strategy of pursuing profitable growth, stimulated revenue growth at PBMS. Rental revenue decreased 6% primarily due to the slowing economy and consolidation of facilities by some of our customers, which has resulted in fewer than usual upgrades to our larger systems meters. We continue to experience good placements of our stand alone and new digital meters. At December 31, 2001, electronic meters represented approximately 50% of our U.S. meter base and digital meters represented approximately 50% of our U.S. meter base, up from 44% in 2000. We no longer place mechanical meters, which is in line with USPS guidelines. As previously mentioned, in 2001 we adopted a formal plan to transition to the next generation of networked mailing technology. See Regulatory and Legal Matters. Financing revenue increased 1% driven by higher revenue associated with the strategic financing of equipment for postal authorities around the world. Financing revenue growth was moderated by our strategy to reduce our asset based financing in our Capital Services segment, through asset sales in 2001 and prior years. In total, we financed 54% and 55% of all sales in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Support services revenue increased 9% in 2001. Despite competitive pricing pressures, U.S. and International Mailing had increased support services revenue due to a larger population of extended maintenance contracts, higher chargeable service calls and billed labor hours in 2001 and the acquisition of MMT. DMT had double digit growth in support services revenue due to an increased service contract base and on site contracts. Ongoing support services revenue continues to be partially dependent on equipment sales levels. Costs and Expenses The following table shows cost of sales as a percentage of sales revenue in 2001 and 2000: (Dollars in millions) 2001 2000 % change $ 611 $ 580 5 % Percentage of sales revenue 46.8 % 45.5 % Cost of sales, as a percentage of sales revenue, increased due to unfavorable product mix at our U.S. and international mailing businesses; in particular, our DMT customers delayed purchases of higher margin customized inserting systems. The following table shows cost of business services revenue as a percentage of business services revenue in 2001 and 2000: (Dollars in millions) 2001 2000 % change $ 660 $ 495 33 % Percentage of business services revenue 80.4 % 81.1 % Cost of business services revenue, as a percentage of business services revenue, decreased primarily due to the acquisition of DSI and improved margins from value added services for existing clients. The following table shows cost of rentals as a percentage of rentals revenue in 2001 and 2000: (Dollars in millions) 2001 2000 % change $ 151 $ 177 (15 )% Percentage of rentals revenue 19.2 % 21.2 % Cost of rentals, as a percentage of rentals revenue, improved 2 percentage points, due to lower costs and related depreciation at U.S. Mailing and SBS. The following table shows cost of financing as a percentage of financing revenue in 2001 and 2000: (Dollars in millions) 2001 2000 % change $ 200 $ 196 2 % Percentage of financing revenue 29.6 % 29.2 % Cost of financing, as a percentage of financing revenue, increased .4 percentage points, due to higher costs associated with new business initiatives. 21 Table of Contents Selling, service and administrative expenses The following table shows selling, service and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2001 and 2000: (Dollars in millions) 2001 2000 % change $ 1,370 $ 1,299 5 % Percentage of total revenue 33.2 % 33.5 % Selling, service and administrative expenses were 33.2% of total revenue in 2001 compared with 33.5% in 2000. The improvement in this ratio resulted from continued emphasis on controlling our expenses. The ratio was favorably affected by our successful Enterprise Wide Resource Planning (ERP) initiative and by our restructuring initiatives. The improvement in this ratio was partially offset by costs associated with investments in acquisition and growth initiatives and the higher mix of support services revenue. Research and development expenses The following table shows our research and development expenses in 2001 and 2000: (Dollars in millions) 2001 2000 % change $ 133 $ 120 10 % Research and development expenses increased 10% in 2001 to $133 million reflecting continued investment in developing new technologies and enhancing features for all our products. The 2001 increase represents expenditures for digital document delivery systems, new digital meters and mailing machines, personal computer metering technology, advanced inserting equipment, and new and advanced features for production mail equipment and high volume incoming mail sorting equipment. Net interest expense The following table shows our net interest expense in 2001 and 2000: (Dollars in millions) 2001 2000 % change $ 184 $ 192 (4 )% Net interest expense decreased due to lower average interest rates during 2001 compared to 2000 associated with borrowings to fund the companys investment in leasing and rental products, acquisitions, dividends and our stock repurchase program. Our variable and fixed rate debt mix, after adjusting for the effect of interest rate swaps, was 42% and 58%, respectively, at December 31, 2001. Based on current borrowing levels, a 25 basis point change in interest rates would affect annual interest expense by approximately $3 million to $4 million. Effective tax rate The following table shows the effective tax rate in 2001 and 2000: 2001 2000 32.9 % 29.9 % Excluding the impact of special items in 2001, the effective tax rate was 31.6% in 2001 compared to 31.4% in 2000, reflecting continued tax benefits from leasing and financing activities. The tax rate was favorably affected by leasing investments and international expansion. The companys provision for taxes could be affected by tax law changes and interpretations by governments or courts. Income from continuing operations decreased 9% and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 5% in 2001. Excluding special items in both periods, income from continuing operations decreased 1% and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 3% in 2001. The increase in diluted earnings per share outperformed the decrease in income from continuing operations due to the companys share repurchase program, under which 7.8 million shares, approximately 3% of the average common and potential common shares outstanding at the end of 2000, were repurchased in 2001. Excluding special items in both periods, income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue decreased to 13.5% in 2001 from 14.5% in 2000 due primarily to the higher mix of lower margin revenue. 22 Table of Contents Capital Services Capital Services strategy In 2002, we took a number of strategic actions to transition our Capital Services business and reduce our overall exposure to long term external financing assets. First, we liquidated about $225 million of financing assets primarily related to assets held for sale. Second, we began a strategic analysis of our existing portfolio to develop the best disposition strategy. Finally, we decided to stop active pursuit of, and growth in, long term Capital Services financing transactions, including long term postal financing. We will continue to provide lease financing for our products through our internal financing operations. We believe that these actions will further position us for growth and maintain our financial flexibility. As a result of these actions and the Capital Services charges discussed below, we estimate a reduction in 2003 earnings of approximately 6 cents per diluted share. Additionally, the higher tax rate expected from lower Capital Services investments is estimated to reduce earnings by an incremental 2 to 3 cents per diluted share in 2003. Capital Services charges In 2002, we recorded a non cash pre tax charge of approximately $213 million, to write down our investments in commercial passenger aircraft leases primarily with US Airways and United and to increase our provision for credit losses primarily related to aircraft leasing investments in the U.S. See page 14 for a further breakdown of this charge. Investment in commercial passenger and cargo aircraft leasing transactions At December 31, 2002, our net investment in commercial passenger and cargo aircraft leasing transactions was $344.4 million, which is composed of transactions with U.S. and foreign airlines of $62.0 million and $282.4 million, respectively. This portfolio is diversified across 13 airlines and 30 aircraft and is financed through investments in leveraged lease transactions, direct financing lease transactions and through our equity investment in PBG Capital Partners LLC (PBG). Risk of loss under these transactions is primarily related to: (1) the inability of the airline to make underlying lease payments; (2) our inability to generate sufficient cash flows either through the sale of the aircraft or secondary lease transactions to recover our net investment; and or (3) in the case of the leveraged lease portfolio, the absence of an equity defeasance or other third party credit arrangements. Approximately 35% of our remaining net investment in commercial passenger and cargo aircraft leasing investments is further secured by approximately $120 million of equity defeasance accounts or third party credit arrangements. 23 Table of Contents At December 31, 2002, our net investment in commercial passenger and cargo aircraft leasing transactions was composed of the following: Aircraft Net investment before charges Write down of lease receivables and residuals Additional credit loss reserves Net investment Airline U.S. United and subsidiary 5 $ 71,705 $ (53,977 ) (A) $ $ 17,728 US Airways 50,705 (50,705 ) (B) Delta 5 48,571 (5,000 ) (C) 43,571 America West 1 23,138 23,138 American 6 22,977 22,977 Southwest 2 11,673 11,673 Northwest 1 3,854 3,854 Alaska 1 1,087 1,087 Federal Express 1 19,965 19,965 Credit loss reserves (82,000 ) (82,000 ) 22 253,675 (109,682 ) (82,000 ) 61,993 Foreign KLM 2 107,519 107,519 Qantas 2 74,311 74,311 Japan 2 45,181 45,181 Air France 1 33,138 33,138 Lufthansa 1 22,295 22,295 8 282,444 282,444 30 $ 536,119 $ (109,682 ) $ (82,000 ) $ 344,437 (A) Our investment in commercial passenger aircraft leasing transactions with United included four aircraft leased to United and one aircraft leased to a wholly owned regional carrier subsidiary of United, for a total investment of approximately $72 million. In December 2002, United filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. We are currently in discussions with United as to whether we will continue leasing these aircraft to them post bankruptcy at reduced lease rates. Based on the expected outcome of these negotiations and the continued deterioration of the U.S. airline industry, we recorded a charge of approximately $54 million to write down lease receivables and residuals to reflect the estimated cumulative loss of future cash flows over the next nine years. (B) Prior to these charges and an exchange transaction as discussed below, our investment in commercial passenger aircraft leasing transactions with US Airways included four aircraft for a total investment of approximately $60 million. In August 2002, US Airways filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. To eliminate our exposure to US Airways, in December 2002, we exchanged the four aircraft leased to US Airways, which were then valued at approximately $9 million and paid approximately $11 million in cash for a leased aircraft operated by Federal Express. We recorded a charge of approximately $51 million as a result of this transaction (C) We recorded a charge of approximately $5 million to write down lease residuals on leases with Delta Airlines based on an assessment of the underlying leases and aircraft. The write down of lease receivables and residuals of $110 million and additional credit loss reserves of $82 million include $31 million and $70 million, respectively, related to aircraft financed through our equity investment in PBG. 24 Table of Contents Capital Services portfolio Our investment in Capital Services lease related assets included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was composed of the following: December 31 2002 2001 (Dollars in millions) Leveraged leases $ 1,560 $ 1,337 Finance receivables 683 1,149 Other assets 61 166 Rental equipment 20 23 Total $ 2,324 $ 2,675 Our investment in leveraged lease assets consists of the following: December 31 2002 2001 (Dollars in millions) Rental receivables $ 8,695 $ 7,762 Residual value 690 708 Principal and interest on nonrecourse loans (6,854 ) (6,224 ) Unearned income (971 ) (909 ) Total leveraged leases $ 1,560 $ 1,337 The $1.6 billion is the amount that is on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Rental receivables represent total lease payments from our customers over the remaining term of the leveraged leases. Residual value represents the value of the property anticipated at the end of the leveraged lease terms and is based on independent appraisals. We regularly review the recorded residual value to ensure it is appropriate. Principal and interest on nonrecourse loans represent amounts due to unrelated third parties from our customers over the remaining term of the leveraged leases. The nonrecourse loans are secured by the lessees rental obligations and the leased property. If a lessee defaults and if the amounts realized from the sale of these assets are insufficient, we have no obligation to make any payments due on these nonrecourse loans to the unrelated third parties. Accordingly, we are required by generally accepted accounting principles to subtract the principal and interest over the remaining term of the nonrecourse loans from our rental receivables and residual value. At December 31, 2002, the principal balances on the nonrecourse loans totaled $3.6 billion and the related interest payments over the remaining terms of the leases totaled $3.3 billion. Unearned income represents our future financing income that will be earned over the remaining term of the leases. The $1.6 billion investment in leveraged leases on our Consolidated Balance Sheet is diversified across the following types of assets: $340.1 million related to commercial real estate facilities, with original lease terms ranging from 17 to 25 years. $307.1 million for postal equipment with international postal authorities, with original lease terms ranging from 16 to 24 years. $303.1 million related to locomotives and railcars, with original lease terms ranging from 20 to 40 years. $302.4 million related to nine commercial passenger and cargo aircraft, with original lease terms ranging from 23 to 25 years. $132.5 million for telecommunications equipment, with original lease terms ranging from 14 to 16 years. $131.3 million for rail and bus facilities with original lease terms ranging from 27 to 37 years. $43.4 million for shipping and handling equipment with an original lease term of 24 years. Our leveraged lease investment in telecommunications equipment represents leases to three highly rated international telecommunication entities. Approximately 86 percent of this portfolio is further secured by equity defeasance accounts or other third party credit arrangements. Additionally, our leveraged lease investment in commercial real estate facilities includes approximately $84 million related to leases of corporate facilities to four U.S. telecommunication entities, of which $69 million is with lessees that are highly rated. In addition, as part of our Capital Services charges discussed on page 23, we increased our provision for credit losses related to our investment in the telecommunications industry. Overall, approximately 48 percent of our $1.6 billion leveraged lease portfolio is further secured by equity defeasance accounts or other third party credit arrangements. In addition, approximately 17 percent of the remaining leveraged lease portfolio represents leases to highly rated government related organizations which have guarantees or supplemental credit enhancements upon the occurrence of certain events. 25 Table of Contents Finance receivables are composed of the following: (Dollars in millions) December 31 2002 2001 Assets held for sale $ 195 $ 376 Single investor leases: Large ticket single investor leases 256 538 Imagistics lease portfolio 232 235 Total $ 683 $ 1,149 We expect to phase out our assets held for sale portfolio by the end of 2003. Our Consolidated Statements of Income includes financing revenue of $32.6 million and $33.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, attributable to our assets held for sale portfolio. Other assets represent our 50% equity interest in PBG. See Off Balance Sheet Items for a further discussion of our equity interest in PBG. Our net investment in PBG was reduced by a write down of aircraft lease receivables of approximately $31 million and additional provisions for credit losses of approximately $70 million related to aircraft lease investments in the U.S. See Capital Services charges. Off Balance Sheet Items Finance receivables sales As part of our Capital Services programs, we have, from time to time sold, through securitizations, net finance receivables with limited recourse. In these transactions, we have surrendered control over the transferred assets in accordance with paragraph 9 of FAS No. 140 and received a cash payment from the transferee. Specifically, the finance receivables were sold to a bankruptcy remote limited liability company. At the time of sale, we obtained legal counsels opinion that the assets were isolated and that the sale qualified as a true sale at law. Under the terms of the sale, the transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the assets it received. There are no conditions that both constrain the transferee from taking advantage of its right to pledge or exchange and provide more than a trivial benefit to the transferor. We do not maintain effective control over the transferred assets. We have accounted for these transactions as a sale recognizing assets obtained and liabilities incurred in consideration as proceeds of the sale. Any resulting gain or loss was recognized in income at the time of sale. The maximum risk of loss in these transactions arises from the possible non performance of lessees to meet the terms of their contracts. We believe adequate provisions for losses have been established for receivables sold which may become uncollectible and for which we have recourse obligation, in accordance with paragraph 113 of FAS No. 140. In selective cases, when we have sold net finance receivables, we entered into guarantee contracts with varying amounts of recourse in privately placed transactions with unrelated third party investors. The uncollected principal balance of receivables sold and guarantee contracts totaled $183.0 million and $181.2 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we do not record these amounts as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our maximum risk of loss on these net finance receivables and guarantee contracts arises from the possible non performance of lessees to meet the terms of their contracts and from changes in the value of the underlying equipment. These contracts are secured by the underlying equipment value, and supported by the creditworthiness of our customers. At December 31, 2002, the underlying equipment value exceeded the sum of the uncollected principal balance of receivables sold and the guarantee contracts. As part of our review of our risk exposure, we believe we have made adequate provision for sold receivables and guarantee contracts which may not be collectible. See Notes 18, 20 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements. We do not depend on these types of transactions to fund our leasing investments. We selectively use these transactions when the overall economic impact on us is more favorable than debt. Equity interest During 1997, we formed PBG with GATX Corporation (GATX) for the purpose of financing and managing certain leasing related assets existing at that time. We contributed assets to PBG and maintain a 50% interest. We account for our investment in PBG under the equity method. Our maximum exposure is our investment of $61 million on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2002. PBGs total assets and liabilities at December 31, 2002 are $379 million and $239 million, respectively. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we do not record these assets and liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. 26 Table of Contents State and local government financing We have originated tax exempt secured loans to state and local governments and have sold certificates of interest in these loans. Generally, we recognize revenue for the fees we receive upon the sale of these certificates. These transactions however, may require us to buy back certificates if interest rates rise significantly. Our maximum risk of loss arises because we may be required to buy back certificates and resell them to other third parties at below our cost. We have structured these transactions so that even in a rising interest rate environment, our losses would be minimal. We have further minimized any risk of non performance on the state and local government loans by obtaining credit guarantees of these loans from a highly rated nationally recognized insurance company. Certificates outstanding at December 31, 2002 and 2001 were $216.8 million and $263.7 million, respectively, which represent our maximum exposure to state and local government financing. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we do not record these certificates as assets or liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our potential requirement to buy back certificates is based on movements of the Bond Market Association (BMA) Municipal Index. Our weighted average coupon rate on the underlying secured loans is approximately 4.96%. The current market rate per the BMA Index is 1.08% on January 3, 2003. We pay a premium over the BMA Index in the range of 25 to 40 basis points. We would be required to buy back certificates if rates rise by approximately 350 basis points. We have periodically entered into a fixed rate contract with investors whereby we lock in a fixed rate for a fixed period, generally 13 months. This insulates our interest rate risk for that set period of time. We recognized net pre tax gains/(losses) after expenses of $2.5 million, $8.1 million and $(.7) million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Restructuring Charges In January 2003, we announced that we will undertake restructuring initiatives related to realigned infrastructure requirements and reduced manufacturing needs for digital equipment. We expect that the pre tax cost of these restructuring initiatives will be about $160 million over a two year period as the various initiatives take effect. In 2001, we adopted a formal restructuring plan to implement a common, streamlined business infrastructure across the corporation as a result of our decisions to spin off our office systems business and align our mailing business on a global basis, as well as cost saving opportunities resulting from strategic acquisitions and partnerships, and additional benefits attained from the consolidation of our IT organization and ERP initiatives. In connection with this plan, we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $149.3 million in 2001, of which $116.1 million was related to continuing operations and the remaining $33.2 million was related to discontinued operations. The restructuring charges related to continuing operations have been segregated in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2001. The restructuring charges related to discontinued operations have been reported in discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2001. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. The restructuring charges related to continuing operations are composed of: (Dollars in millions) Year ended December 31, 2001 Severance and benefit costs $ 74.3 Asset impairments 28.0 Other exit costs 13.8 $ 116.1 All restructuring charges, except for the asset impairments, will result in cash outflows. The severance and benefit costs relate to a reduction in workforce of approximately 1,500 employees worldwide which was initiated in 2001 and was substantially completed at December 31, 2002. The workforce reductions relate to actions across several of our businesses resulting from infrastructure and process improvements and our continuing efforts to streamline operations, and include managerial, professional, clerical and technical roles. Approximately 80% of our workforce reductions are in the U.S. The majority of the international workforce reductions are in Europe. None of the reductions will impact our sales coverage. At December 31, 2002, 1,529 employees were separated under these initiatives and approximately $73.6 million of severance and benefit costs were paid. Asset impairments relate primarily to the disposal or abandonment of certain hardware and software applications, resulting from the alignment of our mailing business on a global basis and ERP initiatives. Other exit costs relate primarily to lease termination costs, non cancelable lease payments, and other costs associated with business activities that have been exited and the consolidation of excess facilities. 27 Table of Contents The restructuring charges related to discontinued operations are composed of: (Dollars in millions) Year ended December 31, 2001 Severance and benefit costs $ 1.9 Asset impairments 17.5 Other exit costs 13.8 $ 33.2 The severance and benefit costs relate to a reduction in workforce of approximately 25 employees. The asset impairments relate primarily to an impairment of residual values, in connection with leases of copier equipment, and the write down of certain facsimile and copier equipment, resulting from the spin off of our office systems business. Other exit costs relate primarily to incremental costs associated with cancellation and separation of facility occupancy leases that are shared between the company and IGI. Accrued restructuring charges at December 31, 2002 consist of the following: (Dollars in millions) Total restructuring charges 2001 Cash payments 2001 Non cash charges Ending balance at December 31, 2001 2002 Cash payments Ending balance at December 31, 2002 Severance and benefit costs $ 76.2 $ 34.5 $ $ 41.7 $ 40.6 $ 1.1 Asset impairments 45.5 45.5 Other exit costs 27.6 14.5 13.1 8.5 4.6 $ 149.3 $ 49.0 $ 45.5 $ 54.8 $ 49.1 $ 5.7 This restructuring plan was substantially completed at December 31, 2002. The restructuring charges are expected to continue to increase our operating efficiency and effectiveness in 2003 and beyond while enhancing growth, primarily as a result of reduced personnel related expenses. We achieved pre tax savings in operating expenses of approximately $50 million in 2002 from these restructuring initiatives. In 2000, we recorded a pre tax charge of approximately $19 million related to the consolidation of information technology staff and infrastructure. This initiative was focused on creating an efficient global organization and technology platform to leverage the benefits of our ERP and e business initiatives. The majority of the initiatives and cash outflows relating to this consolidation were completed by December 31, 2001. Meter Transition In 2001, we adopted a formal plan to transition to the next generation of networked mailing technology. The information capture and exchange, made possible by advanced technology, turns the postage meter into an intelligent terminal that networks the mailer to postal and carrier information and systems. This two way information architecture, in turn, enables convenient access to and delivery of value added services such as tracking, delivery confirmation and rate information. The adoption of this plan was facilitated by our expanded access to technology and our ability to move to networked products combined with our expectations that the U.S. and postal services around the world will continue to encourage the migration of mailing systems to networked digital technologies. As a result of this plan, certain electronic meter rental assets and related equipment will not be placed back in service. In addition, certain leased equipment will either not be remarketed or will result in lower realization at end of lease as a result of the introduction of new technology. In connection with this plan, we recorded non cash pre tax charges of $268.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, related to assets associated with our non networked mailing technology. In November 2001, postal regulations were issued, consistent with our meter transition plan, defining the meter migration process and timing. See Legal and Regulatory Matters. The charges related to the meter transition plan are composed of: (Dollars in millions) Year ended December 31, 2001 Impairment of lease residual values $ 128.4 Impairment of meter rental assets 71.3 Inventory writedowns 27.6 Additional depreciation costs on meter rental assets 41.0 $ 268.3 28 Table of Contents Acquisitions In August 2002, we acquired PSI Group, Inc. (PSI) for approximately $127 million in cash and $39 million in debt assumed. PSI, the nations largest mail presort company, prepares, sorts and aggregates mail to earn postal discounts and expedite delivery for its customers. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. In October 2001, we acquired Secap SA, for approximately Euros 220 million ($206 million) in cash. Secap offers a range of mail processing and paper handling equipment, supplies and technology for low to mid volume mailers. Secap holds more than 30% of the postage meter market share in France. In June 2001, we acquired DSI. The final purchase price, following post closing adjustments, was $285.5 million in cash. DSI provides on and off site document management services, including the management of central reprographic departments, the placement and maintenance of photocopiers, print on demand operations and document archiving and retrieval services. In June 2001, we acquired the MMT business in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. The final purchase price, following post closing adjustments, was $44 million in cash. MMT markets and services high end mail processing, sorting and service related products through a network of distributors and direct operations. We accounted for the acquisitions of PSI, Secap, DSI and MMT under the purchase method and accordingly, the operating results of these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. The acquisitions of PSI, Secap, DSI and MMT did not materially affect income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. During 2002 and 2001, we also completed several smaller acquisitions including the remaining 43% ownership interest of MailCode Inc. in 2002, the acquisition of Alysis Technologies Inc. in 2001, a leading provider of digital document delivery solutions, the acquisition of some of our international dealerships and acquisitions of presort businesses. The cost of these acquisitions was in the aggregate less than $50 million in each year. These acquisitions did not have a material impact on our financial results either individually or on an aggregate basis. Accounting Changes In 1998, FAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, amended in 2000 by FAS No. 138, was issued. FAS No. 133 requires that an entity recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value. Changes in the fair value of those instruments will be reflected as gains or losses. The accounting for the gains or losses depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. The company adopted the provisions of FAS No. 133 in the first quarter of 2001. The company uses derivatives to reduce the volatility in earnings and cash flows associated with the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations due to its investing and funding activities and its operations in different foreign currencies. Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges include primarily foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps related to variable rate debt. Derivatives designated as fair value hedges include primarily interest rate swaps related to fixed rate debt. The adoption of FAS No. 133 has resulted in an after tax reduction to accumulated other comprehensive income of $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, including a one time cumulative effect of accounting change which reduced accumulated other comprehensive income by approximately $9.2 million in the first quarter of 2001. The adoption of FAS No. 133 has also affected assets and liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, summarizing certain guidance in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements. The company adopted the provisions of SAB No. 101 in the fourth quarter of 2000, retroactive to January 1, 2000. The adoption of SAB No. 101 resulted in a one time cumulative after tax reduction in net income of $4.7 million (net of taxes of approximately $3.1 million) in the first quarter of 2000. The reduction to net income was primarily attributable to the deferral of sales recognition of software enabled mail creation equipment and shipping products prior to installation. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. In 2000, FAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities was issued, replacing FAS No. 125, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. FAS No. 140 revises the standards for accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral, as well as requiring certain additional disclosures. However, it carries over most of the provisions contained in FAS No. 125. FAS No. 140 is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities occurring after March 31, 2001. However, it was effective for the recognition and reclassification of collateral and for disclosures relating to those transactions for the year ended December 31, 2000. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company. In July 2001, FAS No. 141, Business Combinations and FAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets were issued requiring business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and refining the criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill. Recorded goodwill and intangibles are evaluated against this new criterion and result in certain intangibles being included in goodwill, or alternatively, amounts initially recorded as goodwill 29 Table of Contents may be separately identified and recognized apart from goodwill. FAS No. 142 requires the use of a nonamortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles. Under a nonamortization approach, goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are not amortized into results of operations, but instead are reviewed for impairment and charged against results of operations only in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles is more than its fair value. The company has adopted the provisions of each statement, which apply to business combinations completed after June 30, 2001. The adoption of these accounting standards did not materially impact results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2001. The provisions of each statement, which apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to June 30, 2001 were adopted by the company on January 1, 2002. The adoption of these standards reduced the amortization of intangible assets commencing January 1, 2002 by approximately 2 cents per diluted share. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or as circumstances warrant. In August 2001, FAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations was issued, amending FAS No. 19, Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies, and applies to all entities. FAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. FAS No. 143 is effective January 1, 2003 for the company. We do not expect this statement to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In August 2001, FAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, was issued, replacing FAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, and portions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion 30, Reporting the Results of Operations. FAS No. 144 provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of and changes the criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as held for sale. FAS No. 144 retains the requirement of APB Opinion 30, to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations and extends that reporting to separate components of an entity. FAS No. 144 is effective January 1, 2002 for the company. The adoption of this statement did not materially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In September 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on Issue 01 10, Accounting for the Impact of the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001. EITF 01 10 provides guidance for accounting for the effects of the events of September 11, 2001 in financial statements. The company believes it is in compliance with this consensus in all material respects. In April 2002, FAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Correction, was issued. Under FAS No. 145, gains and losses related to the extinguishment of debt should no longer be segregated on the income statement as extraordinary items. Instead, such gains and losses should be included as a component of income from continuing operations. The provisions of FAS No. 145 are effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002 with early adoption encouraged. We do not believe that this statement will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In July 2002, FAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, was issued. This statement nullifies EITF No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). FAS No. 146 requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. The provisions of FAS No. 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. Early adoption is encouraged. We are currently evaluating the impact of this statement. In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN No. 45 clarifies the requirements of FAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to a guarantors accounting for and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. FIN No. 45 elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees, including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit. It also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee, the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value, or market value, of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements. The provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantors obligations does not apply to product warranties or to guarantees accounted for as derivatives. The recognition provisions of FIN No. 45 are effective for the company beginning January 1, 2003. We do not believe that this interpretation will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. In December 2002, FAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, which amends FAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, was issued. FAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and requires more prominent and more frequent disclosures in the financial statements of the effects of stock based compensation. The provisions of FAS No. 148 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. 30 Table of Contents In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FIN No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN No. 46 requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. The consolidation requirements of FIN No. 46 apply immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. The consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. Certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, regardless of when the variable interest entity was established. We are currently evaluating the provisions of FIN No. 46 including the impact, if any, on our equity investment in PBG. We do not believe that the adoption of these provisions will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities declined to .76 to 1 at December 31, 2002 compared with .83 to 1 at December 31, 2001. The decrease in this ratio was primarily due to the substitution of long term debt for short term. To manage interest rate risk, we use a balanced mix of debt maturities, variable and fixed rate debt and interest rate swap agreements. In 2002, we received $95 million in cash associated with the termination of four swap agreements. As a result of these transactions, our fixed to floating percentages increased to 68% and 32%, respectively at December 31, 2002 compared to 60% and 40%, respectively at December 31, 2001. Our cash and cash equivalents increased to $315.2 million at December 31, 2002 from $231.6 million at December 31, 2001. The increase resulted primarily from $502.6 million provided by operating activities, offset in part by $300.9 million and $122.8 million used in investing and financing activities, respectively. Net cash of $502.6 million provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net income adjusted for non cash items, and the increase in deferred taxes on income, partially offset by our pension plan investment of $338.6 million, changes in working capital and our investment in internal finance receivables. Net cash used in working capital resulted primarily from increases in inventory to support new product introductions. Net cash of $300.9 million used in investing activities consisted primarily of acquisitions, investments in fixed assets and leveraged leases, partially offset by Capital Services asset sales and reserve account deposits. Net cash of $122.8 million used in financing activities consisted primarily of stock repurchases, dividends paid to stockholders and payments on long term obligations partially offset by net proceeds from long term obligations. In 2002, we made year end contributions of approximately $305 million and $34 million to our U.S. and U.K. pension plans, respectively. We expect these additional investments to significantly offset the impact of changes to actuarial assumptions and loss experience. Based on historical results and future projections, we concluded that a reduction to the long term return on asset assumption to 8.50% in 2003 was warranted. Additionally, we have lowered the discount rate to 6.75% and adopted a new mortality table. We expect that 2003 incremental pension costs attributable to these assumption changes, net of the impact of the pension plan contributions, will be approximately 2 cents per diluted share. Excluding special items and discontinued operations in both periods, the ratio of EBIT to interest was 5.6x and 5.4x and the ratio of EBITDA to interest was 7.1x and 6.7x for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The ratio of total debt to total debt and stockholders equity was 82.3% at December 31, 2002, versus 79.7% at December 31, 2001. Including the preferred stockholders equity in a subsidiary company as debt, the ratio of total debt to total debt and stockholders equity was 83.4% at December 31, 2002 compared to 81.0% at December 31, 2001. The increase in this ratio was driven primarily by debt related to acquisitions and the $300 million repurchase of 7.9 million shares of common stock. We generated $277.7 million of free cash flow (defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures) which partially offset the increase in this ratio. Excluding the cash flow impacts of the pension plan investment and payments related primarily to restructuring initiatives, free cash flow was $682.0 million in 2002. See reconciliation below. In 2000, we sold our PitneyWorksSM Business RewardsSM Visa and Business Visa card operations, including credit card receivables of approximately $322 million, to US Bank, a division of US Bancorp. The proceeds from the sale were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper, financing acquisitions and the repurchase of company stock. The sale included standard representations and warranties with regard to the underlying assets and also included an indemnification provision whereby we would potentially reimburse US Bank if credit losses in the portfolio exceeded agreed upon levels. In 2001, we terminated a related co branded credit card program arrangement with US Bank that the parties entered into at the time of the sale of the portfolio. As part of that termination, we were relieved of any on going liability for indemnification for credit losses. As a result, we have no ongoing liability to US Bancorp related to credit losses in the portfolio or any contingent liability related to the sale, and hence, there is no future impact on our liquidity or capital resources. In November 2002, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of our common stock over the next 12 to 24 months. 31 Table of Contents The following table reconciles GAAP net cash provided by operating activities to proforma free cash flow from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively: (Dollars in thousands) 2002 2001 2000 GAAP net cash provided by operating activities, as reported $ 502,559 $ 1,035,887 $ 872,244 Net investment in fixed assets (224,834 ) (256,204 ) (268,577 ) Free cash flow 277,725 779,683 603,667 Pension plan investment 338,579 30,000 Payments related to special items: Restructuring charges 49,032 49,065 Legal settlements, net 11,856 (243,391 ) Spin off of Imagistics, Inc. 4,772 31,253 (32,886 ) Proforma free cash flow from continuing operations $ 681,964 $ 646,610 $ 570,781 Financings and Capitalization On December 31, 2002, $1.4 billion remained available under the shelf registration statement filed in October 2001 with the SEC, permitting issuances of up to $2 billion in debt securities, preferred stock and depositary shares. In September 2002, we issued $400 million of unsecured fixed rate notes maturing in October 2012. These notes bear interest at an annual rate of 4.625% and pay interest semi annually beginning April 2003. The proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper in anticipation of 2003 debt maturities. In February 2002, we completed an offering of Euros 250 million of senior unsecured notes. These notes bear interest at a floating rate of EURIBOR plus 20 basis points, set two Euro business days preceding the quarterly interest payment dates and mature in August 2003. The notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and have been designated as a hedge of Euro denominated assets held by the company. The proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes including repaying commercial paper, financing acquisitions and the repurchase of company stock. In August 2001, we issued $350 million of unsecured fixed rate notes maturing in August 2008. These notes bear interest at an annual rate of 5.75% and pay interest semi annually beginning February 15, 2002. The proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper. In July 2001, we issued four non recourse promissory notes totaling $111.5 million in connection with four lease transactions. The promissory notes are all due in monthly installments over 194 months at an interest rate of 7.24%. In September 2001, we sold our interest in two of the lease transactions and transferred the obligation on two of the non recourse promissory notes totaling $55.3 million in principal balance. In December 2002, we sold our interest in one of the leasing transactions and transferred the obligation on one non recourse promissory note outstanding at December 31, 2001 with a total principal balance of $25.6 million. In April 2001, we issued the remaining $300 million of notes available under a prior shelf registration, permitting issuances of up to $500 million in debt securities (including medium term notes) with a minimum maturity of nine months. These unsecured notes bear annual interest at 5.875% and mature in May 2006. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper, financing acquisitions and the repurchase of company stock. In December 2000, we issued $100 million of unsecured floating rate notes maturing in April 2002 and $100 million of unsecured floating rate notes maturing June 2004, available under the medium term note program. These notes bear interest at floating rates of LIBOR plus five basis points and 25 basis points, respectively, set as of the quarterly interest payment dates. The proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper. In March 2000, we issued $43.3 million senior notes maturing 2002 through 2012. The proceeds from these notes which have an interest rate of 7.515% were used to pay down commercial paper. In April 2000, we issued a total of $134 million of secured floating rate senior notes. The notes mature in 2003 and bear interest at 7.443%. The proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of short term debt. At December 31, 2002, we had unused lines of credit and revolving credit facilities of $1.5 billion in the U.S. and $14.6 million outside the U.S., largely supporting commercial paper debt. 32 Table of Contents We believe our financing needs for the next 12 months can be met with cash generated internally, money from existing credit agreements, debt issued under new and existing shelf registration statements and existing commercial and medium term note programs. Information on debt maturities is presented in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. In February 2003, we sold 6.45% Preferred Stock in a subsidiary of Pitney Bowes Credit Corporation to an outside institutional investor for approximately A$191 million ($110 million). As part of this transaction, we agreed to repurchase the stock in 10 years. Additionally, we entered into a cross currency interest rate swap with the same institutional investor, effectively converting the obligation to a $110 million note that bears interest at a floating rate of approximately LIBOR minus 50 basis points. This note will be recorded as long term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The proceeds from this transaction will be used for general corporate purposes which may include repaying commercial paper, financing acquisitions and the repurchase of company stock. Total financial services assets decreased to $6.2 billion at December 31, 2002, down 4.2% from $6.4 billion in 2001. To fund finance assets, borrowings were $3.0 billion in 2002 and $3.2 billion in 2001. Approximately $596 million and $419 million in cash was generated from the sale of finance assets in 2002 and 2001, respectively. We used the proceeds to pay down debt, repurchase shares and fund new business investments, and invest in our pension plans. The following summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2002, and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods: (Dollars in millions) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years After 3 years Commercial paper borrowings $ 860 $ 860 $ $ Long term debt and current portion of long term debt 3,102 785 1,068 1,249 Non cancelable capital lease obligations 8 4 4 Non cancelable operating lease obligations 298 74 168 56 $ 4,268 $ 1,723 $ 1,240 $ 1,305 Capital Investment During 2002, net investments in fixed assets included net additions of $154 million to property, plant and equipment and $71 million of rental equipment and related inventories, compared with $132 million and $124 million, respectively, in 2001. These additions included expenditures for normal plant and manufacturing equipment. In the case of rental equipment, the additions included the production of postage meters and the purchase of facsimile and copier equipment related to the discontinued operations of IGI in 2001. Excluding IGI, during 2001, net additions to property, plant and equipment were $119 million and rental equipment was $68 million. We expect net investments in fixed assets in 2003, relating to continuing operations, to be slightly higher than the prior year. These investments will also be affected by the timing of our customers transition to digital meters. At December 31, 2002, commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment reflected plant and manufacturing equipment improvements as well as rental equipment for new and replacement programs. Legal and Regulatory Matters Legal In the ordinary course of normal business, we are routinely defendants in or parties to a number of pending and threatened legal actions including proceedings purportedly brought on behalf of classes of claimants. These may involve litigation by or against us relating to, among other things: contractual rights under vendor, insurance or other contracts intellectual property or patent rights equipment, service, payment or other disputes with customers disputes with employees In those cases where we are the defendants, plaintiffs may seek to recover large and sometimes unspecified amounts of damages or other types of relief and some matters may remain unresolved for several years. Although we cannot predict the outcome of such matters, based on current knowledge, management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of the litigations referred to in this section will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, if the plaintiffs do prevail, the result may have a material effect on our financial position, future results of operations or cash flows. See Legal Settlements, net in Special Items. 33 Table of Contents USPS meter transition In 2000, the USPS issued a schedule for the phaseout of manually reset electronic meters in the U.S. as follows: As of February 1, 2000, new placements of manually reset electronic meters were no longer permitted. The current users of manually reset electronic meters could continue to use these meters for the term of their rental and lease agreements. Leases or rentals due to expire in 2000 could be extended to December 31, 2001. On November 15, 2001, the USPS issued a rule as follows: New placements of non digital meters without the timeout feature that enables the meters to be automatically disabled, if not reset within a specified time period are no longer permitted after December 31, 2002. These meters must be off the market by December 31, 2006. New placements of non digital meters with a timeout feature are no longer permitted after June 30, 2004. These meters must be off the market by December 31, 2008. We adopted a formal plan in the second quarter of 2001 to transition to the next generation of networked mailing technology. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. USPS Information Based Indicia Program (IBIP) In May 1995, the USPS publicly announced its concept of its IBIP for future postage evidencing devices. As initially stated by the USPS, the purpose of the program was to develop a new standard for future digital postage evidencing devices which would significantly enhance postal revenue security and support expanded USPS value added services to mailers. The program would consist of the development of four separate specifications: (i) the Indicium specification; (ii) a Postal Security Device specification; (iii) a Host specification; and (iv) a Vendor Infrastructure specification. During the period from May 1995 through December 31, 2002, we submitted extensive comments to a series of proposed IBIP specifications issued by the USPS, including comments on the IBI Performance Criteria. Other regulatory matters In June 2002, we received an examination report from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) showing proposed income tax adjustments for the 1992 to 1994 tax years. The total additional tax proposed by the IRS for the 1992 through 1994 tax years is about $24 million. In August 2002, we filed a protest with the IRS to challenge most of the proposed deficiencies asserted by the IRS. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to those deficiencies and that the ultimate outcome will not result in a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. However, if the IRS prevails on its asserted deficiencies, additional tax may be due for 1995 and future tax years, which could materially affect our future results of operations, financial position or cash flows. At any time, our provision for taxes could be affected by changes in tax law and interpretations by governments or courts. In June 1999, we were served with a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the U.S. Justice Departments Antitrust Division. A CID is a tool used by the Antitrust Division for gathering information and documents. The company believes that the Justice Department may have been reviewing the companys efforts to protect its intellectual property rights. We believe we have complied fully with the antitrust laws and cooperated fully with the departments investigation. In February 2002, the Justice Department advised us that it has decided to close this investigation with no further action. Effects of Inflation and Foreign Exchange Inflation, although moderate in recent years, continues to affect worldwide economies and the way companies operate. It increases labor costs and operating expenses, and raises costs associated with replacement of fixed assets such as rental equipment. Despite these growing costs and the USPS meter migration initiatives, we have generally been able to maintain profit margins through productivity and efficiency improvements, continual review of both manufacturing capacity and operating expense levels, and, to an extent, price increases. Although not affecting income, translation gains of $38 million were recorded in 2002 resulting from the stronger British pound and Euro as compared to the U.S. dollar. Deferred translation losses of $9 million and $46 million were realized in 2001 and 2000, respectively. These translation losses resulted principally from weaker Canadian dollar, British pound and Euro currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar during those years. 34 Table of Contents The results of our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations. We enter into foreign exchange contracts primarily to minimize our risk of loss from such fluctuations. Exchange rates can impact settlement of our intercompany receivables and payables that result from transfers of finished goods inventories between our affiliates in different countries, and intercompany loans. At December 31, 2002, we had approximately $636 million of foreign exchange contracts outstanding, most of which mature in 2003, to buy or sell various currencies. Risks arise from the possible non performance by counterparties in meeting the terms of their contracts and from movements in securities values, interest and or exchange rates. However, we do not anticipate non performance by the counterparties as they are composed of a number of major international financial institutions. Maximum risk of loss on these contracts is limited to the amount of the difference between the spot rate at the date of the contract delivery and the contracted rate. Dividend Policy Our Board of Directors has a policy to pay a cash dividend on common stock each quarter. In setting dividend payments, our board considers the dividend rate in relation to the companys recent and projected earnings and our capital investment opportunities and requirements. We have paid a dividend each year since 1934. Forward Looking Statements We want to caution readers that any forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in this Form 10 K, other reports or press releases or made by our management involve risks and uncertainties which may change based on various important factors. These forward looking statements are those which talk about the companys or managements current expectations as to the future and include, but are not limited to, statements about the amounts, timing and results of possible restructuring charges and future earnings. Words such as estimate, project, plan, believe, expect, anticipate, intend, and similar expressions may identify such forward looking statements. Some of the factors which could cause future financial performance to differ materially from the expectations as expressed in any forward looking statement made by or on our behalf include: changes in international or national political conditions, including any terrorist attacks negative developments in economic conditions, including adverse impacts on customer demand changes in postal regulations timely development and acceptance of new products success in gaining product approval in new markets where regulatory approval is required successful entry into new markets mailers utilization of alternative means of communication or competitors products the companys success at managing customer credit risk, including risks associated with commercial passenger and cargo aircraft leasing transactions changes in interest rates foreign currency fluctuations timing and execution of the restructuring plan timing and execution of the meter transition plan regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other conditions to consummation of any acquisitions and integration of recent acquisitions impact on mail volume resulting from current concerns over the use of the mail for transmitting harmful biological agents third party suppliers ability to provide product components negative income tax adjustments for prior audit years and changes in tax laws or regulations terms and timing of actions to reduce exposures and disposal of assets in Capital Services segment continuing developments in the U.S. and foreign airline industry changes in pension and retiree medical costs. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations due to our investing and funding activities and our operations in different foreign currencies. Our objectives in managing our exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve our objectives, we use a balanced mix of debt maturities and variable and fixed rate debt together with interest rate swaps. Our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility in earnings and cash flows associated with the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, we enter into various contracts, which change in value as foreign exchange rates change, to protect the value of external and intercompany transactions. The principal currencies hedged are the British pound, Canadian dollar and Euro. We employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks. We do not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures. We utilize a Value at Risk (VaR) model to determine the maximum potential loss in fair value from changes in market conditions. The VaR model utilizes a variance/co variance approach and assumes normal market conditions, a 95% confidence level and a one day holding period. The model includes all of our debt and all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts. The model excludes anticipated transactions, firm commitments, and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by us, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. During 2002, our maximum potential one day loss in fair value of our exposure to foreign exchange rates and interest rates, using the variance/co variance technique described above, was not material. 36 Table of Contents
