ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) contains statements that are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in Forward Looking Statements on page 31 and elsewhere in this report. Overview In 2003, we were able to continue our transformation for long term growth. We achieved this by staying focused on our strategic priorities, which include enhancing our core businesses, streamlining our infrastructure and executing our growth strategies. Approximately 77% of our revenue is recurring due primarily to our large lease and business service contract base and this helps us mitigate the impact of economic conditions. In 2003, we liquidated approximately $337 million of non core Capital Services assets in connection with our previously announced strategy to cease originating large ticket, structured, third party, financing of non core lease assets and continued to pursue opportunities to reduce our exposure to non core lease assets on an economically advantageous basis. Our remaining investment in Capital Services lease related assets included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2003 was $2.05 billion. We also adopted a formal restructuring plan to undertake initiatives related to realigned infrastructure requirements and reduced manufacturing needs for digital equipment. We acquired DDD Company (DDD) which expanded our presence in the important government sector and we also significantly expanded our presort network to 22 sites throughout the U.S. In 2003, revenue increased 4%, income from continuing operations increased 13% and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 16% to $2.10 compared with $1.81 in 2002. Revenue growth for 2003 was driven primarily by the favorable impact of foreign currency and by the acquisitions of DDD and PSI Group, Inc. (PSI), which more than offset the negative impact of lower revenue from non core Capital Services financing. In 2003, income from continuing operations was reduced by pre tax restructuring charges of $117 million ($75 million net of taxes) or 32 cents per diluted share and pre tax contributions to charitable foundations of $10 million ($6 million net of taxes) or 3 cents per diluted share. In 2003, income from continuing operations was increased by pre tax income of $10 million ($6 million net of taxes) or 3 cents per diluted share resulting from the favorable resolution of contingencies related to a settlement of a class action lawsuit that was settled in 2002. In 2002, income from continuing operations was reduced by a non cash pre tax Capital Services charge of approximately $213 million ($134 million net of taxes) or 56 cents per diluted share, related to a write down of our investments in commercial passenger aircraft leasing, and to increase our provision for credit losses primarily related to the rapid deterioration of the U.S. airline industry. Diluted earnings per share included 16 cents from non core Capital Services in 2003 compared with 24 cents per diluted share in 2002. During 2003, we generated $851 million of cash from operating activities, repurchased 5.4 million shares of our common stock and increased our common stock dividend for the twenty second consecutive year. We believe that the challenges of 2004 will be very similar to 2003 as the headwind of lower earnings from our non core Capital Services business will continue into 2004 and we anticipate higher benefits and other non controllable costs. See Results of Continuing Operations for 2003, 2002 and 2001 below for a more detailed discussion of our results of operations. Results of Continuing Operations 2003 Compared to 2002 Business segment revenue The following table shows revenue in 2003 and 2002 by business segment: (Dollars in millions) 2003 2002 % change Global Mailstream Solutions $ 3,156 $ 3,012 5 % Global Enterprise Solutions 1,270 1,218 4 % Total Messaging Solutions 4,426 4,230 5 % Non core 110 140 (22 )% Core 41 40 2 % Capital Services 151 180 (16 )% Total revenue $ 4,577 $ 4,410 4 % Total Messaging Solutions revenue grew 5% over the prior year. The revenue increase came from growth in the Global Mailstream Solutions and Global Enterprise Solutions segments of 5% and 4%, respectively, over 2002. 10 Global Mailstream Solutions revenue increased 5% over the prior year driven by the favorable impact of foreign currency and the acquisition of PSI. Revenue was negatively impacted by delayed decision making by customers for equipment upgrades and new equipment purchases at the high end of our product line due to business and economic uncertainty. Global Mailstream Solutions revenue in the U.S. grew 2% driven by growth in small business mailing products and presort operations partially offset by lower financing and sales revenue from slower equipment sales. Within the Global Mailstream Solutions segment, international mailing revenue increased 14% primarily as a result of the favorable impact of foreign currency. On a local currency basis, Canada, France and the Nordic countries experienced good revenue growth. Canadas revenue grew on a local currency basis due to increased leasing of equipment, improved support services revenue and strong placements of new digital meter systems and high end production mailing systems. Frances revenue grew on a local currency basis due to the integration and success of the Secap SA (Secap) organization. This revenue growth was achieved despite lower revenue in some European countries, such as Germany, and Asia where economic conditions deteriorated and as a result demand has been slower for mailing equipment in a post meter migration environment. Global Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 4% over the prior year driven by a 3% increase at PBMS and an 8% increase at DMT. PBMS revenue increased 3% over the prior year as a result of the favorable impact of foreign currency and the acquisition of DDD, which more than offset the adverse impact of contraction of business in large enterprise accounts. Contraction of business in the telecommunications, financial services and transaction based legal services industries continued to have an adverse impact on PBMS revenue growth and operating margins, which resulted in the loss of higher margin business with long term customers as they continued to downsize their businesses in 2003. The acquisition of DDD demonstrates PBMS strategy to accelerate diversification into the government sector as well as to expand cross selling opportunities. The diversification of its customer base will help offset the weakness that still exists in many other customer segments. DMT revenue increased 8% over the prior year driven by sales of DMTs inserter and sortation equipment. DMT was adversely impacted during the first half of 2003 by reduced capital spending as businesses continued to delay large capital spending decisions, which in turn slowed worldwide demand for our high speed, software enabled production mail equipment and mail processing software. Orders for inserter equipment have been strong over the second half of 2003 as businesses appear to have gradually increased their capital spending in anticipation of an improving economy. Capital Services revenue decreased 16% due to our previously announced decision to cease originating large ticket, structured, third party, financing of non core lease assets. Business segment operating profit The following table shows operating profit in 2003 and 2002 by business segment: (Dollars in millions) 2003 2002 % change Global Mailstream Solutions $ 947 $ 894 6 % Global Enterprise Solutions 75 83 (10 )% Total Messaging Solutions 1,022 977 5 % Non core 50 59 (14 )% Core 21 17 22 % Capital Services 71 76 (6 )% Total operating profit $ 1,093 $ 1,053 4 % Total Messaging Solutions operating profit increased 5% over the prior year. Operating profit increased 6% in the Global Mailstream Solutions segment and declined 10% in the Global Enterprise Solutions segment. Global Mailstream Solutions operating profit increased 6% supported by revenue growth and the effect of our continued emphasis on reducing costs and controlling operating expenses. Operating profit was favorably impacted by foreign currency and lower interest expense. Operating profit was adversely affected by moderating customer orders and upgrades due to the continuing weak economy and a shift to lower margin products and services. The operating profit decrease in our Global Enterprise Solutions segment resulted from a 19% operating profit decrease at PBMS partially offset by a 25% operating profit increase at DMT. Operating profit at PBMS was adversely impacted by acquiring new lower margin accounts, lost higher margin accounts, and contraction of businesses in the telecommunications, financial services and transaction based legal services sectors. PBMS continued its actions to offset economic sensitivity by diversifying its customer base into other market segments and providing higher value services to existing customers while reducing general and administrative expenses to address margin pressures. DMTs operating profit growth resulted from increased placements of high margin equipment. Operating profit decreased 6% in the Capital Services segment consistent with our previously announced decision to cease originating large ticket, structured, third party, financing of non core lease assets. Operating profit was favorably impacted by lower interest expense compared to the prior year as a result of the decline in interest rates and the sale of non core Capital Services assets. 11 Revenue by source The following table shows revenue in 2003 and 2002 by source: (Dollars in millions) 2003 2002 % change Sales $ 1,325 $ 1,309 1 % Rentals 860 828 4 % Core financing 545 540 1 % Non core financing 110 140 (22 )% Business services 1,119 1,011 11 % Support services 618 582 6 % Total revenue $ 4,577 $ 4,410 4 % Sales revenue increased 1% over the prior year due to strong supplies sales, sales of DMT equipment and the favorable impact of foreign currency, which more than offset the impact of delayed decision making for upgrades and new equipment purchases at the high end of our Global Mailstream Solutions product lines. Rentals revenue increased 4% primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign currency and the strong placements of our digital standalone meters and new digital system meters. At December 31, 2003, digital meters represented approximately 67% of our U.S. meter base, up from 58% in 2002 and electronic meters represented approximately 33% of our U.S. meter base, down from 42% in 2002. We no longer place mechanical meters, which is in line with USPS guidelines. As previously mentioned, in 2001, we adopted a formal plan to transition to the next generation of networked mailing technology. See Legal and Regulatory Matters. We do not expect this transition to have a material adverse impact on rentals revenue. Core financing revenue increased 1% due primarily to the favorable impact of foreign currency. In total, we financed 51% and 52% of all sales in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Non core financing revenue decreased 22% due to our previously announced decision to cease originating large ticket, structured, third party, financing of non core lease assets. Business services revenue includes revenue from PBMS and PSI. PBMS revenue increased 3% due mainly to the acquisition of DDD and the favorable impact of foreign currency. Revenue growth at PBMS was adversely affected by the continued contraction of large enterprise accounts, especially in the telecommunications, financial services and legal sectors, which resulted in the loss of higher margin business with our long term customers as they continued to downsize their businesses in 2003. Revenue at PSI, which was acquired on August 1, 2002, increased business services revenue 8% driven by the expansion of our presort network to 22 sites at December 31, 2003 from 17 sites at December 31, 2002. Support services revenue increased 6% due primarily to an increased service contract base and the favorable impact of foreign currency. Despite competitive pricing pressures, Global Mailstream Solutions achieved a strong increase in support services revenue due to a larger population of equipment maintenance agreements. DMT had growth in support services revenue driven by higher professional services revenue. Ongoing support services revenue continues to be partially dependent on equipment sales levels. Costs of revenue The following table summarizes costs of revenue as a percentage of related revenue in 2003 and 2002: (Dollars in millions) Percentage of Revenue 2003 2002 2003 2002 Cost of sales $ 612 $ 593 46.1 % 45.3 % Cost of rentals $ 171 $ 174 19.9 % 21.0 % Cost of core financing $ 141 $ 145 25.9 % 26.9 % Cost of non core financing $ 39 $ 47 35.6 % 33.2 % Cost of business services $ 921 $ 814 82.3 % 80.5 % Cost of support services $ 323 $ 297 52.3 % 51.1 % Cost of sales, as a percentage of sales revenue, increased compared with 2002, primarily due to the increase in mix of lower margin international and DMT revenue and the initial costs associated with our transition to outsourcing parts for digital equipment. 12 Cost of rentals, as a percentage of rentals revenue, decreased compared with 2002, as a result of lower depreciation costs associated with our standalone meters and lower repair costs resulting from the shift from electronic to digital meters. Cost of core financing, as a percentage of core financing revenue, decreased compared with 2002, primarily due to cost reduction initiatives in our financial services business. Cost of non core financing, as a percentage of non core financing revenue, increased compared with 2002, as a result of our decision to cease originating large ticket, structured, third party, financing of non core lease assets and sell non core lease assets on an economically advantageous basis. Cost of business services, as a percentage of business services revenue, increased compared with 2002, primarily due to initial lower margins, higher start up costs and delayed implementation associated with new accounts and sites, the loss of higher margin business with long term customers as they continue to downsize and higher employee benefit costs. Cost of support services, as a percentage of support services revenue, increased compared with 2002, primarily due to the increase in mix of lower margin international support services revenue, partially offset by our emphasis on controlling operating expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses The following table shows selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2003 and 2002: (Dollars in millions) Percentage of Revenue 2003 2002 2003 2002 $ 1,220 $ 1,186 26.7 % 26.9 % Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, decreased compared with 2002, as a result of our emphasis on controlling operating expenses, partially offset by costs associated with investments in infrastructure improvements, organizational transformation programs and growth initiatives. Research and development expenses The following table shows research and development expenses in 2003 and 2002: (Dollars in millions) 2003 2002 % change $ 147 $ 141 4 % Research and development expenses increased 4% in 2003 to $147 million, reflecting our continued investment in developing new technologies and enhancing features for all our products. This increase represents expenditures for new digital meters and mailing machines, billing and statement software, distribution and logistics software, advanced inserting equipment and mail sorting equipment. We expect similar levels of investment in research and development in 2004. Net interest expense The following table shows net interest expense in 2003 and 2002: (Dollars in millions) 2003 2002 % change $ 165 $ 179 (8 )% Net interest expense decreased 8% in 2003 due to lower average interest rates and lower average borrowings associated with our investment in leasing and rental products, acquisitions, dividends, and our stock repurchase program. Our variable and fixed rate debt mix, after adjusting for the effect of interest rate swaps, was 30% and 70%, respectively, at December 31, 2003. Based on current borrowing levels, a 25 basis point change in interest rates would impact annual interest expense by approximately $2 million to $3 million. Effective tax rate The following table shows the effective tax rate in 2003 and 2002: 2003 2002 31.4 % 29.3 % The effective tax rate in 2003 includes a .6% tax benefit from the restructuring charges recorded in 2003. The effective tax rate in 2002 included a 2.0% tax benefit related to our Capital Services charge. The effective tax rate was negatively impacted by our strategy to cease originating large ticket, structured, third party, financing of non core lease assets. The tax rate continues to benefit from leasing and 13 financing activities. The tax rate is also favorably affected by our international expansion and our continued investment in developing new technologies. Our provision for taxes could be affected by tax law changes and interpretations by governments or courts. We expect our effective tax rate to increase as we continue to implement our non core Capital Services strategy outlined on page 17. Income from continuing operations increased 13% from $438 million to $495 million in 2003 and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 16% from $1.81 to $2.10 in 2003. In 2003, income from continuing operations was reduced by pre tax restructuring charges of $117 million ($75 million net of taxes) or 32 cents per diluted share and pre tax contributions to charitable foundations of $10 million ($6 million net of taxes) or 3 cents per diluted share, and increased by pre tax income related to the favorable resolution of contingencies related to a settlement of a class action lawsuit that was settled in 2002 of $10 million ($6 million net of taxes) or 3 cents per diluted share. In 2002, income from continuing operations was reduced by a non cash pre tax Capital Services charge of approximately $213 million ($134 million net of taxes) or 56 cents per diluted share, related to a write down of our investments in commercial passenger aircraft leasing and to increase our provision for credit losses primarily related to the rapid deterioration of the U.S. airline industry. Diluted earnings per share included 16 cents from non core Capital Services in 2003 compared with 24 cents per diluted share in 2002. In 2003, diluted earnings per share continued to benefit from our share repurchase program. During the year we repurchased 5.4 million shares, approximately 2% of the average common and potential common shares outstanding at the end of 2002. Results of Continuing Operations 2002 Compared to 2001 In 2002, our revenue increased 7%, income from continuing operations decreased 15% and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 13% to $1.81 compared with $2.08 for 2001. The acquisitions of PSI, Secap, Danka Services International (DSI), and Bell & Howell International Mail and Messaging Technologies (MMT) contributed 6% to our 2002 revenue growth. These acquisitions increased our operating profit, but including related financing costs, did not materially impact earnings either on a per share or aggregate basis. In 2002, income from continuing operations was reduced by a non cash pre tax Capital Services charge of approximately $213 million ($134 million net of taxes) or 56 cents per diluted share. In 2001, income from continuing operations was reduced by a charge of 68 cents per diluted share related to assets associated with our non networked mailing technology and a charge of 30 cents per diluted share related to restructuring initiatives, and increased by a net gain of 82 cents per diluted share from legal settlements. Business segment revenue The following table shows revenue in 2002 and 2001 by business segment: (Dollars in millions) 2002 2001 % change Global Mailstream Solutions $ 3,012 $ 2,847 6 % Global Enterprise Solutions 1,218 1,083 12 % Total Messaging Solutions 4,230 3,930 8 % Non core 140 150 (7 )% Core 40 42 (5 )% Capital Services 180 192 (6 )% Total revenue $ 4,410 $ 4,122 7 % Total Messaging Solutions revenue increased 8% over the prior year. The revenue increase came from growth in the Global Mailstream Solutions and Global Enterprise Solutions segments of 6% and 12%, respectively, over 2001. Approximately 77% of our total 2002 revenue is recurring revenue, which we believe is a good indicator of potential repeat business. Global Mailstream Solutions revenue increased 6% primarily due to the acquisitions of PSI, Secap and MMT. Global Mailstream Solutions revenue in the U.S. benefited from the placement of new digital mailing systems and the demand for our mail creation and distribution solutions products. Our new DM Series of digital mailing systems featuring Intellilink technology experienced good customer acceptance. Within the Global Mailstream Solutions segment, international mailing revenue grew 17%, of which 15% was attributable to revenue from the acquisition of Secap and the favorable impact of foreign currency. The remaining growth was primarily attributable to improved revenue trends in the U.K. and Canada. This revenue growth was achieved despite lower revenue in Germany and several other European countries, where demand has been slower for mailing equipment in a post meter migration environment, and where we have not yet launched our new DM Series. Global Enterprise Solutions revenue growth of 12% over the prior year was driven by a 19% increase at PBMS primarily as a result of the acquisition of DSI. PBMS continued to improve its competitive position and generated strong growth in new written business, particularly in higher value document management services, but this growth was partially offset by the continued contraction of large enterprise accounts, especially in the financial services and legal sectors. DMT revenue decreased 7% over the prior year as businesses continued to delay large capital spending decisions, which in turn slowed worldwide demand for our high speed, software enabled production mail equipment and mail processing software. 14 Capital Services revenue decreased 6% due to our previously stated strategy to concentrate on fee based income opportunities. Business segment operating profit The following table shows operating profit in 2002 and 2001 by business segment: (Dollars in millions) 2002 2001 % change Global Mailstream Solutions $ 894 $ 860 4 % Global Enterprise Solutions 83 77 7 % Total Messaging Solutions 977 937 4 % Non core 59 51 16 % Core 17 22 (23 )% Capital Services 76 73 4 % Total operating profit $ 1,053 $ 1,010 4 % Operating profit grew 4% over the prior year which reflected contributions from acquisitions, as well as our continuing emphasis on reducing costs and controlling operating expenses. Operating profit grew 4% in the Global Mailstream Solutions segment and 7% in the Global Enterprise Solutions segment. Global Mailstream Solutions operating profit grew 4% supported by revenue growth and the effect of our continued emphasis on reducing costs and controlling operating expenses. Operating profit was adversely affected by moderating customer orders and upgrades due to the continuing weak economy and a shift to lower margin products and services. The operating profit growth in our Global Enterprise Solutions segment came from 11% operating profit growth at PBMS offset by a 5% operating profit decrease at DMT. The operating profit growth at PBMS was supported by strong revenue growth. Operating profit was adversely affected by costs associated with acquiring new accounts, and investments in product technology and infrastructure, especially in Europe. DMTs operating profit decline was driven by slower placements of high margin equipment, an increase in lower margin service revenue and continued investment in new product development. Operating profit increased 4% in the Capital Services segment due primarily to the decline in interest rates. Revenue by source The following table shows revenue in 2002 and 2001 by source: (Dollars in millions) 2002 2001 % change Sales $ 1,309 $ 1,305 Rentals 828 784 6 % Core financing 540 526 3 % Non core financing 140 150 (7 )% Business services 1,011 821 23 % Support services 582 536 9 % Total revenue $ 4,410 $ 4,122 7 % Sales revenue remained flat in 2002. Sales growth was adversely affected by the continued slowdown of the global economy which has resulted in moderating customer orders and upgrades at Global Mailstream Solutions and DMT. Additionally, sales growth was adversely affected by our focus on rentals revenue, which should provide a more stable revenue stream over time. Rentals revenue increased 6% primarily due to strong placements of our standalone meters and new digital meters. At December 31, 2002, digital meters represented approximately 58% of our U.S. meter base, up from 50% in 2001, and electronic meters represented approximately 42% of our U.S. meter base. We no longer place mechanical meters, which is in line with USPS guidelines. As previously mentioned, in 2001 we adopted a formal plan to transition to the next generation of networked mailing technology. See Legal and Regulatory Matters. We do not expect this transition to have a material adverse impact on rentals revenue. Core financing revenue increased 3% due primarily to the favorable impact of foreign currency. In total, we financed 52% and 54% of all sales in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Non core financing revenue decreased 7% due to our strategies to reduce our exposure to our Capital Services segment. 15 Business services revenue includes revenue from PBMS and PSI. Business services revenue increased 20% as a result of the acquisitions of DSI and PSI and 3% as a result of growth in new written business. Revenue growth at PBMS was adversely affected by the continued contraction of large enterprise accounts, especially in the financial services and legal sectors. Support services revenue increased 9% in 2002. Despite competitive pricing pressures, Global Mailstream Solutions achieved a strong increase in support services revenue due to a larger population of equipment maintenance agreements and the impact of acquisitions in 2002. DMT had growth in support services revenue due to an increased service contract base and on site contracts. Ongoing support services revenue continues to be partially dependent on equipment sales levels. Costs of revenue The following table shows costs of revenue as a percentage of related revenue in 2002 and 2001: (Dollars in millions) Percentage of Revenue 2002 2001 2002 2001 Cost of sales $ 593 $ 611 45.3 % 46.8 % Cost of rentals $ 174 $ 151 21.0 % 19.2 % Cost of core financing $ 145 $ 155 26.9 % 29.4 % Cost of non core financing $ 47 $ 45 33.2 % 30.2 % Cost of business services $ 814 $ 660 80.5 % 80.4 % Cost of support services $ 297 $ 265 51.1 % 49.4 % Cost of sales, as a percentage of sales revenue, decreased compared with 2001, primarily due to a favorable product mix at our U.S. and international mailing businesses including margin improvements from the launch of our DM series of digital mailing systems. Cost of rentals, as a percentage of rentals revenue, increased compared with 2001, as a result of higher depreciation costs. Cost of core financing, as a percentage of core financing revenue, decreased compared with 2001, primarily due to cost reduction initiatives in our financial services business. Cost of non core financing, as a percentage of non core financing revenue, increased compared with 2001, primarily due to our strategic actions to transition our Capital Services business and reduce our overall exposure to long term external financing assets. Cost of business services, as a percentage of business services revenue, increased compared with 2001, primarily due to costs associated with acquiring new management services accounts that have not yet generated a full year of revenue. Cost of support services, as a percentage of support services revenue, increased compared with 2001, primarily due to the increase in mix of lower margin international support services revenue, partially offset by our emphasis on controlling operating expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses The following table shows selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2002 and 2001: (Dollars in millions) Percentage of Revenue 2002 2001 2002 2001 $ 1,186 $ 1,106 26.9 % 26.8 % Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, increased compared with 2001, primarily due to costs associated with investments in infrastructure and growth initiatives. Research and development expenses The following table shows research and development expenses in 2002 and 2001: (Dollars in millions) 2002 2001 % change $ 141 $ 133 6 % Research and development expenses increased 6% in 2002 to $141 million, reflecting our continued investment in developing new technologies and enhancing features for all our products. The 2002 increase represents expenditures for digital document delivery systems, new digital meters and mailing machines, billing and statement software, distribution and logistics software, advanced inserting equipment and mail sorting equipment. 16 Net interest expense The following table shows net interest expense in 2002 and 2001: (Dollars in millions) 2002 2001 % change $ 179 $ 184 (3 )% Net interest expense decreased due to lower average interest rates during 2002 compared with 2001. This decrease was partially offset by higher average borrowings associated with our investment in leasing and rental products, acquisitions, dividends, and our stock repurchase program. Our variable and fixed rate debt mix, after adjusting for the effect of interest rate swaps, was 32% and 68%, respectively, at December 31, 2002. Effective tax rate The following table shows the effective tax rate in 2002 and 2001: 2002 2001 29.3 % 32.9 % The effective tax rate in 2002 included a 2.0% tax benefit related to our Capital Services charge. The effective tax rate in 2001 included a 1.3% net tax charge related to legal settlements net of a restructuring charge. The tax rate continues to benefit from leasing and financing activities. The tax rate was also favorably affected by our international expansion and our continued investment in developing new technologies. Our provision for taxes could be affected by tax law changes and interpretations by governments or courts. We expect our effective tax rate to increase in 2003 and beyond as we implement our Capital Services strategy outlined below. Capital Services Capital Services strategy In January 2003, we announced that we would cease originating large ticket, structured, third party, financing of non core lease assets. In 2003, we liquidated approximately $337 million of non core assets and continued to pursue opportunities to reduce our exposure to non core lease assets on an economically advantageous basis. In 2002, we liquidated approximately $225 million of non core financing assets primarily related to assets held for sale. Diluted earnings per share included 16 cents from non core Capital Services in 2003 compared with 24 cents per diluted share in 2002. We estimate 2004 diluted earnings per share from non core Capital Services to be about 8 cents per diluted share. Capital Services charges In 2002, we recorded a non cash pre tax charge of approximately $213 million, to write down our investments in commercial passenger aircraft leases primarily with US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways) and United Air Lines (United) and to increase our provision for credit losses primarily related to commercial passenger aircraft leasing investments in the U.S. The pre tax charge was composed of the following: (1) A write down of U.S. aircraft lease receivables and residuals of approximately $110 million; (2) Additional credit loss reserves related to U.S. aircraft lease investments of approximately $82 million; (3) Other costs related to our aircraft leasing investments of approximately $1 million; and (4) Additional credit loss reserves related to non aircraft Capital Services investments of approximately $20 million. The decision of US Airways and United to file for bankruptcy in 2002 exacerbated an already difficult environment in the airline industry. As a result of the rapid deterioration of the U.S. airline industry as well as our revised Capital Services strategy, we recorded a pre tax charge of approximately $82 million to increase our provision for credit losses related to our aircraft leasing investments in the U.S. As a result of these events, combined with both the deteriorating financial condition in various other industries and the change in our Capital Services strategy, we also recorded a pre tax charge of approximately $20 million to increase our provision for credit losses related to non aircraft leasing investments, including investments in the telecommunications industry. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for a breakdown of the Capital Services charges. 17 Investment in commercial passenger and cargo aircraft leasing transactions At December 31, 2003 and 2002, our net investment in commercial passenger and cargo aircraft leasing transactions was $298 million and $344 million, respectively, which is composed of transactions with U.S. airlines of $41 million and $62 million, respectively, and foreign airlines of $257 million and $282 million, respectively. Our net investment in commercial passenger and cargo aircraft leasing portfolio is financed through investments in leveraged lease transactions, direct financing lease transactions and through our equity investment in PBG Capital Partners LLC (PBG). Risk of loss under these transactions is primarily related to: (1) the inability of the airline to make underlying lease payments; (2) our inability to generate sufficient cash flows either through the sale of the aircraft or secondary lease transactions to recover our net investment; and or (3) in the case of the leveraged lease portfolio, the absence of an equity defeasance or other third party credit arrangements. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, approximately 42% and 35% respectively, of our net investment in commercial passenger and cargo aircraft leasing investments was further secured by approximately $125 million and $120 million, respectively, of equity defeasance accounts or third party credit arrangements. Capital Services portfolio Our investment in Capital Services lease related assets included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets is composed of the following: December 31 2003 2002 (Dollars in millions) Leveraged leases $ 1,535 $ 1,560 Finance receivables 450 708 Other assets 51 61 Rental equipment 18 20 Total $ 2,054 $ 2,349 Our investment in leveraged lease assets consists of the following: December 31 2003 2002 (Dollars in millions) Rental receivables $ 8,043 $ 8,695 Residual value 550 690 Principal and interest on nonrecourse loans (6,263 ) (6,854 ) Unearned income (795 ) (971 ) Total leveraged leases $ 1,535 $ 1,560 Rental receivables represent total lease payments from our customers over the remaining term of the leveraged leases. Residual value represents the value of the property anticipated at the end of the leveraged lease terms and is based on independent appraisals. We regularly review the recorded residual value to ensure it is appropriate. Principal and interest on nonrecourse loans represent amounts due to unrelated third parties from our customers over the remaining term of the leveraged leases. The nonrecourse loans are secured by the lessees rental obligations and the leased property. If a lessee defaults and if the amounts realized from the sale of these assets are insufficient, we have no obligation to make any payments due on these nonrecourse loans to the unrelated third parties. Accordingly, we are required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) to subtract the principal and interest over the remaining term of the nonrecourse loans from our rental receivables and residual value. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the principal balances on the nonrecourse loans totaled $3.5 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively, and the related interest payments over the remaining terms of the leases totaled $2.8 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively. Unearned income represents our future financing income that will be earned over the remaining term of the leases. Total leveraged leases represent the amount that is recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 18 The investment in total leveraged leases in our Consolidated Balance Sheets is diversified across the following types of assets: (Dollars in millions) 2003 2002 Original Lease Term (in years) Locomotives and rail cars $ 360 $ 303 15 40 Postal equipment 338 307 16 24 Commercial aircraft 279 303 23 25 Commercial real estate 236 340 17 25 Telecommunications 139 133 14 16 Rail and bus 132 131 27 37 Shipping and handling 51 43 24 Total leveraged leases $ 1,535 $ 1,560 At December 31, 2003 and 2002, our leveraged lease investment in commercial real estate facilities included approximately $88 million and $84 million, respectively, related to leases of corporate facilities to four U.S. telecommunication entities, of which $73 million and $69 million, respectively, is with lessees that are highly rated. Additionally, our leveraged lease investment in telecommunications equipment represents leases to three highly rated international telecommunication entities. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, approximately 84% and 86%, respectively, of this portfolio is further secured by equity defeasance accounts or other third party credit arrangements. In 2002, as part of our Capital Services charges discussed on page 17, we increased our provision for credit losses related to our investment in the telecommunications industry. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, approximately 51% and 48%, respectively, of our total leveraged lease portfolio is further secured by equity defeasance accounts or other third party credit arrangements. In addition, at December 31, 2003 and 2002, approximately 20% and 17%, respectively, of the remaining leveraged lease portfolio represents leases to highly rated government related organizations which have guarantees or supplemental credit enhancements upon the occurrence of certain events. Finance receivables are composed of the following: December 31 2003 2002 (Dollars in millions) Assets held for sale $ 21 $ 195 Single investor leases: Large ticket single investor leases 157 253 Imagistics lease portfolio 272 260 Total $ 450 $ 708 Other assets represent our 50% equity interest in PBG. See Off Balance Sheet Items for a further discussion of our equity interest in PBG. In 2002, our net investment in PBG was reduced by a write down of aircraft lease receivables of approximately $31 million and additional provisions for credit losses of approximately $70 million related to aircraft lease investments in the U.S. See Capital Services charges. Our Consolidated Statements of Income includes financing revenue of $6.6 million, $32.6 million and $33.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, attributable to our assets held for sale portfolio. Off Balance Sheet Items Finance receivables sales As part of our Capital Services programs, we have, from time to time sold, through securitizations, net finance receivables with limited recourse. In these transactions, we have surrendered control over the transferred assets in accordance with paragraph 9 of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 140 and received a cash payment from the transferee. Specifically, the finance receivables were sold to a bankruptcy remote limited liability company. At the time of sale, we obtained legal counsels opinion that the assets were isolated and that the sale qualified as a true sale at law. Under the terms of the sale, the transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the assets it received. There are no conditions that both constrain the transferee from taking advantage of its right to pledge or exchange and provide more than a trivial benefit to the transferor. We do not maintain effective control over the transferred assets. We have accounted for these transactions as a sale, recognizing assets obtained and liabilities incurred in consideration as proceeds of the sale. Any resulting gain or loss was recognized in income at the time of sale. The maximum risk of loss in these transactions arises 19 from the possible non performance of lessees to meet the terms of their contracts. We believe adequate provisions for losses have been established for receivables sold which may become uncollectible and for which we have recourse obligation, in accordance with paragraph 113 of FAS No. 140. In selective cases, when we have sold net finance receivables, we entered into guarantee contracts with varying amounts of recourse in privately placed transactions with unrelated third party investors. The uncollected principal balance of receivables sold and guarantee contracts totaled $126 million and $183 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In accordance with GAAP, we do not record these amounts as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our maximum risk of loss on these net finance receivables and guarantee contracts arises from the possible non performance of lessees to meet the terms of their contracts and from changes in the value of the underlying equipment. These contracts are secured by the underlying equipment value, and supported by the creditworthiness of our customers. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the underlying equipment value exceeded the sum of the uncollected principal balance of receivables sold and the guarantee contracts. As part of our review of our risk exposure, we believe we have made adequate provision for sold receivables and guarantee contracts which may not be collectible. See Notes 18, 20 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements. Equity interest During 1997, we formed PBG with GATX Corporation (GATX) for the purpose of financing and managing certain leasing related assets existing at that time. We contributed assets to PBG and maintain a 50% interest. We currently account for our investment in PBG under the equity method and do not record the assets and liabilities of PBG in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, we will be required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of PBG effective March 31, 2004 when the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation (FIN) No. 46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities become effective for us. See New Accounting Pronouncements for further details on the impact of adopting FIN No. 46. Our maximum exposure is our investment of $51 million in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2003. PBGs total assets and liabilities at December 31, 2003 are $323 million and $202 million, respectively. State and local government financing As part of our Capital Services business, we originated tax exempt secured loans to state and local governments and sold certificates of interest in these loans. Generally, we recognized revenue for the fees we received upon the sale of these certificates. These transactions however, may have required us to buy back certificates if interest rates rose significantly. During 2003, we sold all of our remaining interest in these structures. We have no future servicing responsibility or risk associated with these transactions. Certificates outstanding at December 31, 2002 were $216.8 million,which in accordance with GAAP, were not recorded as assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Restructuring Charges 2003 Restructuring Plan In January 2003, we announced that we would undertake restructuring initiatives related to realigned infrastructure requirements and reduced manufacturing needs for digital equipment. At that time, we expected the pre tax cost of these restructuring initiatives would be about $160 million ($100 million net of taxes). We continue to review the anticipated cost of these restructuring initiatives and currently estimate 2004 charges to continue at about the same rate as those recorded in the fourth quarter of 2003. As we continue to finalize our 2004 restructuring plans, the ultimate amount of the restructuring charges may differ from our current estimates. The charges related to these restructuring initiatives will be recorded as the various initiatives take effect. The restructuring initiatives are expected to continue to increase our operating efficiency and effectiveness in 2004 and beyond while enhancing growth, primarily as a result of reduced personnel related expenses. We realized approximately $25 million of pre tax benefits from these restructuring initiatives in 2003 and currently estimate incremental pre tax benefits from these initiatives in the range of $40 million to $50 million in 2004. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for our accounting policy related to restructuring charges. In connection with this plan, we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $116.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The pre tax restructuring charges are composed of: (Dollars in millions) Restructuring charges Non cash charges Cash payments Balance at December 31, 2003 Severance and benefit costs $ 81.0 $ $ (53.5 ) $ 27.5 Asset impairments 26.6 (26.6 ) Other exit costs 9.1 (4.4 ) 4.7 $ 116.7 $ (26.6 ) $ (57.9 ) $ 32.2 20 All restructuring charges, except for the asset impairments, will result in cash outflows. The severance and benefit costs relate to a reduction in workforce of approximately 1,438 employees worldwide at December 31, 2003 and expected future workforce reductions of approximately 1,000 employees. The workforce reductions relate to actions across several of our businesses resulting from infrastructure and process improvements and our continuing efforts to streamline operations, and include managerial, professional, clerical and technical roles. Approximately 65% of the workforce reductions are in the U.S. The majority of the international workforce reductions are in Europe and Canada. Asset impairments relate primarily to the write down of property, plant and equipment, resulting from the closure or streamlining of certain facilities. During 2003, we recorded an asset impairment of $23.8 million as a result of our decision to exit our Main Plant facility in Connecticut in connection with our product sourcing and real estate optimization strategy. The fair values of the impaired long lived assets were determined primarily using probability weighted expected cash flows in accordance with FAS No. 144. Other exit costs relate primarily to lease termination costs, non cancelable lease payments, consolidation of excess facilities and other costs associated with exiting business activities. 2001 Restructuring Plan In 2001, we adopted a formal restructuring plan to implement a common, streamlined business infrastructure across the corporation as a result of our decisions to spin off our office systems business and align our mailing business on a global basis, as well as cost saving opportunities resulting from strategic acquisitions and partnerships, and additional benefits attained from the consolidation of our IT organization and ERP initiatives. In connection with this plan, we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $149.3 million in 2001, of which $116.1 million was related to continuing operations and the remaining $33.2 million was related to discontinued operations. The restructuring charges related to continuing operations have been segregated in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2001. The restructuring charges related to discontinued operations have been reported in discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2001. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. The restructuring charges related to continuing operations were composed of: (Dollars in millions) Year ended December 31, 2001 Severance and benefit costs $ 74.3 Asset impairments 28.0 Other exit costs 13.8 $ 116.1 All restructuring charges, except for the asset impairments, resulted in cash outflows. The severance and benefit costs related to a reduction in workforce of approximately 1,500 employees worldwide which was initiated in 2001 and was substantially completed at December 31, 2002. The workforce reductions related to actions across several of our businesses resulting from infrastructure and process improvements and our continuing efforts to streamline operations, and included managerial, professional, clerical and technical roles. Approximately 80% of our workforce reductions were in the U.S. The majority of the international workforce reductions were in Europe. None of the reductions impacted our sales coverage. At December 31, 2002, 1,529 employees were separated under these initiatives and approximately $73.6 million of severance and benefit costs were paid. Asset impairments related primarily to the disposal or abandonment of certain hardware and software applications, resulting from the alignment of our mailing business on a global basis and ERP initiatives. Other exit costs related primarily to lease termination costs, non cancelable lease payments, and other costs associated with business activities that have been exited and the consolidation of excess facilities. The restructuring charges related to discontinued operations were composed of: (Dollars in millions) Year ended December 31, 2001 Severance and benefit costs $ 1.9 Asset impairments 17.5 Other exit costs 13.8 $ 33.2 The severance and benefit costs related to a reduction in workforce of approximately 25 employees. The asset impairments related primarily to an impairment of residual values, in connection with leases of copier equipment, and the write down of certain facsimile and copier equipment, resulting from the spin off of our office systems business. Other exit costs related primarily to incremental costs associated with cancellation and separation of facility occupancy leases that were shared between the company and Imagistics International Inc. (IGI). This restructuring plan was substantially completed at December 31, 2002. 21 Meter Transition In 2001, we adopted a formal plan to transition to the next generation of networked mailing technology. The information capture and exchange, made possible by advanced technology, turns the postage meter into an intelligent terminal that networks the mailer to postal and carrier information and systems. This two way information architecture, in turn, enables convenient access to and delivery of value added services such as tracking, delivery confirmation and rate information. The adoption of this plan was facilitated by our expanded access to technology and our ability to move to networked products combined with our expectations that the U.S. and postal services around the world will continue to encourage the migration of mailing systems to networked digital technologies. As a result of this plan, certain electronic meter rental assets and related equipment will not be placed back in service. In addition, certain leased equipment will either not be remarketed or will result in lower realization at the end of the lease as a result of the introduction of new technology. In connection with this plan, we recorded non cash pre tax charges of $268.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, related to assets associated with our non networked mailing technology. In November 2001, postal regulations were issued, consistent with our meter transition plan, defining the meter migration process and timing. See Legal and Regulatory Matters. The charges related to the meter transition plan were composed of: (Dollars in millions) Year ended December 31, 2001 Impairment of lease residual values $ 128.4 Impairment of meter rental assets 71.3 Inventory write downs 27.6 Additional depreciation costs on meter rental assets 41.0 $ 268.3 Other Income Charitable contributions In 2003, we recorded a pre tax charge of $10 million ($6 million net of taxes) related to contributions to two charitable foundations. Legal settlements, net In 2001, the company and Hewlett Packard announced that they had reached an agreement resolving a lawsuit filed by us in 1995. The lawsuit arose out of a dispute over print technology patents. Under the terms of the agreement, the companies resolved all pending patent litigation without admission of infringement and we received $400 million in cash and ten year supply and technology agreements. We recorded the cash payment, net of legal fees and related expenses of $37.8 million, as other income in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2001. In 2001, we recorded a pre tax charge of approximately $24 million associated with the settlement of a lawsuit related to lease upgrade pricing in the early to mid 1990s. The $24 million charge relates to the following settlement costs: award certificates to be provided to members of the class for purchase of office products through the Pitney Bowes supply line and the cost of legal fees and related expenses of $8.3 million. In 2003, we recorded income of $10 million ($6 million net of taxes) related to the expiration of product award certificates provided in connection with this settlement. Acquisitions In October 2003, we acquired DDD for a net purchase price of $49.5 million, which consisted of approximately $24.8 million of cash and the issuance of common stock valued at $24.7 million. DDD offers a broad array of services including, fulfillment services, secure mail processing, manager services, logistics support, and record and information management. This acquisition reflected PBMS strategy to accelerate diversification into the government sector as well as expand cross selling opportunities. In August 2002, we acquired PSI for approximately $127 million in cash and $39 million in assumed debt. PSI, the nations largest mail presort company, prepares, sorts and aggregates mail to earn postal discounts and expedite delivery for its customers. In October 2001, we acquired Secap, for approximately Euros 220 million ($206 million) in cash. Secap offers a range of mail processing and paper handling equipment, supplies and technology for low to mid volume mailers. At that time, Secap held more than 30% of the postage meter market share in France. In June 2001, we acquired DSI. The final purchase price, following post closing adjustments, was $285.5 million in cash. DSI provides on and off site document management services, including the management of central reprographic departments, the placement and maintenance of photocopiers, print on demand operations and document archiving and retrieval services. 22 In June 2001, we acquired the MMT business in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. The final purchase price, following post closing adjustments, was $44 million in cash. MMT markets and services high end mail processing, sorting and service related products through a network of distributors and direct operations. We accounted for the acquisitions of DDD, PSI, Secap, DSI and MMT under the purchase method and accordingly, the operating results of these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. The acquisitions of DDD, PSI, Secap, DSI and MMT did not materially impact income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, we also completed several smaller acquisitions. During 2003, we acquired one of our address printing suppliers. We acquired the remaining 43% ownership interest of MailCode Inc. in 2002 and completed the acquisition of Alysis Technologies Inc. in 2001, a leading provider of digital document delivery solutions. Our smaller acquisitions also include some of our international dealerships and presort businesses. The cost of these acquisitions in the aggregate was less than $70 million in each year. These acquisitions did not have a material impact on our financial results either individually or on an aggregate basis. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. Discontinued Operations On December 3, 2001, we completed the spin off of our office systems business to stockholders as an independent, publicly traded company under the name of Imagistics International Inc. (IGI). On that date, we paid a special stock dividend of IGI common stock to our common shareholders. Through this special dividend, we distributed 100% of the shares of IGI stock to common shareholders of the company. The historical carrying amount of the IGI net assets distributed to our shareholders on the spin off date has been recorded as a stock dividend of $311.7 million. We segregated the operating results of IGI and reported them as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income. In connection with the spin off, we recorded a loss of approximately $26.0 million (net of taxes of $12.2 million) for the year ended December 31, 2001. On January 14, 2000, we sold Atlantic Mortgage & Investment Corporation (AMIC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, to ABN AMRO North America. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a gain of $2.3 million (net of taxes of $1.6 million) and $12.5 million (net of taxes of $7.4 million) for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These gains resulted from the favorable resolution of certain contingent liabilities recorded at the time of sale. On October 30, 1998, Colonial Pacific Leasing Corporation (CPLC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, transferred the operations, employees and substantially all assets related to its broker oriented external financing business to General Electric Capital Corporation, a subsidiary of the General Electric Company. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a gain of $.9 million (net of taxes of $.6 million) and $25.5 million (net of taxes of $15.0 million) for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These gains resulted from the favorable resolution of certain contingent liabilities recorded at the time of sale. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities increased to .95 to 1 at December 31, 2003 compared with .76 to 1 at December 31, 2002. The increase in this ratio was due primarily to the $.9 billion decrease in notes payable and current portion of long term obligations as a result of the decrease in overall debt combined with the issuances of long term debt during the year ended December 31, 2003. See Financings and Capitalization for further details. To manage interest rate risk, we use a balanced mix of debt maturities, variable and fixed rate debt and interest rate swap agreements. During 2003, we took advantage of lower interest rates in refinancing the debt in our portfolio that matured during the year. This will better position us against a rise in interest rates in the future. In 2002, we received $95 million in cash associated with the termination of four swap agreements. As a result of these transactions, our fixed to floating percentages increased to 70% and 30%, respectively at December 31, 2003 compared to 68% and 32%, respectively at December 31, 2002. 23 The following table summarizes our cash flows in 2003, 2002 and 2001: (Dollars in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 851 $ 503 $ 1,036 Investing activities (34 ) (301 ) (840 ) Financing activities (850 ) (123 ) (163 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 12 5 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (21 ) $ 84 $ 33 During 2003, net cash provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net income adjusted for non cash items and the increase in deferred taxes on income, partially offset by a pension plan contribution, changes in working capital and increases in internal finance receivables. Net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of capital expenditures, acquisitions and other investing activities, partially offset by cash generated from asset sales at Capital Services and reserve account deposits. Net cash used in financing activities consisted primarily of dividends paid to stockholders, stock repurchases and a decrease in total debt. In 2003, we made a year end contribution of approximately $50 million to our U.S. pension plan. In 2002, we made year end contributions of approximately $305 million and $34 million to our U.S. and U.K. pension plans, respectively. We expect these additional investments to significantly offset the impact of changes to actuarial assumptions and loss experience. In 2003, we lowered the discount rate to 6.0%. In 2002, we reduced our long term rate of return on assets assumption to 8.5%, lowered the discount rate to 6.75%, and adopted a new mortality table. We expect that 2004 incremental pension costs attributable to these assumption changes, net of the impact of the pension plan contributions, will be approximately 3 cents per diluted share. The ratio of total debt to total debt and stockholders equity was 76.7% at December 31, 2003, versus 82.3% at December 31, 2002. Including the preferred stockholders equity in a subsidiary company as debt, the ratio of total debt to total debt and stockholders equity was 78.1% at December 31, 2003 compared to 83.4% at December 31, 2002. The decrease in this ratio was driven primarily by a net reduction of total debt, favorable foreign currency translation adjustments and income offset by the $200 million repurchase of 5.4 million shares of common stock. Financings and Capitalization At December 31, 2003, $456 million remained available under the shelf registration statement filed in October 2001 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), permitting issuances of up to $2 billion in debt securities, preferred stock and depositary shares. In April 2003, as part of this shelf registration statement, we established a medium term note program for the issuance of up to $1.38 billion in aggregate principal, representing the remaining amount available on the shelf at that time. At December 31, 2003, we had unused lines of credit and revolving credit facilities of $1.5 billion in the U.S. and $9.6 million outside the U.S., primarily to support commercial paper issuance. In June 2003, we issued $375 million of unsecured fixed rate notes maturing in June 2013. These notes bear interest at an annual rate of 3.875% and pay interest semi annually beginning December 2003. The proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper and the repurchase of company stock. In June 2003, we issued $200 million of unsecured floating rate notes maturing in June 2005. These notes bear interest at a floating rate of LIBOR minus 3 basis points, set two business days preceding the quarterly interest payment dates. The proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper and the repurchase of company stock. In April 2003, we issued $350 million of unsecured fixed rate notes maturing in May 2018. These notes bear interest at an annual rate of 4.75% and pay interest semi annually beginning November 2003. In connection with this issuance, we entered into a $350 million swap maturing in May 2018, converting this obligation to a floating rate note. The proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper and the repurchase of company stock. In February 2003, we sold 6.45% Preferred Stock in a subsidiary of Pitney Bowes Credit Corporation (PBCC) to an outside institutional investor for approximately A$191 million ($110 million). As part of this transaction, we agreed to repurchase the stock in 10 years. Additionally, we entered into a cross currency interest rate swap with the same institutional investor, effectively converting the obligation to a $110 million note that bears interest at a floating rate of approximately LIBOR minus 50 basis points. This note was recorded as long term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The proceeds from this transaction were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper and the repurchase of company stock. 24 In September 2002, we issued $400 million of unsecured fixed rate notes maturing in October 2012. These notes bear interest at an annual rate of 4.625% and pay interest semi annually beginning April 2003. The proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper in anticipation of 2003 debt maturities. In February 2002, we completed an offering of Euros 250 million of senior unsecured notes. These notes bore interest at a floating rate of EURIBOR plus 20 basis points, set two business days preceding the quarterly interest payment dates and matured in August 2003. The notes were listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and were designated as a hedge of Euro denominated net investments held by the company. The proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper, the financing of acquisitions and the repurchase of company stock. In August 2001, we issued $350 million of unsecured fixed rate notes maturing in August 2008. These notes bear interest at an annual rate of 5.75% and pay interest semi annually beginning February 15, 2002. The proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper. In July 2001, we issued four nonrecourse promissory notes totaling $111.5 million in connection with four lease transactions. The promissory notes were all due in monthly installments over 194 months at an interest rate of 7.24%. In September 2001, we sold our interest in two of the lease transactions and transferred the obligation on two of the nonrecourse promissory notes totaling $55.3 million in principal balance. In December 2002, we sold our interest in one of the leasing transactions and transferred the obligation on one nonrecourse promissory note outstanding at December 31, 2001 with a total principal balance of $25.6 million. In September 2003, we sold our remaining interest in the lease transaction and transferred the obligation on the remaining nonrecourse promissory note with a total principal balance of approximately $26 million. The transfer of this obligation was reflected as a reduction of long term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In April 2001, we issued the remaining $300 million of notes available under a prior shelf registration, permitting issuances of up to $500 million in debt securities (including medium term notes) with a minimum maturity of nine months. These unsecured notes bear annual interest at 5.875% and mature in May 2006. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper, the financing of acquisitions and the repurchase of company stock. We believe our financing needs for the next 12 months can be met with cash generated internally, money from existing credit agreements, debt issued under new and existing shelf registration statements and our existing commercial paper programs. Information on debt maturities is presented in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The following summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2003, and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods: Payments due by period (Dollars in millions) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Commercial paper borrowings $ 282 $ 282 $ $ $ Long term debt and current portion of long term debt 3,286 445 908 558 1,375 Non cancelable capital lease obligations 7 2 4 1 Non cancelable operating lease obligations 239 81 97 39 22 Purchase obligations (1) 180 166 14 Total $ 3,994 $ 976 $ 1,023 $ 598 $ 1,397 (1) Purchase obligations include unrecorded agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding upon us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. (2) Other noncurrent liabilities of $347 million included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2003 relate primarily to our non pension postretirement benefits. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. Capital Expenditures During 2003, capital expenditures included net additions of $185 million to property, plant and equipment and $101 million of rental equipment and related inventories compared with $154 million and $71 million, respectively, in 2002. These additions included expenditures for plant and manufacturing equipment and infrastructure improvements as well as increased investments associated 25 with new accounts at PBMS. The additions of rental equipment primarily were postage meters. The increase in our capital expenditures over the prior year was driven by our continued investments in infrastructure improvements, digital equipment for PBMS sites and new digital postage meters. We expect capital expenditures in 2004 to be approximately the same as 2003. These investments will also be affected by the timing of our customers transition to digital meters. At December 31, 2003, commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment as well as rental equipment for new and replacement programs reflected the items discussed above. Critical Accounting Policies We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations. We have discussed the impact and any associated risks on our results of operations related to these policies throughout the MD&A. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include, but are not limited to customer cancellations, bad debts, inventories, residual values of leased assets, useful lives of long lived assets and intangible assets, warranty obligations, restructuring, pensions and other postretirement benefits, and contingencies and litigation. Our actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Revenue recognition Multiple element arrangements We derive our revenue from the following sources: sales, rentals, core financing, non core financing, business services, and support services. Certain of our transactions are consummated at the same time and can therefore generate revenue from multiple sources. The usual form of these transactions involves the sale or lease of equipment, a cancelable meter rental and or a cancelable equipment maintenance agreement. As a result, we are required to determine whether the deliverables in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and if so, how the price should be allocated among the delivered elements and when to recognize revenue for each element. In these cases, revenue is recognized for each of the elements based on their respective fair values. Fair values of any meter rental or equipment maintenance agreement are determined by reference to the prices charged in standalone or renewal transactions. Fair value of the equipment is determined based upon negotiated selling prices. We recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known and uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved. Our allocation of the fair values to the various elements does not change the total revenue recognized from a transaction, but impacts the timing of revenue recognition. Internal financing arrangements We provide lease financing of our products in the U.S. and outside the U.S. primarily through sales type leases. When a sales type lease is consummated, we record the gross finance receivable, unearned income and the estimated residual value of the leased equipment. Residual values are estimated based upon the average expected proceeds to be received at the end of the lease term. Management evaluates recorded residual values on an annual basis or as circumstances warrant. A reduction in estimated residual values could require an impairment charge as well as a reduction in future financing income. Allowances for doubtful accounts and credit losses Allowance for doubtful accounts We estimate our accounts receivable risks and provide allowances for doubtful accounts accordingly. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on a periodic basis. Our evaluation includes historical loss experience, length of time receivables are past due, adverse situations that may affect a customers ability to repay, and prevailing economic conditions. We make adjustments to our allowance if our evaluation of allowance requirements differs from our actual aggregate reserve. This evaluation is inherently subjective because our estimates may be revised as more information becomes available. Based on historical experience, we have not had any material revisions to our recorded allowance for doubtful accounts. 26 Allowance for credit losses We estimate our finance receivables risks and provide allowances for credit losses accordingly. We establish credit approval limits based on the credit quality of our customers and the type of equipment financed. We charge finance receivables through the allowance for credit losses after collection efforts are exhausted and we deem the account uncollectible. Our financial services businesses base credit decisions primarily on a customers financial strength. We believe that our concentration of credit risk for finance receivables in our internal financing division is limited because of our large number of customers, small account balances and customer geographic and industry diversification. In addition, in our Capital Services programs, we have considered collateral values. Our general policy for finance receivables contractually past due for over 90 days is to discontinue revenue recognition. We resume revenue recognition when payments reduce the account to 60 days or less past due. In our Capital Services programs, we discontinue revenue recognition as soon as it is apparent that the obligor will not be making payments in accordance with lease terms, such as in the event of bankruptcy. Otherwise, we discontinue revenue recognition when accounts are over 90 days past due or as circumstances warrant. We evaluate the adequacy of allowance for credit losses on a periodic basis. Our evaluation includes historical loss experience, the nature and volume of our portfolios, adverse situations that may affect a customers ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. We make adjustments to our allowance for credit losses if the evaluation of reserve requirements differs from the actual aggregate reserve. This evaluation is inherently subjective because our estimates may be revised as more information becomes available. Accounting for income taxes When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We record this amount as a provision for our taxes in accordance with FAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This process requires us to make the following assessments: we estimate our actual current tax liability in each jurisdiction. we estimate our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as lease revenue and related depreciation, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we include in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and if we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. At any time, our provision for taxes could be impacted by changes in tax law and interpretations by governments or courts. Long lived assets Useful lives of long lived assets We depreciate property, plant and equipment principally using the straight line method over estimated useful lives: machinery and equipment principally three to 15 years and buildings up to 50 years. We depreciate rental equipment using the straight line method over appropriate periods, which is principally three to ten years. We depreciate other depreciable assets using either the straight line method or accelerated methods. We amortize properties leased under capital leases on a straight line basis over the primary lease terms. We amortize capitalized costs related to internally developed software using the straight line method over the estimated useful life, which is principally three to ten years. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives, which are principally five to 15 years. Our estimates of useful lives could be affected by changes in regulatory provisions, technology or business plans. Impairment review We evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets, including goodwill and intangible assets, on an annual basis or as circumstances warrant. Our goodwill impairment review requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. Significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. 27 We believe that we have no unrecorded asset impairments at December 31, 2003 and 2002. However, future events and circumstances, some of which are described below, may result in an impairment charge: changes in postal regulations governing the types of meters allowable for use. However, recent regulations were issued in November 2001, and therefore we do not expect new regulations for the foreseeable future. new technological developments that provide significantly enhanced benefits over current digital technology. significant negative economic or industry trends. changes in our business strategy that alter the expected usage of the related assets. significant increase or decrease in our cost of capital. future terrorist or other actions that significantly impact the volume of mail. future economic results that are below our expectations used in the current assessments. Retirement benefits Our pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on various actuarial assumptions. We make assumptions relating to discount rates, rate of compensation increase, expected return on plan assets, health care cost trends and other factors. We base our discount rate assumption on current yields on AA rated corporate long term bonds. The rate of compensation increase assumption reflects our actual experience and future outlook. Our expected return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results and future expectations of rates of return. Our health care cost trend assumptions are based on historical cost data and an assessment of likely future trends. Our key assumptions are described in further detail in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants and could therefore affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, FAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations was issued, amending FAS No. 19, Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies, and applies to all entities. FAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. FAS No. 143 is effective January 1, 2003. The adoption of this statement did not impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2002, FAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, was issued. This statement nullifies the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). FAS No. 146 requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. We adopted the provisions of FAS No. 146, which are effective for one time benefit arrangements and exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. We account for ongoing benefit arrangements under FAS No. 112 Employers Accounting for Postemployment Benefits, which requires that a liability be recognized when the costs are probable and reasonably estimable. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. In November 2002, FIN No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others was issued. FIN No. 45 clarifies the requirements of FAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to a guarantors accounting for and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. FIN No. 45 elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees, including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit. It also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee, the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value, or market value, of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements. The provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantors obligations does not apply to product warranties or to guarantees accounted for as derivatives. The recognition provisions of FIN No. 45 are effective January 1, 2003. The adoption of this interpretation did not impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. In December 2002, FAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, which amends FAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, was issued. FAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and requires more prominent and more frequent disclosures in the financial statements of the effects of stock based compensation. The provisions of FAS No. 148 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. We adopted the disclosure only provisions of this statement. In January 2003, FIN No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, was issued. FIN No. 46 requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. The consolidation requirements of FIN No. 46 apply 28 immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to FIN No. 46. Under the new guidance, the consolidation requirements apply to pre existing variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003. Application by public companies for all other types of entities is required in financial statements for periods ending after March 15, 2004. We have an equity investment in PBG that currently qualifies as a variable interest entity under FIN No. 46 but does not meet the definition of a special purpose entity. PBG was formed with GATX in 1997 for the purpose of financing and managing certain leasing related assets. Based on the terms of the partnership agreement, we are the primary beneficiary and as a result we will consolidate our equity investment in PBG effective March 31, 2004. At December 31, 2003, PBGs total assets and liabilities were $323 million and $202 million, respectively. The consolidation of PBG will not have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows. In March 2003, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF No. 00 21 addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it performs multiple revenue generating activities and how to determine whether such an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition. EITF No. 00 21 is effective July 1, 2003. The transition provision allows either prospective application or a cumulative effect adjustment upon adoption. We believe we are in compliance with the provision of EITF No. 00 21. The adoption of these provisions did not impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In April 2003, FAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, was issued. FAS No. 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under FAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The provisions of FAS No. 149 are generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The adoption of this statement did not impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2003, FAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, was issued. FAS No. 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The provisions of FAS No. 150 are effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and are effective July 1, 2003. The adoption of this statement did not impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. In December 2003, FAS No. 132 (Revised), Employers Disclosure about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, was issued. FAS No. 132 (Revised) retains the disclosure requirements of the original pronouncement and required additional disclosures relating to assets, obligations, cash flows and net periodic benefit cost. The provisions of FAS No. 132 (Revised) are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003, except for certain disclosures which are effective for fiscal years ending after June 15, 2004. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further details. Legal and Regulatory Matters Legal See Legal Proceedings in Item 3 of this Form 10 K for information regarding our legal proceedings. In addition, during 2003 a previously pending patent action with Stamps.com was settled with certain cross licensing agreements. USPS meter transition In 2000, the USPS issued a schedule for the phaseout of manually reset electronic meters in the U.S. as follows: As of February 1, 2000, new placements of manually reset electronic meters were no longer permitted. The current users of manually reset electronic meters could continue to use these meters for the term of their rental and lease agreements. Leases or rentals due to expire in 2000 could be extended to December 31, 2001. In 2001, the USPS issued a rule as follows: New placements of non digital meters without the timeout feature that enables the meters to be automatically disabled, if not reset within a specified time period are no longer permitted after December 31, 2002. These meters must be off the market by December 31, 2006. New placements of non digital meters with a timeout feature are no longer permitted after June 30, 2004. These meters must be off the market by December 31, 2008. 29 We adopted a formal plan in the second quarter of 2001 to transition to the next generation of networked mailing technology. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. USPS Information Based Indicia Program (IBIP) In May 1995, the USPS publicly announced its concept of its IBIP for future postage evidencing devices. As initially stated by the USPS, the purpose of the program was to develop a new standard for future digital postage evidencing devices which would significantly enhance postal revenue security and support expanded USPS value added services to mailers. The program would consist of the development of four separate specifications: (i) the Indicium specification; (ii) a Postal Security Device specification; (iii) a Host specification; and (iv) a Vendor Infrastructure specification. During the period from May 1995 through December 31, 2001, we submitted extensive comments to a series of proposed IBIP specifications issued by the USPS, including comments on the IBI Performance Criteria. Other regulatory matters In December 2003, we received accepted closing agreements with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) showing income tax adjustments for the 1992 to 1994 tax years. The total additional tax for these years is approximately $5.0 million. Additional tax due for 1995 and future tax years in connection with these closing agreements will not materially affect our future results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In addition to the accepted income tax adjustments, one 1994 proposed adjustment remains in dispute, which could result in additional tax of approximately $4.3 million. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to this deficiency and that the ultimate outcome will not result in a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years. However, if the IRS prevails on this deficiency, additional tax may be due for 1995 and future tax years, which could materially affect our future results of operations, financial position or cash flows. At any time, our provision for taxes could be affected by changes in tax law and interpretations by governments or courts. Effects of Inflation and Foreign Exchange Inflation, although moderate in recent years, continues to affect worldwide economies and the way companies operate. It increases labor costs and operating expenses, and raises costs associated with replacement of fixed assets such as rental equipment. Despite these growing costs and the USPS meter migration initiatives, we have generally been able to maintain profit margins through productivity and efficiency improvements, continual review of both manufacturing capacity and operating expense levels, and, to an extent, price increases. Although not affecting income, deferred translation gains of $143 million were recorded in 2003 resulting from the stronger British pound, Canadian dollar and Euro as compared to the U.S. dollar. Deferred translation gains of $38 million were recorded in 2002 resulting from the stronger British pound and Euro as compared to the U.S. dollar. Deferred translation losses of $9 million were recorded in 2001 resulting principally from the weaker Canadian dollar, British pound and Euro currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar. The results of our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations. We enter into foreign exchange contracts primarily to minimize our risk of loss from such fluctuations. Exchange rates can impact settlement of our intercompany receivables and payables that result from transfers of finished goods inventories between our affiliates in different countries, and intercompany loans. At December 31, 2003, we had approximately $446 million of foreign exchange contracts outstanding, all maturing in 2004, to buy or sell various currencies. Risks arise from the possible non performance by counterparties in meeting the terms of their contracts and from movements in securities values, interest and or exchange rates. However, we do not anticipate non performance by the counterparties as they are composed of a number of major international financial institutions. Maximum risk of loss on these contracts is limited to the amount of the difference between the spot rate at the date of the contract delivery and the contracted rate. Dividend Policy Our Board of Directors has a policy to pay a cash dividend on common stock each quarter. In setting dividend payments, our board considers the dividend rate in relation to our recent and projected earnings and our capital investment opportunities and requirements. We have paid a dividend each year since 1934. 30 Forward Looking Statements We want to caution readers that any forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in this Form 10 K, other reports or press releases or made by our management involve risks and uncertainties which may change based on various important factors. These forward looking statements are those which talk about the companys or managements current expectations as to the future and include, but are not limited to, statements about the amounts, timing and results of possible restructuring charges and future earnings. Words such as estimate, project, plan, believe, expect, anticipate, intend, and similar expressions may identify such forward looking statements. Some of the factors which could cause future financial performance to differ materially from the expectations as expressed in any forward looking statement made by or on our behalf include: changes in international or national political conditions, including any terrorist attacks negative developments in economic conditions, including adverse impacts on customer demand changes in postal regulations timely development and acceptance of new products success in gaining product approval in new markets where regulatory approval is required successful entry into new markets mailers utilization of alternative means of communication or competitors products the companys success at managing customer credit risk, including risks associated with commercial passenger and cargo aircraft leasing transactions changes in interest rates foreign currency fluctuations cost, timing and execution of the restructuring plan timing and execution of the meter transition plan regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other conditions to consummation of any acquisitions and integration of recent acquisitions impact on mail volume resulting from current concerns over the use of the mail for transmitting harmful biological agents third party suppliers ability to provide product components negative income tax adjustments for prior audit years and changes in tax laws or regulations terms and timing of actions to reduce exposures and disposal of assets in our Capital Services segment continuing developments in the U.S. and foreign airline industry changes in pension and retiree medical costs 31 ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations due to our investing and funding activities and our operations in different foreign currencies. Our objectives in managing our exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve our objectives, we use a balanced mix of debt maturities and variable and fixed rate debt together with interest rate swaps. Our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility in earnings and cash flows associated with the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, we enter into various contracts, which change in value as foreign exchange rates change, to protect the value of external and intercompany transactions. The principal currencies hedged are the British pound, Canadian dollar and Euro. We employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks. We do not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures. We utilize a Value at Risk (VaR) model to determine the maximum potential loss in fair value from changes in market conditions. The VaR model utilizes a variance/co variance approach and assumes normal market conditions, a 95% confidence level and a one day holding period. The model includes all of our debt and all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts. The model excludes anticipated transactions, firm commitments, and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by us, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. During 2003 and 2002, our maximum potential one day loss in fair value of our exposure to foreign exchange rates and interest rates, using the variance/co variance technique described above,was not material. 32
