ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MDA) contains statements that are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in Forward Looking Statements and elsewhere in this report. Overview We achieved solid financial results in 2004, with an exceptionally strong finish to the year. There were six growth engines that propelled our momentum through 2004. Our growth engines include small business solutions, mail services, international, supplies, payment solutions and software. Additionally, we gained significant market share in the production mail market space and our strategy of focusing on targeted services in key vertical markets is proving successful in our management services business. In 2004, we also continued our transformation for long term growth by staying focused on our strategic priorities, which included enhancing our core businesses, streamlining our infrastructure and expanding our presence in the mailstream and document management sectors. Revenue grew 8% in 2004 driven by organic growth in our Global Mailstream Solutions and Global Enterprise Solutions segments, strategic transactions, which contributed 3%, and the favorable impact of foreign currency, which contributed 2%. Strategic transactions in 2004 included the acquisitions of Group 1 Software, Inc. (Group 1), International Mail Express, Inc. (IMEX), Ancora Capital Management Group LLC (Ancora) and Groupe MAG. We also continued actions to reduce our investment in Capital Services and announced our plan to pursue a sponsored spin off of our Capital Services external financing business. Income from continuing operations was $481 million in 2004 compared with $495 million in 2003 and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.05 in 2004 compared with $2.10 in 2003. In 2004, income from continuing operations was reduced by after tax restructuring charges of $101 million, or 43 cents per diluted share, and an after tax charge of $13 million, or 5 cents per diluted share, resulting from the nationwide settlement of the remaining lawsuits related to a program we offer our customers to replace leased equipment if it is lost, stolen or destroyed. In 2003, income from continuing operations was reduced by after tax restructuring charges of $75 million, or 32 cents per diluted share. Diluted earnings per share included 9 cents from non core Capital Services in 2004 compared with 16 cents in 2003. See Results of Continuing Operations for 2004, 2003 and 2002 for a more detailed discussion of our results of operations. Outlook for 2005 We anticipate that we will experience continued strengthening in our financial results in 2005. We expect revenue growth in the range of 7% to 9%, driven by organic growth in our core businesses, strategic transactions and foreign currency, which is expected to contribute approximately 2%. We anticipate that organic revenue growth will continue to be driven by the six growth engines discussed above, as the ongoing changing mix of our product line, where a greater percentage of the revenue is coming from diversified revenue streams associated with fully featured smaller systems and less from larger system sales, continues. Revenue growth at PBMS is expected to benefit from our strategy of focusing on key vertical markets, improving transactional reprographic volumes and reduced consolidation of existing accounts. However, PBMS revenue growth could be moderated as we continue to focus on higher margin service offerings. During 2005, we expect to record additional after tax restructuring charges in the range of $13 million to $26 million, or 6 cents to 11 cents per diluted share, net of the anticipated gain on the sale of our main plant manufacturing facility. These charges relate to the continued realignment and streamlining of our worldwide infrastructure. Including these net restructuring charges, we expect diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.51 to $2.64. Our estimates do not include the impact of adopting new accounting pronouncements during the year or the impact from a potential spin off of our Capital Services external financing business. We anticipate that 2005 earnings will be driven by higher revenue growth and benefits from our cost reduction programs. However, 2005 earnings will be constrained by a year over year decline in earnings from non core Capital Services in the range of 2 cents to 4 cents per diluted share and incremental retiree benefit costs in the range of 6 cents to 8 cents per diluted share. We also anticipate that our interest expense and tax rates will increase in 2005. 10 Results of Continuing Operations 2004 Compared to 2003 Business segment revenue The following table shows revenue in 2004 and 2003 by business segment: (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 % change Global Mailstream Solutions $ 3,390 $ 3,143 8 % Global Enterprise Solutions 1,426 1,280 11 % Capital Services 141 154 (8 )% Total revenue $ 4,957 $ 4,577 8 % Global Mailstream Solutions revenue increased 8% over the prior year driven by organic growth in our worldwide operations, the favorable impact of foreign currency, which contributed 3%, and the acquisitions of Groupe MAG, Ancora and IMEX, which contributed 1%. During the year we experienced an ongoing changing mix of our products, where a greater percentage of the revenue is coming from more fully featured smaller systems, supplies, payment solutions, software and mail services and less from larger system sales. Our mail services operations grew at a double digit rate as a result of strong performance at existing sites and the continued expansion of our mail services network with the acquisitions of Ancora and IMEX. International revenue grew 8% on an organic basis as a result of strong growth throughout most of Europe, driven by an increase in production mail equipment placements with large customers and increased meter and mailing equipment placements by our small business operations. In particular, revenue in the U.K. grew at a double digit rate on a local currency basis due to positive customer reception to our new product lines and improved sales force productivity. Global Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 11% over the prior year driven by a 6% increase at PBMS and a 32% increase at DMT. PBMS revenue increased 6% over the prior year due primarily to the acquisition of DDD Company (DDD), which contributed 5% to revenue growth. Revenue also benefited from new business and a continued improvement in transactional reprographic volumes. Also, the consolidation and reduction of business with existing accounts subsided. Revenue growth was adversely affected by our focus on higher margin service offerings. DMTs revenue increased 32% over the prior year driven by the acquisition of Group 1, which contributed 23%, and ongoing demand for DMTs leading edge, information based inserting and sorting equipment. Group 1, which provides industry leading document composition and mail address hygiene software, experienced strong demand for its software products and services during the year. Capital Services revenue decreased 8% over the prior year consistent with our strategy to reduce our exposure to non core, long term financing. Business segment earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) The following table shows EBIT in 2004 and 2003 by business segment: (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 % change Global Mailstream Solutions $ 1,052 $ 992 6 % Global Enterprise Solutions 94 81 16 % Capital Services 81 99 (18 )% Total EBIT $ 1,227 $ 1,172 5 % Global Mailstream Solutions EBIT increased 6% driven by revenue growth and the effect of our continued emphasis on reducing costs and controlling operating expenses. EBIT margins were adversely affected by the increase in mix of international and mail services revenues. The EBIT increase in our Global Enterprise Solutions segment included an 8% increase at PBMS and a 32% increase at DMT. PBMS EBIT margins improved slightly versus the prior year, helped by our focus on higher margin service offerings and ongoing administrative cost reduction measures. DMTs EBIT growth reflects the increase in revenue for the year. EBIT decreased 18% in the Capital Services segment, consistent with our ongoing strategy to reduce our exposure to non core, long term financing. 11 Revenue by source The following table shows revenue in 2004 and 2003 by source: (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 % change Sales $ 1,463 $ 1,326 10 % Rentals 804 785 2 % Business services 1,268 1,119 13 % Support services 683 618 11 % Core financing 640 616 4 % Non core financing 99 113 (12 )% Total revenue $ 4,957 $ 4,577 8 % Sales revenue increased 10% over the prior year due to strong growth in sales of international mailing equipment, DMT equipment and supplies; the acquisition of Group 1, which contributed 2%; and the favorable impact of foreign currency, which contributed 4%. Rentals revenue increased 2% due to the favorable impact of foreign currency. At December 31, 2004, digital meters represented approximately 75% of our U.S. meter base, up from 67% in 2003. Business services revenue includes revenue from PBMS and mail services. Business services revenue increased 13% due primarily to the acquisitions of IMEX, Ancora and DDD, which contributed 8%, and strong growth at our existing mail services sites. Support services revenue increased 11% due primarily to the acquisition of Group 1, which contributed 5%; the favorable impact of foreign currency, which contributed 3%; a larger population of international equipment maintenance agreements; and higher professional services revenue at DMT. Support services revenue continues to be partially dependent on equipment sales levels. Core financing revenue increased 4% due primarily to growth in postal payment solutions and the favorable impact of foreign currency, which contributed 2%. Non core financing revenue decreased 12% consistent with our ongoing planned strategy to reduce our exposure to non core, long term financing. Costs of revenue The following table summarizes costs of revenue as a percentage of related revenue in 2004 and 2003: Percentage of Revenue (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2004 2003 Cost of sales $ 664 $ 612 45.4 % 46.1 % Cost of rentals $ 164 $ 171 20.4 % 21.7 % Cost of business services $ 1,047 $ 921 82.5 % 82.3 % Cost of support services $ 354 $ 323 51.8 % 52.3 % Cost of sales, as a percentage of sales revenue, decreased compared with 2003, primarily due to lower costs resulting from our successful transition to outsourcing of parts for digital equipment and an increase in mix of higher margin software and supplies revenue. Cost of rentals, as a percentage of rentals revenue, decreased compared with 2003, as a result of lower depreciation costs associated with our standalone meters and lower repair costs resulting from the shift from electronic to digital meters. Cost of business services, as a percentage of business services revenue, increased compared with 2003, primarily due to initial higher costs associated with our expansion to new sites in our mail services operations. Cost of support services, as a percentage of support services revenue, decreased compared with 2003, primarily due to higher margin software support services revenue at Group 1, partially offset by the increase in mix of lower margin international support services revenue. 12 Cost of non core financing Cost of non core financing in 2004 relates to the sale of a non core Capital Services operating lease. Selling, general and administrative expenses The following table shows selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2004 and 2003: Percentage of Revenue (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2004 2003 $ 1,511 $ 1,400 30.5 % 30.6 % Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, decreased compared with 2003, as a result of our emphasis on controlling operating expenses, partially offset by costs associated with investments in infrastructure improvements, organizational transformation programs and growth initiatives. Research and development expenses The following table shows research and development expenses in 2004 and 2003: (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 % change $ 160 $ 147 9 % Research and development expenses increased 9% in 2004 due primarily to research and development at Group 1. The increase also reflects our continued investment in developing new technologies and enhancing features for all our products, including expenditures for new digital meters and mailing machines, billing and statement software, distribution and logistics software, advanced inserting equipment and mail sorting equipment. Net interest expense The following table shows net interest expense in 2004 and 2003: (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 % change $ 169 $ 165 2 % Net interest expense increased 2% in 2004 due to higher average debt outstanding during the year. Our variable and fixed rate debt mix, after adjusting for the effect of interest rate swaps, was 30% and 70%, respectively, at December 31, 2004. Based on our borrowings at December 31, 2004, a one percentage point change in short term interest rates would impact annual interest expense by approximately $12 million. Effective tax rate The following table shows the effective tax rate in 2004 and 2003: 2004 2003 31.3 % 31.4 % The effective tax rate in 2004 and 2003 included tax benefits of 1.0% and .6%, respectively, from restructuring charges. The effective tax rate was negatively impacted by our strategy to cease originating non core, long term Capital Services financing. The tax rate continued to benefit from our international expansion and our continued investment in developing new technologies. Our provision for taxes could be affected by tax law changes and interpretations by governments or courts. We expect our effective tax rate in 2005 to increase as we continue to implement our Capital Services strategy outlined on page 17. 13 Results of Continuing Operations 2003 Compared to 2002 In 2003, revenue increased 4%, income from continuing operations increased 13% and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 16% to $2.10 compared with $1.81 in 2002. Revenue growth for 2003 was driven primarily by the favorable impact of foreign currency, which contributed 3%, and by the acquisitions of DDD and PSI Group, Inc. (PSI), which contributed 1%, and more than offset the negative impact of lower revenue from non core Capital Services financing. In 2003, income from continuing operations was reduced by after tax restructuring charges of $75 million or 32 cents per diluted share and after tax contributions to charitable foundations of $6 million or 3 cents per diluted share, and increased by after tax income of $6 million or 3 cents per diluted share resulting from the favorable resolution of contingencies related to a settlement of a class action lawsuit that was settled in 2002. In 2002, income from continuing operations was reduced by a non cash after tax Capital Services charge of $134 million or 56 cents per diluted share, related to a write down of our investments in commercial passenger aircraft leasing, and to increase our provision for credit losses primarily related to the rapid deterioration of the U.S. airline industry. Diluted earnings per share included 16 cents from non core Capital Services in 2003 compared with 24 cents in 2002. During 2003, we generated $851 million of cash from operating activities, repurchased 5.4 million shares of our common stock and increased our common stock dividend for the twenty second consecutive year. Business segment revenue The following table shows revenue in 2003 and 2002 by business segment: (Dollars in millions) 2003 2002 % change Global Mailstream Solutions $ 3,143 $ 2,998 5 % Global Enterprise Solutions 1,280 1,229 4 % Capital Services 154 183 (16 )% Total revenue $ 4,577 $ 4,410 4 % Global Mailstream Solutions revenue increased 5% over the prior year driven by the favorable impact of foreign currency, which contributed 3%, and the acquisition of PSI, which contributed 2%. Revenue was negatively impacted by delayed decision making by customers for equipment upgrades and new equipment purchases at the high end of our product line due to business and economic uncertainty. Global Mailstream Solutions revenue in the U.S. grew 2% driven by growth in small business mailing products and mail services operations partially offset by lower financing and sales revenue from slower equipment sales. Within the Global Mailstream Solutions segment, international mailing revenue increased 14% primarily as a result of the favorable impact of foreign currency. On a local currency basis, Canada, France and the Nordic countries experienced good revenue growth. Canadas revenue grew on a local currency basis due to increased leasing of equipment, improved support services revenue and strong placements of new digital meter systems and high end production mailing systems. Frances revenue grew on a local currency basis due to the integration and success of the Secap organization. This revenue growth was achieved despite lower revenue in some European countries, such as Germany, and Asia where economic conditions deteriorated and as a result demand has been slower for mailing equipment in a post meter migration environment. Global Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 4% over the prior year driven by a 3% increase at PBMS and an 8% increase at DMT. PBMS revenue increased 3% over the prior year as a result of the favorable impact of foreign currency and the acquisition of DDD, which more than offset the adverse impact of contraction of business in large enterprise accounts. Contraction of business in the telecommunications, financial services and transaction based legal services industries continued to have an adverse impact on PBMS revenue growth and operating margins, which resulted in the loss of higher margin business with long term customers as they continued to downsize their businesses in 2003. The acquisition of DDD demonstrates PBMS strategy to accelerate diversification into the government vertical as well as to expand cross selling opportunities. The diversification of its customer base will help offset the weakness that still exists in many other customer segments. DMTs revenue increased 8% over the prior year driven by sales of DMTs inserter and sorting equipment. DMT was adversely impacted during the first half of 2003 by reduced capital spending as businesses continued to delay large capital spending decisions, which in turn slowed worldwide demand for our high speed production mail equipment and mail processing software. Orders for inserter equipment have been strong over the second half of 2003 as businesses appear to have gradually increased their capital spending in anticipation of an improving economy. Capital Services revenue decreased 16% consistent with our strategy to reduce our exposure to non core, long term financing. 14 Business segment EBIT The following table shows EBIT in 2003 and 2002 by business segment: (Dollars in millions) 2003 2002 % change Global Mailstream Solutions $ 992 $ 952 4 % Global Enterprise Solutions 81 101 (20 )% Capital Services 99 120 (18 )% Total EBIT $ 1,172 $ 1,173 % Global Mailstream Solutions EBIT increased 4% supported by revenue growth and the effect of our continued emphasis on reducing costs and controlling operating expenses. EBIT was favorably impacted by foreign currency. EBIT was adversely affected by moderating customer orders and upgrades due to the continuing weak economy and a shift to lower margin products and services. The decrease in EBIT in our Global Enterprise Solutions segment resulted from a 30% EBIT decrease at PBMS partially offset by an 8% EBIT increase at DMT. EBIT at PBMS was adversely impacted by acquiring new lower margin accounts, lost higher margin accounts, and contraction of businesses in the telecommunications, financial services and transaction based legal services sectors. PBMS continued its actions to offset economic sensitivity by diversifying its customer base into other market segments and providing higher value services to existing customers while reducing general and administrative expenses to address margin pressures. DMTs EBIT growth resulted from increased placements of high margin equipment. EBIT decreased 18% in the Capital Services segment consistent with our strategy to reduce our exposure to non core, long term financing. Revenue by source The following table shows revenue in 2003 and 2002 by source: (Dollars in millions) 2003 2002 % change Sales $ 1,326 $ 1,309 1 % Rentals 785 765 3 % Business services 1,119 1,011 11 % Support services 618 582 6 % Core financing 616 601 3 % Non core financing 113 142 (21 )% Total revenue $ 4,577 $ 4,410 4 % Sales revenue increased 1% over the prior year due to strong supplies sales, sales of DMT equipment and the favorable impact of foreign currency, which more than offset the impact of delayed decision making for upgrades and new equipment purchases at the high end of our Global Mailstream Solutions product lines. Rentals revenue increased 3% primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign currency, which contributed 2%, and the strong placements of our digital standalone meters and new digital system meters. At December 31, 2003, digital meters represented approximately 67% of our U.S. meter base, up from 58% in 2002. Business services revenue includes revenue from PBMS and PSI. PBMS revenue increased 3% due mainly to the acquisition of DDD and the favorable impact of foreign currency. Revenue growth at PBMS was adversely affected by the continued contraction of large enterprise accounts, especially in the telecommunications, financial services and legal sectors, which resulted in the loss of higher margin business with our long term customers as they continued to downsize their businesses in 2003. Revenue at PSI, which was acquired on August 1, 2002, increased business services revenue 8% driven by the expansion of our presort network to 22 sites at December 31, 2003 from 17 sites at December 31, 2002. Support services revenue increased 6% due primarily to an increased service contract base and the favorable impact of foreign currency, which contributed 3%. Despite competitive pricing pressures, Global Mailstream Solutions achieved a strong increase in support services revenue due to a larger population of equipment maintenance agreements. DMT had growth in support services revenue driven by higher professional services revenue. Ongoing support services revenue continues to be partially dependent on equipment sales levels. Core financing revenue increased 3% due primarily to the favorable impact of foreign currency. Non core financing revenue decreased 21% consistent with our strategy to reduce our exposure to non core, long term financing. 15 Costs of revenue The following table summarizes costs of revenue as a percentage of related revenue in 2003 and 2002: Percentage of Revenue (Dollars in millions) 2003 2002 2003 2002 Cost of sales $ 612 $ 593 46.1 % 45.3 % Cost of rentals $ 171 $ 174 21.7 % 22.7 % Cost of business services $ 921 $ 814 82.3 % 80.5 % Cost of support services $ 323 $ 297 52.3 % 51.1 % Cost of sales, as a percentage of sales revenue, increased compared with 2002, primarily due to the increase in mix of lower margin international and DMT revenue and the initial costs associated with our transition to outsourcing parts for digital equipment. Cost of rentals, as a percentage of rentals revenue, decreased compared with 2002, as a result of lower depreciation costs associated with our standalone meters and lower repair costs resulting from the shift from electronic to digital meters. Cost of business services, as a percentage of business services revenue, increased compared with 2002, primarily due to initial lower margins, higher start up costs and delayed implementation associated with new accounts and sites, the loss of higher margin business with long term customers as they continued to downsize and higher employee benefit costs. Cost of support services, as a percentage of support services revenue, increased compared with 2002, primarily due to the increase in mix of lower margin international support services revenue, partially offset by our emphasis on controlling operating expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses The following table shows selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2003 and 2002: Percentage of Revenue (Dollars in millions) 2003 2002 2003 2002 $ 1,400 $ 1,378 30.6 % 31.3 % Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, decreased compared with 2002, as a result of our emphasis on controlling operating expenses, partially offset by costs associated with investments in infrastructure improvements, organizational transformation programs and growth initiatives. Research and development expenses The following table shows research and development expenses in 2003 and 2002: (Dollars in millions) 2003 2002 % change $ 147 $ 141 4 % Research and development expenses increased 4% in 2003 to $147 million, reflecting our continued investment in developing new technologies and enhancing features for all our products. This increase represents expenditures for new digital meters and mailing machines, billing and statement software, distribution and logistics software, advanced inserting equipment and mail sorting equipment. Net interest expense The following table shows net interest expense in 2003 and 2002: (Dollars in millions) 2003 2002 % change $ 165 $ 179 (8 )% Net interest expense decreased 8% in 2003 due to lower average interest rates and lower average borrowings associated with our investment in leasing and rental products, acquisitions, dividends, and our stock repurchase program. Our variable and fixed rate debt mix, after adjusting for the effect of interest rate swaps, was 30% and 70%, respectively, at December 31, 2003. 16 Effective tax rate The following table shows the effective tax rate in 2003 and 2002: 2003 2002 31.4 % 29.3 % The effective tax rate in 2003 included a .6% tax benefit from restructuring charges recorded in 2003. The effective tax rate in 2002 included a 2.0% tax benefit related to our Capital Services charge recorded in 2002. The effective tax rate was negatively impacted by our strategy to cease originating non core, long term Capital Services financing. The tax rate continues to benefit from leasing and financing activities. The tax rate is also favorably affected by our international expansion and our continued investment in developing new technologies. Our provision for taxes could be affected by tax law changes and interpretations by governments or courts. Capital Services Capital Services strategy In December 2004, our Board of Directors approved a plan to pursue a sponsored spin off of our Capital Services external financing business. The new entity will be an independent publicly traded company consisting of most of the assets in our Capital Services segment, including assets related to Imagistics International, Inc. We have entered into negotiations with a third party interested in investing in the new entity. The decision to move forward with the spin off will be contingent upon reaching agreement on terms with an investor, prevailing market conditions at the time of the proposed spin off, regulatory review and the receipt of a favorable ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that the spin off will be tax free. The decision to pursue the option of a sponsored spin off is consistent with our ongoing planned strategy of reducing our risks associated with complex, long term financing transactions. This will enable us to sharpen our focus on our core businesses consistent with our strategic priorities and will enhance our financial flexibility going forward. We liquidated approximately $49 million, $337 million and $225 million of non core Capital Services assets in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Diluted earnings per share from non core Capital Services was 9 cents, 16 cents and 24 cents for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Capital Services portfolio Our investment in Capital Services lease related assets included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets is composed of the following: December 31(Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 Leveraged leases $ 1,585 $ 1,535 Finance receivables (1) 633 450 Other assets (1) 51 Rental equipment (1) 54 18 Total $ 2,272 $ 2,054 (1) On March 31, 2004 we adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation (FIN) No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, and consolidated the assets and liabilities of PBG Capital Partners LLC (PBG). Accordingly, the increase in finance receivables and rental equipment at December 31, 2004 reflects the consolidated assets of PBG. Other assets at December 31, 2003 represented our investment in PBG, which at that time was accounted for under the equity method of accounting. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further details on the impact of adopting FIN No. 46. Our investment in leveraged lease assets is composed of the following: December 31(Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 Rental receivables $ 7,820 $ 8,043 Residual value 534 550 Principal and interest on nonrecourse loans (6,019 ) (6,263 ) Unearned income (750 ) (795 ) Total leveraged leases $ 1,585 $ 1,535 17 Rental receivables represent total lease payments from our customers over the remaining term of the leveraged leases. Residual value represents the value of the property anticipated at the end of the leveraged lease terms and is based on appraisals or other sources of estimated value. We regularly review the recorded residual value for impairments deemed to be other than temporary and record adjustments as appropriate. Principal and interest on nonrecourse loans represent amounts due to unrelated third parties from our customers over the remaining term of the leveraged leases. The nonrecourse loans are secured by the lessees rental obligations and the leased property. If a lessee defaults and if the amounts realized from the sale of these assets are insufficient, we have no obligation to make any payments due on these nonrecourse loans to the unrelated third parties. Accordingly, we are required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) to subtract the principal and interest over the remaining term of the nonrecourse loans from our rental receivables and residual value. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the principal balances on the nonrecourse loans totaled $3.4 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively, and the related interest payments over the remaining terms of the leases totaled $2.6 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. Unearned income represents our future financing income that will be earned over the remaining term of the leases. Total leveraged leases represent the amount that is recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The investment in total leveraged leases in our Consolidated Balance Sheets is diversified across the following types of assets: (Dollars in millions) Original Lease Term December 31 2004 2003 (in years) Locomotives and rail cars $ 382 $ 360 20 40 Postal equipment 356 338 16 24 Commercial aircraft 275 279 23 25 Commercial real estate 242 236 17 25 Telecommunications 141 139 14 16 Rail and bus 133 132 27 37 Shipping and handling 56 51 24 Total leveraged leases $ 1,585 $ 1,535 At December 31, 2004 and 2003, our leveraged lease investment in commercial real estate facilities included approximately $92 million and $88 million, respectively, related to leases of corporate facilities to four U.S. telecommunication entities, of which $76 million and $73 million, respectively, is with lessees that are highly rated. Additionally, our leveraged lease investment in telecommunications equipment represents leases to three highly rated international telecommunication entities. At December 31, 2004 substantially all of this portfolio is further secured by equity defeasance accounts or other third party credit arrangements. At December 31, 2004 approximately 53% of our total leveraged lease portfolio is further secured by equity defeasance accounts or other third party credit arrangements. In addition, at December 31, 2004 approximately 18% of the remaining leveraged lease portfolio represents leases to highly rated government related organizations that have guarantees or supplemental credit enhancements upon the occurrence of certain events. Finance receivables are composed of the following: December 31(Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 Large ticket single investor leases (1) $ 350 $ 178 Imagistics lease portfolio 283 272 Total finance receivables $ 633 $ 450 (1) The increase in large ticket single investor leases at December 31, 2004 reflects the change in Capital Services strategy and the consolidated assets of PBG. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further details on the impact of adopting FIN No. 46. Investment in commercial passenger and cargo aircraft leasing transactions At December 31, 2004 and 2003, our net investment in commercial passenger and cargo aircraft leasing transactions, net of related debt and minority interest, was $276 million and $298 million, respectively, which is composed of transactions with U.S. airlines of $24 million and $41 million, respectively, and foreign airlines of $252 million and $257 million, respectively. Our net investment in commercial passenger and cargo aircraft leasing portfolio is composed of investments in leveraged lease transactions, direct financing 18 lease transactions and a portion of our investment in PBG. Risk of loss under these transactions is primarily related to: (1) the inability of the airline to make underlying lease payments; (2) our inability to generate sufficient cash flows either through the sale of the aircraft or secondary lease transactions to recover our net investment; and or (3) in the case of the leveraged lease portfolio, the default of an equity defeasance or other third party credit arrangements. At December 31, 2004 approximately 45% of our remaining net investment in commercial passenger and cargo aircraft leasing investments was further secured by approximately $123 million of equity defeasance accounts or third party credit arrangements. Capital Services charges In 2002, we recorded a non cash pre tax charge of approximately $213 million, to write down our investments in commercial passenger aircraft leases primarily with US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways) and United Air Lines (United) and to increase our provision for credit losses primarily related to commercial passenger aircraft leasing investments in the U.S. The pre tax charge was composed of the following: (1) A write down of U.S. aircraft lease receivables and residuals of approximately $110 million; (2) Additional credit loss reserves related to U.S. aircraft lease investments of approximately $82 million; (3) Other costs related to our aircraft leasing investments of approximately $1 million; and (4) Additional credit loss reserves related to non aircraft Capital Services investments of approximately $20 million. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. Off Balance Sheet Items Finance receivable sales As part of our Capital Services programs, we have from time to time sold, through securitizations, net finance receivables with limited recourse. In these transactions, we have surrendered control over the transferred assets in accordance with paragraph 9 of FAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities, and received a cash payment from the transferee. Specifically, the finance receivables were sold to a bankruptcy remote limited liability company. At the time of sale, we obtained legal counsels opinion that the assets were isolated and that the sale qualified as a true sale at law. Under the terms of the sale, the transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the assets it received. There are no conditions that both constrain the transferee from taking advantage of its right to pledge or exchange and provide more than a trivial benefit to the transferor. We do not maintain effective control over the transferred assets. We have accounted for these transactions as a sale, recognizing assets obtained and liabilities incurred in consideration as proceeds of the sale. Any resulting gain or loss was recognized in income at the time of sale. The maximum risk of loss in these transactions arises from the possible non performance of lessees to meet the terms of their contracts. We believe adequate provisions for losses have been established for receivables sold which may become uncollectible and for which we have recourse obligation, in accordance with paragraph 113 of FAS No. 140. In selective cases, when we have sold net finance receivables, we entered into guarantee contracts with varying amounts of recourse in privately placed transactions with unrelated third party investors. The uncollected principal balance of receivables sold and guarantee contracts totaled $99 million and $126 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In accordance with GAAP, we do not record these amounts as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our maximum risk of loss on these net finance receivables and guarantee contracts arises from the possible non performance of lessees to meet the terms of their contracts and from changes in the value of the underlying equipment. These contracts are secured by the underlying equipment value, and supported by the creditworthiness of our customers. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the underlying equipment value exceeded the sum of the uncollected principal balance of receivables sold and the guarantee contracts. As part of our review of our risk exposure, we believe we have made adequate provision for sold receivables and guarantee contracts which may not be collectible. See Notes 17, 19 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements. Restructuring Charges In January 2003, we undertook restructuring initiatives related to realigned infrastructure requirements and reduced manufacturing needs for digital equipment. In connection with these initiatives, we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $158 million and $117 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We expect these restructuring initiatives to be substantially completed by the end of 2005 and currently estimate 2005 pre tax restructuring charges to be in the range of $20 million to $40 million, net of the anticipated gain on the sale of our main plant manufacturing facility. As we continue to finalize our 2005 restructuring plans, the ultimate amount and timing of the restructuring charges may differ from our current estimates. The charges related to these restructuring initiatives will be recorded as the various initiatives take effect. 19 The cash outflows related to restructuring charges are funded primarily by cash from operating activities. The restructuring initiatives are expected to continue to increase our operating efficiency and effectiveness in 2005 and beyond while enhancing growth, primarily as a result of reduced personnel related expenses. We realized incremental pre tax benefits of approximately $45 million and $25 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, from these restructuring initiatives and currently estimate incremental pre tax benefits from these initiatives in the range of $40 million to $50 million in 2005. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for our accounting policy related to restructuring charges. The pre tax restructuring charges are composed of: (Dollars in millions) Restructuring charges Non cash charges Cash payments Balance December 31 2003 Severance and benefit costs $ 81 $ $ (54 ) $ 27 Asset impairments 27 (27 ) Other exit costs 9 (4 ) 5 $ 117 $ (27 ) $ (58 ) $ 32 2004 Severance and benefit costs $ 76 $ $ (55 ) $ 48 Asset impairments 73 (73 ) Other exit costs 9 (11 ) 3 $ 158 $ (73 ) $ (66 ) $ 51 All restructuring charges, except for the asset impairments, will result in cash outflows. The severance and benefit costs relate to a reduction in workforce of approximately 2,300 employees worldwide from the inception of this plan through December 31, 2004 and expected future workforce reductions of approximately 1,000 employees. The workforce reductions relate to actions across several of our businesses resulting from infrastructure and process improvements and our continuing efforts to streamline operations, and include managerial, professional, clerical and technical roles. Approximately 60% of the workforce reductions to date are in the U.S. The majority of the international workforce reductions are in Europe and Canada. Restructuring charges in 2004 included a pre tax charge of $28 million related to the planned closure of a manufacturing facility in Germany. Asset impairments in 2004 included a $47 million charge related to the write down of capitalized system development costs, related to order management processes, as a result of our changing business profile and our organizational realignment. Asset impairments in 2003 included a $24 million charge as a result of our decision to exit our main plant manufacturing facility in Connecticut in connection with our product sourcing and real estate optimization strategy. Other asset impairments in 2004 and 2003 relate primarily to the write down of property, plant and equipment resulting from the closure or streamlining of certain facilities and systems. The fair values of the impaired long lived assets were determined primarily using probability weighted expected cash flows in accordance with FAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. Other exit costs relate primarily to lease termination costs, non cancelable lease payments, consolidation of excess facilities and other costs associated with exiting business activities. In January 2005, our Board of Directors approved the sale of our main plant manufacturing facility in Connecticut. In connection with this transaction, we expect to record a pre tax gain of approximately $30 million in 2005. Other Income (Expense) Charitable contributions In 2003, we recorded a pre tax charge of $10 million ($6 million net of taxes) related to contributions to two charitable foundations. Legal settlements, net In 2004, we recorded a pre tax charge of approximately $20 million associated with the settlement of lawsuits related to a program we offer to some of our leasing customers to replace equipment if it is lost, stolen or destroyed. The $20 million charge relates to the following settlement costs: certificates to be provided to members of the class for purchase of office products through our diverse supply line and the cost of legal fees and related expenses. See Legal Proceedings in Item 3 of this Form 10 K for information regarding our legal proceedings. In 2001, we recorded a pre tax charge of approximately $24 million associated with the settlement of a lawsuit related to lease upgrade pricing in the early to mid 1990s. The $24 million charge relates to the following settlement costs: award certificates to be provided to members of the class for purchase of office products through the Pitney Bowes supply line and the cost of legal fees and related expenses. In 2003, we recorded pre tax income of $10 million ($6 million net of taxes) related to the expiration of product award certificates provided in connection with this settlement. 20 Acquisitions In December 2004, we acquired Groupe MAG for a net purchase price of $43 million of cash. Groupe MAG is a distributor of production mail equipment, software and services in France, Belgium and Luxembourg. In November 2004, we acquired a substantial portion of the assets of Ancora for a net purchase price of $37 million of cash. Ancora is a provider of first class, standard letter and international mail processing and presort services with five operations in southern California, Pennsylvania and Maryland. In July 2004, we acquired Group 1 for a net purchase price of $329 million of cash. Group 1 is an industry leader in software that enhances mailing efficiency, data quality and customer communications. In May 2004, we acquired substantially all of the assets of IMEX for a net purchase price of $30 million of cash. IMEX consolidates letters and flat sized mail headed to international addresses to reduce postage costs and expedite delivery. In October 2003, we acquired DDD for a final net purchase price, following post closing adjustments, of $48.6 million, which consisted of approximately $24.3 million of cash and the issuance of common stock valued at $24.3 million. DDD offers a broad array of services including, fulfillment services, secure mail processing, messenger services, logistics support, and record and information management. In August 2002, we acquired PSI for approximately $127 million of cash and $39 million in assumed debt. PSI, the nations largest mail presort company, prepares, sorts and aggregates mail to earn postal discounts and expedite delivery for its customers. We accounted for these acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and accordingly, the operating results of these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. These acquisitions did not materially impact income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, we also completed several smaller acquisitions, including additional sites for our mail services operations and some of our international dealerships. We also acquired the hardware equipment services business of Standard Register Inc. at the end of 2004, one of our address printing suppliers in 2003 and completed the acquisition of the remaining 43% ownership interest of MailCode Inc. in 2002. The cost of these acquisitions in the aggregate was less than $75 million in each year. These acquisitions did not have a material impact on our financial results either individually or on an aggregate basis. These acquisitions are included in other investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. Discontinued Operations On January 14, 2000, we sold Atlantic Mortgage Investment Corporation (AMIC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, to ABN AMRO North America. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a gain of $2.3 million (net of taxes of $1.6 million) and $12.5 million (net of taxes of $7.4 million) for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These gains resulted from the favorable resolution of certain contingent liabilities recorded at the time of sale. On October 30, 1998, Colonial Pacific Leasing Corporation (CPLC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, transferred the operations, employees and substantially all assets related to its broker oriented external financing business to General Electric Capital Corporation, a subsidiary of the General Electric Company. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a gain of $.9 million (net of taxes of $.6 million) and $25.5 million (net of taxes of $15.0 million) for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These gains resulted from the favorable resolution of certain contingent liabilities recorded at the time of sale. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities decreased to .82 to 1 at December 31, 2004 compared with .95 to 1 at December 31, 2003. The decrease in this ratio was due primarily to the reclassification of current maturities of long term debt to short term debt. See Financings and Capitalization for further details. To manage interest rate risk, we use a balanced mix of debt maturities, variable and fixed rate debt and interest rate swap agreements. Our fixed to floating percentages were 70% and 30%, respectively, at December 31, 2004 and 2003. During 2003, we took advantage of lower interest rates in refinancing the debt in our portfolio that matured during the year. This will better position us against a rise in interest rates in the future. 21 The ratio of total debt to total debt and stockholders equity was 75.5% at December 31, 2004 versus 76.7% at December 31, 2003. Including the preferred stockholders equity in a subsidiary company as debt, the ratio of total debt to total debt and stockholders equity was 76.9% at December 31, 2004 compared to 78.1% at December 31, 2003. The decrease in this ratio was driven primarily by net income and favorable foreign currency translation adjustments, offset by an increase in debt, stock repurchases and the payment of dividends. The following table summarizes our cash flows in 2004 and 2003: (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 Cash flows from operating activities: Net income $ 481 $ 498 Nonrecurring charges, net 113 71 Nonrecurring payments (66 ) (73 ) Depreciation and amortization 307 289 Increase in deferred taxes on income and income taxes payable 211 195 Pension plan investment (50 ) Net investment in internal finance receivables (74 ) (60 ) Other operating assets and liabilities (27 ) (19 ) Net cash provided by operating activities 945 851 Net cash used in investing activities (772 ) (34 ) Net cash used in financing activities (194 ) (850 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 7 12 Decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (14 ) $ (21 ) 2004 Cash flows Net cash provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net income adjusted for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Nonrecurring charges, net, consisted primarily of restructuring charges. Nonrecurring payments consisted of severance payments made in connection with our restructuring program. The increase in our deferred taxes and income taxes payable balances contributed $211 million to cash from operations, resulting from continued tax benefits from our internal financing and Capital Services leasing activities. The increase in our internal finance receivables balances reduced cash from operations by $74 million, reflecting growth in equipment placements and our postal payment business during the year. Other operating assets and liabilities reduced our cash from operations by $27 million primarily due to higher accounts receivable balances that resulted from strong equipment sales at the end of the year. Net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of capital expenditures, acquisitions and other investing activities, partially offset by cash generated from Capital Services asset sales and reserve account deposits. Capital expenditures were $317 million reflecting our continued investment in property, plant, equipment and rental assets. We generated $17 million from our net investment in Capital Services reflecting our strategy to reduce our exposure to non core Capital Services. We used $500 million for acquisitions and other investing activities, reflecting the continued implementation of our growth strategies. We generated $28 million from our reserve account deposits driven by growth in our postal payment business. Net cash used in financing activities consisted primarily of dividends paid to stockholders of $282 million and stock repurchases of $200 million, partially offset by net debt proceeds of $215 million and by proceeds from issuance of stock of $73 million. 2003 Cash flows Net cash provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net income adjusted for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Nonrecurring charges, net, consisted primarily of restructuring charges. Nonrecurring payments consisted primarily of severance payments made in connection with our restructuring program. We made a $50 million pension plan contribution. The increase in our deferred taxes and income taxes payable balances contributed $195 million to cash from operations, resulting from continued tax benefits from our internal financing and Capital Services leasing activities. The increase in our internal finance receivables balances reduced cash from operations by $60 million, reflecting growth in equipment placements and our postal payment business during the year. Other operating assets and liabilities reduced our cash from operations by $19 million. Net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of capital expenditures, acquisitions and other investing activities, partially offset by cash generated from asset sales at Capital Services and reserve account deposits. Capital expenditures were $286 million reflecting our continued investment in property, plant, equipment and rental assets. We generated $304 million from our net investment in Capital Services, reflecting our strategy to reduce our exposure to non core financing assets. We used $107 million for 22 acquisitions and other investing activities, reflecting the continued implementation of our growth strategies. We generated $50 million from our reserve account deposits driven by growth in our postal payment business. Net cash used in financing activities consisted primarily of dividends paid to stockholders of $281 million, stock repurchases of $200 million and net debt payments of $422 million, partially offset by proceeds from issuance of stock of $52 million. Financings and Capitalization In February 2005, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for issuances of up to $2.5 billion in debt securities, preferred stock, preference stock, common stock, purchase contracts, depositary shares, warrants and units. At December 31, 2004, $5.8 million remained available under the shelf registration statement filed in October 2001 with the SEC, permitting issuances of up to $2 billion in debt securities, preferred stock and depositary shares. In April 2003, as part of this shelf registration statement, we established a medium term note program for the issuance of up to $1.38 billion in aggregate principal, representing the remaining amount available on the shelf at that time. At December 31, 2004, we had unused lines of credit and revolving credit facilities of $1.5 billion in the U.S. and $10.6 million outside the U.S., primarily to support commercial paper issuance. In November 2004, we issued $100 million of unsecured fixed rate notes maturing in August 2014. These notes bear interest at an annual rate of 4.875% and pay interest semi annually beginning February 2005. This issuance was a reopening of the 4.875% notes due August 2014, originally issued in August 2004. The proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper and the repurchase of company stock. In August 2004, we issued $350 million of unsecured fixed rate notes maturing in August 2014. These notes bear interest at an annual rate of 4.875% and pay interest semi annually beginning February 2005. The proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper, financing of acquisitions and the repurchase of company stock. We believe our financing needs in the short and long term can be met with cash generated internally, money from existing credit agreements, debt issued under new and existing shelf registration statements and our existing commercial paper programs. Information on debt maturities is presented in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The following summarizes our known contractual obligations at December 31, 2004 and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods: Payments due by period (Dollars in millions) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Commercial paper borrowings $ 538 $ 538 $ $ $ Long term debt and current portion of long term debt 3,438 639 361 811 1,627 Non cancelable capital lease obligations 7 2 4 1 Non cancelable operating lease obligations 251 74 99 46 32 Purchase obligations (1) 180 171 9 Total $ 4,414 $ 1,424 $ 473 $ 858 $ 1,659 (1) Purchase obligations include unrecorded agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding upon us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. (2) Other noncurrent liabilities of $355 million included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2004 relate primarily to our non pension postretirement benefits. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. 23 Capital Expenditures During 2004, capital expenditures included net additions of $185 million to property, plant and equipment and $132 million of rental equipment and related inventories compared with $185 million and $101 million, respectively, in 2003. These additions included expenditures for plant and manufacturing equipment and infrastructure improvements as well as investments associated with new accounts at PBMS. The addition of rental equipment relates primarily to postage meters and increased over the prior year due to higher placements of our digital meters during 2004. We expect capital expenditures in 2005 to be approximately the same as 2004. These investments will also be affected by the timing of our customers transition to digital meters. At December 31, 2004, commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment as well as rental equipment for new and replacement programs reflected the items discussed above. Critical Accounting Policies We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations. We have discussed the impact and any associated risks on our results of operations related to these policies throughout the MDA. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include, but are not limited to, customer cancellations, bad debts, inventory obsolescence, residual values of leased assets, useful lives of long lived assets and intangible assets, warranty obligations, restructuring, pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies and litigation, and allocation of purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired in business combinations. Our actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. We believe the assumptions and estimates used are reasonable and appropriate in accordance with GAAP. Revenue recognition Multiple element and internal financing arrangements We derive our revenue from multiple sources including sales, rentals, financing and services. Certain of our transactions are consummated at the same time and can therefore generate revenue from multiple sources. The most common form of these transactions involves a non cancelable equipment lease, a meter rental and an equipment maintenance agreement. As a result, we are required to determine whether the deliverables in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and if so, how the price should be allocated among the delivered elements and when to recognize revenue for each element. In multiple element arrangements, we recognize revenue for each of the elements based on their respective fair values in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. We recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known and uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved. Our allocation of the fair values to the various elements does not change the total revenue recognized from a transaction, but impacts the timing of revenue recognition. Revenue is allocated to the meter rental and equipment maintenance agreement elements first using their respective fair values, which are determined based on prices charged in standalone and renewal transactions. Revenue is then allocated to the equipment based on the present value of the remaining minimum lease payments. We then compare the allocated equipment fair value to the range of cash selling prices in standalone transactions during the period to ensure the allocated equipment fair value approximates average cash selling prices. We provide lease financing for our products primarily through sales type leases. We classify our leases in accordance with FAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases. The vast majority of our leases qualify as sales type leases using the present value of minimum lease payments classification criteria outlined in FAS No. 13. We believe that our sales type lease portfolio contains only normal collection risk with no important uncertainties with respect to future costs. Accordingly, we record the fair value of equipment as sales revenue, the cost of equipment as cost of sales and the minimum lease payments plus the estimated residual value as gross finance receivables. The difference between the gross finance receivable and the equipment fair value is recorded as unearned income and is amortized as income over the lease term using the interest rate implicit in the lease. Equipment residual values are determined at inception of the lease using estimates of equipment fair value at the end of the lease term. Estimates of future equipment fair value are based primarily on our historical experience. We also consider forecasted supply and demand for our various products, product retirement and future product launch plans, end of lease customer behavior, regulatory changes, remanufacturing strategies, used equipment markets, if any, competition and technological changes. We evaluate residual 24 values on an annual basis or as changes to the above considerations occur. We have not experienced any material changes to our residual values during 2004, 2003 or 2002 nor do we expect any material changes to residual values in the foreseeable future. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for our accounting policies on revenue recognition. Allowances for doubtful accounts and credit losses Allowance for doubtful accounts We estimate our accounts receivable risks and provide allowances for doubtful accounts accordingly. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on a periodic basis. Our evaluation includes historical loss experience, length of time receivables are past due, adverse situations that may affect a customers ability to repay and prevailing economic conditions. We make adjustments to our allowance if our evaluation of allowance requirements differs from our actual aggregate reserve. This evaluation is inherently subjective because our estimates may be revised as more information becomes available. Based on historical experience, we have not had any material revisions to our recorded allowance for doubtful accounts. Allowance for credit losses We estimate our finance receivables risks and provide allowances for credit losses accordingly. We establish credit approval limits based on the credit quality of our customers and the type of equipment financed. We charge finance receivables to the allowance for credit losses after collection efforts are exhausted and we deem the account uncollectible. We base credit decisions primarily on a customers financial strength. We believe that our concentration of credit risk for finance receivables in our internal financing division is limited because of our large number of customers, small account balances and customer geographic and industry diversification. In addition, in our Capital Services programs, we have considered collateral values. Our general policy for finance receivables contractually past due for over 90 days is to discontinue revenue recognition. We resume revenue recognition when payments reduce the account to 60 days or less past due. In our Capital Services programs, we discontinue revenue recognition as soon as it is apparent that the obligor will not be making payments in accordance with lease terms, such as in the event of bankruptcy. Otherwise, we discontinue revenue recognition when accounts are over 90 days past due or as circumstances warrant. We evaluate the adequacy of allowance for credit losses on a periodic basis. Our evaluation includes historical loss experience, the nature and volume of our portfolios, adverse situations that may affect a customers ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. We make adjustments to our allowance for credit losses if the evaluation of reserve requirements differs from the actual aggregate reserve. This evaluation is inherently subjective because our estimates may be revised as more information becomes available. Accounting for income taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We record this amount as a provision for our taxes in accordance with FAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This process requires us to make the following assessments: we estimate our actual current tax liability in each jurisdiction. we estimate our temporary differences resulting from differences in treatment of items, such as lease revenue and related depreciation, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we include in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and if we believe that recovery is not more likely than not, we establish a valuation allowance. we assess the probable outcomes of uncertain tax positions. At any time, our provision for taxes could be impacted by changes in tax law and interpretations by governments or courts. Based on our 2004 income from continuing operations before income taxes, a 1% change in our effective tax rate would impact income from continuing operations by approximately $7 million. 25 Long lived assets Useful lives of long lived assets We depreciate property, plant and equipment principally using the straight line method over estimated useful lives: machinery and equipment principally three to 15 years and buildings up to 50 years. We depreciate rental equipment using the straight line method over estimated useful lives, which is principally three to ten years. We depreciate other depreciable assets using either the straight line method or accelerated methods. We amortize properties leased under capital leases on a straight line basis over the primary lease terms. We amortize capitalized costs related to internally developed software using the straight line method over the estimated useful life, which is principally three to ten years. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which are principally five to 15 years. Our estimates of useful lives could be affected by changes in regulatory provisions, technology or business plans. Impairment review We evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets, including goodwill and intangible assets, on an annual basis or as circumstances warrant. Our goodwill impairment review requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. Significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. We use internal discounted cash flow estimates, quoted market prices when available and appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value. We derive the cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our future long term business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate. When available and as appropriate, we use comparative market multiples to corroborate discounted cash flow results. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. We believe that we have no unrecorded asset impairments at December 31, 2004. However, future events and circumstances, some of which are described below, may result in an impairment charge: changes in postal regulations governing the types of meters allowable for use. However, regulations were issued in November 2001, and therefore we do not expect new regulations for the foreseeable future. new technological developments that provide significantly enhanced benefits over current digital technology. significant negative economic or industry trends. changes in our business strategy that alters the expected usage of the related assets. significant increase or decrease in our cost of capital. future terrorist or other actions that significantly impact the volume of mail. future economic results that are below our expectations used in the current assessments. Pension benefits Assumptions and estimates Our net pension expense, assets and obligations are dependent on various assumptions and estimates. We make assumptions relating to discount rates, rate of compensation increase, expected return on plan assets and other factors. These assumptions are evaluated and updated annually and are described in further detail in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. The following assumptions relate to our U.S. pension plan, which is our largest plan. We base our discount rate assumption on rates of return of high quality, long term corporate bonds, including, among others, Moodys AA corporate bond yields, with maturities that are consistent with projected cash flows. Accordingly, we lowered our discount rate assumption at December 31, 2004 to 5.75% from 6.0% in 2003 to reflect market interest rate conditions. The rate of compensation increase assumption reflects our actual experience and best estimate of future increases. Our estimate of rate of compensation increase was 4.75% in 2004 and 2003. Our expected return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results, the plans asset mix and future expectations of market rates of return on the types of assets in the plan. Our expected return on plan assets assumption was 8.5% in 2004 and 2003. Sensitivity to changes in assumptions: Discount rate a 0.25% increase in the discount rate would decrease annual pension expense by approximately $2 million Rate of compensation increase a 0.25% increase in the rate of compensation increase would increase annual pension expense by approximately $2 million Expected return on plan assets a 0.25% increase in the expected return on assets of our principal plans would decrease annual pension expense by approximately $4 million 26 Delayed recognition principles In accordance with FAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, actual pension plan results that differ from our assumptions and estimates are accumulated and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants and will therefore affect pension expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods. We also base our net pension expense primarily on a market related valuation of plan assets. In accordance with this approach we recognize differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets primarily over a five year period and as a result future pension expense will be impacted when these previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. Investment related risks and uncertainties We invest our pension plans assets in a variety of investment securities in accordance with our strategic asset allocation policy. The composition of our U.S. pension plan assets at December 31, 2004 was approximately 71% equity securities, 24% fixed income securities and 5% real estate investments. Investment securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate, market and credit risks. In particular, due to the level of risk associated with equity securities, it is reasonably possible that changes in the values of such investment securities will occur and that such changes could materially affect our future results. New Accounting Pronouncements In January 2003, FIN No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, was issued. FIN No. 46 requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. Our ownership of the equity of PBG qualifies as a variable interest entity under FIN No. 46. PBG was formed with GATX Corporation in 1997 for the purpose of financing and managing certain leasing related assets. We adopted the provisions of FIN No. 46 effective March 31, 2004. As a result, we consolidated the operations of PBG on March 31, 2004. Prior to March 31, 2004, we accounted for PBG under the equity method of accounting. PBGs minority interest of $41 million is included in other noncurrent liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2004. PBGs nonrecourse debt of $158 million is included in long term debt and notes payable and current portion of long term obligations in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2004. The consolidation of PBG did not have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows. In April 2003, FAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, was issued. FAS No. 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under FAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The provisions of FAS No. 149 were generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The adoption of this statement did not impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2003, FAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, was issued. FAS No. 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The provisions of FAS No. 150 were effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and were effective July 1, 2003. The adoption of this statement did not impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. In December 2003, FAS No. 132 (Revised), Employers Disclosure about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, was issued. FAS No. 132R retains the disclosure requirements of the original pronouncement and requires additional disclosures relating to assets, obligations, cash flows and net periodic benefit cost. The provisions of FAS No. 132R were effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003, except for certain disclosures which are effective for fiscal years ending after June 15, 2004. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. In March 2003, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF No. 00 21 addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it performs multiple revenue generating activities and how to determine whether such an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition. EITF No. 00 21 was effective July 1, 2003. The transition provision allowed either prospective application or a cumulative effect adjustment upon adoption. We believe we are in compliance with the provisions of EITF No. 00 21. The adoption of these provisions did not impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. 106 2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. The FSP provides accounting guidance for the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) to a sponsor of a postretirement health care plan that has concluded that prescription drug benefits available under the plan are actuarially equivalent and thus qualify for the subsidy under the Act. The provisions of FSP No. 106 2 were effective July 1, 2004. We have concluded that the prescription drug 27 benefits provided under our nonpension postretirement benefit plans are actuarially equivalent to the prescription drug benefits offered under Medicare Part D. We adopted the provisions of FSP No. 106 2 on a prospective basis on July 1, 2004. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. In November 2004, FAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, was issued. FAS No. 151 amends and clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material (spoilage). The provisions of FAS No. 151 are effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We are currently evaluating the provisions of FAS No. 151. In December 2004, FAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, was issued. FAS No. 123R supercedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. The revised statement addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions with employees and other third parties, eliminates the ability to account for share based transactions using APB No. 25 and requires that the compensation costs relating to such transactions be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. FAS No. 123R requires additional disclosures relating to the income tax and cash flow effects resulting from share based payments. The provisions of FAS No. 123R are effective July 1, 2005. We are currently evaluating the provisions of FAS No. 123R and currently estimate that the adoption of these provisions will reduce annual diluted earnings per share in 2005 by approximately 7 cents to 9 cents, which is comparable with the 2004 pro forma amounts disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP No. 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The FSP provides guidance under FAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Act) on enterprises income tax expense and deferred tax liability. The Jobs Act was enacted on October 22, 2004. FSP No. 109 2 states that companies are allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the Jobs Act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying FAS No. 109. We are currently evaluating the effects of the repatriation provision; however, we do not expect to complete this evaluation until after Congress or the Treasury Department provides clarification on key elements of the repatriation provision. We do not expect the adoption of these provisions to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further details. Legal and Regulatory Matters Legal See Legal Proceedings in Item 3 of this Form 10 K for information regarding our legal proceedings. Other regulatory matters In December 2003, we received accepted closing agreements with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) showing income tax adjustments for the 1992 to 1994 tax years. The total additional tax for these years is approximately $5 million. Additional tax due for 1995 and future tax years in connection with these closing agreements will not materially affect our future results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In addition to the accepted income tax adjustments discussed above, a proposed adjustment related to the 1994 tax year remains in dispute, which could result in additional tax of approximately $4 million for that year. The IRS also is proposing similar adjustments for the 1995 and future tax years relating to this deficiency. These adjustments could result in additional tax expense in the range of $0 to $40 million. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to these proposed adjustments. The IRS may propose penalties on us with respect to all periods that have been examined. The IRS is in the process of completing its examination of our tax returns for the 1995 to 2000 tax years and has issued notices of proposed adjustment with respect to Capital Services leasing transactions entered into in 1997 through 2000. Specifically, the IRS is proposing to disallow certain expenses claimed as deductions on the 1997 through 2000 tax returns. We anticipate receiving similar notices for other leasing transactions entered into during the audit period. The IRS will likely make similar claims for years subsequent to 2000 in future audits with respect to these transactions. The IRS may propose penalties on us with respect to all periods that have been examined. In addition, in June 2004, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) proposed an adjustment for the 1996 to 1999 tax years, relating to intercompany loan transactions. The CRA may propose penalties on us with respect to all periods that have been examined. We vigorously disagree with the proposed adjustments and intend to aggressively contest these matters through applicable IRS, CRA and judicial procedures, as appropriate. Although the final resolution of the proposed adjustments is uncertain and involves unsettled 28 areas of the law, based on currently available information, we have provided for our best estimate of the probable tax liability for these matters and believe that the resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years. However, an unfavorable resolution could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. At any time, our provision for taxes could be affected by changes in tax law and interpretations by government or courts. Effects of Inflation and Foreign Exchange Inflation, although moderate in recent years, continues to affect worldwide economies and the way companies operate. It increases labor costs and operating expenses, and raises costs associated with replacement of fixed assets such as rental equipment. Despite these growing costs and the USPS meter migration initiatives, we have generally been able to maintain profit margins through productivity and efficiency improvements, continual review of both manufacturing capacity and operating expense levels, and, to an extent, price increases. 2004 earnings performance was helped by currency translation gains of approximately 5 cents per diluted share. Based on the current contribution from our international operations, a 1% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar would result in a decline in revenue of approximately $12 million and a decline in income from continuing operations before income taxes of approximately $2 million. Although not affecting income, balance sheet related deferred translation gains of $115 million were recorded in 2004 resulting from the stronger British pound, Canadian dollar and Euro as compared to the U.S. dollar. Similarly, deferred translation gains of $143 million and $38 million were recorded in 2003 and 2002. The results of our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations. We enter into foreign exchange contracts primarily to minimize our risk of loss from such fluctuations. Exchange rates can also impact settlement of our intercompany receivables and payables that result from transfers of finished goods inventories between our affiliates in different countries, and intercompany loans. At December 31, 2004, we had approximately $391 million of foreign exchange contracts outstanding, all maturing in 2005, to buy or sell various currencies. Risks arise from the possible non performance by counterparties in meeting the terms of their contracts and from movements in securities values, interest and or exchange rates. However, we do not anticipate non performance by the counterparties as they are composed of a number of major international financial institutions. Maximum risk of loss on these contracts is limited to the amount of the difference between the spot rate at the date of the contract delivery and the contracted rate. Dividend Policy Our Board of Directors has a policy to pay a cash dividend on common stock each quarter. In setting dividend payments, our board considers the dividend rate in relation to our recent and projected earnings and our capital investment opportunities and requirements. We have paid a dividend each year since 1934. Forward Looking Statements We want to caution readers that any forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in this Form 10 K, other reports or press releases or made by our management involve risks and uncertainties which may change based on various important factors. These forward looking statements are those which talk about the companys or managements current expectations as to the future and include, but are not limited to, statements about the amounts, timing and results of possible restructuring charges and future earnings. Words such as estimate, project, plan, believe, expect, anticipate, intend, and similar expressions may identify such forward looking statements. Some of the factors which could cause future financial performance to differ materially from the expectations as expressed in any forward looking statement made by or on our behalf include: changes in international or national political conditions, including any terrorist attacks negative developments in economic conditions, including adverse impacts on customer demand changes in postal regulations timely development and acceptance of new products success in gaining product approval in new markets where regulatory approval is required successful entry into new markets mailers utilization of alternative means of communication or competitors products 29 the companys success at managing customer credit risk, including risks associated with commercial passenger and cargo aircraft leasing transactions the companys success at managing costs associated with its strategy of outsourcing functions and operations not central to its business changes in interest rates foreign currency fluctuations cost, timing and execution of the restructuring plan timing and execution of the meter transition plan regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other conditions to consummation of any acquisitions and integration of recent acquisitions impact on mail volume resulting from current concerns over the use of the mail for transmitting harmful biological agents third party suppliers ability to provide product components negative income tax adjustments for prior audit years and changes in tax laws or regulations terms and timing of actions to reduce exposures and disposal of assets in our Capital Services segment continuing developments in the U.S. and foreign airline industry changes in pension and retiree medical costs ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations due to our investing and funding activities and our operations in different foreign currencies. Our objectives in managing our exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve our objectives, we use a balanced mix of debt maturities and variable and fixed rate debt together with interest rate swaps. Our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility in earnings and cash flows associated with the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, we enter into various contracts, which change in value as foreign exchange rates change, to protect the value of external and intercompany transactions. The principal currencies hedged are the British pound, Canadian dollar and Euro. We employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks. We do not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures. We utilize a Value at Risk (VaR) model to determine the maximum potential loss in fair value from changes in market conditions. The VaR model utilizes a variance/co variance approach and assumes normal market conditions, a 95% confidence level and a one day holding period. The model includes all of our debt and all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts. The model excludes anticipated transactions, firm commitments, and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by us, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. During 2004 and 2003, our maximum potential one day loss in fair value of our exposure to foreign exchange rates and interest rates, using the variance/co variance technique described above, was not material. 30
