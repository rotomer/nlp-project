ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) contains statements that are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in Forward Looking Statements and elsewhere in this report. Overview We were pleased with our financial results in 2005 which featured strong growth in revenue and earnings. We were also pleased with the progress we made throughout 2005 as successful execution of our growth strategies resulted in more solutions, for more customers, in more places worldwide. We are realizing the benefits from our previous actions to strengthen revenue growth, expand into new market spaces and enhance our operating efficiencies. Revenue grew 11% in 2005 driven by six growth engines that propelled our momentum through the year and acquisitions, which contributed 5%. These growth engines included mail services, small business, supplies, international, payment solutions and software. Strategic transactions in 2005 included the acquisitions of Imagitas, Inc., Danka Canada Inc., and Compulit, Inc. We also continued actions to reduce our investment in Capital Services. Income from continuing operations was $527 million in 2005 compared with $481 million in 2004 and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.27 in 2005 compared with $2.05 in 2004. In 2005, diluted earnings per share was reduced by restructuring charges of 16 cents, an increase in our tax reserves related to corporate owned life insurance (COLI) of 24 cents and three cents per diluted share relating to foundation contributions. In 2004, diluted earnings per share was reduced by restructuring charges of 43 cents and five cents resulting from a legal settlement. We were able to grow our earnings despite increases in interest rates, a higher effective tax rate and reduced earnings contribution from Capital Services compared to the prior year. See Results of Continuing Operations for 2005, 2004 and 2003 for a more detailed discussion of our results of operations. Outlook for 2006 We anticipate that we will experience continued strength in our financial results in 2006. We expect that revenue growth will continue to be driven by the growth engines discussed above, as we continue to experience a changing mix of our product line, where a greater percentage of the revenue is coming from diversified revenue streams associated with fully featured smaller systems and less from larger system sales. In addition, we expect to continue our market expansion and derive further synergies from our recent acquisitions. During 2006, we expect to record additional restructuring charges related primarily to the completion of programs initiated in 2005. We expect that these charges will be significantly less than in 2005. We remain focused on disciplined expense control initiatives and will continue to allocate capital to optimize our returns. While it is always difficult to predict future economic and interest rate trends, we expect that our interest costs will increase further in 2006 due to an increase in rates compared with the prior year. We will also continue to be impacted by the year over year decline in earnings from Capital Services, consistent with our strategy for this business. On February 9, 2006, the United States Senate approved postal reform legislation. On July 26, 2005, the House of Representatives passed its version of the bill on postal reform. The legislation is currently being referred to a joint House and Senate Committee to reconcile the differences between the two bills. We are confident that the legislation, which ultimately emerges from the House Senate Conference Committee, will be beneficial. 12 Results of Continuing Operations 2005 Compared to 2004 Business segment revenue The following table shows revenue in 2005 and 2004 by business segment: (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 % change % Contribution from Acquisitions Inside the U.S. Mailing $ 2,273 $ 2,185 4 % DMT 430 350 23 % 19 % Outside the U.S. 1,173 1,011 16 % 8 % Global Mailstream Solutions 3,876 3,546 9 % 4 % Global Management Services 1,072 1,078 1 % Mail Services 405 192 110 % 56 % Global Business Services 1,477 1,270 16 % 9 % Capital Services 139 141 (2 %) Total revenue $ 5,492 $ 4,957 11 % 5 % Global Mailstream Solutions revenue increased 9% over the prior year driven by growth in our worldwide operations, and the acquisitions of Group 1, Groupe MAG and Danka Canada. Inside the U.S., revenue growth was favorably impacted by placements of small and mid sized networked digital mailing systems, mail creation equipment and supplies. The years results also included higher revenue from DMT that was driven by placements of our Advanced Productivity Systems and Flexible Productivity Systems and Group 1 software that was acquired in July 2004. Outside of the U.S., revenue grew 16%. These results included an increase in placements of mailing equipment with small businesses and increased sales of supplies. Revenue also benefited from the acquisition of Groupe MAG and Danka Canada, and favorable foreign currency translation, which contributed 4%. Global Business Services revenue increased 16% driven by Mail Services which more than doubled in revenue compared with the prior year. Global Management Services revenue declined slightly, reflecting our continued focus on enhancing profitability for this business segment. Mail Services growth was driven by the continued expansion of our presort and international mail consolidation network, growth in our customer base and the acquisitions of International Mail Express, Inc. (IMEX), Ancora and Imagitas. During the year, Imagitas expanded its marketing services for the motor vehicle registration process to a fifth state and launched a catalog request form as an enhanced offering in the USPS move update kit. Capital Services revenue decreased 2% over the prior year, consistent with our strategy for this business. 13 Business segment earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) We use EBIT as a measure of our segment profitability. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. The following table shows EBIT in 2005 and 2004 by business segment: (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 % change Inside the U.S. Mailing $ 906 $ 864 5 % DMT 62 38 62 % Outside the U.S. 203 174 17 % Global Mailstream Solutions 1,171 1,076 9 % Global Management Services 72 56 28 % Mail Services 26 10 160 % Global Business Services 98 66 48 % Capital Services 83 88 (5 %) Total EBIT $ 1,352 $ 1,230 10 % Global Mailstream Solutions EBIT increased 9% driven by revenue growth and the effect of our continued emphasis on reducing costs and controlling operating expenses. EBIT margins for Global Mailstream Solutions were adversely affected by the increase in mix of lower margin DMT and Outside the U.S. revenue. Global Business Services EBIT increased 48% driven by revenue growth and margin improvements. Global Management Services EBIT margins improved versus the prior year, driven by our focus on higher margin service offerings and ongoing administrative cost reduction measures. Mail Services EBIT margins improved, driven by our continued integration of recently acquired sites, as well as the addition of higher margin Imagitas revenue. EBIT decreased 5% in the Capital Services segment, consistent with our strategy for this business. Revenue by source The following table shows revenue in 2005 and 2004 by source: (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 % change Sales $ 1,634 $ 1,463 12 % Rentals 801 804 Financing 650 598 9 % Support services 791 681 16 % Business services 1,477 1,270 16 % Capital services 139 141 (2 %) Total revenue $ 5,492 $ 4,957 11 % Sales revenue increased 12% over the prior year due to strong growth in worldwide sales of digital mailing equipment, mail creation equipment and supplies; the acquisitions of Group 1, Groupe MAG and Danka Canada, which contributed 5%; and the favorable impact of foreign currency, which contributed 1%. Rentals revenue remained flat compared with the prior year. Rentals revenue was negatively impacted by downsizing to smaller machines. At December 31, 2005, digital meters represented approximately 84% of our 1.3 million U.S. meter base, up from 75% in 2004. Financing revenue increased 9% due primarily to growth in our worldwide equipment leasing volumes, higher revenue from payment solutions and the favorable impact of foreign currency, which contributed 1%. 14 Support services revenue increased 16% due primarily to the acquisitions of Group 1, Groupe MAG and Danka Canada, which in the aggregate contributed 11%; the favorable impact of foreign currency, which contributed 1%; a larger population of international and DMT equipment maintenance agreements; and the addition of hardware equipment services contracts from Standard Register Inc. in late 2004. Business services revenue increased 16% due primarily to growth at our existing and new mail services sites and the acquisitions of IMEX, Ancora, Compulit, and Imagitas, which contributed 9% in aggregate. Capital Services revenue decreased 2%, consistent with our strategy for this business. Costs of revenue The following table summarizes costs of revenue as a percentage of related revenue in 2005 and 2004: (Dollars in millions) Percentage of Revenue 2005 2004 2005 2004 Cost of sales $ 711 $ 664 43.6 % 45.4 % Cost of rentals $ 166 $ 164 20.7 % 20.4 % Cost of support services $ 407 $ 354 51.4 % 52.0 % Cost of business services $ 1,195 $ 1,047 80.9 % 82.4 % Cost of sales, as a percentage of sales revenue, decreased compared with 2004, primarily due to lower costs resulting from our successful transition to outsourcing of parts for digital equipment and an increase in mix of higher margin software and supplies revenue. Cost of rentals, as a percentage of rentals revenue, increased compared with 2004, as a result of higher depreciation costs from new meter placements. Cost of support services, as a percentage of support services revenue, decreased compared with 2004 primarily due to higher margin software revenue at Group 1, partially offset by the increase in mix of lower margin international revenue. Cost of business services, as a percentage of business services revenue, decreased compared with 2004, primarily due to our ongoing focus on cost containment and efficiency in our management services operations, integration of new sites in our mail services operations and the addition of higher margin revenue at Imagitas. Selling, general and administrative expenses The following table shows selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2005 and 2004: (Dollars in millions) Percentage of Revenue 2005 2004 2005 2004 $ 1,685 $ 1,506 30.7 % 30.4 % Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, increased compared with 2004. The increase was due to the impact of our acquisitions and cost associated with our Capital Services strategy, which more than offset our continued focus on controlling operating expenses and benefits from our transformation programs. 15 Research and development expenses The following table shows research and development expenses in 2005 and 2004: (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 % change $ 165 $ 160 3 % Research and development expenses increased in 2005 due primarily to research and development at Group 1. Our investment in research and development reflects our continued focus on developing new technologies and enhancing features for all our products. Net interest expense The following table shows net interest expense in 2005 and 2004: (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 % change $ 208 $ 173 20 % Net interest expense increased in 2005 due to higher average interest rates and higher borrowings during the year. Our variable and fixed rate debt mix, after adjusting for the effect of interest rate swaps, was 21% and 79%, respectively, at December 31, 2005. Based on our borrowings at December 31, 2005, a 25 basis point change in short term interest rates would impact our earnings by approximately 1 cent per diluted share. Effective tax rate The following table shows the effective tax rate in 2005 and 2004: 2005 2004 39.3 % 31.3 % In 2005, the effective tax rate was negatively impacted by 6.5% by a $56 million increase in our tax reserve related to an adverse court opinion that another company received related to the tax treatment of COLI. This was partially offset by tax benefits of 0.4% from restructuring charges and 0.8% from favorable adjustments to the Capital Services tax provisions. The effective tax rate in 2004 included tax benefits of 1.0% from restructuring charges. Results of Continuing Operations 2004 Compared to 2003 Business segment revenue The following table shows revenue in 2004 and 2003 by business segment: (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 % change % Contribution from Acquisitions Inside the U.S. Mailing $ 2,185 $ 2,184 DMT 350 274 28 % 19 % Outside the U.S. 1,011 846 20 % 2 % Global Mailstream Solutions 3,546 3,304 7 % 2 % Global Management Services 1,078 1,006 7 % 5 % Mail Services 192 113 70 % 33 % Global Business Services 1,270 1,119 13 % 8 % Capital Services 141 154 (8 %) Total revenue $ 4,957 $ 4,577 8 % 3 % 16 Global Mailstream Solutions revenue increased 7% over the prior year driven by growth in our worldwide operations, the favorable impact of foreign currency, which contributed 3%, and the acquisitions of Group 1 and Groupe MAG. During the year our mailing business continued to experience an ongoing changing mix of our products, where a greater percentage of the revenue is coming from more fully featured smaller systems, supplies, payment solutions, software and less from larger system sales. International revenue grew 8% on a constant currency basis as a result of strong growth throughout most of Europe, driven by an increase in production mail equipment placements with large customers and increased meter and mailing equipment placements by our small business operations. In particular, revenue in the U.K. grew at a double digit rate on a local currency basis due to positive customer reception to our new product lines and improved sales force productivity. Inside the U.S. DMTs revenue increased 28% over the prior year driven by the acquisition of Group 1, and ongoing demand for DMTs leading edge, information based inserting and sorting equipment. Group 1, which provides industry leading document composition and mail address hygiene software, experienced strong demand for its software products and services during the year. Global Business Services revenue increased 13% over the prior year driven by a 70% increase at Mail Services and a 7% increase at Global Management Services. Our Mail Services operations grew at a double digit rate as a result of strong performance at existing sites and the continued expansion of our Mail Services network with the acquisitions of IMEX and Ancora. Global Management Services revenue increased 7% over the prior year due primarily to the acquisition of DDD Company (DDD). Revenue also benefited from new business and a continued improvement in transactional reprographic volumes. Also, the consolidation and reduction of business with existing accounts subsided. Revenue growth was adversely affected by our focus on enhancing the profitability of this business. Capital Services revenue decreased 8% over the prior year, consistent with our strategy to reduce our exposure to this business. Business segment earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) The following table shows EBIT in 2004 and 2003 by business segment: (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 % change Inside the U.S. Mailing $ 864 $ 847 2 % DMT 38 29 32 % Outside the U.S. 174 132 31 % Global Mailstream Solutions 1,076 1,008 7 % Global Management Services 56 52 8 % Mail Services 10 11 (9 %) Global Business Services 66 63 5 % Capital Services 88 104 (15 %) Total EBIT $ 1,230 $ 1,175 5 % Global Mailstream Solutions EBIT increased 7% driven by revenue growth and the effect of our continued emphasis on reducing costs and controlling operating expenses. EBIT margins were adversely affected by the increase in mix of lower margin international and DMT revenues. Global Business Services EBIT increased 5%. Mail Services EBIT decreased due primarily to higher costs for the integration of recently added sites and the acquisition of Ancora. Global Management Services EBIT margins improved slightly versus the prior year, helped by our focus on higher margin service offerings and ongoing administrative cost reduction measures. EBIT decreased 15% in the Capital Services segment, consistent with our strategy to reduce our exposure to this business. 17 Revenue by source The following table shows revenue in 2004 and 2003 by source: (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 % change Sales $ 1,463 $ 1,325 10 % Rentals 804 785 2 % Financing 598 576 4 % Support services 681 618 10 % Business services 1,270 1,119 13 % Capital services 141 154 (8 %) Total revenue $ 4,957 $ 4,577 8 % Sales revenue increased 10% over the prior year due to strong growth in sales of international mailing equipment, DMT equipment and supplies, the acquisition of Group 1 which contributed 2% and the favorable impact of foreign currency which contributed 4%. Rentals revenue increased 2% due to the favorable impact of foreign currency. At December 31, 2004, digital meters represented approximately 75% of our U.S. meter base, up from 67% in 2003. Financing revenue increased 4% due primarily to growth in postal payment solutions and the favorable impact of foreign currency which contributed 2%. Support services revenue increased 10% due primarily to the acquisition of Group 1, which contributed 5%; the favorable impact of foreign currency, which contributed 3%; a larger population of international equipment maintenance agreements; and higher professional services revenue at DMT. Business services revenue increased 13% due primarily to the acquisitions of IMEX, Ancora and DDD which contributed 8% and strong growth at our existing mail services sites. Capital Services revenue decreased 8%, consistent with our strategy to reduce our exposure to this business. Costs of revenue The following table summarizes costs of revenue as a percentage of related revenue in 2004 and 2003: (Dollars in millions) Percentage of Revenue 2004 2003 2004 2003 Cost of sales $ 664 $612 45.4 % 46.1 % Cost of rentals $ 164 $ 171 20.4 % 21.7 % Cost of support services $ 354 $ 323 52.0 % 52.3 % Cost of business services $ 1,047 $ 921 82.4 % 82.3 % Cost of sales, as a percentage of sales revenue, decreased compared with 2003, primarily due to lower costs resulting from our transition to outsourcing of parts for digital equipment and an increase in mix of higher margin software and supplies revenue. Cost of rentals, as a percentage of rentals revenue, decreased compared with 2003, as a result of lower depreciation costs associated with our standalone meters and lower repair costs resulting from the shift from electronic to digital meters. Cost of support services, as a percentage of support services revenue, decreased compared with 2003, primarily due to higher margin software support services revenue at Group 1, partially offset by the increase in mix of lower margin international support services revenue. Cost of business services, as a percentage of business services revenue, increased compared with 2003, primarily due to initial higher costs associated with our expansion to new sites in our mail services operations. 18 Selling, general and administrative expenses The following table shows selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2004 and 2003: (Dollars in millions) Percentage of Revenue 2004 2003 2004 2003 $ 1,506 $ 1,397 30.4 % 30.5 % Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, decreased compared with 2003, as a result of our emphasis on controlling operating expenses, partially offset by costs associated with investments in infrastructure improvements, organizational transformation programs and growth initiatives. Research and development expenses The following table shows research and development expenses in 2004 and 2003: (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 % change $ 160 $ 147 9 % Research and development expenses increased 9% in 2004 due primarily to research and development at Group 1. The increase also reflects our continued investment in developing new technologies and enhancing features for all our products, including expenditures for new digital meters and mailing machines, billing and statement software, distribution and logistics software, advanced inserting equipment and mail sorting equipment. Net interest expense The following table shows net interest expense in 2004 and 2003: (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 % change $ 173 $ 169 3 % Net interest expense increased 3% in 2004 due to higher average debt outstanding during the year. Our variable and fixed rate debt mix, after adjusting for the effect of interest rate swaps, was 27% and 73%, respectively, at December 31, 2004. Based on our borrowings at December 31, 2004, a one percentage point change in short term interest rates would impact annual diluted earnings per share by approximately one cent. Effective tax rate The following table shows the effective tax rate in 2004 and 2003: 2004 2003 31.3 % 31.4 % The effective tax rate in 2004 and 2003 included tax benefits of 1.0% and 0.6%, respectively, from restructuring charges. The effective tax rate was negatively impacted by our Capital Services strategy. The tax rate continued to benefit from our international expansion and our continued investment in developing new technologies. Other Income (Expense) Charitable contributions In 2005 and 2003, we contributed $10 million ($6 million after tax) to the Pitney Bowes Literacy and Education Fund and the Pitney Bowes Employee Involvement Fund. 19 Capital Services charge In 2005, we recorded a $24 million pre tax charge ($5 million after tax) resulting primarily from the revision of the accounting for certain Capital Services lease transactions and favorable adjustments to the Capital Services tax provisions. In accordance with these revisions, we grossed up the related lease assets and non recourse debt and reduced our investment in leveraged leases on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. Legal settlements, net In 2004, we recorded a pre tax charge of approximately $20 million associated with the settlement of lawsuits related to a program we offer to some of our leasing customers to replace equipment if it is lost, stolen or destroyed. The $20 million charge relates to the following settlement costs: certificates to be provided to members of the class for purchase of office products through our diverse supply line; and the cost of legal fees and related expenses. In 2003, we recorded pre tax income of $10 million related to the expiration of product award certificates previously provided to certain customers in connection with a legal settlement. Capital Services Capital Services strategy In December 2004, our Board of Directors approved a plan to pursue a sponsored spin off of our Capital Services external financing business. The new entity (Spinco) would be an independent publicly traded company consisting of most of the assets in our Capital Services segment. On March 31, 2005, Pitney Bowes Credit Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Subscription Agreement with Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. through its investment vehicle, JCC Management LLC (Investor). Under the terms of the Subscription Agreement, the Investor is expected to invest in excess of $100 million for common and preferred stock representing up to 19.9% of the voting interest and up to 48% economic interest in the spun off entity. The Subscription Agreement anticipates that Pitney Bowes stockholders would receive 80.1% of the common stock of Spinco in a tax free distribution. In accordance with the Subscription Agreement, both parties have the right to terminate this agreement at March 31, 2006. The Subscription Agreement was filed as Exhibit 10 to the Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q for the three months ended March 31, 2005. We estimate that we would incur after tax transaction costs of about $20 million to $35 million in connection with the spin off. The majority of these costs would be incurred at the time of the spin off. These costs are composed primarily of professional fees, taxes on asset transfers and lease contract termination fees. In addition, in accordance with current accounting guidelines, at the time of the spin off we would be required to compare the book and fair market values of the assets and liabilities spun off and record any resulting deficit as a charge in discontinued operations. We currently estimate this potential non cash after tax charge to be in the range of $150 million to $250 million. The ultimate amount of this charge, if any, would be determined by the fair market value of Spinco at the time of the spin off and the resolution of the related tax liabilities. The spin off is not subject to a vote by Pitney Bowes stockholders. The transaction is subject to regulatory review and other customary conditions. In January 2006, we received a favorable ruling from the IRS that the spin off would be tax free to our stockholders. In March 2006, based on a recent communication we initiated, the SEC staff indicated that we would need to include three years of historical audited financial statements for Pitney Bowes Credit Corporation, the legal entity holding the assets of the Capital Services external financing business rather than for the Capital Services business alone. Fulfillment of this requirement could extend the timeframe for completion of the spin into the first half of 2007. As a result, consistent with our previously stated desire to exit the Capital Services business in a way that maximizes stockholder value, we are assessing a broader range of asset and business disposition options, including spin off, a sale of the business, or sale of all or a portion of the assets. Several factors, including improved economic conditions, make this range of options more attractive now, than when we first announced our intention to look at options for exiting this business in January 2003. In July 2005, we received notice of termination of our agreement to provide future lease financing to Imagistics International, Inc. This agreement was replaced with successive thirty day lease financing agreements that have been extended each month since October 2005. In March 2006, we announced that we had signed a definitive agreement to sell our Imagistics International, Inc. lease portfolio for approximately $280 $290 million to De Lage Landen, a subsidiary of Rabobank NV. The final purchase price will be a function of the receivables balance in the portfolio at closing. This lease portfolio is part of the external financing assets included in the proposed 20 spin off. The completion of the sale of the Imagistics lease portfolio is subject to customary closing conditions. In addition, if we decide to pursue the spin off in its current form, the sale will be subject to receipt of a supplemental Internal Revenue Service ruling that the proposed spin off of our Capital Services external financing business would be tax free to Pitney Bowes stockholders. The Imagistics lease portfolio contributed approximately five cents to our diluted earnings per share in 2005 and 2004. Capital Services portfolio Our investment in Capital Services assets included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets is composed of the following: December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Leveraged leases $ 1,470 $ 1,478 Finance receivables 520 587 Rental property and equipment, net 585 625 Total $ 2,575 $ 2,690 Leveraged leases Our investment in leveraged lease assets is composed of the following: December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2005  2004  Rental receivables $ 6,711 $ 7,243 Residual value 305 312 Principal and interest on non recourse loans (4,985 ) (5,477 ) Unearned income (561 ) (600 ) Investment in leveraged leases 1,470 1,478 Less: Deferred taxes related to leveraged leases (1,151 ) (1,126 ) Net investment in leveraged leases $ 319 $ 352 Rental receivables represent total lease payments from our customers over the remaining term of the leveraged leases. Residual value represents the value of the property anticipated at the end of the leveraged lease terms and is based on appraisals or other sources of estimated value. We review the recorded residual value for impairments deemed to be other than temporary at least once annually and record adjustments as appropriate. Principal and interest on non recourse loans represent amounts due to unrelated third parties from our customers over the remaining term of the leveraged leases. The non recourse loans are secured by the lessees rental obligations and the leased property. If a lessee defaults and if the amounts realized from the sale of these assets are insufficient, we have no obligation to make any payments due on these non recourse loans to the unrelated third parties. Accordingly, we are required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) to subtract the principal and interest over the remaining term of the non recourse loans from our rental receivables and residual value. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the principal balances on the non recourse loans totaled $2.8 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively, and the related interest payments over the remaining terms of the leases totaled $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. Unearned income represents our future financing income that will be earned over the remaining term of the leases. Investment in leveraged leases represents the amount that is recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 21 The investment in leveraged leases in our Consolidated Balance Sheets is diversified across the following types of assets: December 31(Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Original Lease Term (in years) Locomotives and rail cars $ 399 $ 382 20 40 Postal equipment 365 358 15 24 Commercial aircraft 230 268 22 25 Commercial real estate 142 140 17 25 Telecommunications 141 141 14 16 Rail and bus 133 133 27 37 Shipping and handling 60 56 24 Investment in leveraged leases $ 1,470 $ 1,478 At December 31, 2005, approximately 57% of our total leveraged lease portfolio is further secured by equity defeasance accounts or other third party credit arrangements. In addition, at December 31, 2005, approximately 9% of the remaining leveraged lease portfolio represents leases to highly rated government related organizations that have guarantees or supplemental credit enhancements upon the occurrence of certain events. Finance receivables Capital services finance receivables are composed of the following: December 31(Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Large ticket single investor leases $ 267 $ 327 Imagistics lease portfolio 253 260 Total finance receivables $ 520 $ 587 Rental property and equipment, net Rental property and equipment, net is composed of the following: December 31(Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Commercial real estate $ 393 $ 396 Imagistics lease portfolio 17 23 Rail and other 175 206 Total rental property and equipment, net $ 585 $ 625 Investment in commercial passenger and cargo aircraft leasing transactions At December 31, 2005 and 2004, our net investment in commercial passenger and cargo aircraft leasing transactions, net of related debt and minority interest, was $231 million and $268 million, respectively, which is composed of transactions with U.S. airlines of $22 million and $21 million, respectively, and foreign airlines of $209 million and $247 million, respectively. Our net investment in commercial passenger and cargo aircraft leasing portfolio is composed of investments in leveraged lease transactions, direct financing lease transactions and a portion of our investment in PBG Capital Partners LLC (PBG). Risk of loss under these transactions is primarily related to: (1) the inability of the airline to make underlying lease payments; (2) our inability to generate sufficient cash flows either through the sale of the aircraft or secondary lease transactions to recover our net investment; and or (3) in the case of the leveraged lease portfolio, the default of an equity defeasance or other third party credit arrangements. At December 31, 2005, approximately 45% of our remaining net investment in commercial passenger and cargo aircraft leasing investments was further secured by approximately $105 million of equity defeasance accounts or third party credit arrangements. During the first quarter of 2005, Japan Airlines exercised its early buy out option. We received approximately $47 million from this transaction, reflecting the net investment at that time. 22 During the second quarter of 2005, we sold the aircraft associated with our remaining leases with United Air Lines. We received approximately $14 million and recorded a pre tax gain of approximately $7 million, net of minority interest, from this transaction. Off Balance Sheet Items Finance receivable sales As part of our Capital Services programs, we have from time to time sold, through securitizations, net finance receivables with limited recourse. In these transactions, we have surrendered control over the transferred assets in accordance with paragraph 9 of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities, and received a cash payment from the transferee. Specifically, the finance receivables were sold to a bankruptcy remote limited liability company. In certain cases, at the time of sale, we obtained legal counsels opinion that the assets were isolated and that the sale qualified as a true sale at law. Under the terms of the sale, the transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the assets it received. There are no conditions that both constrain the transferee from taking advantage of its right to pledge or exchange and provide more than a trivial benefit to the transferor. We do not maintain effective control over the transferred assets. We have accounted for these transactions as a sale, recognizing assets obtained and liabilities incurred in consideration for proceeds of the sale. Any resulting gain or loss was recognized in income at the time of sale. The maximum risk of loss in these transactions arises from the possible non performance of lessees to meet the terms of their contracts. We believe adequate provisions for losses have been established for receivables sold which may become uncollectible and for which we have recourse obligation, in accordance with paragraph 113 of SFAS No. 140. In selective cases, when we have sold net finance receivables, we entered into guarantee contracts with varying amounts of recourse in privately placed transactions with unrelated third party investors. The uncollected principal balance of receivables sold and guarantee contracts totaled $32 million and $99 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In accordance with GAAP, we do not record these amounts as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our maximum risk of loss on these net finance receivables and guarantee contracts arises from the possible non performance of lessees to meet the terms of their contracts and from changes in the value of the underlying equipment. These contracts are secured by the underlying equipment value, and supported by the creditworthiness of our customers. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the underlying equipment value exceeded the sum of the uncollected principal balance of receivables sold and the guarantee contracts. As part of our review of our risk exposure, we believe we have made adequate provision for sold receivables and guarantee contracts which may not be collectible. See Notes 17, 19 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements. Restructuring Charges In connection with our previously announced restructuring initiatives, we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $54 million, $158 million and $117 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2005 charge is net of a $30 million gain on the sale of our main plant manufacturing facility. These restructuring initiatives were substantially completed by the end of 2005. We currently estimate 2006 pre tax restructuring charges to be in the range of $20 million to $35 million. These charges relate primarily to the completion of programs initiated in 2005. The ultimate amount and timing of the restructuring charges may differ from our current estimates. The cash outflows related to restructuring charges are funded primarily by cash from operating activities. The restructuring initiatives are expected to continue to increase our operating efficiency and effectiveness in 2006 and beyond while enhancing growth, primarily as a result of reduced personnel related expenses. We realized incremental pre tax benefits of approximately $50 million, $45 million and $25 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, from these restructuring initiatives and currently estimate incremental pre tax benefits from these initiatives of approximately $25 million in 2006. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for our accounting policy related to restructuring charges. 23 The pre tax restructuring charges are composed of: (Dollars in millions) Restructuring charges Non cash charges Cash payments Balance December 31 2003 Severance and benefit costs $ 81 $ $ (54 ) $ 27 Asset impairments 27 (27 ) Other exit costs 9 (4 ) 5 $ 117 $ (27 ) $ (58 ) $ 32 2004 Severance and benefit costs $ 76 $ $ (55 ) $ 48 Asset impairments 73 (73 ) Other exit costs 9 (11 ) 3 $ 158 $ (73 ) $ (66 ) $ 51 2005 Severance and benefit costs $ 71 $ $ (74 ) $ 45 Asset impairments 7 (7 ) Other exit costs 6 (4 ) 5 Gain on sale of main plant (30 ) 30 $ 54 $ (7 ) $ (48 ) $ 50 All restructuring charges, except for asset impairments, will result in cash outflows. The severance and benefit costs relate to a reduction in workforce of approximately 3,500 employees worldwide from the inception of this plan through December 31, 2005 and expected future workforce reductions of approximately 800 employees. The workforce reductions relate to actions across several of our businesses resulting from infrastructure and process improvements and our continuing efforts to streamline operations, and include managerial, professional, clerical and technical roles. Approximately 62% of the workforce reductions to date are in the U.S. The majority of the international workforce reductions are in Europe and Canada. Asset impairments in 2003 included a $24 million charge as a result of our decision to exit our main plant manufacturing facility in Connecticut in connection with our product sourcing and real estate optimization strategy. During the first quarter of 2005, following the successful rezoning of our main plant facility, we recorded a pre tax gain of $30 million related to the sale of this facility. Restructuring charges in 2004 included a pre tax charge of $28 million related to the planned closure of a manufacturing facility in Germany. Asset impairments in 2004 included a $47 million charge related to the write down of capitalized system development costs, related to order management processes, as a result of our changing business profile and our organizational realignment. Other asset impairments in 2005 and 2004 relate primarily to the write down of property, plant and equipment resulting from the closure or streamlining of certain facilities and systems. The fair values of the impaired long lived assets were determined primarily using probability weighted expected cash flows in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. Other exit costs relate primarily to lease termination costs, non cancelable lease payments, consolidation of excess facilities and other costs associated with exiting business activities. Acquisitions On February 8, 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Emtex Ltd. (Emtex) for approximately $41 million in cash. Emtexs software and services allow large volume mailers to simplify document production and centrally manage complex multi vendor and multi site print operations. On June 30, 2005, we acquired Danka Canada Inc. (Danka), a subsidiary of Danka Business Systems PLC, for a net purchase price of $14 million in cash. Danka is a leading provider of office systems services, supplies and equipment in Canada. This acquisition strengthens our Canadian operations by enhancing our geographic coverage and extending our offerings. On May 26, 2005, we acquired Imagitas for a net purchase price of $231 million in cash, net of unrestricted cash. Imagitas is a marketing services company that specializes in using mail to help companies connect with hard to reach consumers. This acquisition expands our presence in the mailstream and adds to the array of valuable services that we currently deliver to our customers. On March 24, 2005, we acquired Compulit for a net purchase price of $24 million in cash. Compulit is a leading provider of litigation support services to law firms and corporate clients. This acquisition expands our ability to provide a broader range of high value services for our legal vertical. 24 On December 16, 2004, we acquired Groupe MAG for a net purchase price of $43 million of cash. Groupe MAG is a distributor of production mail equipment, software and services in France, Belgium and Luxembourg. On November 1, 2004, we acquired a substantial portion of the assets of Ancora for a net purchase price of $37 million of cash. Ancora is a provider of first class, standard letter and international mail processing and presort services with five operations in southern California, Pennsylvania and Maryland. On July 20, 2004, we acquired Group 1 for a net purchase price of $329 million of cash. Group 1 is an industry leader in software that enhances mailing efficiency, data quality and customer communications. On May 21, 2004, we acquired substantially all of the assets of IMEX for a net purchase price of $30 million of cash. IMEX consolidates letters and flat sized mail headed to international addresses to reduce postage costs and expedite delivery. On October 23, 2003, we acquired DDD for a purchase price of $49 million, which consisted of approximately half of cash and half of common stock issuance. DDD offers a broad array of services including fulfillment services, secure mail processing, messenger services, logistics support, and record and information management. We accounted for these acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and accordingly, the operating results of these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. These acquisitions did not materially impact income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, we also completed several smaller acquisitions, including additional sites for our mail services operations and some international dealers. We also acquired the hardware equipment services business of Standard Register Inc. at the end of 2004 and one of our address printing suppliers in 2003. The cost of these acquisitions in the aggregate was less than $75 million in each year. These acquisitions did not have a material impact on our financial results either individually or on an aggregate basis. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities increased to 0.94 to 1 at December 31, 2005 compared with 0.81 to 1 at December 31, 2004. The increase in this ratio was due primarily to the decrease in notes payable, current portion of long term debt and income taxes payable during the year. See Financings and Capitalization for further details. To manage interest rate risk, we use a balanced mix of debt maturities, variable and fixed rate debt and interest rate swap agreements. Our fixed to floating percentages were 79% and 21% at December 31, 2005 and 73% and 27% at December 31, 2004. The ratio of total debt to total debt and stockholders equity was 78.3% at December 31, 2005 versus 77.2% at December 31, 2004. Including the preferred stockholders equity in a subsidiary company as debt, the ratio of total debt to total debt and stockholders equity was 79.4% at December 31, 2005 compared to 78.4% at December 31, 2004. The increase in this ratio was driven primarily by an increase in debt, stock repurchases and the payment of dividends. 25 The following table summarizes our cash flows in 2005 and 2004: (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Cash flows from operating activities: Net income $ 527 $ 481 Restructuring and other charges, net 42 113 Restructuring and other payments (89 ) (66 ) Bond posted with Internal Revenue Service (200 ) Depreciation and amortization 332 307 Increase in deferred taxes on income and income taxes payable 204 211 Pension plan contributions (77 ) Net investment in internal finance receivables (105 ) (74 ) Other operating assets and liabilities (95 ) (27 ) Net cash provided by operating activities 539 945 Net cash used in investing activities (472 ) (772 ) Net cash used in financing activities (137 ) (194 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (3 ) 7 Decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (73 ) $ (14 ) 2005 Cash flows Net cash provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net income adjusted for non cash items, changes in operating assets and liabilities, contributions to our pension funds, restructuring payments and a $200 million tax bond posted with the IRS in April 2005. The increase in our deferred taxes and income taxes payable balances contributed $204 million to cash from operations, resulting from continued tax benefits from our internal financing and the run off of Capital Services leasing activities. The increase in our internal finance receivables balances reduced cash from operations by $105 million, reflecting growth in equipment placements and our payment solutions business during the year. Other operating assets and liabilities reduced our cash from operations by $95 million primarily due to higher accounts receivable balances that resulted from strong growth in our businesses. Net cash used in investing activities was $472 million and consisted primarily of capital expenditures and acquisitions, partially offset by cash generated from Capital Services asset sales, reserve account deposits and proceeds from the sale of the main plant. Net cash used in financing activities was $137 million and consisted primarily of dividends paid to stockholders and stock repurchases, partially offset by the issuance of debt and stock. 2004 Cash flows Net cash provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net income adjusted for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities and restructuring payments. The increase in our deferred taxes and income taxes payable balances contributed $211 million to cash from operations, resulting from continued tax benefits from our internal financing and run off of Capital Services leasing activities. The increase in our internal finance receivables balances reduced cash from operations by $74 million, reflecting growth in equipment placements and our postal payment business during the year. Other operating assets and liabilities reduced our cash from operations by $27 million primarily due to higher accounts receivable balances that resulted from strong equipment sales at the end of the year. Net cash used in investing activities was $772 million and consisted primarily of capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments, partially offset by cash generated from Capital Services asset sales and reserve account deposits. Net cash used in financing activities was $194 million and consisted primarily of dividends paid to stockholders and stock repurchases, partially offset by the issuance of debt and stock. 26 Financings and Capitalization At December 31, 2005, $1.6 billion remained available under the shelf registration statement filed in February 2005 with the SEC, permitting issuances of up to $2.5 billion in debt securities, preferred stock, preference stock, common stock, purchase contracts, depositary shares, warrants and units. At December 31, 2005, we had unused lines of credit and revolving credit facilities of $1.5 billion in the U.S. and $1.6 million outside the U.S., primarily to support commercial paper issuance. In October 2005, Pitney Bowes Nova Scotia II ULC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, issued $150 million floating rate notes maturing in October 2010. These notes bear interest at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 15 basis points and pay interest quarterly beginning December 2005. The proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper, the financing of acquisitions and the repurchase of company stock. In July 2005, we issued $500 million of unsecured fixed rate notes maturing in January 2016. These notes bear interest at an annual rate of 4.75% and pay interest semi annually beginning January 2006. The proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper, the financing of acquisitions and the repurchase of company stock. In March 2005, we issued $400 million of unsecured fixed rate notes maturing in March 2015. These notes bear interest at an annual rate of 5.0% and pay interest semi annually beginning September 2005. The proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper, financing of acquisitions and the repurchase of company stock. We believe our financing needs in the short and long term can be met from cash generated internally, money from existing credit agreements, debt issued under new and existing shelf registration statements and our existing commercial paper programs. Information on debt maturities is presented in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The following summarizes our known contractual obligations at December 31, 2005 and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods: Payments due by period (Dollars in millions) Total Less than 1 year 13 years 35 years More than 5 years Commercial paper borrowings $ 519 $ 519 $ $ $ Long term debt and current portion of long term debt 4,187 337 719 392 2,739 Non cancelable capital lease obligations 4 2 2 Non cancelable operating lease obligations 242 70 90 39 43 Purchase obligations (1) 174 166 8 Other non current liabilities (2) 327 162 54 111 Total $ 5,453 $ 1,094 $ 981 $ 485 $ 2,893 (1) Purchase obligations include unrecorded agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding upon us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. (2) Other non current liabilities relate primarily to our non pension postretirement benefits. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. Capital Expenditures During 2005, capital expenditures included net additions of $147 million to property, plant and equipment and $145 million of net additions to rental equipment and related inventories compared with $185 million and $132 million, respectively, in 2004. The addition of rental equipment relates primarily to postage meters and increased over the prior year due to higher placements of our digital meters during 2005. We expect capital expenditures in 2006 to be approximately the same as 2005. These investments will also be affected by the timing of our customers transition to digital meters. 27 Critical Accounting Policies We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations. We have discussed the impact and any associated risks on our results of operations related to these policies throughout the MD&A. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include, but are not limited to, customer cancellations, bad debts, inventory obsolescence, residual values of leased assets, useful lives of long lived assets and intangible assets, warranty obligations, restructuring, pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies and litigation, and allocation of purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired in business combinations. Our actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. We believe the assumptions and estimates used are reasonable and appropriate in accordance with GAAP. Revenue recognition Multiple element and internal financing arrangements We derive our revenue from multiple sources including sales, rentals, financing and services. Certain of our transactions are consummated at the same time and can therefore generate revenue from multiple sources. The most common form of these transactions involves a non cancelable equipment lease, a meter rental and an equipment maintenance agreement. As a result, we are required to determine whether the deliverables in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and if so, how the price should be allocated among the delivered elements and when to recognize revenue for each element. In multiple element arrangements, we recognize revenue for each of the elements based on their respective fair values in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. We recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known and uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved. Our allocation of the fair values to the various elements does not change the total revenue recognized from a transaction, but impacts the timing of revenue recognition. Revenue is allocated to the meter rental and equipment maintenance agreement elements first using their respective fair values, which are determined based on prices charged in standalone and renewal transactions. Revenue is then allocated to the equipment based on the present value of the remaining minimum lease payments. We then compare the allocated equipment fair value to the range of cash selling prices in standalone transactions during the period to ensure the allocated equipment fair value approximates average cash selling prices. We provide lease financing for our products primarily through sales type leases. We classify our leases in accordance with SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases. The vast majority of our leases qualify as sales type leases using the present value of minimum lease payments classification criteria outlined in SFAS No. 13. We believe that our sales type lease portfolio contains only normal collection risk with no important uncertainties with respect to future costs. Accordingly, we record the fair value of equipment as sales revenue, the cost of equipment as cost of sales and the minimum lease payments plus the estimated residual value as gross finance receivables. The difference between the gross finance receivable and the equipment fair value is recorded as unearned income and is amortized as income over the lease term using the interest rate implicit in the lease. Equipment residual values are determined at inception of the lease using estimates of equipment fair value at the end of the lease term. Estimates of future equipment fair value are based primarily on our historical experience. We also consider forecasted supply and demand for our various products, product retirement and future product launch plans, end of lease customer behavior, regulatory changes, remanufacturing strategies, used equipment markets, if any, competition and technological changes. We evaluate residual values on an annual basis or as changes to the above considerations occur. We have not experienced any material changes to our residual values during 2005, 2004 or 2003 nor do we expect any material changes to residual values in the foreseeable future. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for our accounting policies on revenue recognition. 28 Allowances for doubtful accounts and credit losses Allowance for doubtful accounts We estimate our accounts receivable risks and provide allowances for doubtful accounts accordingly. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on a periodic basis. Our evaluation includes historical loss experience, length of time receivables are past due, adverse situations that may affect a customers ability to repay and prevailing economic conditions. We make adjustments to our allowance if our evaluation of allowance requirements differs from our actual aggregate reserve. This evaluation is inherently subjective because our estimates may be revised as more information becomes available. Based on historical experience, we have not had any material revisions to our recorded allowance for doubtful accounts. Allowance for credit losses We estimate our finance receivables risks and provide allowances for credit losses accordingly. We establish credit approval limits based on the credit quality of our customers and the type of equipment financed. We charge finance receivables to the allowance for credit losses after collection efforts are exhausted and we deem the account uncollectible. We base credit decisions primarily on a customers financial strength. We believe that our concentration of credit risk for finance receivables in our internal financing division is limited because of our large number of customers, small account balances and customer geographic and industry diversification. In addition, in our Capital Services programs, we have considered collateral values. Our general policy for finance receivables contractually past due for over 120 days is to discontinue revenue recognition. We resume revenue recognition when payments reduce the account to 60 days or less past due. In our Capital Services programs, we discontinue revenue recognition as soon as it is apparent that the obligor will not be making payments in accordance with lease terms, such as in the event of bankruptcy. Otherwise, we discontinue revenue recognition when accounts are over 120 days past due or as circumstances warrant. We evaluate the adequacy of allowance for credit losses on a periodic basis. Our evaluation includes historical loss experience, the nature and volume of our portfolios, adverse situations that may affect a customers ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. We make adjustments to our allowance for credit losses if the evaluation of reserve requirements differs from the actual aggregate reserve. This evaluation is inherently subjective because our estimates may be revised as more information becomes available. Accounting for income taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We record this amount as a provision for our taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. We regularly assess the likelihood of tax adjustments in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and account for the related financial statement implications. We have established tax reserves which we believe to be appropriate given the possibility of tax adjustments. Determining the appropriate level of tax reserves requires us to exercise judgment regarding the uncertain application of tax law. We adjust the amount of reserves when information becomes available or when an event occurs indicating a change in the reserve is appropriate. Future changes in tax reserve requirements could have a material impact on our results of operations. Based on our 2005 income from continuing operations before income taxes, a 1% change in our effective tax rate would impact income from continuing operations by approximately $9 million. Long lived assets Useful lives of long lived assets We depreciate property, plant and equipment and rental property and equipment principally using the straight line method over estimated useful lives: machinery and equipment principally three to 15 years and buildings up to 50 years. We depreciate other depreciable assets using either the straight line method or accelerated methods. We amortize properties leased under capital leases on a straight line basis over the primary lease terms. We amortize capitalized costs related to internally developed software using the straight line method over the estimated useful life, which is principally three to ten years. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated 29 useful lives, which are principally four to 15 years. Our estimates of useful lives could be affected by changes in regulatory provisions, technology or business plans. Impairment review We evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets, including goodwill and intangible assets, on an annual basis or as circumstances warrant. Our goodwill impairment review requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. Significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. We use internal discounted cash flow estimates, quoted market prices when available and appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value. We derive the cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our future long term business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate. When available and as appropriate, we use comparative market multiples to corroborate discounted cash flow results. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. We believe that we have no unrecorded asset impairments at December 31, 2005. However, future events and circumstances, some of which are described below, may result in an impairment charge: Changes in postal regulations governing the types of meters allowable for use. However, regulations were issued in November 2001, and therefore we do not expect new regulations for the foreseeable future. New technological developments that provide significantly enhanced benefits over current digital technology. Significant negative economic or industry trends. Changes in our business strategy that alters the expected usage of the related assets. Significant increase or decrease in our cost of capital. Future economic results that are below our expectations used in the current assessments. Pension benefits Assumptions and estimates Our net pension expense, assets and obligations are dependent on various assumptions and estimates. We make assumptions relating to discount rates, rate of compensation increase, expected return on plan assets and other factors. These assumptions are evaluated and updated annually and are described in further detail in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. The following assumptions relate to our U.S. qualified pension plan, which is our largest plan. We determine our discount rate for the U.S. retirement benefit plan by using a model that discounts each years estimated benefit payments by an applicable spot rate. These spot rates are derived from a yield curve created from a large number of high quality corporate bonds. Accordingly, our discount rate assumption was 5.60% at December 31, 2005 and 5.75% at December 31, 2004. The rate of compensation increase assumption reflects our actual experience and best estimate of future increases. Our estimate of the rate of compensation increase was 4.50% and 4.75% at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our expected return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results, the plans asset mix and future expectations of market rates of return on the types of assets in the plan. Our expected return on plan assets assumption was 8.5% in 2005 and 2004. Sensitivity to changes in assumptions: Discount rate a 0.25% increase in the discount rate would decrease annual pension expense by approximately $2 million. Rate of compensation increase a 0.25% increase in the rate of compensation increase would increase annual pension expense by approximately $2 million. Expected return on plan assets a 0.25% increase in the expected return on assets of our principal plans would decrease annual pension expense by approximately $4 million. Delayed recognition principles In accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, actual pension plan results that differ from our assumptions and estimates are accumulated and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants and will therefore affect pension expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods. We also base our net pension expense primarily on a market related valuation of plan assets. In accordance with this approach we recognize differences between the actual and expected return on 30 plan assets primarily over a five year period and as a result future pension expense will be impacted when these previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. Investment related risks and uncertainties We invest our pension plan assets in a variety of investment securities in accordance with our strategic asset allocation policy. The composition of our U.S. pension plan assets at December 31, 2005 was approximately 70% equity securities, 25% fixed income securities and 5% real estate investments. Investment securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate, market and credit risks. In particular, due to the level of risk associated with equity securities, it is reasonably possible that changes in the values of such investment securities will occur and that such changes could materially affect our future results. New Accounting Pronouncements In January 2003, FIN No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, was issued. FIN No. 46 requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. Our ownership of the equity of PBG qualifies as a variable interest entity under FIN No. 46. PBG was formed with GATX Corporation in 1997 for the purpose of financing and managing certain leasing related assets. We adopted the provisions of FIN No. 46 effective March 31, 2004. As a result, we consolidated the operations of PBG on March 31, 2004. Prior to March 31, 2004, we accounted for PBG under the equity method of accounting. PBGs minority interest of $29 million and $33 million respectively is included in other non current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004. The consolidation of PBG did not have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows. In May 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. SFAS 106 2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. The FSP provides accounting guidance for the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) to a sponsor of a postretirement health care plan that has concluded that prescription drug benefits available under the plan are actuarially equivalent and thus qualify for the subsidy under the Act. The provisions of FSP No. SFAS 106 2 were effective July 1, 2004. We have concluded that the prescription drug benefits provided under our non pension postretirement benefit plans are actuarially equivalent to the prescription drug benefits offered under Medicare Part D. We adopted the provisions of FSP No. SFAS 106 2 on a prospective basis on July 1, 2004. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. In November 2004, SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, was issued. SFAS No. 151 amends and clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material (spoilage). The provisions of SFAS No. 151 are effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of this provision did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2004, SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, was issued. SFAS No. 123R supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. The revised statement addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions with employees and other third parties, eliminates the ability to account for share based transactions using APB No. 25 and requires that the compensation costs relating to such transactions be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 123R requires compensation cost to be recognized immediately for awards granted to retirement eligible employees or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved, if that is expected to occur during the nominal vesting period. We currently use the nominal vesting period approach to determine the pro forma stock based compensation expense for all awards. SFAS No. 123R also requires additional disclosures relating to the income tax and cash flow effects resulting from share based payments. We adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 using the modified retrospective application. We estimate that our adoption of these provisions will reduce annual diluted earnings per share in 2006 by approximately eight to nine cents, which compares with eight cents in 2005. In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP No. SFAS 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The FSP provides guidance under SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Act) on enterprises income tax expense and deferred tax liability. The Jobs Act was enacted on October 22, 2004. FSP No. SFAS 109 2 states that companies are allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the Jobs Act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying SFAS No. 109. Under the Jobs Act, the Company repatriated $15 million of foreign earnings in 2005. Additional tax of less than $1 million was accrued as a result of this repatriation. 31 In June 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. SFAS 143 1, Accounting for Electronic Equipment Waste Obligations, that provides guidance on how commercial users and producers of electronic equipment should recognize and measure asset retirement obligations associated with the European Directive 2002/96/EC on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (the Directive). The adoption of this FSP did not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows for those European Union (EU) countries that enacted the Directive into country specific laws. We are currently evaluating the impact of applying this FSP in the remaining countries in future periods and do not expect the adoption of this provision to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further details. Legal and Regulatory Matters Legal See Legal Proceedings in Item 3 of this Form 10 K for information regarding our legal proceedings. Other The European Union has instituted two environmental directives that impact our international operations. The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment legislation, effective August 13, 2005, makes manufacturers responsible for the disposal of their equipment. This directive is progressively being rolled out by member states and is expected to be fully implemented in 2006. The Restriction of Hazardous Substances directive (RoHS) effective July 2006, requires the removal of substances that are now considered actually or potentially hazardous, from future equipment placements. As a result of the RoHS directive, we are required to modify or change certain components in our products and in some instances these changes will require us to seek re approval for the placement of postage meters from the appropriate postal authorities in each country. Income taxes We are continually under examination by tax authorities in the United States, other countries and local jurisdictions in which we have operations. The years under examination vary by jurisdiction. In December 2003, the IRS issued a closing agreement reflecting additional U.S. tax, interest and penalties related to 1992 through 1994. In January 2006, the IRS proposed adjustments that may result in the assessment of additional U.S. tax, interest and penalties related to 1995 through 2000. We are not disputing certain of these adjustments and the impact of these adjustments has been reflected in our financial statements. We are disputing other adjustments the IRS has proposed that may result in the assessment of additional U.S. tax, interest and penalties related to 1994 through 2000. These disputed adjustments relate primarily to the tax treatment of COLI and related interest expense, the tax effect of the sale of certain preferred share holdings and the tax treatment of certain lease transactions. The IRS will likely make similar adjustments to lease transactions when examining years subsequent to 2000. We disagree with these disputed adjustments and intend to contest them. We have requested a review of these adjustments by the administrative appeals division of the IRS. If negotiations at the administrative appeals level are not successful, we intend to file for judicial review of the disputed adjustments. The disputed adjustments from 1994 through 2000 could result in the assessment of additional tax of up to $390 million plus penalties of up to $65 million, a significant portion of which has already been accrued. Certain of these adjustments would result in future tax deductions and, therefore, are only temporary in nature. We have bonds posted with the IRS of $330 million to mitigate interest assessments on any otherwise underpaid tax that would result from a final settlement. In January 2006, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a District Court decision that another company received related to the tax treatment of COLI and related interest deductions. As a result, we recorded an additional tax reserve of $56 million in 2005. We have accrued for our best estimate of the probable tax, interest and penalties that may result from these disputed matters as it relates to 1992 through 2005 and we believe that the accrual for tax liabilities is appropriate. However, the resolution of such matters could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flow. 32 Effects of Inflation and Foreign Exchange Inflation, although moderate in recent years, continues to affect worldwide economies and the way companies operate. It increases labor costs and operating expenses, and raises costs associated with replacement of fixed assets such as rental equipment. Despite these growing costs and the USPS meter migration initiatives, we have generally been able to maintain profit margins through productivity and efficiency improvements, continual review of both manufacturing capacity and operating expense levels, and, to an extent, price increases. Our 2005 earnings performance was helped by currency translation gains of approximately one cent per diluted share. Based on the current contribution from our international operations, a 1% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar would result in a decline in revenue of approximately $14 million and a decline in income from continuing operations before income taxes of approximately $2 million. Although not affecting income, balance sheet related deferred translation losses of $54 million were recorded in 2005 resulting from the weaker British pound and Euro, partially offset by the stronger Canadian dollar, as compared to the U.S. dollar. During 2004 and 2003, we recorded deferred translation gains of $115 million and $143 million relating to the stronger British pound, Euro and Canadian dollar as compared with the U.S. dollar. The results of our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations. We enter into foreign exchange contracts primarily to minimize our risk of loss from such fluctuations. Exchange rates can also impact settlement of our intercompany receivables and payables that result from transfers of finished goods inventories between our affiliates in different countries, and intercompany loans. At December 31, 2005, we had approximately $406 million of foreign exchange contracts outstanding, all maturing in 2006, to buy or sell various currencies. Risks arise from the possible non performance by counterparties in meeting the terms of their contracts and from movements in securities values, interest and or exchange rates. However, we do not anticipate non performance by the counterparties as they are composed of a number of major international financial institutions. Maximum risk of loss on these contracts is limited to the amount of the difference between the spot rate at the date of the contract delivery and the contracted rate. Dividend Policy Our Board of Directors has a policy to pay a cash dividend on common stock each quarter. In setting dividend payments, our board considers the dividend rate in relation to our recent and projected earnings and our capital investment opportunities and requirements. We have paid a dividend each year since 1934. Forward Looking Statements We want to caution readers that any forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in this Form 10 K, other reports or press releases or made by our management involve risks and uncertainties which may change based on various important factors. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. These forward looking statements are those which talk about the Companys or managements current expectations as to the future and include, but are not limited to, statements about the amounts, timing and results of possible restructuring charges and future earnings. Words such as estimate, project, plan, believe, expect, anticipate, intend, and similar expressions may identify such forward looking statements. Some of the factors which could cause future financial performance to differ materially from the expectations as expressed in any forward looking statement made by or on our behalf include: changes in international or national political conditions, including any terrorist attacks negative developments in economic conditions, including adverse impacts on customer demand changes in postal regulations timely development and acceptance of new products success in gaining product approval in new markets where regulatory approval is required successful entry into new markets mailers utilization of alternative means of communication or competitors products the Companys success at managing customer credit risk, including risks associated with commercial passenger and cargo aircraft leasing transactions the Companys success at managing costs associated with its strategy of outsourcing functions and operations not central to its business changes in interest rates 33 foreign currency fluctuations cost, timing and execution of the restructuring plan including any potential asset impairments regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other conditions to consummation of any acquisitions and integration of recent acquisitions interrupted use of key information systems changes in privacy laws intellectual property infringement claims impact on mail volume resulting from current concerns over the use of the mail for transmitting harmful biological agents third party suppliers ability to provide product components negative income tax adjustments for prior audit years and changes in tax laws or regulations terms and timing of actions to reduce exposures and disposal of assets in our Capital Services segment, including the spin off or other disposition of the majority of the assets in this segment changes in pension and retiree medical costs acts of nature ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations due to our investing and funding activities and our operations in different foreign currencies. Our objectives in managing our exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve our objectives, we use a balanced mix of debt maturities and variable and fixed rate debt together with interest rate swaps. Our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility in earnings and cash flows associated with the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, we enter into various contracts, which change in value as foreign exchange rates change, to protect the value of external and intercompany transactions. The principal currencies hedged are the British pound, Canadian dollar and Euro. We employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks. We do not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures. We utilize a Value at Risk (VaR) model to determine the maximum potential loss in fair value from changes in market conditions. The VaR model utilizes a variance/co variance approach and assumes normal market conditions, a 95% confidence level and a one day holding period. The model includes all of our debt and all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts. The model excludes anticipated transactions, firm commitments, and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by us, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. During 2005 and 2004, our maximum potential one day loss in fair value of our exposure to foreign exchange rates and interest rates, using the variance/co variance technique described above, was not material. 34
