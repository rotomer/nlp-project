ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) contains statements that are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in Forward Looking Statements and elsewhere in this report. As a result of the sale of our Imagistics lease portfolio and Capital Services external financing business, the results of operations reflect these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Overview We had significant accomplishments in 2006, capped off by the passage of historic postal reform legislation. We achieved strong financial results throughout the year. We completed our restructuring program which has made us more efficient and competitive. With the sale of Capital Services and the tax settlement with the Internal Revenue Service earlier in the year, there is greater stability, transparency and visibility into our business. Revenue grew 7% in 2006 driven by strong growth in supplies, financing, software, mail services, marketing services and continued demand for our digital mailing and production mail equipment. Strategic transactions for the year included the acquisitions of Print, Inc.; Advertising Audit Services and PMH Caramanning; Ibis Consulting, Inc.; and Emtex Ltd. Acquisitions contributed 2% to our revenue growth. Income from continuing operations was $566 million in 2006 compared with $473 million in 2005 and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.51 in 2006 compared with $2.04 in 2005. In 2006, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was reduced by restructuring charges of 10 cents. In 2005, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was reduced by restructuring charges of 16 cents, increased by our tax reserves related to corporate owned life insurance (COLI) of 24 cents and reduced by foundation contributions of 3 cents. See Results of Operations for 2006, 2005 and 2004 for a more detailed discussion of our results of operations. Outlook for 2007 We anticipate that we will experience solid financial results for the year 2007. We expect that we will continue to experience a changing mix of product line sales, where a greater percentage of the revenue will come from diversified revenue streams associated with fully featured smaller systems and a smaller percentage from larger system sales. In addition, we expect to continue our market expansion in both Mailstream Solutions and Mailstream Services and derive further synergies from our recent acquisitions. We will remain focused on disciplined expense control and will continue to allocate capital in order to optimize our returns. In December 2006, the United States Congress passed and President Bush signed into law the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act which is the first major change to the United States Postal Service (USPS) since 1971. We believe that postal reform will set the stage for overall growth in the U.S. mailing industry. This new law enhances the stability of the USPS; provides rate flexibility; encourages increased use of technology; and encourages partnerships with the private sector. 10 Results of Operations 2006 Compared to 2005 Business segment revenue The following table shows revenue in 2006 and 2005 by business segment: (Dollars in millions) % Contribution 2006 2005 % change from Acquisitions Revenue: U.S. Mailing $ 2,350 $ 2,260 4% 1% International Mailing 1,013 917 10% 3% Production Mail 575 534 8% 1% Software 203 174 16% 8% Mailstream Solutions 4,141 3,885 7% 2% Management Services 1,074 1,072 2% Mail Services 370 335 10% Marketing Services 145 75 93% 68% Mailstream Services 1,589 1,482 7% 5% Total Revenue $ 5,730 $ 5,367 7% 2% Mailstream Solutions revenue increased 7% over the prior year driven by growth in our worldwide operations, and the acquisitions of Print, Inc. and Emtex in 2006 and Danka Canada in 2005. U.S. Mailings revenue grew by 4% due to solid growth in US equipment sales, supplies, shipping solutions and financing as our meter base continued to transition to new digital technology and customers took advantage of our broad range of financial offerings. However, revenue continued to be adversely affected by the ongoing changing mix to more fully featured smaller systems. International Mailings revenue grew by 10% driven by growth in mailing equipment and supplies. Worldwide revenue for Production Mail grew by 8% due to placements of inserting systems and strong demand for our advanced, high speed Infinity metering system in the U.S., offset by lower sales in Europe. Softwares revenue grew by 16% due to sales of document composition, and address management products. Mailstream Services revenue increased 7% driven by growth in Mail Services and Marketing Services and the acquisitions of Advertising Audit Services and PMH Caramanning (collectively AAS) and Ibis Consulting in 2006 and Imagitas as well as Compulit in 2005. During the year, we expanded our marketing services for the motor vehicle registration process to a sixth state and launched a catalog request form as an enhanced offering in the USPS move update kit. Management Services revenue remained flat in 2006 as we continued to focus on enhancing the profitability of this segment. Mail Services revenue increased by 10% as a result of our continued expansion of our presort and international consolidation network and growth in our customer base. Revenue growth for Marketing Services was driven by existing and new direct marketing services and the acquisition of AAS.

Cost of supplies as a percentage of revenue increased to 26.5% in 2006 compared with 24.6% in the prior year, primarily due to sales of toner, ink and other supplies which have lower margins than our traditional meter supplies. Cost of software as a percentage of revenue in 2006 remained flat at 21.3% compared with the prior year. Cost of rentals as a percentage of revenue increased to 21.8% in 2006 compared with 20.7% in the prior year, primarily due to higher depreciation costs from new placements associated with our meter base migration. Cost of support services increased to 55.8% of revenue in 2006 compared with 55.3% in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in the mix of higher cost Production Mail and International Mail support services. Cost of business services decreased to 78.2% of revenue in 2006 compared with 80.7% in the prior year, primarily due to our ongoing focus on cost containment and efficiency in our Management Services operations, and the successful integration of new sites in our Mail Services operations. Selling, general and administrative expenses (Dollars in millions) Percentage of Revenue 2006 2005 2006 2005 $ 1,764 $ 1,655 30.8% 30.8% Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, remained flat compared with 2005 as benefits from our transformation and productivity programs were offset by investments made in our selling and marketing capabilities as well as transition expenses related to the consolidation and outsourcing of administrative functions in Europe. Research and development expenses (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 % change $165 $166 (0.6)% Research and development expenses remained flat with the prior year. Our investment in research and development reflects our continued focus on developing new technologies and enhancing features for all of our different products as well as an increased mix of new software development. 13 Net interest expense (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 % change $213 $188 13.3% Net interest expense increased by $25 million in 2006 due to higher average interest rates and higher average borrowings during the year partly offset by higher interest income from the investment of proceeds received upon the sale of Capital Services. Our variable and fixed rate debt mix, after adjusting for the effect of interest rate swaps, was 23% and 77%, respectively, at December 31, 2006. Income taxes / effective tax rate 2006 2005 36.6% 40.5% The reduction in our 2006 effective tax rate was primarily due to the COLI tax reserve that was recorded in 2005. Minority interest (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 % change $14 $10 40.0% Minority interest includes dividends paid to preferred stockholders in a subsidiary. Minority interest increased compared with the prior year primarily due to an increase in the weighted average dividend rate which is repriced at each auction date.

U.S. Mailings revenue growth of 4% was favorably impacted by placements of small and mid sized networked digital mailing systems, mail creation equipment and supplies. International Mailing revenue grew 12% due to increased placements of mailing equipment with small businesses and increased sales of supplies. Revenue also benefited from the acquisition of Group MAG and Danka Canada, and favorable foreign currency translation, which contributed 4%. Worldwide Production Mail revenue increased by 14% driven by placements of our Advanced Productivity Systems and Flexible Productivity Systems. Software revenue grew 79% primarily as a result of a full years revenue from Group 1 which was acquired in July 2004. Mailstream Services revenue increased 17% over the prior year driven primarily by a 73% increase at Mail Services. Management Services revenue declined slightly from the prior year, reflecting our continued focus on enhancing profitability for this business segment. Our Mail Services operations grew at a double digit rate as a result of continued expansion of our presort and international mail consolidation network, growth in our customer base and the acquisitions of IMEX and Ancora. Revenue growth for Marketing Services is a result of our acquisition of Imagitas in May 2005. Business segment earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) The following table shows EBIT in 2005 and 2004 by business segment: (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 % change EBIT: U.S. Mailing $ 906 $ 861 5 % International Mailing 182 165 10 % Production Mail 49 31 58 % Software 27 14 93 % Mailstream Solutions 1,164 1,071 9 % Management Services 69 53 30 % Mail Services 20 11 82 % Marketing Services 10 Mailstream Services 99 64 55 % Total EBIT $ 1,263 $ 1,135 11 % 15 Mailstream Solutions EBIT increased 9% driven by revenue growth and the effect of our continued emphasis on reducing costs and controlling operating expenses. EBIT margins were adversely affected by the increase in mix of lower margin International Mail and Production Mail revenues. The increase in EBIT for Software is in line with the increase in revenue. Mailstream Services EBIT increased 55%. Mail Services EBIT increased due primarily to lower costs for the integration of recently added sites. Management Services EBIT margins improved slightly versus the prior year, helped by our focus on higher margin service offerings and ongoing administrative cost reduction measures. EBIT growth for Marketing Services is a result of our acquisition of Imagitas in May 2005.

Rentals revenue was negatively impacted by downsizing to smaller machines. At December 31, 2005, digital meters represented approximately 84% of our 1.3 million U.S. meter base, up from 75% in 2004. Financing revenue increased 8% due primarily to growth in our worldwide equipment leasing volumes, higher revenue from payment solutions and the favorable impact of foreign currency which contributed 1%. Support services revenue increased 12% due primarily to the acquisitions of Groupe MAG and Danka Canada, which in the aggregate contributed 9%; the favorable impact of foreign currency, which contributed 1%; a larger population of International and Production Mail equipment maintenance agreements; and the addition of hardware equipment services contracts from Standard Register Inc. in late 2004. Business services revenue increased 17% due primarily to growth at our existing and new Mail Services sites and the acquisitions of IMEX, Ancora, Compulit, and Imagitas which contributed 9% in aggregate. 16 Costs of revenue (Dollars in millions) Percentage of Revenue 2005 2004 2005 2004 Cost of equipment sales $ 625 $ 586 50.0 % 50.9 % Cost of supplies $ 73 $ 66 24.6 % 24.5 % Cost of software $ 37 $ 28 21.3 % 28.9 % Cost of rentals $ 166 $ 164 20.7 % 20.4 % Cost of support services $ 386 $ 340 55.3 % 54.4 % Cost of business services $ 1,196 $ 1,048 80.7 % 82.4 % Cost of equipment sales, as a percentage of sales revenue, decreased compared with 2004, primarily due to lower costs resulting from our successful transition to outsourcing of parts for digital equipment.

Our variable and fixed rate debt mix, after adjusting for the effect of interest rate swaps, was 21% and 79%, respectively, at December 31, 2005. Based on our borrowings at December 31, 2005, a one percentage point change in short term interest rates would impact annual diluted earnings per share by approximately 1 cent. Income taxes / effective tax rate 2005 2004 40.5 % 32.4 % In 2005, the effective tax rate increased by 6.5% due to a $56 million increase in our tax reserve related to an adverse court opinion that another company received related to the tax treatment of COLI. This was partially offset by tax benefits of 0.4% from restructuring charges and 0.8% from favorable adjustments to the Capital Services tax provisions. The effective tax rate in 2004 included tax benefits of 1.0% from restructuring charges. Minority interest (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 % change $ 10 $ 6 66.7 % Minority interest includes dividends paid to preferred stockholders in a subsidiary.

Other Income (Expense) Charitable contributions In 2005 we contributed $10 million ($6 million after tax) to the Pitney Bowes Literacy and Education Fund and the Pitney Bowes Employee Involvement Fund. 18 Legal settlements, net In 2004, we recorded a pre tax charge of approximately $20 million associated with the settlement of lawsuits related to a program we offered to some of our leasing customers to replace equipment if it was lost, stolen or destroyed. The $20 million charge related to the following settlement costs: award certificates to be provided to members of the class for purchase of office products through our diverse supply line; and the cost of legal fees and related expenses. In 2006, we recorded a pre tax gain of $5 million related to a revised liability estimate associated with this settlement and a pre tax charge of $2 million for other legal matters. Restructuring Charges In connection with our previously announced restructuring initiatives, we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $36 million, $54 million and $158 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2005 charge is net of a $30 million gain on the sale of our main plant manufacturing facility. We have now concluded our formal restructuring program which began in 2003. The cash outflows related to restructuring charges are funded primarily by cash from operating activities. The outstanding restructuring balance is expected to be substantially paid over the next twelve months. The restructuring initiatives are expected to continue to increase our operating efficiency and effectiveness in 2007 and beyond while enhancing growth, primarily as a result of reduced personnel related expenses. We realized incremental pre tax benefits of approximately $25 million, $50 million and $45 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, from these restructuring initiatives, primarily as a result of reduced personnel related expense, and currently estimate incremental pre tax benefits from these initiatives of approximately $20 million in 2007. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our accounting policy related to restructuring charges. The pre tax restructuring charges are composed of: (Dollars in millions) Restructuring Balance charges Non cash charges Cash payments December 31 2004 Severance and benefit costs $ 76 $ $ (55 ) $ 48 Asset impairments 73 (73 ) Other exit costs 9 (11 ) 3 $ 158 $ (73 ) $ (66 ) $ 51 2005 Severance and benefit costs $ 71 $ $ (74 ) $ 45 Asset impairments 7 (7 ) Other exit costs 6 (4 ) 5 Gain on sale of main plant (30 ) 30 $ 54 $ (7 ) $ (48 ) $ 50 2006 Severance and benefit costs $ 33 $ $ (46 ) $ 32 Asset impairments 1 (1 ) Other exit costs 2 (5 ) 2 $ 36 $ (1 ) $ (51 ) $ 34 All restructuring charges, except for asset impairments, will result in cash outflows. The severance and benefit costs relate to a reduction in workforce of approximately 4,000 employees worldwide from the inception of this plan through December 31, 2006. The workforce reductions relate to actions across several of our businesses resulting from infrastructure and process improvements and our continuing efforts to streamline operations, and include managerial, professional, clerical and technical roles. Approximately 62% of the workforce reductions were in the U.S. while the majority of the international workforce reductions were in Europe and Canada. Asset impairments in 2003 included a $24 million charge as a result of our decision to exit our main plant manufacturing facility in Connecticut in connection with our product sourcing and real estate optimization strategy. During the first quarter of 2005, following the successful rezoning of our main plant facility, we recorded a pre tax gain of $30 million related to the sale of this facility. Restructuring charges in 2004 included a pre tax charge of $28 million related to the planned closure of a manufacturing facility in Germany. Asset impairments in 2004 included a $47 million charge related to the write down of capitalized system development costs, related to order management processes, as a result of our changing business profile and organizational realignment. Other asset impairments in 2006, 2005 and 2004 relate primarily to the write down of property, plant and equipment resulting from the closure or streamlining of certain facilities and systems. The fair values of the impaired long lived assets were determined primarily using probability weighted expected cash flows in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. Other exit costs relate primarily to lease termination costs, non cancelable lease payments, consolidation of excess facilities and other costs associated with exiting business activities. 19 Acquisitions On July 31, 2006, we acquired Print, Inc. for approximately $47 million in cash.

These acquisitions did not have a material impact on our financial results either individually or on an aggregate basis. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that strong cash flow generated by operations, existing cash and liquid investments, as well as borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program, the existing credit facility and debt capital markets should be sufficient to finance our capital requirements for the foreseeable future. Our potential uses of cash include but are not limited to the following: growth and expansion opportunities; internal investments; customer financing; tax payments; interest and dividend payments; share repurchase program; and potential acquisitions and divestitures. Cash Flow Summary The change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows: (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 Cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ (286 ) $ 530 Cash provided by (used in) investing activities 720 (472 ) Cash used in financing activities (440 ) (128 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 2 (3 ) Decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (4 ) $ (73 ) 2006 Cash Flows Net cash used in operating activities decreased due to payments made to the IRS in connection with the sale of Capital Services and the IRS tax settlement. These payments to the IRS reflect taxes due from the sale of our Imagistics lease portfolio and Capital Services external financing business as well as final payments for our settlement of all outstanding tax audit issues in dispute for tax years through December 31, 2000. See Note 9 for further discussion. The increase in accounts receivable decreased cash from operations by approximately $47 million, primarily reflecting growth in sales of equipment and software licenses. The increase in our internal finance receivables balances reduced cash from operations by $237 million, reflecting growth in equipment placements and our payment solutions business during the year. Net cash provided by investing activities consisted primarily of proceeds of $747 million received from the sale of our Capital Services external financing business, $282 million received from the sale of our Imagistics lease portfolio and an advance of $138 million against the cash surrender value of our COLI policies, offset by $328 million in capital expenditures and $231 million used for acquisitions. Net cash used in financing activities was $440 million and consisted primarily of stock repurchases and dividends paid, offset by the issuance of debt, common stock and proceeds from preferred stock issued by a subsidiary. 2005 Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $530 million and consisted primarily of net income adjusted for non cash items, changes in operating assets and liabilities, contributions to our pension funds, restructuring payments and a $200 million tax bond posted with the IRS in April 2005. The increase in our deferred taxes and income taxes payable balances resulted from continued tax benefits from our internal financing and the run off of Capital Services leasing activities contributing $186 million to cash from operations. The increase in our internal finance receivables balances reduced cash from operations by $105 million, reflecting growth in equipment placements and our payment solutions business during the year. Other operating assets and liabilities reduced our cash from operations by $95 million primarily due to higher accounts receivable balances that resulted from strong growth in our businesses. Net cash used in investing activities was $472 million and consisted primarily of capital expenditures and acquisitions, partially offset by cash generated from Capital Services asset sales, increased reserve account deposits and proceeds from the sale of the main plant. 21 Net cash used in financing activities was $128 million and consisted primarily of dividends paid to stockholders and stock repurchases, partially offset by the issuance of debt and stock. Capital Expenditures During 2006, capital expenditures included net additions of $137 million to property, plant and equipment and $191 million in net additions to rental equipment and related inventories compared with $147 million and $145 million, respectively, in 2005. The increase in rental asset additions relates primarily to the continued migration to digital postage meters. We expect capital expenditures in 2007 to be approximately the same as 2006. These investments will also continue to be affected by the timing of our customers transition to digital meters. Financings and Capitalization We have a commercial paper program that is a significant source of liquidity. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately $490 million of outstanding commercial paper issuances and an unused credit facility of $1.5 billion which supports commercial paper issuances. In addition to our borrowing capability under the unused credit facilities described above, we have $1.1 billion available under the shelf registration statement filed in February 2005 with the SEC, permitting issuances of up to $2.5 billion in debt securities, preferred stock, preference stock, common stock, purchase contracts, depositary shares, warrants and units. In May 2006, we took a cash advance totaling $138 million against the cash surrender value in certain COLI policies. This advance is reflected as a reduction to our COLI investment in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In November 2006, we issued $500 million of unsecured fixed rate notes maturing in January 2037. These notes bear interest at an annual rate of 5.25% and pay interest semi annually beginning in January 2007. The proceeds from these notes were issued for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper, increases in customer financing, the financing of acquisitions and repurchase of the Companys shares. In December 2006, our subsidiary, Pitney Bowes International Holdings, Inc., issued 750,000 shares of variable term voting preferred stock for net proceeds of $74 million. The proceeds from the preferred stock issuance were used for general corporate purposes and the repayment of commercial paper. We believe our financing needs in the short and long term can be met from cash generated internally, borrowing capacity from existing credit agreements, available debt issuances under existing shelf registration statements and our existing commercial paper program. Information on debt maturities is presented in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following summarizes our known contractual obligations at December 31, 2006 and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods: Payments due by period Less than More than (Dollars in millions) Total 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years 5 years Commercial paper borrowings $ 490 $ 490 $ $ $ Long term debt and current portion of long term debt 3,826 1 700 150 2,975 Non cancelable operating lease obligations 249 79 96 48 26 Purchase obligations (1) 160 133 15 5 7 Other non current liabilities (2) 446 293 51 102 Total $ 5,171 $ 703 $ 1,104 $ 254 $ 3,110 (1) Purchase obligations include unrecorded agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding upon us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. (2) Other non current liabilities relate primarily to our postretirement benefits. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 22 Critical Accounting Policies We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations. We have discussed the impact and any associated risks on our results of operations related to these policies throughout the MD&A. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include, but are not limited to, customer cancellations, bad debts, inventory obsolescence, residual values of leased assets, useful lives of long lived assets and intangible assets, warranty obligations, restructuring, pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies and litigation, and allocation of purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired in business combinations. Our actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. We believe the assumptions and estimates used are reasonable and appropriate in accordance with GAAP. Revenue recognition Multiple element and internal financing arrangements We derive our revenue from multiple sources including sales, rentals, financing and services. Certain of our transactions are consummated at the same time and can therefore generate revenue from multiple sources. The most common form of these transactions involves a non cancelable equipment lease, a meter rental and an equipment maintenance agreement. As a result, we are required to determine whether the deliverables in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and if so, how the price should be allocated among the delivered elements and when to recognize revenue for each element. In multiple element arrangements, we recognize revenue for each of the elements based on their respective fair values in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. We recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known and uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved. Our allocation of the fair values to the various elements does not change the total revenue recognized from a transaction, but impacts the timing of revenue recognition. Revenue is allocated to the meter rental and equipment maintenance agreement elements first using their respective fair values, which are determined based on prices charged in standalone and renewal transactions. Revenue is then allocated to the equipment based on the present value of the remaining minimum lease payments. We then compare the allocated equipment fair value to the range of cash selling prices in standalone transactions during the period to ensure the allocated equipment fair value approximates average cash selling prices. We provide lease financing for our products primarily through sales type leases. We classify our leases in accordance with SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases. The vast majority of our leases qualify as sales type leases using the present value of minimum lease payments classification criteria outlined in SFAS No. 13. We believe that our sales type lease portfolio contains only normal collection risk with no important uncertainties with respect to future costs. Accordingly, we record the fair value of equipment as sales revenue, the cost of equipment as cost of sales and the minimum lease payments plus the estimated residual value as gross finance receivables. The difference between the gross finance receivable and the equipment fair value is recorded as unearned income and is amortized as income over the lease term using the interest rate implicit in the lease. Equipment residual values are determined at inception of the lease using estimates of equipment fair value at the end of the lease term. Estimates of future equipment fair value are based primarily on our historical experience. We also consider forecasted supply and demand for our various products, product retirement and future product launch plans, end of lease customer behavior, regulatory changes, remanufacturing strategies, used equipment markets, if any, competition and technological changes. We evaluate residual values on an annual basis or as changes to the above considerations occur. We have not experienced any material changes to our residual values during 2006, 2005 or 2004 nor do we expect any material changes to residual values in the foreseeable future. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our accounting policies on revenue recognition. 23 Allowances for doubtful accounts and credit losses Allowance for doubtful accounts We estimate our accounts receivable risks and provide allowances for doubtful accounts accordingly. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on a periodic basis. Our evaluation includes historical loss experience, length of time receivables are past due, adverse situations that may affect a customers ability to repay and prevailing economic conditions. We make adjustments to our allowance if our evaluation of allowance requirements differs from our actual aggregate reserve. This evaluation is inherently subjective because our estimates may be revised as more information becomes available. Based on historical experience, we have not had any material revisions to our recorded allowance for doubtful accounts. Allowance for credit losses We estimate our finance receivables risks and provide allowances for credit losses accordingly. We establish credit approval limits based on the credit quality of our customers and the type of equipment financed. We charge finance receivables to the allowance for credit losses after collection efforts are exhausted and we deem the account uncollectible. We base credit decisions primarily on a customers financial strength. We believe that our concentration of credit risk for finance receivables in our internal financing division is limited because of our large number of customers, small account balances and customer geographic and industry diversification. Our general policy for finance receivables contractually past due for over 120 days is to discontinue revenue recognition. We resume revenue recognition when payments reduce the account to 60 days or less past due. We evaluate the adequacy of allowance for credit losses on a periodic basis. Our evaluation includes historical loss experience, the nature and volume of our portfolios, adverse situations that may affect a customers ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. We make adjustments to our allowance for credit losses if the evaluation of reserve requirements differs from the actual aggregate reserve. This evaluation is inherently subjective because our estimates may be revised as more information becomes available. Accounting for income taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We record this amount as a provision for our taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. We regularly assess the likelihood of tax adjustments in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and account for the related financial statement implications. We have established tax reserves which we believe to be appropriate given the possibility of tax adjustments. Determining the appropriate level of tax reserves requires us to exercise judgment regarding the uncertain application of tax law. We adjust the amount of reserves when information becomes available or when an event occurs indicating a change in the reserve is appropriate. Future changes in tax reserve requirements could have a material impact on our results of operations. Based on our 2006 income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest, a 1% change in our effective tax rate would impact income from continuing operations by approximately $9.1 million. Long lived assets Useful lives of long lived assets We depreciate property, plant and equipment and rental property and equipment principally using the straight line method over estimated useful lives: machinery and equipment principally 3 to 15 years and buildings up to 50 years. We depreciate other depreciable assets using either the straight line method or accelerated methods. We amortize properties leased under capital leases on a straight line basis over the primary lease terms. We amortize capitalized costs related to internally developed software using the straight line method over the estimated useful life, which is principally 3 to 10 years. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which are principally 4 to 15 years. Our estimates of useful lives could be affected by changes in regulatory provisions, technology or business plans. 24 Impairment review We evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets, including goodwill and intangible assets, on an annual basis or as circumstances warrant. Our goodwill impairment review requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. Significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. We use internal discounted cash flow estimates, quoted market prices when available and appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value. We derive the cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our future long term business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate. When available and as appropriate, we use comparative market multiples to corroborate discounted cash flow results. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. We believe that we have no unrecorded asset impairments at December 31, 2006. However, future events and circumstances, some of which are described below, may result in an impairment charge: Changes in postal regulations governing the types of meters allowable for use. New technological developments that provide significantly enhanced benefits over current digital technology. Significant negative economic or industry trends. Changes in our business strategy that alters the expected usage of the related assets. Future economic results that are below our expectations used in the current assessments. Pension benefits Assumptions and estimates Our net pension expense, assets and obligations are dependent on various assumptions and estimates. We make assumptions relating to discount rates, rate of compensation increase, expected return on plan assets and other factors. These assumptions are evaluated and updated annually and are described in further detail in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following assumptions relate to our U.S. qualified pension plan, which is our largest plan. We determine our discount rate for the U.S. retirement benefit plan by using a model that discounts each years estimated benefit payments by an applicable spot rate. These spot rates are derived from a yield curve created from a large number of high quality corporate bonds. Accordingly, our discount rate assumption was 5.85% at December 31, 2006 and 5.60% at December 31, 2005. The rate of compensation increase assumption reflects our actual experience and best estimate of future increases. Our estimate of the rate of compensation increase was 4.50% at December 31, 2006 and 2005. Our expected return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results, the plans asset mix and future expectations of market rates of return on the types of assets in the plan. Our expected return on plan assets assumption was 8.50% in 2006 and 2005. Sensitivity to changes in assumptions: Discount rate a 0.25% increase in the discount rate would decrease annual pension expense by approximately $2.8 million. Rate of compensation increase a 0.25% increase in the rate of compensation increase would increase annual pension expense by approximately $2.2 million. Expected return on plan assets a 0.25% increase in the expected return on assets of our principal plans would decrease annual pension expense by approximately $3.9 million. Delayed recognition principles In accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, actual pension plan results that differ from our assumptions and estimates are accumulated and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants and will therefore affect pension expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods. We also base our net pension expense primarily on a market related valuation of plan assets. In accordance with this approach we recognize differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets primarily over a five year period and as a result future pension expense will be impacted when these previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. See new accounting pronouncements below for the effect of SFAS No. 158, Employees Accounting for Defined Pension and Other Post Retirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). 25 Investment related risks and uncertainties We invest our pension plan assets in a variety of investment securities in accordance with our strategic asset allocation policy. The composition of our U.S. pension plan assets at December 31, 2006 was approximately 72% equity securities, 23% fixed income securities and 5% real estate investments. Investment securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate, market and credit risks. In particular, due to the level of risk associated with equity securities, it is reasonably possible that changes in the values of such investment securities will occur and that such changes could materially affect our future results. New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123(R) (revised 2004), Share Based Payment. SFAS 123(R) supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. The revised statement addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions with employees and other third parties, eliminates the ability to account for share based transactions using APB No. 25 and requires that the compensation costs relating to such transactions be recognized in the condensed consolidated financial statements. SFAS 123(R) requires compensation cost to be recognized immediately for awards granted to retirement eligible employees or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved, if that is expected to occur during the nominal vesting period. Prior to our adoption of SFAS 123(R), we used the nominal vesting period approach to determine the pro forma stock based compensation expense for all awards. SFAS 123(R) also requires additional disclosures relating to the income tax and cash flow effects resulting from share based payments. We adopted the provisions of SFAS 123(R) on January 1, 2006 using the modified retrospective application. See Note 12 for further disclosures related to our stock based compensation. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, which replaces APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 28. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is not practicable. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Our adoption of SFAS 154 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 143 1, Accounting for Electronic Equipment Waste Obligations, that provides guidance on how commercial users and producers of electronic equipment should recognize and measure asset retirement obligations associated with the European Directive 2002/96/EC on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (the Directive). The adoption of this FSP did not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows for those European Union (EU) countries that enacted the Directive into country specific laws. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by creating a framework for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions that they have taken or expect to take in a tax return. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is required to be adopted by us beginning in the first quarter of 2007. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this Statement. In July 2006, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 13 2, Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction, that provides guidance on how a change or a potential change in the timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease transaction affects the accounting by a lessor for the lease. FSP 13 2 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is required to be adopted by us beginning in the first quarter of 2007. It is not anticipated that the adoption of FSP 13 2 will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), to define how the fair value of assets and liabilities should be measured in more than 40 other accounting standards where it is allowed or required. In addition to defining fair value, the statement establishes a framework within GAAP for measuring fair value and expands required disclosures surrounding fair value measurements. While it will change the way companies currently measure fair value, it does not establish any new instances where fair value measurement is required. SFAS 157 defines fair value as an amount that a company would receive if it sold an asset or paid to transfer a liability in a normal transaction between market participants in the same market where the company does business. It emphasizes that the value is based on assumptions that market participants would use, not necessarily only the company that might buy or sell the asset. SFAS 157 takes effect for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption allowed. We continue to evaluate the impact of adopting this Statement. 26 In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS 158) to require recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans on the balance sheet. Under SFAS 158, gains and losses, prior service costs and credits, and any remaining transition amounts under SFAS 87 and SFAS 106 that have not yet been recognized through net periodic benefit cost are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax effects, until they are amortized as a component of net periodic cost. Our adoption of the provisions of SFAS 158 reduced our stockholders equity by $297 million at December 31, 2006. SFAS 158 did not affect our results of operations or cash flows. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding the adoption of SFAS 158. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements for the purposes of determining whether the current years financial statements are materially misstated. SAB 108 allows registrants to adjust for the cumulative effect of certain errors relating to prior years in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the current year, with an offsetting adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption provided that management has properly concluded that the errors were not material to prior periods. SAB 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. In 2006, we determined that the accounting for certain leveraged lease transactions in Canada was misstated due to changes in assumptions having occurred prior to 2000 which impacted net income from the leases. Such changes in assumptions require the leveraged lease pricing models to be revised. These misstatements were immaterial to prior periods, however correction in the current period would have had the effect of reducing our pre tax income and our tax provision by approximately $48 million and $43 million, respectively, which was considered material to the current period financial statements. Accordingly, we corrected these misstatements by adjusting opening retained earnings in 2006 by $5 million. As part of this adjustment, we also decreased our investment in leveraged leases by $33 million, increased other non current liabilities by $15 million and decreased deferred taxes on income by $43 million. Legal and Regulatory Matters Legal See Legal Proceedings in Item 3 of this Form 10 K for information regarding our legal proceedings. Other The European Union has instituted two environmental directives that impact our international operations. The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment legislation, effective August 13, 2005, makes manufacturers responsible for the disposal of their equipment. This directive is progressively being rolled out by member states. The Restriction of Hazardous Substances directive (RoHS) effective July 2006, requires the removal of substances that are now considered actually or potentially hazardous, from future equipment placements. As a result of the RoHS directive, we are required to modify or change certain components in our products and in some instances these changes will require us to seek re approval for the placement of postage meters from the appropriate postal authorities in each country. Income taxes In 2006, we accrued in discontinued operations an additional tax expense of $16.2 million to record the impact of the recently enacted Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act (TIPRA). The TIPRA legislation repealed the exclusion from federal income taxation a portion of the income generated from certain leveraged leases of aircraft by foreign sales corporations. See Note 2 for further discussion of discontinued operations. In August 2006, we reached a settlement with the IRS governing all outstanding tax audit issues in dispute for tax years through 2000. These disputed items related primarily to the tax treatment of corporate owned life insurance (COLI) and related interest expense, the tax effect of the sale of certain preferred share holdings and the tax treatment of certain Capital Services lease transactions. In the second quarter of 2006, we estimated the tax due as a result of the IRS settlement including our best estimate of the additional liability for these items in all open years, the sale of the Imagistics portfolio and the sale of the Capital Services businesses to be approximately $1.1 billion. Accordingly, we recorded $61 million of additional tax expense. $41 million of the $61 million tax expense related to the Capital Services business and was included in discontinued operations and $20 million was included in continuing operations. The $1.1 billion tax liability is net of $330 million of IRS tax bonds previously posted. We paid the $1.1 billion obligation to the IRS by the end of 2006. These tax obligations were funded with proceeds previously received from the sale of the Imagistics portfolio and the Capital Services business and the advance against the cash surrender value of our COLI assets. 27 In January 2006, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a District Court decision that another company received related to the tax treatment of COLI and related interest deductions. As a result, we recorded additional tax reserves of $56 million in our 2005 financial results. We regularly assess the likelihood of tax adjustments in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we have operations and account for the related financial statement implications. Tax reserves have been established which we believe to be appropriate given the possibility of tax adjustments. Determining the appropriate level of tax reserves requires us to exercise judgment regarding the uncertain application of tax law. The amount of reserves is adjusted when information becomes available or when an event occurs indicating a change in the reserve is appropriate. Future changes in tax reserve requirements could have a material impact on our results of operations. We have accrued our estimate of the probable tax, interest and penalties that may result from these disputed matters as it relates to 2001 through 2006 and we believe that the accrual for tax liabilities is appropriate. However, the resolution of such matters could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flow. We are continually under examination by tax authorities in the United States, other countries and local jurisdictions in which we have operations. The years under examination vary by jurisdiction. Effects of Inflation and Foreign Exchange Inflation, although moderate in recent years, continues to affect worldwide economies and the way companies operate. It increases labor costs and operating expenses, and raises costs associated with replacement of fixed assets such as rental equipment. Despite these growing costs and the USPS meter migration initiatives, we have generally been able to maintain profit margins through productivity and efficiency improvements, continual review of both manufacturing capacity and operating expense levels, and, where applicable, price increases. Our 2006 revenue growth was helped by approximately 0.3% due to currency translation. Currency translation gains increased our income before taxes by $3 million. Based on the current contribution from our international operations, a 1% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar would result in a decline in revenue of approximately $15 million and a decline in income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest of approximately $2 million. Although not affecting income, balance sheet related deferred translation gains of $83 million were recorded in 2006 resulting from the stronger British pound, Euro and Canadian dollar, as compared to the U.S. dollar. During 2005, we recorded deferred translation losses of $54 million relating to the weaker British pound and Euro, partially offset by the stronger Canadian dollar as compared with the U.S. dollar. During 2004, we recorded deferred translation gains of $115 million relating to the stronger British pound, Euro and Canadian dollar. The results of our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations. We enter into foreign exchange contracts primarily to minimize our risk of loss from such fluctuations. Exchange rates can also impact settlement of our intercompany receivables and payables that result from transfers of finished goods inventories between our affiliates in different countries, and intercompany loans. At December 31, 2006, we had approximately $617 million of foreign exchange contracts outstanding, all maturing in 2007, to buy or sell various currencies. Risks arise from the possible non performance by counterparties in meeting the terms of their contracts and from movements in securities values, interest and or exchange rates. However, we do not anticipate non performance by the counterparties as they are composed of a number of major international financial institutions. Maximum risk of loss on these contracts is limited to the amount of the difference between the spot rate at the date of the contract delivery and the contracted rate. Dividends It is a general practice of our Board of Directors to pay a cash dividend on common stock each quarter. In setting dividend payments, our board considers the dividend rate in relation to our recent and projected earnings and our capital investment opportunities and requirements. We have paid a dividend each year since 1934. 28 Forward Looking Statements We want to caution readers that any forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in this Form 10 K, other reports or press releases or made by our management involve risks and uncertainties which may change based on various important factors. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. These forward looking statements are those which talk about our current expectations as to the future and include, but are not limited to, statements about the amounts, timing and results of possible restructuring charges and future earnings. Words such as estimate, project, plan, believe, expect, anticipate, intend, and similar expressions may identify such forward looking statements. Some of the factors which could cause future financial performance to differ materially from the expectations as expressed in any forward looking statement made by or on our behalf include: changes in international or national political conditions, including any terrorist attacks negative developments in economic conditions, including adverse impacts on customer demand changes in postal regulations timely development and acceptance of new products success in gaining product approval in new markets where regulatory approval is required successful entry into new markets mailers utilization of alternative means of communication or competitors products our success at managing customer credit risk our success at managing costs associated with our strategy of outsourcing functions and operations not central to our business changes in interest rates foreign currency fluctuations cost, timing and execution of the restructuring plans including any potential asset impairments regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other conditions to consummation of any acquisitions and integration of recent acquisitions interrupted use of key information systems changes in privacy laws intellectual property infringement claims impact on mail volume resulting from current concerns over the use of the mail for transmitting harmful biological agents third party suppliers ability to provide product components negative income tax adjustments for prior audit years and changes in tax laws or regulations changes in pension and retiree medical costs acts of nature ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations due to our investing and funding activities and our operations denominated in different foreign currencies. We manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by limiting its impact on earnings and cash flows and lowering our overall borrowing costs. We use a balanced mix of debt maturities and variable and fixed rate debt together with interest rate swaps to execute our strategy. Our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility in earnings and cash flows associated with the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, we enter into various contracts, which change in value as foreign exchange rates change, to protect the value of external and intercompany transactions. 29 The principal currencies actively hedged are the British pound, Canadian dollar and Euro. We employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks. We do not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures. We utilize a Value at Risk (VaR) model to determine the maximum potential loss in fair value from changes in market conditions. The VaR model utilizes a variance/co variance approach and assumes normal market conditions, a 95% confidence level and a one day holding period. The model includes all of our debt and all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts. The model excludes anticipated transactions, firm commitments, and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by us, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. During 2006 and 2005, our maximum potential one day loss in fair value of our exposure to foreign exchange rates and interest rates, using the variance/co variance technique described above, was not material.
