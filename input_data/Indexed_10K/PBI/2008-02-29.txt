ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) contains statements that are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in Forward Looking Statements and elsewhere in this report. Overview Revenue grew 7% in 2007 to $6.1 billion. Acquisitions and foreign currency translation contributed about 4% and 2%, respectively to this growth. Acquisitions for this year included MapInfo Corporation, Digital Cement, and Asterion SAS. Income from continuing operations was $361 million in 2007 compared with $566 million in 2006 and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.63 in 2007 compared with $2.51 in 2006. In 2007, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was reduced by restructuring and impairment charges of 87 cents, 5 cents for the purchase accounting alignment for MapInfo, and 16 cents for tax adjustments, related principally to a valuation allowance for net operating losses outside the U.S. In 2006, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was reduced by restructuring charges of 10 cents and tax adjustments of 9 cents and increased by 1 cent from net legal settlements. Our Software and Mail Services segments experienced strong results during 2007. These strong performances were offset by disappointing results in Europe, weaker performance in the legal solutions portion of our Management Services segment, and lower sales at U.S. Mailing due to the wind down of meter migration. In addition, weakness in certain sectors of the economy, such as financial services, adversely affected our results during the second half of 2007. On November 15, 2007, we announced a plan to lower our cost structure, accelerate efforts to improve operational efficiencies, and to transition our product line. As a result of this program, we expect a net reduction of about 1,500 positions across business lines and geographies, representing approximately 4 percent of the global employment base. Also, following a comprehensive review of our portfolio, we decided to explore strategic alternatives to determine the best course of action for our U.S. Management Services business. See Results of Operations for 2007, 2006 and 2005 for a more detailed discussion of our results of operations. Outlook We believe that the actions we took in the fourth quarter of 2007, and actions that we will continue to take in 2008, will position us for sustained, long term improvement in earnings and increased shareholder value. We expect to realize approximately $70 million in pre tax annual benefits from these actions in 2008. We intend to reinvest the majority of these benefits in programs to improve our customers experience and our operational efficiencies. We are targeting $150 million in pre tax annual benefits by 2009. We plan to use about half of these benefits to improve customer processes and generate revenue. We expect our mix of revenue to continue to change, with a greater percentage of revenue coming from diversified revenue streams associated with fully featured smaller systems and a smaller percentage from larger system sales. We also expect a greater percentage of revenue growth from the Software and Mail Services segments. In addition, we expect to derive further synergies from our recent acquisitions. We will continue to remain focused on enhancing our productivity and to allocate capital in order to optimize our returns. 10 Results of Operations 2007 Compared to 2006 Business segment revenue The following table shows revenue in 2007 and 2006 by business segment: (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 % change % contribution from acquisitions Revenue: U.S. Mailing $ 2,346 $ 2,350 % 1 % International Mailing 1,070 1,013 6 % % Production Mail 603 575 5 % 2 % Software 346 203 71 % 50 % Mailstream Solutions 4,365 4,141 5 % 3 % Management Services 1,135 1,074 6 % 3 % Mail Services 459 370 24 % 5 % Marketing Services 171 145 18 % 16 % Mailstream Services 1,765 1,589 11 % 5 % Total Revenue $ 6,130 $ 5,730 7 % 4 % U.S. Mailings revenue remained flat. Revenue benefited from growth in supplies, payment solutions, and the sale of equipment related to shape based rating. However, results were unfavorably impacted by lower equipment sales due to the wind down of meter migration and weak economic conditions. International Mailings revenue grew by 6%, including favorable foreign currency translation of 8%. The segments results were negatively impacted by lower sales and rentals in Europe as delays in postal liberalization across Europe affected customer purchases. Worldwide revenue for Production Mail grew by 5%, primarily driven by favorable foreign currency of 3% and acquisitions as higher equipment placements in the U.S. were offset by lower sales in Europe. Softwares revenue grew by 71% driven by continued strong worldwide demand for our software solutions, the acquisition of MapInfo, and favorable foreign currency translation of 4%. Management Services revenue increased by 6% due to the acquisition of Asterion SAS and favorable foreign currency translation of 2%. The segments revenue growth was negatively impacted by weakness in our legal solutions vertical as well as print contracts in the prior year that did not repeat in 2007. Mail Services revenue increased by 24% due to continued growth in presort and cross border mail services. Marketing Services revenue increased by 18% driven primarily by acquisitions. Revenue growth for this segment was negatively affected by lower revenue from our motor vehicle registration services program. Business segment earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) We use EBIT as a measure of our segment profitability. Refer to the reconciliation of segment amounts to income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table shows EBIT in 2007 and 2006 by business segment: (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 % change EBIT U.S. Mailing $ 957 $ 944 1 % International Mailing 162 179 (10 )% Production Mail 73 66 11 % Software 55 33 66 % Mailstream Solutions 1,247 1,222 2 % Management Services 76 83 (9 )% Mail Services 65 43 51 % Marketing Services 9 20 (55 )% Mailstream Services 150 146 2 % Total EBIT $ 1,397 $ 1,368 2 % 11 U.S. Mailings EBIT grew 1% due to the increase in mix of higher margin revenue from payment solutions and supplies as well as our continued focus on controlling operating expenses. International Mailing EBIT decreased 10%. The segments profitability was adversely impacted by lower equipment sales and rentals in Europe, and incremental costs in 2007 related to back office operations, including the outsourcing of our European order and financial processing. Production Mail EBIT increased 11% driven primarily by revenue growth and net legal recoveries of approximately $4 million in Europe. Software EBIT increased 66%, driven by revenue growth partially offset by integration costs for the MapInfo acquisition. Management Services EBIT decreased 9% due to continued weakness in our legal solutions vertical. Mail Services EBIT grew by 51% driven by revenue growth, successful integration of acquired sites, and increased operating efficiencies. Marketing Services EBIT decreased 55%, principally due to lower revenue in our motor vehicle registration services program.

Supplies revenue increased 16% from the prior year due to the continued transition of our meter base to digital technology. Acquisitions and foreign currency translation contributed 4% and 3% to this growth, respectively. Software revenue increased 71% from the prior year primarily driven by strong worldwide demand for our software solutions, acquisitions which contributed 50%, and currency translation which contributed 4%. Rentals revenue decreased 6% from the prior year due to the continued downsizing by customers to smaller machines. Financing revenue increased 9% from the prior year primarily due to higher revenue from payment solutions and equipment leases. Foreign currency translation accounted for 2% of this growth. Support services revenue increased 6% from the prior year due primarily to acquisitions, which contributed 2%, and foreign currency translation, which contributed 3% to this growth. Business services revenue increased 11% over the prior year. This increase was driven by strong growth in our presort and cross border mail services.

Cost of rentals as a percentage of revenue increased to 23.2% in 2007 compared with 21.8% in the prior year, primarily due to higher depreciation costs from placements of new digital meters. Cost of support services as a percentage of revenue increased to 56.9% in 2007 compared with 55.8% in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in mix of production mail and international mailing revenue. Cost of business services as a percentage of revenue remained flat at 78.2%. Improving margins in our presort and cross border services were offset by lower margins in our legal solutions business. Selling, general and administrative expenses (Dollars in millions) Percentage of Revenue 2007 2006 2007 2006 $ 1,907 $ 1,764 31.1 % 30.8 % Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, increased to 31.1% compared with 30.8% in the prior year. This increase was due to the impact of acquisitions which offset the benefits from productivity initiatives. Research and development expenses (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 % change $ 186 $ 165 12 % Research and development expenses increased 12% over the prior year, primarily due to the acquisition of MapInfo. Our investment in research and development reflects higher expenses for software development and our continued focus on developing new technologies and enhancing features for all of our different products. Net interest expense (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 % change $ 242 $ 213 14 % Net interest expense increased 14% in 2007 due to higher average interest rates and higher average borrowings during the year. Also, last year we had interest income on the cash balance that resulted from the Capital Services divestiture. Our variable and fixed rate debt mix, after adjusting for the effect of interest rate swaps, was 19% and 81%, respectively, at December 31, 2007. Income taxes / effective tax rate 2007 2006 42.4 % 36.6 % The effective tax rate for continuing operations for 2007 included $54 million of tax charges related principally to a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets and tax rate changes outside the U.S. The effective tax rate for 2006 included a $20 million charge related to the IRS settlement discussed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Minority interest (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 % change $ 19 $ 14 39 % Minority interest includes dividends paid to preferred stockholders in subsidiary companies. Minority interest increased by $5 million compared with the prior year, primarily due to an increase in the average outstanding preferred shares and a higher weighted average dividend rate. 13 Discontinued operations (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Revenue $ $ 81 Pretax income $ $ 29 Net income $ 6 $ 31 Gain on sale of Imagistics, net of $7 tax expense 11 FSC tax law change (16 ) Additional tax on IRS settlement (41 ) Loss on sale of Capital Services, net of $285 tax benefit (445 ) Total discontinued operations, net of tax $ 6 $ (460 ) Net income in 2007 includes a gain of $11.3 million from the conclusion of certain tax issues net of an interest accrual for uncertain tax positions of $5.8 million.

See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion and details of discontinued operations. 14 Results of Operations 2006 Compared to 2005 Business segment revenue The following table shows revenue in 2006 and 2005 by business segment: (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 % change % contribution from acquisitions Revenue: U.S. Mailing $ 2,350 $ 2,260 4 % 1 % International Mailing 1,013 917 10 % 3 % Production Mail 575 534 8 % 1 % Software 203 174 16 % 8 % Mailstream Solutions 4,141 3,885 7 % 2 % Management Services 1,074 1,072 2 % Mail Services 370 335 10 % Marketing Services 145 75 93 % 68 % Mailstream Services 1,589 1,482 7 % 5 % Total Revenue $ 5,730 $ 5,367 7 % 2 % Mailstream Solutions revenue increased 7% over the prior year driven by growth in our worldwide operations, and the acquisitions of Print, Inc. and Emtex in 2006 and Danka Canada in 2005. U.S. Mailings revenue grew by 4% due to solid growth in U.S. equipment sales, supplies, shipping solutions and financing as our meter base continued to transition to new digital technology and customers took advantage of our broad range of financial offerings. However, revenue continued to be adversely affected by the ongoing changing mix to more fully featured smaller systems. International Mailings revenue grew by 10% driven by growth in mailing equipment and supplies. Worldwide revenue for Production Mail grew by 8% due to placements of inserting systems and strong demand for our advanced, high speed Infinity metering system in the U.S., offset by lower sales in Europe. Softwares revenue grew by 16% due to sales of document composition, and address management products. Mailstream Services revenue increased 7% driven by growth in Mail Services and Marketing Services and the acquisitions of Advertising Audit Services and PMH Caramanning (collectively AAS) and Ibis Consulting in 2006 and Imagitas as well as Compulit in 2005. During the year, we expanded our marketing services for the motor vehicle registration process to a sixth state and launched a catalog request form as an enhanced offering in the USPS move update kit. Management Services revenue remained flat in 2006 as we continued to focus on enhancing the profitability of this segment. Mail Services revenue increased by 10% as a result of our continued expansion of our presort and international consolidation network and growth in our customer base. Revenue growth for Marketing Services was driven by existing and new direct marketing services and the acquisition of AAS.

Cost of supplies as a percentage of revenue increased to 26.5% in 2006 compared with 24.6% in the prior year, primarily due to sales of toner, ink and other supplies which have lower margins than our traditional meter supplies. Cost of software as a percentage of revenue in 2006 remained flat at 21.3% compared with the prior year. 16 Cost of rentals as a percentage of revenue increased to 21.8% in 2006 compared with 20.7% in the prior year, primarily due to higher depreciation costs from new placements associated with our meter base migration. Cost of support services as a percentage of revenue increased to 55.8% in 2006 compared with 55.3% in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in the mix of higher cost Production Mail and International Mail support services. Cost of business services as a percentage of revenue decreased to 78.2% in 2006 compared with 80.7% in the prior year, primarily due to our ongoing focus on cost containment and efficiency in our Management Services operations, and the successful integration of new sites in our Mail Services operations. Selling, general and administrative expenses (Dollars in millions) Percentage of Revenue 2006 2005 2006 2005 $ 1,764 $ 1,655 30.8 % 30.8 % Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, remained flat compared with 2005 as benefits from our transformation and productivity programs were offset by investments made in our selling and marketing capabilities as well as transition expenses related to the consolidation and outsourcing of administrative functions in Europe. Research and development expenses (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 % change $ 165 $ 166 (1 )% Research and development expenses decreased 1% from the prior year. Our investment in research and development reflects our continued focus on developing new technologies and enhancing features for all of our different products as well as an increased mix of new software development. Net interest expense (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 % change $ 213 $ 188 13 % Net interest expense increased by $25 million in 2006 due to higher average interest rates and higher average borrowings during the year partly offset by higher interest income from the investment of proceeds received upon the sale of Capital Services. Our variable and fixed rate debt mix, after adjusting for the effect of interest rate swaps, was 23% and 77%, respectively, at December 31, 2006. Income taxes / effective tax rate 2006 2005 36.6 % 40.5 % The reduction in our 2006 effective tax rate was primarily due to the COLI tax reserve that was recorded in 2005. Minority interest (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 % change $ 14 $ 10 40 % Minority interest includes dividends paid to preferred stockholders in a subsidiary. Minority interest increased compared with the prior year primarily due to an increase in the weighted average dividend rate which is repriced at each auction date. 17 Discontinued operations (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 Revenue $ 81 $ 125 Pretax income $ 29 $ 38 Net income $ 31 $ 35 Gain on sale of Imagistics, net of $7 tax expense 11 FSC tax law change (16 ) Additional tax on IRS settlement (41 ) Loss on sale of Capital Services, net of $285 tax benefit (445 ) Total discontinued operations, net of tax $ (460 ) $ 35 In 2006, we completed the sale of our Capital Services external financing business and our Imagistics lease portfolio. We have reported the results of these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion and details of discontinued operations. Other (Income) Expense In 2007 and 2006, we recorded pre tax gains of approximately $3 million and $5 million, respectively, related to a revised liability estimate associated with the settlement of a previous lawsuit and net pre tax charges of approximately $3 million in 2007 and $2 million in 2006 for other legal matters. In 2005, we contributed $10 million to the Pitney Bowes Literacy and Education Fund and the Pitney Bowes Employee Involvement Fund. These amounts are included in other (income) expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Restructuring Charges and Asset Impairments We recorded pre tax restructuring charges and asset impairments of $264 million in 2007. These charges relate primarily to a program we announced in November 2007 to lower our cost structure, accelerate efforts to improve operational efficiencies, and transition our product line. The program includes charges primarily associated with older equipment that we have stopped selling upon transition to the new generation of fully digital, networked, and remotely downloadable equipment. The asset impairment charges related to these initiatives include the write off of inventory ($48 million), rental assets ($61 million), lease residual values ($46 million), and other assets ($9 million). The cash portion of the restructuring charges includes employee termination costs ($85 million) and other exit costs ($6 million) and relates primarily to our efforts to lower our cost structure and accelerate improvements in operational efficiencies. As a result of this program, we expect a net reduction of about 1,500 positions. About half of these reductions will be outside of the U.S. As of December 31, 2007, 401 employees had been terminated under this program. Other exit costs relate primarily to lease termination costs and other costs associated with exiting product lines and business activities. The cash outflows related to the cash charges will be funded primarily by cash from operating activities. We expect to incur approximately $20 million of additional restructuring charges in 2008 associated with these actions, however, we continue to evaluate additional actions in conjunction with this program. We expect to complete the majority of this program by the end of 2008. We are targeting to achieve $150 million in pre tax annual benefits from these initiatives by 2009. In addition, asset impairments also include the write down of certain intangible assets for $9 million. The pre tax restructuring charges and asset impairments are composed of: (Dollars in millions) Restructuringcharges Non cashCharges Cashpayments BalanceDecember 31,2007 Severance and benefit costs $ 85 $ $ (4 ) $ 81 Asset impairments 173 (173 ) Other exit costs 6 6 Total $ 264 $ (173 ) $ (4 ) $ 87 18 In connection with our 2003 restructuring program, we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $36 million and $54 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The 2005 charge is net of a $30 million gain on the sale of our main plant manufacturing facility. The activities associated with this program were substantially completed in 2006. We made restructuring payments of $29 million, $51 million and $48 million (net of the $30 million gain) during 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The remaining restructuring liability associated with this program at December 31, 2007 is $5 million. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our accounting policy related to restructuring charges and asset impairments. Acquisitions On September 12, 2007, we acquired Asterion SAS for $28 million in cash, net of cash acquired. Asterion is a leading provider of outsourced transactional print and document process services in France. We assigned the goodwill to the Management Services segment. On May 31, 2007, we acquired the remaining shares of Digital Cement, Inc. for a total purchase price of $49 million in cash, net of cash acquired. Digital Cement, Inc. provides marketing management strategy and services to help companies acquire, retain, manage, and grow their customer relationships. We assigned the goodwill to the Marketing Services segment. On April 19, 2007, we acquired MapInfo Corporation for $446 million in cash, net of cash acquired. Included in the assets and liabilities acquired were short term investments of $46 million and debt assumed of $14 million. MapInfo is a global company and a leading provider of location intelligence software and solutions. We assigned the goodwill to the Software segment. As part of the purchase accounting for MapInfo, we aligned MapInfos accounting policies with ours. Accordingly, certain software revenue that was previously recognized by MapInfo on a periodic basis is now being recognized over the life of the contract. On July 31, 2006, we acquired Print, Inc. for approximately $46 million in cash, net of cash acquired. Print, Inc. provides printer supplies, service and equipment under long term managed services contracts. The goodwill was assigned to the U.S. Mailing segment. On June 15, 2006, we acquired substantially all the assets of Advertising Audit Service and PMH Caramanning (collectively AAS) for approximately $42 million in cash. AAS offers a variety of web based tools for the customization of promotional mail and marketing collateral and designs and manages customer and channel performance solutions. The goodwill was assigned to the Marketing Services segment. On April 24, 2006, we acquired Ibis Consulting, Inc. (Ibis) for approximately $65 million in cash, net of cash acquired. Ibis is a leading provider of electronic discovery (eDiscovery) services to law firms and corporate clients. Ibis technology and offerings complement those of Compulit, which we acquired in 2005, and expands our range of solutions and services for the complex litigation support needs of law firms and corporate legal departments. The goodwill was assigned to the Management Services segment. On February 8, 2006, we acquired Emtex Ltd. (Emtex) for approximately $33 million in cash, net of cash acquired. Emtex is a software and services company that allows large volume mailers to simplify document production and centrally manage complex multi vendor and multi site print operations. The goodwill was assigned to the Software segment. We accounted for these acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and accordingly, the operating results of these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. As a result of the purchase accounting alignment, the acquisition of MapInfo reduced our diluted earnings per share by 5 cents in 2007. Acquisitions made in 2006 did not materially impact income from continuing operations for that year. During 2007 and 2006, we also completed several smaller acquisitions for an aggregate cost of $87 million and $43 million, respectively. These acquisitions did not have a material impact on our financial results either individually or on an aggregate basis. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that cash flow generated by operations, existing cash and liquid investments, as well as borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program, the existing credit facility and debt capital markets should be sufficient to finance our capital requirements and to cover our customer deposits for the foreseeable future. Our potential uses of cash include but are not limited to the following: growth and expansion opportunities; internal investments; customer financing; tax payments; interest and dividend payments; share repurchase program; and potential acquisitions and divestitures. 19 Cash Flow Summary The change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows: (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 1,060 $ (286 ) Cash (used in) provided by investing activities (726 ) 720 Cash used in financing activities (204 ) (440 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 8 2 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 138 $ (4 ) 2007 Cash Flows Net cash provided by operations consisted primarily of net income adjusted for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The strong cash flow provided by operations for 2007 is primarily driven by tax refunds and lower tax payments, lower investment in finance receivables, and increased management attention on working capital which resulted in lower accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable balances. Net cash used in investing activities consisted of acquisitions of $594 million and capital expenditures of $265 million partially offset by proceeds from the sale of a training facility for $30 million, proceeds from short term investments of $42 million, and increased reserve account balances for customer deposits of $63 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $204 million and consisted primarily of stock repurchases of $400 million and dividends paid of $289 million, primarily offset by a net borrowing of debt of $377 million and proceeds from stock issuance of $108 million. 2006 Cash Flows Net cash used in operating activities decreased due to payments made to the IRS in connection with the sale of Capital Services and the IRS tax settlement. These payments to the IRS reflect taxes due from the sale of our Imagistics lease portfolio and Capital Services external financing business as well as final payments for our settlement of all outstanding tax audit issues in dispute for tax years through December 31, 2000. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. The increase in accounts receivable decreased cash from operations by approximately $47 million, primarily reflecting growth in sales of equipment and software licenses. The increase in our internal finance receivables balances reduced cash from operations by $237 million, reflecting growth in equipment placements and our payment solutions business during the year. Net cash provided by investing activities consisted primarily of proceeds of $747 million received from the sale of our Capital Services external financing business, $282 million received from the sale of our Imagistics lease portfolio and an advance of $138 million against the cash surrender value of our COLI policies, offset by $328 million in capital expenditures and $231 million used for acquisitions. Net cash used in financing activities was $440 million and consisted primarily of stock repurchases and dividends paid, offset by the issuance of debt, common stock and proceeds from preferred stock issued by a subsidiary. Capital Expenditures During 2007, capital expenditures included net additions of $142 million to property, plant and equipment and $123 million in net additions to rental equipment and related inventories compared with $137 million and $191 million, respectively, in 2006. The decrease in rental asset additions relates primarily to the wind down of our customers transition to digital meters. Financings and Capitalization We have a commercial paper program that is a significant source of liquidity. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately $405 million of outstanding commercial paper issuances and an unused credit facility of $1.5 billion which supports commercial paper issuances. In September 2007, we issued $500 million of unsecured fixed rate notes maturing in September 2017. These notes bear interest at an annual rate of 5.75% and pay interest semi annually beginning in March 2008. The proceeds from these notes 20 were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper, the financing of acquisitions and repurchase of our stock. In December 2007, we entered into a $150 million syndicated bank transaction priced at 3 month LIBOR plus 35 basis points. The proceeds from this credit facility, due 2012, were used to pay off the $150 million variable rate debt that was due in 2010. In addition to our borrowing capability under the unused credit facilities described above, we have $0.6 billion available under the shelf registration statement filed in February 2005 with the SEC, permitting issuances of up to $2.5 billion in debt securities, preferred stock, preference stock, common stock, purchase contracts, depository shares, warrants and units. We believe our financing needs in the short and long term can be met from cash generated internally, borrowing capacity from existing credit agreements, available debt issuances under existing shelf registration statements and our existing commercial paper program. Information on debt maturities is presented in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following summarizes our known contractual obligations at December 31, 2007 and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods: Payments due by period (Dollars in millions) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Commercial paper borrowings $ 405 $ 405 $ $ $ Long term debt and current portion of long term debt 4,339 550 151 551 3,087 Non cancelable operating lease obligations 292 89 113 52 38 Capital lease obligations 22 9 10 3 Purchase obligations (1) 252 193 45 14 Other non current liabilities (2) 406 258 49 99 Total $ 5,716 $ 1,246 $ 577 $ 669 $ 3,224 (1) Purchase obligations include unrecorded agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding upon us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. (2) Other non current liabilities relate primarily to our postretirement benefits. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The amount and period of future payments related to our FIN 48 income tax uncertainties cannot be reliably estimated and, therefore, is not included in the above table. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. Critical Accounting Policies We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations. We have discussed the impact and any associated risks on our results of operations related to these policies throughout the MD&A. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include, but are not limited to, customer cancellations, bad debts, inventory obsolescence, residual values of leased assets, useful lives of long lived assets and intangible assets, warranty obligations, restructuring, pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies and litigation, and allocation of purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired in business combinations. Our actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. We believe the assumptions and estimates used are reasonable and appropriate in accordance with GAAP. 21 Revenue recognition Multiple element and internal financing arrangements We derive our revenue from multiple sources including sales, rentals, financing and services. Certain of our transactions are consummated at the same time and can therefore generate revenue from multiple sources. The most common form of these transactions involves a non cancelable equipment lease, a meter rental and an equipment maintenance agreement. As a result, we are required to determine whether the deliverables in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and if so, how the price should be allocated among the delivered elements and when to recognize revenue for each element. In multiple element arrangements, we recognize revenue for each of the elements based on their respective fair values in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. We recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known and uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved. Our allocation of the fair values to the various elements does not change the total revenue recognized from a transaction, but impacts the timing of revenue recognition. Revenue is allocated to the meter rental and equipment maintenance agreement elements first using their respective fair values, which are determined based on prices charged in standalone and renewal transactions. Revenue is then allocated to the equipment based on the present value of the remaining minimum lease payments. We then compare the allocated equipment fair value to the range of cash selling prices in standalone transactions during the period to ensure the allocated equipment fair value approximates average cash selling prices. We provide lease financing for our products primarily through sales type leases. We classify our leases in accordance with SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases. The vast majority of our leases qualify as sales type leases using the present value of minimum lease payments classification criteria outlined in SFAS No. 13. We believe that our sales type lease portfolio contains only normal collection risk with no important uncertainties with respect to future costs. Accordingly, we record the fair value of equipment as sales revenue, the cost of equipment as cost of sales and the minimum lease payments plus the estimated residual value as gross finance receivables. The difference between the gross finance receivable and the equipment fair value is recorded as unearned income and is amortized as income over the lease term using the interest rate implicit in the lease. Equipment residual values are determined at inception of the lease using estimates of equipment fair value at the end of the lease term. Estimates of future equipment fair value are based primarily on our historical experience. We also consider forecasted supply and demand for our various products, product retirement and future product launch plans, end of lease customer behavior, regulatory changes, remanufacturing strategies, used equipment markets, if any, competition and technological changes. We evaluate residual values on an annual basis or as changes to the above considerations occur. In 2007, we recorded an impairment charge of $46 million related to the transition of our product line. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. We did not experience any material changes to our residual values during 2006 or 2005. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our accounting policies on revenue recognition. Allowances for doubtful accounts and credit losses Allowance for doubtful accounts We estimate our accounts receivable risks and provide allowances for doubtful accounts accordingly. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on a periodic basis. Our evaluation includes historical loss experience, length of time receivables are past due, adverse situations that may affect a customers ability to repay and prevailing economic conditions. We make adjustments to our allowance if our evaluation of allowance requirements differs from our actual aggregate reserve. This evaluation is inherently subjective because our estimates may be revised as more information becomes available. Based on historical experience, we have not had any material revisions to our recorded allowance for doubtful accounts. Allowance for credit losses We estimate our finance receivables risks and provide allowances for credit losses accordingly. We establish credit approval limits based on the credit quality of our customers and the type of equipment financed. We charge finance receivables to the allowance for credit losses after collection efforts are exhausted and we deem the account uncollectible. We base credit decisions primarily on a customers financial strength. We believe that our concentration of credit risk for finance receivables in our internal financing division is limited because of our large number of customers, small account balances and customer geographic and industry diversification. Our general policy for finance receivables contractually past due for over 22 120 days is to discontinue revenue recognition. We resume revenue recognition when payments reduce the account to 60 days or less past due. We evaluate the adequacy of allowance for credit losses on a periodic basis. Our evaluation includes historical loss experience, the nature and volume of our portfolios, adverse situations that may affect a customers ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. We make adjustments to our allowance for credit losses if the evaluation of reserve requirements differs from the actual aggregate reserve. This evaluation is inherently subjective because our estimates may be revised as more information becomes available. Accounting for income taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We record this amount as a provision for our taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), which supplements Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, by defining the confidence level that a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 requires a two step approach under which the tax effect of a position is recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained and the amount of the tax benefit recognized is equal to the largest tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement of the tax position. This is a different standard for recognition than the approach previously required. Both approaches require us to exercise considerable judgment and estimates are inherent in both processes. We regularly assess the likelihood of tax adjustments in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and account for the related financial statement implications. We have established tax reserves which we believe to be appropriate given the possibility of tax adjustments. Determining the appropriate level of tax reserves requires us to exercise judgment regarding the uncertain application of tax law. We adjust the amount of reserves when information becomes available or when an event occurs indicating a change in the reserve is appropriate. Future changes in tax reserve requirements could have a material impact on our results of operations. Based on our 2007 income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest, a 1% change in our effective tax rate would impact income from continuing operations by approximately $7 million. Long lived assets Useful lives of long lived assets We depreciate property, plant and equipment and rental property and equipment principally using the straight line method over estimated useful lives: machinery and equipment principally 3 to 15 years and buildings up to 50 years. We depreciate other depreciable assets using either the straight line method or accelerated methods. We amortize properties leased under capital leases on a straight line basis over the primary lease terms. We amortize capitalized costs related to internally developed software using the straight line method over the estimated useful life, which is principally 3 to 10 years. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which are principally 4 to 15 years. Our estimates of useful lives could be affected by changes in regulatory provisions, technology or business plans. Impairment review We evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets, including goodwill and intangible assets, on an annual basis or as circumstances warrant. Our goodwill impairment review requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. Significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. We use internal discounted cash flow estimates, quoted market prices when available and appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value. We derive the cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our future long term business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate. When available and as appropriate, we use comparative market multiples to corroborate discounted cash flow results. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. 23 See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on our transition initiatives and asset impairments recorded in 2007. We believe that we have no unrecorded asset impairments at December 31, 2007. However, future events and circumstances, some of which are described below, may result in an impairment charge: Changes in postal regulations governing the types of meters allowable for use. New technological developments that provide significantly enhanced benefits over current technology. Significant negative economic or industry trends. Changes in our business strategy that alters the expected usage of the related assets. Future economic results that are below our expectations used in the current assessments. Pension benefits Assumptions and estimates The valuation and calculation of our net pension expense, assets and obligations are dependent on various assumptions and estimates. We make assumptions relating to discount rates, rate of compensation increase, expected return on plan assets and other factors. These assumptions are evaluated and updated annually and are described in further detail in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following assumptions relate to our U.S. qualified pension plan, which is our largest plan. We determine our discount rate for the U.S. retirement benefit plan by using a model that discounts each years estimated benefit payments by an applicable spot rate. These spot rates are derived from a yield curve created from a large number of high quality corporate bonds. Accordingly, our discount rate assumption was 6.15% at December 31, 2007 and 5.85% at December 31, 2006. The rate of compensation increase assumption reflects our actual experience and best estimate of future increases. Our estimate of the rate of compensation increase was 4.50% at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Our expected return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results, the plans asset mix and future expectations of market rates of return on the types of assets in the plan. Our expected return on plan assets assumption was 8.50% in 2007 and 2006. Sensitivity to changes in assumptions: Discount rate a 0.25% increase in the discount rate would decrease annual pension expense by approximately $2.9 million. Rate of compensation increase a 0.25% increase in the rate of compensation increase would increase annual pension expense by approximately $2.5 million. Expected return on plan assets a 0.25% increase in the expected return on assets of our principal plans would decrease annual pension expense by approximately $3.9 million. Delayed recognition principles In accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, actual pension plan results that differ from our assumptions and estimates are accumulated and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants and will therefore affect pension expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods. We also base our net pension expense primarily on a market related valuation of plan assets. In accordance with this approach, we recognize differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets primarily over a five year period and as a result future pension expense will be impacted when these previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. See the new accounting pronouncements below for the effect of SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Pension and Other Post Retirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). Investment related risks and uncertainties We invest our pension plan assets in a variety of investment securities in accordance with our strategic asset allocation policy. The composition of our U.S. pension plan assets at December 31, 2007 was approximately 66% equity securities, 28% fixed income securities and 6% real estate investments. Investment securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate, market and credit risks. In particular, due to the level of risk associated with equity securities, it is reasonably possible those changes in the values of such investment securities will occur and that such changes could materially affect our future results. 24 New Accounting Pronouncements In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections (FAS 154), which replaces APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 28. FAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is not practicable. FAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Our adoption of SFAS 154 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 143 1, Accounting for Electronic Equipment Waste Obligations, that provides guidance on how commercial users and producers of electronic equipment should recognize and measure asset retirement obligations associated with the European Directive 2002/96/EC on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (the Directive). The adoption of this FSP did not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows for those European Union (EU) countries that enacted the Directive into country specific laws. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), which supplements Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, by defining the confidence level that a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 requires the tax effect of a position to be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date. If a tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits, no benefits of the position are recognized. This is a different standard for recognition than was previously required. The more likely than not threshold must continue to be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of a benefit. At adoption, companies adjusted their financial statements to reflect only those tax positions that were more likely than not to be sustained as of the adoption date. Any necessary adjustment was recorded directly to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption and reported as a change in accounting principle. We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007 which resulted in a decrease to opening retained earnings of $84.4 million, with a corresponding increase in our tax liabilities. In July 2006, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 13 2, Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction, that provided guidance on how a change or a potential change in the timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease transaction affected the accounting by a lessor for the lease. We adopted the provisions of FSP No. FAS 13 2 on January 1, 2007. Our adoption of this FSP did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157), to define how the fair value of assets and liabilities should be measured in accounting standards where it is allowed or required. In addition to defining fair value, the statement establishes a framework within GAAP for measuring fair value and expands required disclosures surrounding fair value measurements. While it will change the way companies currently measure fair value, it does not establish any new instances where fair value measurement is required. FAS 157 defines fair value as an amount that a company would receive if it sold an asset or paid to transfer a liability in a normal transaction between market participants in the same market where the company does business. It emphasizes that the value is based on assumptions that market participants would use, not necessarily only the company that might buy or sell the asset. The FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 157 a, Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement No. 13 and Its Related Interpretive Accounting Pronouncements That Address Leasing Transactions, which eliminated lease accounting from the scope of this standard. FAS 157, as issued, is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 157 b, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, which delays the effective date by one year for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, at least annually. We do not expect that the adoption of this statement for financial assets and liabilities, effective January 1, 2008, will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flow. We continue to evaluate the impact of adopting this statement for the nonfinancial items deferred until January 1, 2009. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (FAS 158), which required recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans on the balance sheet. Under FAS 158, gains and losses, prior service costs and credits, and any remaining transition amounts under SFAS 87 and SFAS 106 that have not yet been recognized through net periodic benefit cost were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax effects, until they are amortized as a component of net periodic cost. Our adoption of the provisions of FAS 158 reduced stockholders equity by $297 million at December 31, 2006. FAS 158 did not affect our results of operations or cash flows. 25 In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 provided guidance on how prior year misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements for the purposes of determining whether the current years financial statements are materially misstated. SAB 108 allowed registrants to adjust for the cumulative effect of certain errors relating to prior years in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the current year, with an offsetting adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption provided that management had properly concluded that the errors were not material to prior periods. SAB 108 was effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. In 2006, we determined that the accounting for certain leveraged lease transactions in Canada was misstated due to changes in assumptions having occurred prior to 2000 which impacted net income from the leases. Such changes in assumptions required the leveraged lease pricing models to be revised. These misstatements were immaterial to periods prior to 2006, however correction in that period would have had the effect of reducing our pre tax income and our tax provision by $48 million and $43 million, respectively, which was considered material to the 2006 financial statements. Accordingly, we corrected these misstatements by adjusting opening retained earnings in 2006 by $5 million. As part of this adjustment, we also decreased our investment in leveraged leases by $33 million, increased other non current liabilities by $15 million and decreased deferred taxes on income by $43 million. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities (FAS 159),which permits entities to choose to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis. The fair value election once made is irrevocable. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings. FAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We do not expect to adopt the fair value option allowed by this standard. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (R), Business Combinations (FAS 141 (R)). FAS 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how a company (a) recognizes and measures in their financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest (previously referred to as minority interest); (b) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and (c) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of a business combination. FAS 141 (R) requires fair value measurements at the date of acquisition, with limited exceptions specified in the Statement. Some of the major impacts of this new standard include expense recognition for transaction costs and restructuring costs. FAS 141 (R) is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and will be applied prospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this Statement. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51 (FAS 160). FAS 160 addresses the accounting and reporting for the outstanding noncontrolling interest (previously referred to as minority interest) in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It also establishes additional disclosures in the consolidated financial statements that identify and distinguish between the interests of the parents owners and of the noncontrolling owners of a subsidiary. FAS 160 requires changes in ownership interest that do not result in deconsolidation to be accounted for as equity transactions. This Statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. This gain or loss is measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment. This Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. FAS 160 requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests. All other requirements of FAS 160 are applied prospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this Statement. Legal and Regulatory Matters Legal See Legal Proceedings in Item 3 of this Form 10 K for information regarding our legal proceedings. Other The European Union has instituted two environmental directives that impact our international operations. The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment legislation, effective August 13, 2005, makes manufacturers responsible for the disposal of their equipment. The Restriction of Hazardous Substances directive (RoHS) effective July 2006, requires the removal of substances that are now considered actually or potentially hazardous, from future equipment placements. As a result of the RoHS directive, we have sought and received re approval for the placement of postage meters from the appropriate postal authorities in each country. 26 Income taxes The current IRS exam of tax years 2001 2004 is estimated to be completed in the next year or two, and the federal statute of limitations for years prior to 2001 has expired. In connection with the 2001 2004 audit, we are currently disputing a recent formal request from the IRS in the form of a civil summons to provide certain company workpapers. The company believes that certain documents being sought should not be produced because they are privileged. In the third quarter, in a similar case, the U.S. District Court in Rhode Island ruled that certain company workpapers were privileged. The IRS has appealed that decision. A similar issue is also being litigated between the IRS and another taxpayer before the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. In connection with the 2001 2004 audit, we have recently entered into an agreement in principle with the IRS regarding the tax treatment of certain Capital Services lease transactions. The additional tax and interest associated with this settlement was accrued and paid to the IRS prior to 2007. In 2006, we accrued in discontinued operations an additional tax expense of $16.2 million to record the impact of the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act (TIPRA). The TIPRA legislation repealed the exclusion from federal income taxation of a portion of the income generated from certain leveraged leases of aircraft by foreign sales corporations. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of discontinued operations. In August 2006, we reached a settlement with the IRS governing all outstanding tax audit issues in dispute for the tax years through 2000. These disputed items related primarily to the tax treatment of corporate owned life insurance (COLI) and related interest expense, the tax effect of the sale of certain preferred share holdings, and the tax treatment of certain Capital Services lease transactions. In the second quarter of 2006, we estimated the tax due as a result of the IRS settlement including our best estimate of the additional liability for these items in all open years, the sale of the Imagistics portfolio and the sale of the Capital Services business to be approximately $1.1 billion. Accordingly, we recorded $61 million of additional tax expense. The $1.1 billion tax liability was net of $330 million of IRS tax bonds previously posted. In the third quarter of 2006, we paid $239 million of the $1.1 billion obligation to the IRS, with the remainder paid by the end of 2006. These tax obligations were funded with proceeds previously received in 2006 from the sale of the Imagistics lease portfolio and Capital Services and the advance against the cash surrender value of our COLI assets. Of the $61 million of tax expense, $41 million related to the Capital Services business and was included in discontinued operations and $20 million was included in continuing operations. In January 2006, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a District Court decision that another company received related to the tax treatment of COLI and related interest deductions. As a result, we recorded additional tax reserves of $56 million in our 2005 financial results. We regularly assess the likelihood of tax adjustments in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we have operations and account for the related financial statement implications. Tax reserves have been established which we believe to be appropriate given the possibility of tax adjustments. Determining the appropriate level of tax reserves requires us to exercise judgment regarding the uncertain application of tax law. The amount of reserves is adjusted when information becomes available or when an event occurs indicating a change in the reserve is appropriate. Future changes in tax reserve requirements could have a material impact on our results of operations. We have accrued our estimate of the probable tax, interest and penalties that may result from these disputed matters as it relates to 2001 through 2007 and we believe that the accrual for tax liabilities is appropriate. However, the resolution of such matters could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flow. We are continually under examination by tax authorities in the United States, other countries and local jurisdictions in which we have operations. The years under examination vary by jurisdiction. Effects of Inflation and Foreign Exchange Inflation, although moderate in recent years, continues to affect worldwide economies and the way companies operate. It increases labor costs and operating expenses, and raises costs associated with replacement of fixed assets such as rental equipment. Despite these growing costs and the USPS meter migration initiatives, we have generally been able to maintain profit margins through productivity and efficiency improvements, continual review of both manufacturing capacity and operating expense levels, and, where applicable, price increases. Currency translation increased our 2007 revenue by approximately 2%. Also, currency translation gains increased our income before taxes by $11 million. Based on the current contribution from our international operations, a 1% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar would result in a decline in revenue of approximately $17 million and a decline in income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest of approximately $2 million. 27 Although not affecting income, balance sheet related deferred translation gains of $165 million were recorded in 2007 resulting primarily from the stronger British pound, Euro and Canadian dollar, as compared to the U.S. dollar. During 2006, we recorded deferred translation gains of $83 million resulting primarily from the stronger British pound, Euro and Canadian dollar, as compared to the U.S. dollar. During 2005, we recorded deferred translation losses of $54 million resulting primarily from the weaker British pound and Euro, partially offset by the stronger Canadian dollar as compared with the U.S. dollar. The results of our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations. We enter into foreign exchange contracts primarily to minimize our risk of loss from such fluctuations. Exchange rates can also impact settlement of our intercompany receivables and payables that result from transfers of finished goods inventories between our affiliates in different countries, and intercompany loans. At December 31, 2007, we had $316 million of foreign exchange contracts outstanding, all maturing in 2008, to buy or sell various currencies. As a result of the use of derivative instruments, we are exposed to counterparty risk. To mitigate such risks, we enter into contracts with only those financial institutions that meet stringent credit requirements as set forth in our derivative policy. We regularly review our credit exposure balances as well as the creditworthiness of our counterparties. Maximum risk of loss on these contracts is limited to the amount of the difference between the spot rate at the date of the contract delivery and the contracted rate. Dividends It is a general practice of our Board of Directors to pay a cash dividend on common stock each quarter. In setting dividend payments, our board considers the dividend rate in relation to our recent and projected earnings and our capital investment opportunities and requirements. We have paid a dividend each year since 1934. Forward Looking Statements We want to caution readers that any forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in this Form 10 K, other reports or press releases or made by our management involve risks and uncertainties which may change based on various important factors. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. These forward looking statements are those which talk about our current expectations as to the future and include, but are not limited to, statements about the amounts, timing and results of possible restructuring charges and future earnings. Words such as estimate, project, plan, believe, expect, anticipate, intend, and similar expressions may identify such forward looking statements. Some of the factors which could cause future financial performance to differ materially from the expectations as expressed in any forward looking statement made by or on our behalf include: changes in international or national political conditions, including any terrorist attacks negative developments in economic conditions, including adverse impacts on customer demand changes in postal regulations timely development and acceptance of new products success in gaining product approval in new markets where regulatory approval is required successful entry into new markets mailers utilization of alternative means of communication or competitors products our success at managing customer credit risk our success at managing costs associated with our strategy of outsourcing functions and operations not central to our business changes in interest rates foreign currency fluctuations cost, timing and execution of our transition plans including any potential asset impairments regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other conditions to consummation of any acquisitions and integration of recent acquisitions interrupted use of key information systems changes in privacy laws intellectual property infringement claims impact on mail volume resulting from current concerns over the use of the mail for transmitting harmful biological agents third party suppliers ability to provide product components negative income tax adjustments for prior audit years and changes in tax laws or regulations changes in pension and retiree medical costs acts of nature 28 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations due to our investing and funding activities and our operations denominated in different foreign currencies. We manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by limiting its impact on earnings and cash flows and lowering our overall borrowing costs. We use a balanced mix of debt maturities and variable and fixed rate debt together with interest rate swaps to execute our strategy. Our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility in earnings and cash flows associated with the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, we enter into various contracts, which change in value as foreign exchange rates change, to protect the value of external and intercompany transactions. The principal currencies actively hedged are the British pound, Canadian dollar and Euro. We employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks. We do not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures. We utilize a Value at Risk (VaR) model to determine the maximum potential loss in fair value from changes in market conditions. The VaR model utilizes a variance/co variance approach and assumes normal market conditions, a 95% confidence level and a one day holding period. The model includes all of our debt and all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts. The model excludes anticipated transactions, firm commitments, and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by us, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. During 2007 and 2006, our maximum potential one day loss in fair value of our exposure to foreign exchange rates and interest rates, using the variance/co variance technique described above, was not material.
