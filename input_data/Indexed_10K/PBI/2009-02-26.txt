ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) contains statements that are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in Forward Looking Statements and elsewhere in this report. Overview Revenue grew 2% in 2008 to $6.3 billion, of which acquisitions contributed 3%. Income from continuing operations was $447.5 million in 2008 compared with $361.2 million in 2007 and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.13 compared with $1.63 in 2007. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was reduced by restructuring charges and asset impairment charges of 69 cents and 87 cents, in 2008 and 2007, respectively. In 2008, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations also included positive tax adjustments of 4 cents related primarily to deferred tax assets associated with certain U.S. leasing transactions. In 2007, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was also reduced by 5 cents for the purchase accounting alignment of MapInfo, and 16 cents for tax adjustments related principally to a valuation allowance for net operating losses outside the U.S. Despite volatile economic conditions, particularly in the second half of 2008, certain of our business segments produced solid results, including both revenue and EBIT growth at International Mailing, Mail Services and Marketing Services. In addition, International Mailing, worldwide Production Mail, and Marketing Services improved their EBIT margins as well. These strong performances were offset by revenue declines at U.S. Mailing due to lower equipment sales due in part from the prior year stimulus from sales of shape based kits, lower financing and rental revenues. Also, declines in worldwide Production Mail were due to the effects of a slowdown in U.S. sales as large enterprises curtailed large ticket capital expenditures due to ongoing credit constraints and global economic uncertainty. In late 2007, we announced a plan to lower our cost structure, accelerate efforts to improve operational efficiencies, enhance our customer experience, and to transition our product line. On completion of this program, which continued throughout 2008, we reduced our global workforce by roughly eight percent and improved margins in many of our business segments. In addition, we generated $990 million in cash from operations during 2008. See Results of Operations for 2008, 2007 and 2006 for a more detailed discussion of our results of operations. Outlook Our business model and the actions we have taken to significantly reduce costs and streamline our operations, will help mitigate, but do not eliminate the effects of prolonged global economic weakness and unanticipated currency fluctuations. Two external factors in particular, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen last year and the significant increase in pension costs related to recent changes in capital markets and other assumptions, will negatively impact 2009 reported results. We expect our mix of revenue to continue to change, with a greater percentage of revenue coming from diversified revenue streams associated with fully featured smaller systems and a smaller percentage from larger system sales. In addition, we expect to derive further synergies from our recent acquisitions. We will continue to remain focused on enhancing our productivity and to allocate capital in order to optimize our returns. 11 Results of Operations 2008 Compared to 2007 Business segment revenue The following table shows revenue in 2008 and 2007 by business segment. Prior year results have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Refer to Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on these changes. (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 % change % contribution from acquisitions Revenue: U.S. Mailing $ 2,207 $ 2,364 (7 )% 0 % International Mailing 1,133 1,070 6 % 1 % Production Mail 616 623 (1 )% 0 % Software 400 326 23 % 20 % Mailstream Solutions 4,356 4,383 (1 )% 2 % Management Services 1,172 1,135 3 % 6 % Mail Services 542 441 23 % 10 % Marketing Services 192 171 12 % 5 % Mailstream Services 1,906 1,747 9 % 7 % Total Revenue $ 6,262 $ 6,130 2 % 3 % Mailstream Solutions revenue decreased 1% to $4.4 billion. Within Mailstream Solutions: U.S. Mailings revenue decreased 7% due to lower equipment placements, rental revenue, and lower financing revenue. The lower equipment revenues were driven in part by the prior year benefits from the sale of mailing equipment shape based upgrade kits and by customer buying decisions influenced by uncertainty created by weak economic conditions. International Mailings revenue grew by 6% and benefited 2% from favorable foreign currency translation and 1% from acquisitions. Revenue growth benefited from strong growth in France, Germany, Norway and other parts of Europe as well as in Latin America; and continued growth in supplies. Worldwide revenue for Production Mail decreased 1% due to lower equipment sales in the U.S., parts of Europe and Latin America as economic uncertainty slowed large ticket capital expenditures by many large enterprises worldwide. This decrease was partly offset by continued strong demand in the U.K. and France for high speed, intelligent inserting systems. Software revenue increased 23% from prior year, driven by the positive impact of acquisitions of 20%. Software sales increased outside of the U.S., but declined within the U.S. driven by the economic uncertainty, which has resulted in fewer large ticket licensing deals than in the prior year as customers assess the overall business environment. Mailstream Services revenue grew 9% to $1.9 billion. Within Mailstream Services: Management Services revenue grew 3% driven by acquisitions, which contributed 6% to segment revenue growth. The segments revenue growth was partially offset by lower print and transaction volumes for some customers, especially in the U.S. financial services sector. Mail Services revenue grew 23% due to continued growth in presort and international mail services of 14% and acquisitions, which contributed 10% to segment revenue growth. Marketing Services revenue grew 12% driven primarily by higher volumes in our mover source program, partially offset by the companys planned phased exit from the motor vehicle registration services program. Business segment earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) We use EBIT as a measure of our segment profitability. Refer to the reconciliation of segment amounts to income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table shows EBIT in 2008 and 2007 by business segment. Prior year results have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Refer to Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on these changes. 12 (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 % change EBIT U.S. Mailing $ 896 $ 965 (7 )% International Mailing 185 162 14 % Production Mail 81 74 10 % Software 28 37 (23 )% Mailstream Solutions 1,190 1,238 (4 )% Management Services 70 76 (8 )% Mail Services 69 57 22 % Marketing Services 16 9 76 % Mailstream Services 155 142 9 % Total EBIT $ 1,345 $ 1,380 (3 )% Mailstream Solutions EBIT decreased 4% to $1.2 billion. Within Mailstream Solutions: U.S. Mailings EBIT decreased 7% principally due to the lower revenue growth, but was partly offset by positive impacts of our ongoing actions to reduce costs and streamline operations. International Mailings EBIT grew 14% as improved EBIT margins resulted from the Companys actions over the last two years to reduce costs through the outsourcing of manufacturing and the consolidation of back office operations. Production Mails EBIT increased 10% due to ongoing actions to reduce administrative costs and improve gross margins in anticipation of a slowing capital investment environment. Softwares EBIT decreased 23% primarily due to the lower revenues in the U.S., product mix and the planned investments in the expansion of the Companys distribution channel and globalization of its research and development infrastructure. Mailstream Services EBIT increased 9% to $155 million. Within Mailstream Services: Management Services EBIT decreased 8% due to weakness in the Companys management services businesses outside the U.S., particularly in the U.K. and Germany. These decreases were partially offset by actions taken to reduce the fixed cost structure of its U.S. operations. Mail Services EBIT increased 22% as a result of operating leverage from an increase in mail volume and increased operating efficiency, partly offset by the integration costs associated with acquisitions in the U.S. and U.K. Marketing Services EBIT increased by 76% driven by higher volumes in the Companys mover source program and its phased exit from the motor vehicle registration services program. Revenue by source (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 % change Equipment sales $ 1,252 $ 1,336 (6 )% Supplies 392 393 0 % Software 424 346 23 % Rentals 728 739 (1 )% Financing 773 790 (2 )% Support services 769 761 1 % Business services 1,924 1,765 9 % Total revenue $ 6,262 $ 6,130 2 % Equipment sales revenue decreased 6% compared to the prior year. Lower sales of equipment in U.S. Mailing were primarily due to the postal rate case in 2007, which resulted in incremental sales of mailing equipment shape based upgrade kits during that period and pulled sales forward from 2008, weakening global economic conditions, and product shift toward smaller, fully featured postage machines. International sales revenue, excluding the positive impact from foreign currency of 2% and acquisitions of 2%, increased 2% principally due to a postal rate change in the first quarter of 2008 in France, combined with higher equipment placements throughout Europe. Foreign currency translation contributed an overall favorable impact of 1% to equipment sales revenue. Supplies revenue in 2008 was flat compared to the prior year. The decline of supplies revenue in the U.S was due to lower volumes, offset by an increase in supplies revenue in Europe as our customers continue to migrate to digital technology. Foreign currency translation contributed 1% to supplies revenue. 13 Software revenue increased by 23% from the prior year primarily driven by acquisitions which contributed 19% to revenue growth and strong international demand for our location intelligence and customer communication software solutions. Foreign currency translation had a negative impact of 2%. Rentals revenue decreased 1% compared to the prior year. Favorable foreign currency translation of 1% and higher demand in France were offset by lower revenue in the U.S., as our customers continue to downsize to smaller, fully featured machines. Financing revenue decreased 2% compared to the prior year. Lower equipment sales have resulted in a corresponding decline in the U.S. lease portfolio. Support services revenue increased 1% from the prior year primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of 1%. Renewals and pricing increases offset the impact of customers down sizing their equipment. Business services revenue increased 9% from the prior year, of which acquisitions contributed 7%. The additional growth was driven by higher revenues in Mail Services and Marketing Services, partly offset by lower transaction volumes in Management Services. Costs of revenue Percentage of Revenue (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2008 2007 Cost of equipment sales $ 663 $ 697 53.0 % 52.2 % Cost of supplies $ 104 $ 107 26.5 % 27.1 % Cost of software $ 101 $ 82 23.9 % 23.7 % Cost of rentals $ 154 $ 171 21.1 % 23.2 % Cost of support services $ 448 $ 433 58.3 % 56.9 % Cost of business services $ 1,508 $ 1,381 78.4 % 78.2 % Cost of equipment sales as a percentage of revenue increased to 53.0% in 2008 compared with 52.2% in the prior year, primarily due to the increase in mix of lower margin equipment sales outside the U.S. and the prior year sales of high margin upgrade kits. Cost of supplies as a percentage of revenue decreased to 26.5% in 2008 compared with 27.1% in the prior year. This variance is driven by a change in the mix of business. Cost of software as a percentage of revenue increased to 23.9% in 2008 compared with 23.7% in the prior year primarily due to a change in the mix of business. Cost of rentals as a percentage of revenue decreased to 21.1% in 2008 compared with 23.2% in the prior year primarily due to lower depreciation costs related to the transition of our product line. Cost of support services as a percentage of revenue increased to 58.3% in 2008 compared with 56.9% in the prior year. Improvements in our Production Mail segment due to the impact of our transition initiatives were more than offset by higher service costs in our U.S. and International Mailing businesses. Cost of business services as a percentage of revenue was 78.4% in 2008 compared with 78.2% in the prior year. For Mail Services, continued integration costs associated with the current year acquisitions of a multi site presort operation in the U.S. and U.K. were more than offset by the successful integration of other recently acquired sites and productivity improvements. Selling, general and administrative expenses Percentage of Revenue (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2008 2007 $ 1,948 $ 1,907 31.1 % 31.1 % Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, remained flat at 31.1%. The benefits gained from our transition initiatives were offset by lower revenue growth and a shift in the mix of our business as well as higher credit loss expenses in the U.S. Software, which is continuing to become a larger portion of our overall business, has a relatively higher selling, general and administrative expense ratio. 14 Research and development expenses (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 % change $ 206 $ 186 11 % Research and development expenses increased $20 million, or 11%, as we continue to invest in developing new technologies, enhancing our products, and expanding our offshore development capabilities. R&D expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased to 3.3% in 2008 from 3.0% in 2007. Net interest expense (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 % change $ 216 $ 242 (11 )% Net interest expense decreased $25 million or 11%, from prior year due to lower average interest rates during the year. Our variable and fixed rate debt mix, after adjusting for the effect of interest rate swaps, was 22% and 78%, respectively, at December 31, 2008. We do not allocate interest costs to our business segments. Income taxes / effective tax rate 2008 2007 34.3 % 42.4 % The effective tax rate declined 8.1% in 2008 primarily as a result of a $54 million tax charge in 2007 related principally to a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets and tax rate changes outside the U.S. Minority interest (preferred stock dividends of subsidiaries) (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 % change $ 21 $ 19 8 % Minority interest includes dividends paid to preferred stockholders in subsidiary companies. In August 2008, we redeemed 100% of the outstanding Cumulative Preferred Stock issued previously by a subsidiary company for $10 million. This redemption resulted in a net loss of $1.8 million accounting for the year over year increase. Discontinued operations (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 Revenue $ $ Pretax income $ $ Net income $ (28 ) $ 6 Total discontinued operations, net of tax $ (28 ) $ 6 Net loss in 2008 includes accruals of tax and interest on uncertain tax positions. 2007 includes a gain of $11.3 million from uncertain tax positions, net of an interest accrual for uncertain tax positions of $5.8 million. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion and details of discontinued operations. 15 Results of Operations 2007 Compared to 2006 Business segment revenue The following table shows revenue in 2007 and 2006 by business segment. Results have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Refer to Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on these changes.

Within Mailstream Solutions: U.S. Mailings revenue remained flat. Revenue benefited from growth in supplies, payment solutions, and the sale of equipment related to shape based rating. However, results were unfavorably impacted by lower equipment sales due to the wind down of meter migration and weak economic conditions. International Mailings revenue grew by 6%, including favorable foreign currency translation of 8%. The segments results were negatively impacted by lower sales and rentals in Europe as delays in postal liberalization across Europe affected customer purchases. Worldwide revenue for Production Mail grew by 5%, primarily driven by favorable foreign currency of 3% and acquisitions as higher equipment placements in the U.S. were offset by lower sales in Europe. Softwares revenue grew by 79% driven by continued strong worldwide demand for our software solutions, the acquisition of MapInfo, and favorable foreign currency translation of 4%. Mailstream Services revenue increased 11% to $1.7 billion. Within Mailstream Services: Management Services revenue increased by 6% due to the acquisition of Asterion SAS and favorable foreign currency translation of 2%. The segments revenue growth was negatively impacted by weakness in our legal solutions vertical as well as print contracts in 2006 that did not repeat in 2007. Mail Services revenue increased by 23% due to continued growth in presort and cross border mail services. Marketing Services revenue increased by 18% driven primarily by acquisitions. Revenue growth for this segment was negatively affected by lower revenue from our motor vehicle registration services program. Business segment earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) We use EBIT as a measure of our segment profitability. Refer to the reconciliation of segment amounts to income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 16 The following table shows EBIT in 2007 and 2006 by business segment.

Within Mailstream Solutions: U.S. Mailings EBIT grew 2% due to the increase in mix of higher margin revenue from payment solutions and supplies as well as our continued focus on controlling operating expenses. International Mailing EBIT decreased 10%. The segments profitability was adversely impacted by lower equipment sales and rentals in Europe, and incremental costs in 2007 related to back office operations, including the outsourcing of our European order and financial processing. Production Mail EBIT increased 9% driven primarily by revenue growth and net legal recoveries of approximately $4 million in Europe. Software EBIT increased 22%, driven by revenue growth partially offset by integration costs for the MapInfo acquisition. Mailstream Services EBIT increased 1% to $142 million. Within Mailstream Services: Management Services EBIT decreased 9% due to continued weakness in our legal solutions vertical. Mail Services EBIT grew by 53% driven by revenue growth, successful integration of acquired sites, and increased operating efficiencies.

Research and development expenses (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 % change $ 186 $ 165 12 % Research and development expenses increased 12% over the prior year, primarily due to the acquisition of MapInfo. Our investment in research and development reflects higher expenses for software development and our continued focus on developing new technologies and enhancing features for all of our different products. 18 Net interest expense (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 % change $ 242 $ 213 14 % Net interest expense increased 14% in 2007 due to higher average interest rates and higher average borrowings during the year. Also, in 2006 we had interest income on the cash balance that resulted from the Capital Services divestiture. Our variable and fixed rate debt mix, after adjusting for the effect of interest rate swaps, was 19% and 81%, respectively, at December 31, 2007. We do not allocate interest costs to our business segments. Income taxes / effective tax rate 2007 2006 42.4 % 36.6 % The effective tax rate for continuing operations for 2007 included $54 million of tax charges related principally to a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets and tax rate changes outside the U.S. The effective tax rate for 2006 included a $20 million charge related to the IRS settlement discussed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Minority interest (preferred stock dividends of subsidiaries) (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 % change $ 19 $ 14 39 % Minority interest includes dividends paid to preferred stockholders in subsidiary companies. Minority interest increased by $5 million compared with the prior year, primarily due to an increase in the average outstanding preferred shares and a higher weighted average dividend rate. Discontinued operations (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Revenue $ $ 81 Pretax income $ $ 29 Net income $ 6 $ 31 Gain on sale of Imagistics, net of $7 tax expense 11 FSC tax law change (16 ) Additional tax on IRS settlement (41 ) Loss on sale of Capital Services, net of $285 tax benefit (445 ) Total discontinued operations, net of tax $ 6 $ (460 ) Net income in 2007 includes a gain of $11.3 million from the conclusion of certain tax issues net of an interest accrual for uncertain tax positions of $5.8 million. In 2006, we completed the sale of our Capital Services external financing business and our Imagistics lease portfolio. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion and details of discontinued operations. Other (Income) Expense In 2007 and 2006, we recorded pre tax gains of approximately $3 million and $5 million, respectively, related to a revised liability estimate associated with the settlement of a previous lawsuit and net pre tax charges of approximately $3 million in 2007 and $2 million in 2006 for other legal matters. These amounts are included in other (income) expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 19 Restructuring Charges and Asset Impairments We recorded pre tax restructuring charges and asset impairments of $200.3 million and $264.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. These charges primarily relate to a program we announced in November 2007 to lower our cost structure, accelerate efforts to improve operational efficiencies, and transition our product line. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the asset impairment charges included in restructuring activities relate to older technology equipment of $28.5 million and other assets of $2.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the asset impairment charges included in restructuring activities related to the write off of inventory of $48.1 million, rental assets of $61.5 million, lease residual values of $46.1 million and other assets of $8.8 million. Additional asset impairments, unrelated to restructuring, were also recorded in 2008 and 2007. For 2008, these other impairment charges are related to intangible assets of $16.0 million principally due to a loss of a customer in our Marketing Services business and the ongoing shift in market conditions for the litigation support vertical in our Management Services business. For 2007, additional asset impairment charges included the write down of certain intangible assets for $8.5 million. Other exit costs of $35.3 million and $5.8 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, relate primarily to lease termination fees, facility closing costs, contract cancellation costs and outplacement costs. As of December 31, 2008, 1,926 terminations have occurred under the restructuring program and approximately 300 additional unfilled positions have been eliminated. The majority of the liability at December 31, 2008 is expected to be paid by the end of 2009 from cash generated from operations. The pre tax restructuring charges and asset impairments are composed of: (Dollars in millions) Balance at December 31, 2007 2008 Expense Cash payments Non cash Charges Balance at December 31, 2008 Severance and benefit costs $ 81 $ 118 $ (91 ) $ $ 108 Asset impairments 47 (47 ) Other exit costs 6 35 (8 ) 33 Total $ 87 $ 200 $ (99 ) $ (47 ) $ 141 (Dollars in millions) Balance at December 31, 2006 2007 Expense Cash payments Non cash Charges Balance at December 31, 2007 Severance and benefit costs $ $ 85 $ (4 ) $ $ 81 Asset impairments 173 (173 ) Other exit costs 6 6 Total $ $ 264 $ (4 ) $ (173 ) $ 87 In January 2003, we undertook restructuring initiatives related to realigned infrastructure requirements and reduced manufacturing needs for digital equipment. In connection with this plan, we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The program was completed during 2006 and, therefore, there were no additional restructuring charges related to this plan after December 31, 2006. We made restructuring payments of $3 million, $29 million and $51 million during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our accounting policy related to restructuring charges and asset impairments. Acquisitions On April 21, 2008, we acquired Zipsort, Inc. for $39 million in cash, net of cash acquired. Zipsort, Inc. acts as an intermediary between customers and the U.S. Postal Service.

MapInfo is a global company and a leading provider of location intelligence software and solutions. We assigned the goodwill to the Software segment. As part of the purchase accounting for MapInfo, we aligned MapInfos accounting policies for software revenue recognition with ours. Accordingly, certain software revenue that was previously recognized by MapInfo on a periodic basis has now been recognized over the life of the contract. We accounted for these acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and accordingly, the operating results of these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. Acquisitions made in 2008 did not materially impact our diluted earnings per share for the year. As a result of the purchase accounting alignment, the acquisition of MapInfo reduced our diluted earnings per share by 5 cents in 2007. During 2008 and 2007, we also completed several smaller acquisitions, the costs of which were $29.7 million and $86.6 million, respectively. These acquisitions did not have a material impact on our financial results. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that cash flow from operations, existing cash and liquid investments, as well as borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program, the existing credit facility and debt capital markets should be sufficient to finance our capital requirements and to cover our customer deposits. Our potential uses of cash include but are not limited to the following: growth and expansion opportunities; internal investments; customer financing; tax payments; interest and dividend payments; share repurchase program; pension and other benefit plan funding; and acquisitions. In light of recent market events, we have conducted an extensive review of our liquidity provisions. We have carefully monitored for material changes in the creditworthiness of those banks acting as derivative counterparties, depository banks or credit providers to us through credit ratings and the credit default swap market. We have determined that there has not been a material variation in the underlying sources of cash flows currently used to finance the operations of the company. To date, we have had consistent access to the commercial paper market. Cash Flow Summary The change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows: (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 Cash provided by operating activities $ 990 $ 1,060 Cash used in investing activities (234 ) (726 ) Cash used in financing activities (742 ) (204 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (15 ) 8 (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (1 ) $ 138 2008 Cash Flows Net cash provided by operations consisted primarily of net income adjusted for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The strong cash flow provided by operations for 2008 is primarily due to the timing of tax payments, which favorably contributed $122 million, and the receipt of $44 million related to the unwind of an interest rate swap, which is described in further detail in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Partially offsetting these positive impacts was a reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $77 million, primarily due to timing of these payments. Net cash used in investing activities consisted of capital expenditures of $237 million primarily for rental assets and acquisitions of $68 million partially offset by proceeds from short term and other investments of $36 million, and increased reserve account balances for customer deposits of $33 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $742 million and consisted primarily of stock repurchases of $333 million, dividends paid of $292 million, and a net payment of debt of $125 million, which was partly offset by proceeds of $20 million from the issuance of 21 common stock associated with employee stock plans. We also paid $12 million associated with the redemption of 100% of the outstanding Cumulative Preferred Stock issued previously by a subsidiary company. 2007 Cash Flows Net cash provided by operations consisted primarily of net income adjusted for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The strong cash flow provided by operations for 2007 is primarily driven by tax refunds and lower tax payments, lower investment in finance receivables, and increased management attention on working capital which resulted in lower accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable balances. Net cash used in investing activities consisted of acquisitions of $594 million and capital expenditures of $265 million partially offset by proceeds from the sale of a training facility for $30 million, proceeds from short term investments of $42 million, and increased reserve account balances for customer deposits of $63 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $204 million and consisted primarily of stock repurchases of $400 million and dividends paid of $289 million, primarily offset by a net borrowing of debt of $377 million and proceeds from stock issuance of $108 million. Capital Expenditures During 2008, capital expenditures included net additions of $122.0 million to property, plant and equipment and $115.3 million in net additions to rental equipment and related inventories compared with $142.1 million and $122.6 million, respectively, in 2007. The decrease in property, plant and equipment is due mostly to the continuing shift toward leased equipment in our Management Services segment. Financings and Capitalization We have a commercial paper program that is a significant source of liquidity for the Company. During 2008, we have continued to have consistent access to the commercial paper market. As of December 31, 2008, we had $610 million of outstanding commercial paper issuances. We also have a committed line of credit of $1.5 billion which supports commercial papers issuance and is provided by a syndicate of 14 banks until 2011. As of December 31, 2008, this line of credit had not been drawn down. In addition, we filed a Well known Seasoned Issuer registration statement with the SEC in June 2008 which permits the issuance of debt securities, preferred stock, preference stock, common stock, purchase contracts, depositary shares, warrants and units. On March 4, 2008, we issued $250 million of 10 year fixed rate notes with a coupon rate of 5.60%. The interest is paid semi annually beginning September 2008. The notes mature on March 15, 2018. We simultaneously entered into two interest rate swaps for a total notional amount of $250 million to convert the fixed rate debt to a floating rate obligation bearing interest at 6 month LIBOR plus 111.5 basis points. The proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper and repurchase of our stock. In December 2007, we entered into a $150 million syndicated bank transaction priced at 3 month LIBOR plus 35 basis points. The proceeds from this credit facility, due 2012, were used to pay off the $150 million variable rate debt that was due in 2010. In September 2007, we issued $500 million of unsecured fixed rate notes maturing in September 2017. These notes bear interest at an annual rate of 5.75% and pay interest semi annually beginning in March 2008. The proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper, the financing of acquisitions and repurchase of our stock. We believe our financing needs in the short and long term can be met from cash generated internally, borrowing capacity from existing credit agreements, available debt issuances under existing shelf registration statements and our existing commercial paper program. Information on debt maturities is presented in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 22 The following summarizes our known contractual obligations at December 31, 2008 and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods: Contractual Obligations Payments due by period (Dollars in millions) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Commercial paper borrowings $ 610 $ 610 $ $ $ Long term debt and current portion of long term debt 4,025 150 925 2,950 Non cancelable operating lease obligations 267 81 107 54 25 Capital lease obligations 19 6 10 2 1 Purchase obligations (1) 367 283 60 20 4 Other non current liabilities (2) 809 172 46 591 Total $ 6,097 $ 1,130 $ 349 $ 1,047 $ 3,571 (1) Purchase obligations include unrecorded agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding upon us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. (2) Other non current liabilities relate primarily to our postretirement benefits. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The amount and period of future payments related to our FIN 48 income tax uncertainties cannot be reliably estimated and, therefore, is not included in the above table. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. Critical Accounting Estimates We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations. We have discussed the impact and any associated risks on our results of operations related to these policies throughout the MD&A. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include, but are not limited to, customer cancellations, bad debts, inventory obsolescence, residual values of leased assets, useful lives of long lived assets and intangible assets, warranty obligations, restructuring, pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies and litigation, and allocation of purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired in business combinations. Our actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. We believe the assumptions and estimates used are reasonable and appropriate in accordance with GAAP. Revenue recognition Multiple element and internal financing arrangements We derive our revenue from multiple sources including sales, rentals, financing and services. Certain of our transactions are consummated at the same time and can therefore generate revenue from multiple sources. The most common form of these transactions involves a non cancelable equipment lease, a meter rental and an equipment maintenance agreement. As a result, we are required to determine whether the deliverables in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and if so, how the price should be allocated among the delivered elements and when to recognize revenue for each element. In multiple element arrangements, we recognize revenue for each of the elements based on their respective fair values in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. We recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known and uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved. Our allocation of the fair values to the various elements does not change the total revenue recognized from a transaction, but impacts the timing of revenue recognition. Revenue is allocated to the meter rental and equipment maintenance agreement elements first using their respective fair values, which are determined based on prices charged in standalone and renewal transactions. Revenue is then allocated to the equipment based on the present value of the remaining minimum lease payments. We then compare 23 the allocated equipment fair value to the range of cash selling prices in standalone transactions during the period to ensure the allocated equipment fair value approximates average cash selling prices. We provide lease financing for our products primarily through sales type leases. We classify our leases in accordance with SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases. The vast majority of our leases qualify as sales type leases using the present value of minimum lease payments classification criteria outlined in SFAS No. 13. We believe that our sales type lease portfolio contains only normal collection risk with no important uncertainties with respect to future costs. Accordingly, we record the fair value of equipment as sales revenue, the cost of equipment as cost of sales and the minimum lease payments plus the estimated residual value as gross finance receivables. The difference between the gross finance receivable and the equipment fair value is recorded as unearned income and is amortized as income over the lease term using the interest rate implicit in the lease. Equipment residual values are determined at inception of the lease using estimates of equipment fair value at the end of the lease term. Estimates of future equipment fair value are based primarily on our historical experience. We also consider forecasted supply and demand for our various products, product retirement and future product launch plans, end of lease customer behavior, regulatory changes, remanufacturing strategies, used equipment markets, if any, competition and technological changes. We evaluate residual values on an annual basis or as changes to the above considerations occur. In 2007, we recorded an impairment charge of $46 million related to the transition of our product line. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our accounting policies on revenue recognition. Allowances for doubtful accounts and credit losses Allowance for doubtful accounts We estimate our accounts receivable risks and provide allowances for doubtful accounts accordingly. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on a periodic basis. Our evaluation includes historical loss experience, length of time receivables are past due, adverse situations that may affect a customers ability to repay and prevailing economic conditions. We make adjustments to our allowance if our evaluation of allowance requirements differs from our actual aggregate reserve. This evaluation is inherently subjective because our estimates may be revised as more information becomes available. Based on historical experience, we have not had any material revisions to our recorded allowance for doubtful accounts. Allowance for credit losses We estimate our finance receivables risks and provide allowances for credit losses accordingly. We establish credit approval limits based on the credit quality of our customers and the type of equipment financed. We charge finance receivables to the allowance for credit losses after collection efforts are exhausted and we deem the account uncollectible. We base credit decisions primarily on a customers financial strength. We believe that our concentration of credit risk for finance receivables in our internal financing division is limited because of our large number of customers, small account balances and customer geographic and industry diversification. Our general policy for finance receivables contractually past due for over 120 days is to discontinue revenue recognition. We resume revenue recognition when payments reduce the account to 60 days or less past due. We evaluate the adequacy of allowance for credit losses on a periodic basis. Our evaluation includes historical loss experience, the nature and volume of our portfolios, adverse situations that may affect a customers ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. We make adjustments to our allowance for credit losses if the evaluation of reserve requirements differs from the actual aggregate reserve. This evaluation is inherently subjective because our estimates may be revised as more information becomes available. Accounting for income taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We record this amount as a provision for our taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), which supplements Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, by defining the confidence level that a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 requires a two step approach under which the tax effect of a position is recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained and the amount of the tax benefit recognized is equal to the largest tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement of the tax position. This is a different standard for recognition than the approach previously required. Both approaches require us to exercise considerable judgment and estimates are inherent in both processes. 24 We regularly assess the likelihood of tax adjustments in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and account for the related financial statement implications. We have established tax reserves which we believe to be appropriate given the possibility of tax adjustments. Determining the appropriate level of tax reserves requires us to exercise judgment regarding the uncertain application of tax law. We adjust the amount of reserves when information becomes available or when an event occurs indicating a change in the reserve is appropriate. Future changes in tax reserve requirements could have a material impact on our results of operations. Based on our 2008 income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest, a 1% change in our effective tax rate would impact income from continuing operations by approximately $7 million. Long lived assets Useful lives of long lived assets We depreciate property, plant and equipment and rental property and equipment principally using the straight line method over estimated useful lives: machinery and equipment principally 3 to 15 years and buildings up to 50 years. We depreciate other depreciable assets using either the straight line method or accelerated methods. We amortize properties leased under capital leases on a straight line basis over the primary lease terms. We amortize capitalized costs related to internally developed software using the straight line method over the estimated useful life, which is principally 3 to 10 years. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which are principally 4 to 15 years. Our estimates of useful lives could be affected by changes in regulatory provisions, technology or business plans. Impairment review We evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets, including goodwill and intangible assets, on an annual basis or as circumstances warrant. Our goodwill impairment review requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. Significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. We use internal discounted cash flow estimates, quoted market prices when available and appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value. We derive the cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our future long term business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate. When available and as appropriate, we use comparative market multiples to corroborate discounted cash flow results. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on our transition initiatives and asset impairments recorded in 2008. We believe that we have no unrecorded asset impairments at December 31, 2008. However, future events and circumstances, some of which are described below, may result in an impairment charge: Changes in postal regulations governing the types of meters allowable for use. New technological developments that provide significantly enhanced benefits over current technology. Significant ongoing negative economic or industry trends. Changes in our business strategy that alters the expected usage of the related assets. Future economic results that are below our expectations used in the current assessments. Pension benefits Assumptions and estimates The valuation and calculation of our net pension expense, assets and obligations are dependent on various assumptions and estimates. We make assumptions relating to discount rate, rate of compensation increase, expected return on plan assets and other factors. These assumptions are evaluated and updated annually and are described in further detail in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following assumptions relate to our U.S. qualified pension plan, which is our largest plan. We determine our discount rate for the U.S. retirement benefit plan by using a model that discounts each years estimated benefit payments by an applicable spot rate. These spot rates are derived from a yield curve created from a large number of high quality corporate bonds. Accordingly, our discount rate assumption was 6.05% at December 31, 2008 and 6.15% at December 31, 2007. The rate of compensation increase assumption reflects our actual experience and best estimate of future increases. Our estimate of the rate of compensation increase was 4.25% at December 31, 2008 and 4.5% at December 31, 2007. Our expected return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results, the plans asset mix and future expectations of market rates of return on the types of assets in the plan. Our expected return on plan assets assumption was 8.0% in 2008 and 8.5% at December 31, 2007. 25 Sensitivity to changes in assumptions: U.S. Pension Plan Discount rate a 0.25% increase in the discount rate would decrease annual pension expense by approximately $2.8 million and would lower the projected benefit obligation by $39.8 million. Rate of compensation increase a 0.25% increase in the rate of compensation increase would increase annual pension expense by approximately $2.5 million. Expected return on plan assets a 0.25% increase in the expected return on assets of our principal plans would decrease annual pension expense by approximately $3.8 million. The following assumptions relate to our U.K. qualified pension plan, which is our largest foreign plan. We determine our discount rate for the U.K. retirement benefit plan by using a model that discounts each years estimated benefit payments by an applicable spot rate. These spot rates are derived from a yield curve created from a large number of high quality corporate bonds. Accordingly, our discount rate assumption was 6.3% at December 31, 2008 and 5.8% at December 31, 2007. The rate of compensation increase assumption reflects our actual experience and best estimate of future increases. Our estimate of the rate of compensation increase was 4.3% at December 31, 2008 and 4.7% at December 31, 2007. Our expected return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results, the plans asset mix and future expectations of market rates of return on the types of assets in the plan. Our expected return on plan assets assumption was 7.25% in 2008 and 7.75% at December 31, 2007. U.K. Pension Plan Discount rate a 0.25% increase in the discount rate would decrease annual pension expense by approximately $2.0 million and would lower the projected benefit obligation by $12.3 million. Rate of compensation increase a 0.25% increase in the rate of compensation increase would increase annual pension expense by approximately $0.7 million. Expected return on plan assets a 0.25% increase in the expected return on assets of our principal plans would decrease annual pension expense by approximately $0.9 million. Delayed recognition principles In accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, actual pension plan results that differ from our assumptions and estimates are accumulated and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants and will therefore affect pension expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods. We also base our net pension expense primarily on a market related valuation of plan assets. In accordance with this approach, we recognize differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets primarily over a five year period and as a result future pension expense will be impacted when these previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. See the new accounting pronouncements below for the effect of SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Pension and Other Post Retirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). Investment related risks and uncertainties We invest our pension plan assets in a variety of investment securities in accordance with our strategic asset allocation policy. The composition of our U.S. pension plan assets at December 31, 2008 was approximately 50% equity securities, 39% fixed income securities, 7% real estate investments and 4% private equity investments. The composition of our U.K. pension plan assets at December 31, 2008 was approximately 63% equity securities, 33% fixed income securities and 4% cash. Investment securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate, market and credit risks. In particular, due to the level of risk associated with equity securities, it is reasonably possible that changes in the values of such investment securities will occur and that such changes could materially affect our future results. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), which supplements Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, by defining the confidence level that a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 requires the tax effect of a position to be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date. If a tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits, no benefits of the position are recognized. This is a different standard for recognition than was previously required. The more likely than not threshold must continue to be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of a benefit. At adoption, companies adjusted their financial statements to reflect only those tax positions that were more likely than not to be sustained as of the adoption date. Any necessary adjustment was recorded directly to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption and reported as a change in accounting principle. We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007 which resulted in a decrease to opening retained earnings of $84.4 million, with a corresponding increase in our tax liabilities. 26 In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), to define how the fair value of assets and liabilities should be measured in accounting standards where it is allowed or required. In addition to defining fair value, the Statement established a framework within GAAP for measuring fair value and expanded required disclosures surrounding fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP). FAS 157 2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, which delayed the effective date by one year for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 157 3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active. This FSP is effective immediately and includes those periods for which financial statements have not been issued. We adopted this Statement for financial assets and financial liabilities on January 1, 2008, and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We do not expect the adoption of this Statement for nonfinancial items effective January 1, 2009 to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We currently do not have any financial assets that are valued using inactive markets, and as such are not impacted by the issuance of FSP 157 3. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on fair value measurements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS 158), which required recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans on the balance sheet. Under SFAS 158, gains and losses, prior service costs and credits, and any remaining transition amounts under SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106 that have not yet been recognized through net periodic benefit cost were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax effects, until they are amortized as a component of net periodic cost. Our adoption of the provisions of SFAS 158 reduced stockholders equity by $297 million at December 31, 2006. SFAS 158 did not affect our results of operations or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations (SFAS 141(R)). SFAS 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how a company (a) recognizes and measures in their financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest (previously referred to as minority interest); (b) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and (c) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of a business combination. SFAS 141(R) requires fair value measurements at the date of acquisition, with limited exceptions specified in the Statement. Some of the major impacts of this new standard include expense recognition for transaction costs and restructuring costs. SFAS 141(R) is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and will be applied prospectively. We do not expect the adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 addresses the accounting and reporting for the outstanding noncontrolling interest (previously referred to as minority interest) in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It also establishes additional disclosures in the consolidated financial statements that identify and distinguish between the interests of the parents owners and of the noncontrolling owners of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 requires changes in ownership interest that do not result in deconsolidation to be accounted for as equity transactions. This Statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. This gain or loss is measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment. This Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. SFAS 160 requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests. All other requirements of SFAS 160 are applied prospectively. We do not expect the adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 requires enhanced disclosures about (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and its related interpretations, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. This Statement encourages, but does not require, comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption. The adoption of this Statement will require us to present currently disclosed information in a tabular format and will also expand our disclosures concerning where derivatives are reported on the balance sheet and where gains/losses are recognized in the results of operations. The Company will comply with the disclosure requirements of this Statement beginning in the first quarter of 2009. In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 142 3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP FAS 142 3). FSP FAS 142 3 removed the requirement of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), for an entity to consider, when determining the useful life of an acquired intangible asset, whether the intangible asset can be renewed without substantial cost or material modification to the existing terms and conditions associated with the intangible asset. FSP FAS 142 3 replaces the previous useful life assessment criteria with a requirement that an entity considers its own experience in renewing similar 27 arrangements. If the entity has no relevant experience, it would consider market participant assumptions regarding renewal. This should lead to greater consistency between the useful life of recognized intangibles under SFAS 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure fair value of such assets under SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations. FSP FAS 142 3 will be applied prospectively beginning January 1, 2009. We do not expect the adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (SFAS 162). SFAS 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP. SFAS 162 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The adoption of this Statement did not result in a change in current practice. In September 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 133 1 and FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 45 4, Disclosures about Credit Derivatives and Certain Guarantees: An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 and FASB Interpretation No. 45; and Clarification of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 161. The FSP amends SFAS No. 133 to require a seller of credit derivatives, including credit derivatives embedded in a hybrid instrument, to provide certain disclosures for each statement of financial position presented. These disclosures are required even if the likelihood of having to make payments is remote. To make the disclosures consistent with the disclosures that will now be required for credit derivatives, FIN No. 45 4 was issued to require guarantors to disclose the current status of the payment/performance risk of the guarantee. This FSP also clarifies that SFAS 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. The FSP is effective for reporting periods ending after November 15, 2008. The Company does not sell credit derivatives. The Company has complied with the additional disclosure requirement for guarantees in the fourth quarter of 2008. In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 132(R) 1, Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets, which amends Statement No. 132(R) to require more detailed disclosures about employers plan assets, including investment strategies, major categories of assets, concentrations of risk within plan assets and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of assets. The FSP is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009. The Company will comply with the additional disclosure requirements. Legal and Regulatory Matters Legal See Legal Proceedings in Item 3 of this Form 10 K for information regarding our legal proceedings. Income taxes We regularly assess the likelihood of tax adjustments in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we have operations and account for the related financial statement implications. Tax reserves have been established which we believe to be appropriate given the possibility of tax adjustments. Determining the appropriate level of tax reserves requires us to exercise judgment regarding the uncertain application of tax law. The amount of reserves is adjusted when information becomes available or when an event occurs indicating a change in the reserves is appropriate. Future changes in tax reserve requirements could have a material impact on our results of operations. We are continually under examination by tax authorities in the United States, other countries and local jurisdictions in which we have operations. The years under examination vary by jurisdiction. The current IRS exam of tax years 2001 2004 is estimated to be completed within the next two years. In connection with this exam, we have recently received notices of proposed adjustments to our filed returns. We have accrued our best estimate of the tax, interest and penalties that may result from these proposed adjustments in accordance with FIN 48. We are disputing a formal request from the IRS in the form of a civil summons to provide certain company workpapers. We believe that certain documents being sought should not be produced because they are privileged. In a similar case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit ruled that certain company workpapers were privileged, however, the case was remanded to the lower court to consider other related issues. Also in connection with the 2001 2004 audits, we have entered into a settlement with the IRS regarding the tax treatment of certain lease transactions related to the Capital Services business that we sold in 2006. Prior to 2007, we accrued and paid the IRS the additional tax and interest associated with this settlement. A variety of post 1999 tax years remain subject to examination by other tax authorities, including the U.K., Canada, France, Germany and various U.S. states. We have accrued our best estimate of the tax, interest and penalties that may result from these tax uncertainties in these and other jurisdictions in accordance with FIN 48. However, the resolution of such matters could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In August 2006, we reached a settlement with the IRS governing all outstanding tax audit issues in dispute for the tax years through 2000. Accordingly, in 2006 we recorded $61 million of additional tax expense. Of the $61 million, $41 million related to the Capital 28 Services business and was included in discontinued operations and $20 million was included in continuing operations. The federal statute of limitations for these years has now expired. In 2006, we accrued in discontinued operations an additional tax expense of $16.2 million to record the impact of the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act (TIPRA). The TIPRA legislation repealed the exclusion from federal income taxation of a portion of the income generated from certain leveraged leases of aircraft by foreign sales corporations. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the discontinued operations. During 2009, we expect to reverse tax benefits of approximately $11 to $13 million associated with the expiration of vested stock options and the vesting of restricted stock units previously granted to our employees. This write off of deferred tax assets will not increase the amount of tax to be paid. Effects of Inflation and Foreign Exchange Inflation, although moderate in recent years, continues to affect worldwide economies and the way companies operate. It increases labor costs and operating expenses, and raises costs associated with replacement of fixed assets such as rental equipment. Despite these growing costs and the USPS meter migration initiatives, we have generally been able to maintain profit margins through productivity and efficiency improvements, continual review of both manufacturing capacity and operating expense levels, and, where applicable, price increases. Currency translation increased our 2008 revenue by approximately 0.5%. Also, currency translation gains increased our income before taxes by $2 million. Based on the current contribution from our international operations, a 1% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar would result in a decline in revenue of approximately $19 million and a decline in income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest of approximately $2 million. Although not affecting income, balance sheet related deferred translation losses of $305 million were recorded in 2008 resulting primarily from the strengthening U.S. dollar as compared to the British pound, Euro and Canadian dollar. During 2007, we recorded deferred translation gains of $165 million resulting primarily from the stronger British pound, Euro and Canadian dollar, as compared to the U.S. dollar. During 2006, we recorded deferred translation gains of $83 million resulting primarily from the stronger British pound, Euro and Canadian dollar, as compared to the U.S. dollar. The results of our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations. We enter into foreign exchange contracts primarily to reduce our risk of loss from such fluctuations. Exchange rates can also impact settlement of our intercompany receivables and payables that result from transfers of finished goods inventories between our affiliates in different countries, and intercompany loans. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. At December 31, 2008, we had $250 million of foreign exchange contracts outstanding, all maturing in 2009, to buy or sell various currencies. As a result of the use of derivative instruments, we are exposed to counterparty risk. To mitigate such risks, we enter into contracts with only those financial institutions that meet stringent credit requirements as set forth in our derivative policy. We regularly review our credit exposure balances as well as the creditworthiness of our counterparties. Maximum risk of loss on these contracts is limited to the amount of the difference between the spot rate at the date of the contract delivery and the contracted rate. Dividends It is a general practice of our Board of Directors to pay a cash dividend on common stock each quarter. In setting dividend payments, our board considers the dividend rate in relation to our recent and projected earnings and our capital investment opportunities and requirements. We have paid a dividend each year since 1934. 29 Forward Looking Statements We want to caution readers that any forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in this Form 10 K, other reports or press releases or made by our management involve risks and uncertainties which may change based on various important factors. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. These forward looking statements are those which talk about our current expectations as to the future and include, but are not limited to, statements about the amounts, timing and results of possible restructuring charges and future earnings. Words such as estimate, project, plan, believe, expect, anticipate, intend, and similar expressions may identify such forward looking statements. Some of the factors which could cause future financial performance to differ materially from the expectations as expressed in any forward looking statement made by or on our behalf include: changes in international or national political conditions, including any terrorist attacks negative developments in economic conditions, including adverse impacts on customer demand changes in postal regulations timely development and acceptance of new products success in gaining product approval in new markets where regulatory approval is required successful entry into new markets mailers utilization of alternative means of communication or competitors products our success at managing customer credit risk our success at managing costs associated with our strategy of outsourcing functions and operations not central to our business changes in interest rates foreign currency fluctuations cost, timing and execution of our transition plans including any potential asset impairments regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other conditions to consummation of any acquisitions and integration of recent acquisitions interrupted use of key information systems changes in privacy laws intellectual property infringement claims impact on mail volume resulting from current concerns over the use of the mail for transmitting harmful biological agents third party suppliers ability to provide product components, assemblies or inventories negative income tax adjustments for prior audit years and changes in tax laws or regulations changes in pension and retiree medical costs acts of nature ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations due to our investing and funding activities and our operations denominated in different foreign currencies. We manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by limiting its impact on earnings and cash flows and lowering our overall borrowing costs. We use a balanced mix of debt maturities and variable and fixed rate debt together with interest rate swaps to execute our strategy. Our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility in earnings and cash flows associated with the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, we enter into various contracts, which change in value as foreign exchange rates change, to protect the value of external and intercompany transactions. The principal currencies actively hedged are the British pound, Canadian dollar and Euro. We employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks. We do not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures. We utilize a Value at Risk (VaR) model to determine the maximum potential loss in fair value from changes in market conditions. The VaR model utilizes a variance/co variance approach and assumes normal market conditions, a 95% confidence level and a one day holding period. The model includes all of our debt and all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts. The model 30 excludes anticipated transactions, firm commitments, and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by us, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. During 2008 and 2007, our maximum potential one day loss in fair value of our exposure to foreign exchange rates and interest rates, using the variance/co variance technique described above, was not material.
