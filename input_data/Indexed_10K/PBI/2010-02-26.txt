ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) contains statements that are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of some of the factors discussed below and elsewhere in this report. Forward Looking Statements We want to caution readers that any forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in this Form 10 K may change based on various factors. The future is difficult to predict. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. These forward looking statements are those which talk about our current expectations as to the future and include, but are not limited to, statements about the transformation initiatives, and amounts, timing and results of possible restructuring charges and future earnings or risks. Words such as estimate, target, project, plan, believe, expect, anticipate, intend, and similar expressions may identify such forward looking statements. Some of the factors which could cause future financial performance to differ materially from the expectations as expressed in any forward looking statement made by or on our behalf include: negative developments in economic conditions, including adverse impacts on customer demand changes in postal or banking regulations timely development and acceptance of new products success in gaining product approval in new markets where regulatory approval is required successful entry into new markets mailers utilization of alternative means of communication or competitors products our success at managing customer credit risk our success at managing costs associated with our strategy of outsourcing functions and operations not central to our business changes in interest rates foreign currency fluctuations cost, timing and execution of our transformation plans including any potential asset impairments regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other conditions to consummation of any acquisitions and integration of recent acquisitions interrupted use of key information systems changes in privacy laws changes in international or national political conditions, including any terrorist attacks intellectual property infringement claims impact on mail volume resulting from current concerns over the use of the mail for transmitting harmful biological agents third party suppliers ability to provide product components, assemblies or inventories negative income tax adjustments for prior audit years and changes in tax laws or regulations changes in pension and retiree medical costs acts of nature 11 Overview In 2009, revenue decreased 11% to $5.6 billion due largely to continuing challenging global economic conditions and the negative impact of foreign currency translation which adversely impacted revenue by 2%. Pitney Bowes Inc. net income was $423 million in 2009 compared with $420 million in 2008 and diluted earnings per share of common stock attributable to Pitney Bowes Inc. common stockholders was $2.04 compared with $2.00 in 2008. Diluted earnings per share was reduced by restructuring charges of 15 cents and 69 cents in 2009 and 2008, respectively. In 2009, diluted earnings per share also included a loss of 6 cents for tax adjustments related to a non cash charge associated with out of the money stock options that expired during the year, a net loss of 4 cents comprised primarily of accruals for interest and taxes associated with discontinued operations partly offset by the positive impacts of a bankruptcy settlement and expiration of an indemnity agreement, and a 1 cent positive tax adjustment associated with the repricing of leveraged lease transactions. In 2008, diluted earnings per share also included positive tax adjustments of 4 cents related primarily to deferred tax assets associated with certain U.S. leasing transactions and a loss of 13 cents for the accrual of interest and taxes associated with discontinued operations. A continued global economic downturn resulted in a decline in revenue for the year in six of our seven business segments. Historically, mail volumes have tracked economic conditions and the unprecedented volume decreases in 2009 were indicative of the extent of the economic slowdown. Although there is not a direct correlation between mail volumes and a majority of our revenues, the decline in mail volumes was one of a number of factors that affected our 2009 revenues. EBIT margins, however, were up in four of our segments from 2008 reflecting our continued cost management actions. We reduced our selling, general and administrative expense by over $170 million during 2009, despite increased pension costs of $14 million when compared to the prior year. In addition, we generated $824 million in cash from operations during 2009. We also reduced our debt by $242 million during 2009. See Results of Operations for 2009, 2008 and 2007 for a more detailed discussion of our results of operations. Outlook Economic and business conditions in mail intensive industries have been weak during the entire year. Sales cycles for most capital purchase decisions by customers remain long. These factors have impacted our financial results, as the sustained economic downturn has had a negative effect on equipment sales and the related high margin financing, rental, and supplies revenue streams. While the company has been successful in reducing its cost structure across its entire business and is shifting to a more variable cost structure, these actions have not been enough to offset the impact of lower revenue. We continue to expect our mix of revenue to change, with a greater percentage of revenue coming from diversified revenue streams associated with fully featured smaller systems and a smaller percentage from larger system sales. We expect that our future results will continue to be impacted by changes in global economic conditions and their impact on mail intensive industries. It is not expected that total mail volumes will rebound to prior peak levels in an economic recovery, and future volume trends will continue to be a factor for our businesses. We are undertaking a series of initiatives that are designed to transform and enhance the way we operate as a global company. In order to enhance our responsiveness to changing market conditions, we are executing a strategic transformation program designed to create improved processes and systems to further enable us to invest in future growth in areas such as our global customer interactions and product development processes. This program is expected to continue into 2012 and will result in the reduction of up to 10 percent of the positions in the company. We expect the total pre tax cost of this program will be in the range of $250 million to $350 million primarily related to severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with such workforce reductions. Most of the total pre tax costs will be cash related charges. Currently, we are targeting annualized benefits, net of system and related investments, in the range of at least $150 million to $200 million on a pre tax basis. These costs and the related benefits will be recognized as different actions are approved and implemented, with the goal of reaching the full benefit run rate in 2012. 12 Results of Operations 2009 Compared to 2008 Business segment results The following table shows revenue and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in 2009 and 2008 by business segment. We use EBIT, a non GAAP measure, to determine our segment profitability. Refer to the reconciliation of segment amounts to income from continuing operations before income taxes in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior year results have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Refer to Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on these changes. Revenue EBIT (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 % change 2009 2008 % change U.S. Mailing $ 2,016 $ 2,250 (10 )% $ 743 $ 890 (17 )% International Mailing 920 1,134 (19 )% 128 185 (31 )% Production Mail 526 616 (15 )% 51 82 (37 )% Software 346 400 (14 )% 38 28 32 % Mailstream Solutions 3,808 4,400 (13 )% 960 1,185 (19 )% Management Services 1,061 1,172 (9 )% 72 70 3 % Mail Services 559 542 3 % 83 69 20 % Marketing Services 141 148 (5 )% 23 21 8 % Mailstream Services 1,761 1,862 (5 )% 178 160 11 % Total $ 5,569 $ 6,262 (11 )% $ 1,138 $ 1,345 (15 )% Mailstream Solutions revenue decreased 13% to $3.8 billion and EBIT decreased 19% to $960 million, compared to the prior year. Within Mailstream Solutions: U.S. Mailings revenue decreased 10% primarily due to fewer placements of mailing equipment and related financing and rental revenues as customers continued to delay purchases of new equipment and extend leases on existing equipment due to the economic conditions. Revenue was adversely affected by lower business activity levels and the ongoing changing mix to more fully featured smaller systems. Lease extensions have a positive impact on profit margins longer term but negatively impact revenue in the current year. As a result of lower business activity levels over the prior year, U.S. Mailings EBIT decreased 17% principally due to lower equipment sales, financing revenue, meter rentals, and supplies sales. International Mailing revenue decreased 19%, with 8% of this decline driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. The international economic environment continued to create weaker demand for our products and services. As a result, many customers delayed making purchase decisions for new mailing systems and lower mail volume reduced supplies revenue. International Mailings EBIT declined 31%, primarily driven by lower levels of equipment and supplies sales, and lower financing revenues. Revenue for Production Mail decreased 15% primarily as a result of lower equipment sales in the U.S., France, and Asia Pacific as economic uncertainty continues to delay large ticket capital expenditures for many large enterprises worldwide. Foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact of 2%. Production Mails EBIT decreased 37% driven by lower revenues and a shift in product mix to lower margin products. Softwares revenue decreased 14%, with 4% of this decline driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Worldwide consolidation in the financial services industry and slowness in the retail sector continued to adversely impact the sales and renewal of software licenses. Uncertainty surrounding the economy has resulted in many large multi national organizations changing their approval policies for capital expenditures, which has lengthened the sales cycle. Softwares EBIT increased to $38 million compared to $28 million in the prior year due to business integration and productivity initiatives which resulted in substantial EBIT margin improvements. This helped offset the pressure on margin due to lower revenue and a higher mix of some lower margin software sales. 13 Mailstream Services revenue decreased 5% to $1.8 billion. However, EBIT increased 11% to $178 million, compared to the prior year. Within Mailstream Services: Management Services revenue decreased 9%, of which 2% was driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. The segments revenue was adversely affected by lower business activity and decreased print and transaction volumes throughout the U.S. and Europe. Management Services EBIT, however, increased by 3% primarily due to productivity enhancements that have improved the profitability of the operations globally. Mail Services revenue increased 3% mostly due to the impact of 2008 acquisitions which contributed 4% but was partly offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of 1%. Expansion of the customer base and continued growth in mail processed drove a slight increase in revenue for the year. Mail Services EBIT increased by 20% driven by the integration of Mail Services sites acquired last year and ongoing automation and productivity initiatives implemented by the business. Marketing Services revenue decreased 5%, mostly due to the impact of fewer household moves during the year and the resulting decline in the volume of change of address kits mailed. Marketing Services EBIT increased 8% due to an improving cost structure and the exit from the motor vehicle registration services program. Revenue by source (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 % change Equipment sales $ 1,007 $ 1,252 (20 )% Supplies 336 392 (14 )% Software 365 424 (14 )% Rentals 647 728 (11 )% Financing 695 773 (10 )% Support services 714 769 (7 )% Business services 1,805 1,924 (6 )% Total revenue $ 5,569 $ 6,262 (11 )% Equipment sales revenue decreased 20% compared to the prior year due to lower placements of mailing equipment as more customers have delayed purchases of new equipment and extended their leases on existing equipment due to the global economic conditions. Revenue also continues to be adversely affected by the ongoing changing mix in equipment placements to smaller, fully featured systems. Foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact of 3%. Supplies revenue decreased 14% compared to the prior year due to lower supplies usage resulting from lower mail volumes and fewer installed meters due to customer consolidations in the U.S. and internationally. Foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact of 3%. Software revenue decreased 14% compared to the prior year primarily due to the impact of the global economic slowdown which has caused many businesses to delay their capital spending worldwide. Worldwide consolidation in the financial services industry and slowness in the retail sector have also adversely impacted sales and renewals of software licenses. Foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact of 4%. Rentals revenue decreased 11% compared to the prior year as customers in the U.S. continue to downsize to smaller, fully featured machines. The weak economic conditions have also impacted our international rental markets, specifically in Canada and France. Foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact of 1%. Financing revenue decreased 10% compared to the prior year. Lower equipment sales over prior periods have resulted in a decline in both our U.S. and international lease portfolios. Foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact of 2%. Support services revenue decreased 7% compared to the prior year, principally due to lower revenues in Canada, the U.S. and the U.K. due to lower new equipment placements and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of 3%. Business services revenue decreased 6% compared to the prior year. Lower volumes at Management Services and Marketing Services offset the impact of an increase in mail processed at Mail Services. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of 2% was partly offset by the positive impact of acquisitions which contributed 1%. 14 Costs and expenses Percentage of Revenue (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2009 2008 Cost of equipment sales $ 530 $ 663 52.7 % 53.0 % Cost of supplies $ 94 $ 104 27.9 % 26.5 % Cost of software $ 82 $ 101 22.5 % 23.9 % Cost of rentals $ 159 $ 154 24.5 % 21.1 % Financing interest expense $ 98 $ 110 14.1 % 14.3 % Cost of support services $ 393 $ 448 55.0 % 58.3 % Cost of business services $ 1,382 $ 1,486 76.6 % 77.2 % Selling, general and administrative $ 1,801 $ 1,971 32.3 % 31.5 % Research and development $ 182 $ 206 3.3 % 3.3 % Cost of equipment sales as a percentage of revenue was 52.7% in 2009 compared with 53.0% in the prior year, primarily due to the positive impacts of ongoing productivity improvements, partly offset by a higher mix of lower margin sales. Cost of supplies as a percentage of revenue was 27.9% in 2009 compared with 26.5% in the prior year due to a greater mix of non ink supplies in U.S Mailing. Cost of software as a percentage of revenue was 22.5% in 2009 compared with 23.9% in the prior year due to business integration initiatives and productivity investments, which more than offset the impact of lower revenue levels. Cost of rentals as a percentage of revenue was 24.5% in 2009 compared with 21.1% in the prior year primarily due to the fixed costs of meter depreciation on lower revenues. Financing interest expense as a percentage of revenue was 14.1% in 2009 compared with 14.3% in the prior year due to lower interest rates and lower average borrowings. In computing our financing interest expense, which represents our cost of borrowing associated with the generation of financing revenues, we assumed a 10:1 leveraging ratio of debt to equity and applied our overall effective interest rate to the average outstanding finance receivables. Cost of support services as a percentage of revenue was 55.0% in 2009 compared with 58.3% in the prior year. Margin improvements in our International Mailing, U.S. Mailing and Production Mail segments were driven by the positive impacts of ongoing productivity investments and price increases on service contracts in Production Mail. Cost of business services as a percentage of revenue was 76.6% in 2009 compared with 77.2% in the prior year. This improvement is due to the positive impacts of cost reduction programs at our Management Services and Mail Services businesses, partly offset by lower transaction volumes in our Management Services business. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of revenue was 32.3% in 2009 compared with 31.5% in the prior year. SG&A expense declined $170 million or 9%, primarily as a result of our cost reduction initiatives and the positive impact of foreign currency translation of 3%. However, the impact of lower revenue, increased pension costs of $14 million and higher credit loss expenses of $9 million more than offset these benefits on a percentage of revenue basis. Research and development expenses decreased $23 million or 11%, in 2009 from the prior year due to the transition and related benefits from our move to offshore development activities. Foreign currency translation also had a positive impact of 3%. As a percentage of revenue, research and development expenses were 3.3% for 2009 and 2008 as we continue to invest in developing new technologies and enhancing our products. Other interest expense (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 % change $ 111 $ 119 (7 )% Other interest expense decreased $8 million or 7% in 2009 compared to the prior year due to lower interest rates and lower average borrowings. 15 We do not allocate other interest expense to our business segments. Income taxes / effective tax rate 2009 2008 34.6 % 34.3 % The effective tax rate for 2009 included $13 million of tax charges related to the write off of deferred tax assets associated with the expiration of out of the money vested stock options and the vesting of restricted stock, offset by $13 million of tax benefits from retirement of inter company obligations and the repricing of leveraged lease transactions. The write off of deferred tax assets will not require the payment of any taxes. The effective tax rate for 2008 included $12 million of tax increases related to the low tax benefit associated with restructuring expenses recorded during 2008, offset by adjustments of $10 million related to deferred tax assets associated with certain U.S. leasing transactions. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Discontinued operations (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Pre tax income $ 21 $ Tax provision (29 ) (28 ) Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax $ (8 ) $ (28 ) The 2009 net loss includes $10 million of pre tax income ($6 million net of tax) for a bankruptcy settlement received during 2009 and $11 million of pre tax income ($7 million net of tax) related to the expiration of an indemnity agreement associated with the sale of a former subsidiary. This income was more than offset by the accrual of interest on uncertain tax positions. The 2008 net loss of $28 million includes an accrual of tax and interest on uncertain tax positions. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Noncontrolling interests (Preferred stock dividends of subsidiaries) (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 % change $ 21 $ 21 3 % Noncontrolling interests includes dividends paid to preferred stockholders in subsidiary companies. 2009 included an expense of $3 million associated with the redemption of $375 million of variable term voting preferred stock during the year. 2008 included a net expense of $2 million associated with the redemption of $10 million of 9.11% Cumulative Preferred Stock. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Results of Operations 2008 Compared to 2007 Business segment results The following table shows revenue and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in 2008 and 2007 by business segment. We use EBIT, a non GAAP measure, to determine our segment profitability. Refer to the reconciliation of segment amounts to income from continuing operations before income taxes in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Results have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Refer to Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on these changes. 16 Revenue EBIT (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 % change 2008 2007 % change U.S. Mailing $ 2,250 $ 2,409 (7 )% $ 890 $ 967 (8 )% International Mailing 1,134 1,070 6 % 185 162 14 % Production Mail 616 623 (1 )% 82 74 10 % Software 400 326 23 % 28 37 (23 )% Mailstream Solutions 4,400 4,428 (1 )% 1,185 1,240 (4 )% Management Services 1,172 1,135 3 % 70 76 (8 )% Mail Services 542 441 23 % 69 57 22 % Marketing Services 148 126 18 % 21 7 205 % Mailstream Services 1,862 1,702 9 % 160 140 15 % Total $ 6,262 $ 6,130 2 % $ 1,345 $ 1,380 (3 )% Mailstream Solutions revenue decreased 1% to $4.4 billion and EBIT decreased 4% to $1.2 billion, compared to the prior year. Within Mailstream Solutions: U.S. Mailings revenue decreased 7% due to lower equipment placements, rental revenue, and lower financing revenue. The lower equipment revenues were driven in part by the prior year benefits from the sale of mailing equipment shape based upgrade kits and by customer buying decisions influenced by uncertainty created by weak economic conditions. U.S. Mailings EBIT decreased 8% principally due to the lower revenue growth, but was partly offset by positive impacts of our ongoing actions to reduce costs and streamline operations. International Mailings revenue grew by 6% and benefited 2% from favorable foreign currency translation and 1% from acquisitions. Revenue growth benefited from strong growth in France, Germany, Norway and other parts of Europe as well as in Latin America; and continued growth in supplies. International Mailings EBIT grew 14% as improved EBIT margins resulted from the Companys actions over the last two years to reduce costs through the outsourcing of manufacturing and the consolidation of back office operations. Worldwide revenue for Production Mail decreased 1% due to lower equipment sales in the U.S., parts of Europe and Latin America as economic uncertainty slowed large ticket capital expenditures by many large enterprises worldwide. This decrease was partly offset by continued strong demand in the U.K. and France for high speed, intelligent inserting systems. Production Mails EBIT increased 10% due to ongoing actions to reduce administrative costs and improve gross margins in anticipation of a slowing capital investment environment. Software revenue increased 23% from prior year, driven by the positive impact of acquisitions of 20%. Software sales increased outside of the U.S., but declined within the U.S. driven by the economic uncertainty, which has resulted in fewer large ticket licensing deals than in the prior year as customers assess the overall business environment. Softwares EBIT decreased 23% primarily due to the lower revenues in the U.S., product mix and the planned investments in the expansion of the Companys distribution channel and globalization of its research and development infrastructure. Mailstream Services revenue increased 9% to $1.9 billion and EBIT increased 15% to $160 million, compared to the prior year. Within Mailstream Services: Management Services revenue grew 3% driven by acquisitions, which contributed 6% to segment revenue growth. The segments revenue growth was partially offset by lower print and transaction volumes for some customers, especially in the U.S. financial services sector. Management Services EBIT decreased 8% due to weakness in our management services businesses outside the U.S., particularly in the U.K. and Germany. These decreases were partially offset by actions taken to reduce the fixed cost structure of its U.S. operations. Mail Services revenue grew 23% due to continued growth in presort and international mail services of 14% and acquisitions, which contributed 10% to segment revenue growth. Mail Services EBIT increased 22% as a result of operating leverage from an increase in mail volume and increased operating efficiency, partly offset by the integration costs associated with acquisitions in the U.S. and U.K. Marketing Services revenue grew 18% driven primarily by higher volumes in our mover source program, partially offset by the companys planned phased exit from the motor vehicle registration services program. Marketing Services EBIT increased to $21 17 million in 2008 from $7 million in 2007 driven by higher volumes in the Companys mover source program and its phased exit from the motor vehicle registration services program. Revenue by source (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 % change Equipment sales $ 1,252 $ 1,336 (6 )% Supplies 392 393 % Software 424 346 23 % Rentals 728 739 (1 )% Financing 773 790 (2 )% Support services 769 761 1 % Business services 1,924 1,765 9 % Total revenue $ 6,262 $ 6,130 2 % Equipment sales revenue decreased 6% compared to the prior year. Lower sales of equipment in U.S. Mailing were primarily due to the postal rate case in 2007, which resulted in incremental sales of mailing equipment shape based upgrade kits during that period and pulled sales forward from 2008, weakening global economic conditions, and product shift toward smaller, fully featured postage machines. International sales revenue, excluding the positive impact from foreign currency of 2% and acquisitions of 2%, increased 2% principally due to a postal rate change in the first quarter of 2008 in France, combined with higher equipment placements throughout Europe. Foreign currency translation contributed an overall favorable impact of 1% to equipment sales revenue. Supplies revenue in 2008 was flat compared to the prior year. The decline of supplies revenue in the U.S was due to lower volumes, offset by an increase in supplies revenue in Europe as our customers continue to migrate to digital technology. Foreign currency translation contributed 1% to supplies revenue. Software revenue increased by 23% from the prior year primarily driven by acquisitions which contributed 19% to revenue growth and strong international demand for our location intelligence and customer communication software solutions. Foreign currency translation had a negative impact of 2%. Rentals revenue decreased 1% compared to the prior year. Favorable foreign currency translation of 1% and higher demand in France were offset by lower revenue in the U.S., as our customers continue to downsize to smaller, fully featured machines. Financing revenue decreased 2% compared to the prior year. Lower equipment sales have resulted in a corresponding decline in the U.S. lease portfolio. Support services revenue increased 1% from the prior year primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of 1%. Renewals and pricing increases offset the impact of customers down sizing their equipment. Business services revenue increased 9% from the prior year, of which acquisitions contributed 7%. The additional growth was driven by higher revenues in Mail Services and Marketing Services, partly offset by lower transaction volumes in Management Services. Costs and expenses Percentage of Revenue (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2008 2007 Cost of equipment sales $ 663 $ 697 53.0 % 52.2 % Cost of supplies $ 104 $ 107 26.5 % 27.1 % Cost of software $ 101 $ 82 23.9 % 23.7 % Cost of rentals $ 154 $ 171 21.1 % 23.2 % Financing interest expense $ 110 $ 127 14.3 % 16.0 % Cost of support services $ 448 $ 433 58.3 % 56.9 % Cost of business services $ 1,486 $ 1,357 77.2 % 76.9 % Selling, general and administrative $ 1,971 $ 1,930 31.5 % 31.5 % Research and development $ 206 $ 186 3.3 % 3.0 % 18 Cost of equipment sales as a percentage of revenue increased to 53.0% in 2008 compared with 52.2% in the prior year, primarily due to the increase in mix of lower margin equipment sales outside the U.S. and the prior year sales of high margin upgrade kits. Cost of supplies as a percentage of revenue decreased to 26.5% in 2008 compared with 27.1% in the prior year. This variance is driven by a change in the mix of business. Cost of software as a percentage of revenue increased to 23.9% in 2008 compared with 23.7% in the prior year primarily due to a change in the mix of business. Cost of rentals as a percentage of revenue decreased to 21.1% in 2008 compared with 23.2% in the prior year primarily due to lower depreciation costs related to the transition of our product line. Financing interest expense as a percentage of revenue was 14.3% in 2008 compared with 16.0% in the prior year due to lower interest rates. In computing our financing interest expense, which represents our cost of borrowing associated with the generation of financing revenues, we assumed a 10:1 leveraging ratio of debt to equity and applied our overall effective interest rate to the average outstanding finance receivables. Cost of support services as a percentage of revenue increased to 58.3% in 2008 compared with 56.9% in the prior year. Improvements in our Production Mail segment due to the impact of our transition initiatives were more than offset by higher service costs in our U.S. and International Mailing businesses. Cost of business services as a percentage of revenue was 77.2% in 2008 compared with 76.9% in the prior year. For Mail Services, continued integration costs associated with the current year acquisitions of a multi site presort operation in the U.S. and U.K. were more than offset by the successful integration of other recently acquired sites and productivity improvements. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, remained flat at 31.5%. The benefits gained from our transition initiatives were offset by lower revenue growth and a shift in the mix of our business as well as higher credit loss expenses in the U.S. Software, which is continuing to become a larger portion of our overall business, has a relatively higher selling, general and administrative expense ratio. Research and development expenses increased $20 million, or 11%, as we continue to invest in developing new technologies, enhancing our products, and expanding our offshore development capabilities. R&D expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased to 3.3% in 2008 from 3.0% in 2007. Other interest expense (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 % change $ 119 $ 124 (4 )% Other interest expense decreased $5 million or 4%, from prior year due to lower average interest rates during the year. We do not allocate other interest expenses to our business segments. Income taxes / effective tax rate 2008 2007 34.3 % 42.4 % The effective tax rate declined 8.1% in 2008 primarily as a result of a $54 million tax charge in 2007 related principally to a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets and tax rate changes outside the U.S. Discontinued operations (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 Pre tax income $ $ Tax provision (28 ) 6 (Loss) gain from discontinued operations, net of tax $ (28 ) $ 6 19 The net loss in 2008 includes accruals of tax and interest on uncertain tax positions. The 2007 net gain includes a benefit of $11 million and the accrual of $6 million of interest expense, both related to uncertain tax positions. Noncontrolling interests (Preferred stock dividends of subsidiaries) (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 % change $ 21 $ 19 8 % Noncontrolling interests includes dividends paid to preferred stockholders in subsidiary companies. In August 2008, we redeemed 100% of the outstanding Cumulative Preferred Stock issued previously by a subsidiary company for $10 million. This redemption resulted in a net loss of $2 million accounting for the year over year increase. Restructuring Charges and Asset Impairments We recorded pre tax restructuring charges and asset impairments of $49 million and $200 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 2009 Program In 2009, we announced that we are undertaking a series of initiatives that are designed to transform and enhance the way we operate as a global company. In order to enhance our responsiveness to changing market conditions, we are executing a strategic transformation program designed to create improved processes and systems to further enable us to invest in future growth in areas such as our global customer interactions and product development processes. This program is expected to continue into 2012 and will result in the reduction of up to 10 percent of the positions in the company. We expect the total pre tax cost of this program will be in the range of $250 million to $350 million primarily related to severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with such workforce reductions. Most of the total pre tax costs will be cash related charges. Currently, we are targeting annualized benefits, net of system and related investments, in the range of at least $150 million to $200 million on a pre tax basis. These costs and the related benefits will be recognized as different actions are approved and implemented. During 2009, we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $68 million, of which $56 million related to severance and benefit costs and $12 million related to other exit costs associated with this new transformation project. As of December 31, 2009, 548 employee terminations have occurred. The majority of the liability at December 31, 2009 is expected to be paid during the next twelve months from cash generated from operations. Pre tax restructuring reserves at December 31, 2009 for the restructuring actions taken in connection with the 2009 program are composed of the following: 2009 Program Balance at December 31, 2008 Expenses Cash payments Non cash charges Balance at December 31, 2009 Severance and benefit costs $ $ 56 $ (10 ) $ $ 46 Other exit costs 12 (5 ) 7 Total $ $ 68 $ (15 ) $ $ 53 2007 Program We announced a program in November 2007 to lower our cost structure, accelerate efforts to improve operational efficiencies, and transition our product line. The program included charges primarily associated with older equipment that we had stopped selling upon transition to the new generation of fully digital, networked, and remotely downloadable equipment. In 2009, we recorded a pre tax adjustment to restructuring charges and asset impairments for $19 million due to lower than anticipated charges associated with the program announced in November 2007. In 2008, we recorded pre tax restructuring charges and asset impairments of $200 million, the majority of which related to the program announced in November 2007. These charges included severance and benefit costs of $118 million, asset impairment charges related to older technology equipment of $29 million and other assets of $2 million. Other exit costs of $35 million related primarily to lease termination fees, facility closing costs, contract cancellation costs and outplacement costs. 20 Additional asset impairments, unrelated to restructuring, were also recorded in 2008 and related to intangible assets of $16 million principally due to a loss of a customer in one of our marketing consulting businesses and the ongoing shift in market conditions for the litigation support vertical in our Management Services business. As of December 31, 2009, 2,999 terminations have occurred under this program. The majority of the liability at December 31, 2009 is expected to be paid during the next twelve months from cash generated from operations. Pre tax restructuring reserves at December 31, 2009 for the restructuring program announced in November 2007 are composed of the following: 2007 Program Balance at December 31, 2008 Expenses Cash payments Non cash charges Balance at December 31, 2009 Severance and benefit costs $ 108 $ (15 ) $ (78 ) $ $ 15 Asset impairments (4 ) 4 Other exit costs 33 (12 ) 21 Total $ 141 $ (19 ) $ (90 ) $ 4 $ 36 Balance at December 31, 2007 Expenses Cash payments Non cash charges Balance at December 31, 2008 Severance and benefit costs $ 81 $ 118 $ (91 ) $ $ 108 Asset impairments 47 (47 ) Other exit costs 6 35 (8 ) 33 Total $ 87 $ 200 $ (99 ) $ (47 ) $ 141 Acquisitions There were no acquisitions during 2009. On April 21, 2008, we acquired Zipsort, Inc. for $40 million in cash, net of cash acquired. Zipsort, Inc. acts as an intermediary between customers and the U.S. Postal Service. Zipsort, Inc. offers mailing services that include presorting of first class, standard class, flats, permit and international mail as well as metering services. We assigned the goodwill to the Mail Services segment. During 2008, we also completed several smaller acquisitions, the costs of which were $30 million. These acquisitions did not have a material impact on our financial results. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. We accounted for these acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and accordingly, the operating results of these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. Acquisitions made in 2008 did not materially impact our diluted earnings per share for the year. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on acquisitions. Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that cash flow from operations, existing cash and liquid investments, as well as borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program, the existing credit facility and debt capital markets should be sufficient to finance our capital requirements and to cover our customer deposits. Our potential uses of cash include but are not limited to the following: growth and expansion opportunities; internal investments; customer financing; restructuring payments; tax payments; interest and dividend payments; pension and other benefit plan funding; acquisitions; and share repurchase program. We continue to review our liquidity profile. We have carefully monitored for material changes in the creditworthiness of those banks acting as derivative counterparties, depository banks or credit providers to us through credit ratings and the credit default swap market. We have determined that there has not been a material variation in the underlying sources of cash flows currently used to finance the operations of the company. To date, we have had consistent access to the commercial paper market. 21 Cash Flow Summary The change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows: (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Cash provided by operating activities $ 824 $ 1,009 Cash used in investing activities (172 ) (234 ) Cash used in financing activities (626 ) (761 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 10 (15 ) Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 36 $ (1 ) 2009 Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net income adjusted for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The strong cash flow provided by operations for 2009 is primarily due to the decrease in finance receivables and accounts receivable of $207 million and $84 million, respectively, primarily due to lower sales volumes as well as an increase in current and non current income taxes of $86 million due to the timing of tax payments. Partially offsetting these positive impacts was a reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $127 million, primarily due to timing of payments, $125 million for voluntary pension plan contributions and $105 million for restructuring payments associated with the programs initiated in 2007 and 2009. Net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $167 million for rental and other assets utilized in our operations. Net cash used in financing activities was $626 million and consisted primarily of dividends paid to common stockholders of $298 million, a net reduction of debt of $242 million, and a net cash outflow associated with the issuance and redemption of preferred stock issued by a subsidiary of $79 million. 2008 Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net income adjusted for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The strong cash flow provided by operations for 2008 is primarily due to the timing of tax payments, which favorably contributed $122 million, and the receipt of $44 million related to the unwind of an interest rate swap, which is described in further detail in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Partially offsetting these positive impacts were restructuring payments of $103 million associated with the program initiated in 2007 and a reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $77 million, primarily due to timing of these payments. Net cash used in investing activities consisted of capital expenditures of $237 million primarily for rental assets and acquisitions of $68 million partially offset by proceeds from short term and other investments of $36 million, and increased reserve account balances for customer deposits of $33 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $761 million and consisted primarily of stock repurchases of $333 million, dividends paid to common stockholders of $292 million, and a net payment of debt of $125 million, which was partly offset by proceeds of $20 million from the issuance of common stock associated with employee stock plans. We also paid $10 million associated with the redemption of 100% of the outstanding Cumulative Preferred Stock issued previously by a subsidiary company. Capital Expenditures During 2009, capital expenditures included net additions of $85 million to property, plant and equipment and $82 million in net additions to rental equipment and related inventories compared with $122 million and $115 million, respectively, in 2008. The decrease in spend on property, plant and equipment and net additions to rental equipment and related inventories is due to lower new meter placements in 2009 and tighter control over capital spending. Financings and Capitalization We have a commercial paper program that is a significant source of liquidity for the Company. During 2009, we continued to have consistent access to the commercial paper market. As of December 31, 2009, we had $221 million of outstanding commercial paper issuances. We also have a committed line of credit of $1.5 billion which supports commercial papers issuance and is provided by a syndicate of 16 banks until 2011. As of December 31, 2009, this line of credit had not been drawn down. We are a Well Known 22 Seasoned Issuer with the SEC which allows us to issue debt securities, preferred stock, preference stock, common stock, purchase contracts, depositary shares, warrants and units. On September 15, 2009, we repaid the 8.55% notes with a $150 million face value at their maturity. The repayment of these notes was funded through cash generated from operations and issuance of commercial paper. No additional long term notes will mature until 2012. On June 29, 2009, we entered into an interest rate swap for an aggregate notional amount of $100 million to effectively convert our interest payments on a portion of the $400 million, 4.625% fixed rate notes due in 2012, into variable interest rates. The variable rates payable are based on one month LIBOR plus 249 basis points. In July 2009, we entered into three additional interest rate swaps for an aggregate notional amount of $300 million to effectively convert our interest payments on the remainder of the $400 million, 4.625% fixed rate notes due in 2012, into variable interest rates. The variable rates payable are based on one month LIBOR plus 248 basis points for $100 million notional amount and one month LIBOR plus 250 basis points for $200 million notional amount. On March 2, 2009, we issued $300 million of 10 year fixed rate notes with a coupon rate of 6.25%. The interest is paid semi annually beginning September 15, 2009. The notes mature on March 15, 2019. We simultaneously unwound four forward starting swap agreements (forward swaps) used to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the forecasted issuance of the fixed rate debt. The unwind of the derivatives resulted in a loss (and cash payment) of $20.3 million which was recorded to other comprehensive income, net of tax, and will be amortized to net interest expense over the 10 year term of the notes. The proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper. On March 4, 2008, we issued $250 million of 10 year fixed rate notes with a coupon rate of 5.60%. The interest is paid semi annually beginning September 15, 2008. The notes mature on March 15, 2018. We simultaneously entered into two interest rate swaps for a total notional amount of $250 million to convert the fixed rate debt to a floating rate obligation bearing interest at 6 month LIBOR plus 111.5 basis points. The proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper and repurchase of our stock. During 2009, we voluntarily contributed a total of $125 million in cash to our global defined benefit pension plans in excess of legally required minimum contributions to increase the funding levels of the plans. Specifically, $100 million was contributed to the U.S. qualified plan and $25 million to certain foreign qualified plans. The voluntary contributions were funded by cash flows from operations and the issuance of commercial paper. During 2009, the Board of Directors approved and adopted a resolution amending both U.S. pension plans, the Pitney Bowes Pension Plan and the Pitney Bowes Pension Restoration Plan, to provide that benefit accruals as of December 31, 2014, will be determined and frozen and no future benefit accruals under the plans will occur after that date. In October 2009, Pitney Bowes International Holdings, Inc. (PBIH), a subsidiary of the Company, issued $300 million of perpetual voting preferred stock to certain outside institutional investors. These preferred shares are entitled to 25% of the combined voting power of all classes of capital stock of PBIH. All outstanding common stock of PBIH, representing the remaining 75% of the combined voting power of all classes of capital stock, is owned directly or indirectly by Pitney Bowes Inc. The preferred stock is entitled to cumulative dividends at a rate of 6.125% for a period of 7 years after which they become callable and, if remain outstanding, will yield a dividend that increases by 150% every six months thereafter. In October 2009, PBIH redeemed $344 million of its existing variable term voting preferred stock. The redemption was funded by a combination of the issuance of the $300 million perpetual voting preferred stock and commercial paper. In December 2009, PBIH redeemed the remaining $31 million of its existing variable term voting preferred stock. The redemption was funded by cash flows from operations and the issuance of commercial paper. We believe our financing needs in the short and long term can be met from cash generated internally, the issuance of commercial paper, debt issuance under our effective shelf registration statement and borrowing capacity under our existing credit agreements. Information on debt maturities is presented in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 23 Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following summarizes our known contractual obligations at December 31, 2009and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods: Contractual Obligations Payments due by period (Dollars in millions) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Commercial paper borrowings $ 221 $ 221 $ $ $ Long term debt and current portion of long term debt 4,175 550 825 2,800 Non cancelable operating lease obligations 322 110 136 53 23 Interest payments on debt 1,762 185 371 327 879 Capital lease obligations 14 6 6 2 Purchase obligations (1) 325 244 68 13 Other non current liabilities (2) 616 114 43 459 Total $ 7,435 $ 766 $ 1,245 $ 1,263 $ 4,161 (1) Purchase obligations include unrecorded agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding upon us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. (2) Other non current liabilities relate primarily to our postretirement benefits. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The amount and period of future payments related to our income tax uncertainties cannot be reliably estimated and, therefore, is not included in the above table. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. Critical Accounting Estimates We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations. We have discussed the impact and any associated risks on our results of operations related to these policies throughout the MD&A. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include, but are not limited to, customer cancellations, bad debts, inventory obsolescence, residual values of leased assets, useful lives of long lived assets and intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, warranty obligations, restructuring, pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies and litigation, and allocation of purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired in business combinations. Our actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. We believe the assumptions and estimates used are reasonable and appropriate in accordance with GAAP. Revenue recognition Multiple element and internal financing arrangements We derive our revenue from multiple sources including sales, rentals, financing and services. Certain of our transactions are consummated at the same time and can therefore generate revenue from multiple sources. The most common form of these transactions involves a non cancelable equipment lease, a meter rental and an equipment maintenance agreement. As a result, we are required to determine whether the deliverables in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and if so, how the price should be allocated among the delivered elements and when to recognize revenue for each element. In multiple element arrangements, we recognize revenue for each of the elements based on their respective fair values in accordance with the accounting guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. We recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known and uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved. Our allocation of the fair values to the various elements does not change the total revenue recognized from a transaction, but impacts the timing of 24 revenue recognition. Revenue is allocated to the meter rental and equipment maintenance agreement elements first using their respective fair values, which are determined based on prices charged in standalone and renewal transactions. Revenue is then allocated to the equipment based on the present value of the remaining minimum lease payments. We then compare the allocated equipment fair value to the range of cash selling prices in standalone transactions during the period to ensure the allocated equipment fair value approximates average cash selling prices. We provide lease financing for our products primarily through sales type leases. We classify our leases in accordance with the lease accounting guidance. The vast majority of our leases qualify as sales type leases using the present value of minimum lease payments classification criteria. We believe that our sales type lease portfolio contains only normal collection risk. Accordingly, we record the fair value of equipment as sales revenue, the cost of equipment as cost of sales and the minimum lease payments plus the estimated residual value as gross finance receivables. The difference between the gross finance receivable and the equipment fair value is recorded as unearned income and is amortized as income over the lease term using the interest rate implicit in the lease. Equipment residual values are determined at inception of the lease using estimates of equipment fair value at the end of the lease term. Estimates of future equipment fair value are based primarily on our historical experience. We also consider forecasted supply and demand for our various products, product retirement and future product launch plans, end of lease customer behavior, regulatory changes, remanufacturing strategies, used equipment markets, if any, competition and technological changes. We evaluate residual values on an annual basis or as changes to the above considerations occur. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our accounting policies on revenue recognition. Allowances for doubtful accounts and credit losses Allowance for doubtful accounts We estimate our accounts receivable risks and provide allowances for doubtful accounts accordingly. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical loss experience, length of time receivables are past due, adverse situations that may affect a customers ability to pay and prevailing economic conditions. We make adjustments to our allowance if our evaluation of allowance requirements differs from our actual aggregate reserve. This evaluation is inherently subjective because our estimates may be revised as more information becomes available. Allowance for credit losses We estimate our finance receivables risks and provide allowances for credit losses accordingly. We establish credit approval limits based on the credit quality of our customers and the type of equipment financed. We charge finance receivables to the allowance for credit losses after collection efforts are exhausted and we deem the account uncollectible. We base credit decisions primarily on a customers financial strength. We believe that our concentration of credit risk for finance receivables in our internal financing division is limited because of our large number of customers, small account balances and customer geographic and industry diversification. Our general policy for finance receivables contractually past due for over 120 days is to discontinue revenue recognition. We resume revenue recognition when payments reduce the account to 60 days or less past due. We evaluate the adequacy of allowance for credit losses based on our historical loss experience, the nature and volume of our portfolios, adverse situations that may affect a customers ability to pay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. We make adjustments to our allowance for credit losses if the evaluation of reserve requirements differs from the actual aggregate reserve. This evaluation is inherently subjective because our estimates may be revised as more information becomes available. Accounting for income taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We record this amount as a provision for our taxes in accordance with the accounting for income taxes guidance. In 2007, we adopted guidance addressing accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. The guidance defines the confidence level that a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the financial statements. The guidance requires a two step approach under which the tax effect of a position is recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained and the amount of the tax benefit recognized is equal to the largest tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement of the tax position. This is a different standard for recognition than the approach previously required. Both approaches require us to exercise considerable judgment and estimates are inherent in both processes. 25 We regularly assess the likelihood of tax adjustments in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and account for the related financial statement implications. We have established tax reserves which we believe to be appropriate given the possibility of tax adjustments. Determining the appropriate level of tax reserves requires us to exercise judgment regarding the uncertain application of tax law. We adjust the amount of reserves when information becomes available or when an event occurs indicating a change in the reserve is appropriate. Future changes in tax reserve requirements could have a material impact on our results of operations. Based on our 2009 income from continuing operations before income taxes, a 1% change in our effective tax rate would impact income from continuing operations by approximately $7 million. Goodwill and long lived assets Useful lives of long lived assets We depreciate property, plant and equipment and rental property and equipment principally using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives: machinery and equipment principally 3 to 15 years and buildings up to 50 years. We amortize properties leased under capital leases on a straight line basis over the primary lease terms. We amortize capitalized costs related to internally developed software using the straight line method over the estimated useful life, which is principally 3 to 10 years. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which are principally 4 to 15 years, using the straight line method or an accelerated attrition method. Our estimates of useful lives could be affected by changes in regulatory provisions, technology or business plans. Impairment review We evaluate the recoverability and, if necessary, the fair value of our long lived assets, including intangible assets, on an annual basis or as circumstances warrant. We derive the cash flow estimates that are incorporated into the analysis from our historical experience and our future long term business plans and, if necessary, apply an appropriate discount rate to assist in the determination of its fair value. In addition, we used quoted market prices when available and appraisals as appropriate to assist in the determination of fair value. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, or sooner when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist at the reporting unit level. Our goodwill impairment review requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. Significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. We use a combination of various techniques, including the present value of future cash flows, earnings multiples of competitors and multiples from sales of like businesses, to determine the fair value of our reporting units. We derive the cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our future long term business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate. Changes in the estimates and assumptions incorporated into the long lived asset and goodwill assessments could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. For 2009, based upon our impairment reviews for goodwill and long lived assets, where appropriate, no impairments were identified. During the review of our 2009 annual goodwill impairment test, the calculated fair values for all of our reporting units were considered substantially in excess of the respective reporting units carrying value, with the exception of one reporting unit. This reporting unit, which represents the international operations of our Management Services segment, had a calculated fair value 14% in excess of its carrying value. At December 31, 2009, the carrying value of this reporting unit included an allocation of goodwill of $136 million. The calculated fair value of each of our reporting units was based on a combination of inputs and assumptions. These inputs and assumptions include projections of future cash flows, discount rates, growth rates and applicable earnings multiples of competitors. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on our restructuring charges and asset impairments recorded in 2009 and 2008. We believe that we have no unrecorded asset impairments at December 31, 2009. However, future events and circumstances, some of which are described below, may result in an impairment charge: Changes in postal regulations governing the types of meters allowable for use. New technological developments that provide significantly enhanced benefits over current technology. Significant ongoing negative economic or industry trends. Changes in our business strategy that alters the expected usage of the related assets. Future economic results that are below our expectations used in the current assessments. 26 Pension benefits Assumptions and estimates The valuation and calculation of our net pension expense, assets and obligations are dependent on various assumptions and estimates. We make assumptions relating to discount rate, rate of compensation increase, expected return on plan assets and other factors. These assumptions are evaluated and updated annually and are described in further detail in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following assumptions relate to our U.S. qualified pension plan, which is our largest plan. We determine our discount rate for the U.S. retirement benefit plan by using a model that discounts each years estimated benefit payments by an applicable spot rate. These spot rates are derived from a yield curve created from a large number of high quality corporate bonds. Accordingly, our discount rate assumption was 5.75% at December 31, 2009 and 6.05% at December 31, 2008. The rate of compensation increase assumption reflects our actual experience and best estimate of future increases. Our estimate of the rate of compensation increase was 3.50% at December 31, 2009 and 4.25% at December 31, 2008. Our expected return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the plans investment portfolio after analyzing historical experience and future expectations of the returns and volatility of the various asset classes. The overall expected rate of return for the portfolio is determined based on the target asset allocations for each asset class, adjusted for historical and expected experience of active portfolio management results, when compared to the benchmark returns. When assessing the expected future returns for the portfolio, we place more emphasis on the expected future returns than historical returns. Our expected return on plan assets assumption was 8.0% at December 31, 2009 and 2008. Sensitivity to changes in assumptions: U.S. Pension Plan Discount rate a 0.25% increase in the discount rate would decrease annual pension expense by approximately $2.4 million and would lower the projected benefit obligation by $39.2 million. Rate of compensation increase a 0.25% increase in the rate of compensation increase would increase annual pension expense by approximately $0.6 million. Expected return on plan assets a 0.25% increase in the expected return on assets of our principal plans would decrease annual pension expense by approximately $3.9 million. The following assumptions relate to our U.K. qualified pension plan, which is our largest foreign plan. We determine our discount rate for the U.K. retirement benefit plan by using a model that discounts each years estimated benefit payments by an applicable spot rate. These spot rates are derived from a yield curve created from a large number of high quality corporate bonds. Accordingly, our discount rate assumption was 5.70% at December 31, 2009 and 6.3% at December 31, 2008. The rate of compensation increase assumption reflects our actual experience and best estimate of future increases. Our estimate of the rate of compensation increase was 3.50% at December 31, 2009 and 4.3% at December 31, 2008. Our expected return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results, the plans asset mix and future expectations of market rates of return on the types of assets in the plan. Our expected return on plan assets assumption was 7.50% and 7.25% at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. U.K. Pension Plan Discount rate a 0.25% increase in the discount rate would decrease annual pension expense by approximately $1.4 million and would lower the projected benefit obligation by $15.4 million. Rate of compensation increase a 0.25% increase in the rate of compensation increase would increase annual pension expense by approximately $0.4 million. Expected return on plan assets a 0.25% increase in the expected return on assets of our principal plans would decrease annual pension expense by approximately $0.7 million. Delayed recognition principles In accordance with the retirement benefits accounting guidance, actual pension plan results that differ from our assumptions and estimates are accumulated and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants and will therefore affect pension expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods. We also base our net pension expense primarily on a market related valuation of plan assets. In accordance with this approach, we recognize differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets primarily over a five year period and as a result future pension expense will be impacted when these previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. Investment related risks and uncertainties We invest our pension plan assets in a variety of investment securities in accordance with our strategic asset allocation policy. The composition of our U.S. pension plan assets at December 31, 2009 was approximately 54% equity securities, 38% fixed income 27 securities, 4% real estate investments and 4% private equity investments. The composition of our U.K. pension plan assets at December 31, 2009 was approximately 67% equity securities, 32% fixed income securities and 1% cash. Investment securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate, market and credit risks. In particular, due to the level of risk associated with equity securities, it is reasonably possible that changes in the values of such investment securities will occur and that such changes could materially affect our future results. New Accounting Pronouncements Revenue Recognition In September 2009, new guidance was introduced addressing the accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple elements and certain revenue arrangements that include software. The new literature will allow companies to allocate consideration in a multiple element arrangement in a way that better reflects the economics of the transaction. This will result in the elimination of the residual method. In addition, tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product will be scoped out of the software revenue guidance. The new guidance will also result in more expansive disclosures. The new guidance will be effective on January 1, 2011, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance. Pension Disclosures On December 31, 2009, we adopted new accounting guidance requiring more detailed disclosures about employers postretirement benefit plan assets, including investment strategies, major categories of assets, concentrations of risk within plan assets and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of assets. The Company has complied with the additional disclosure requirements. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our postretirement benefit plan disclosures. Noncontrolling Interests On January 1, 2009, we adopted new accounting guidance on noncontrolling interests. The new guidance addresses the accounting and reporting for the outstanding noncontrolling interest (previously referred to as minority interest) in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It also establishes additional disclosures in the consolidated financial statements that identify and distinguish between the interests of the parents owners and of the noncontrolling owners of a subsidiary. The guidance requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests while all other requirements of the guidance are applied prospectively. Business Combinations On January 1, 2009, we adopted new accounting guidance on business combinations. The new guidance revises principles and requirements for how a company (a) recognizes and measures in their financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest (previously referred to as minority interest); (b) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and (c) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of a business combination. Some of the major impacts of this new guidance include expense recognition for transaction costs and restructuring costs. The adoption of this guidance has not had a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities On January 1, 2009, we adopted new accounting guidance on disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities. The new guidance impacts disclosures only and requires additional qualitative and quantitative information on the use of derivatives and their impact on an entitys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our derivative instruments and hedging activities. Fair Value Measurements On January 1, 2008, we adopted new accounting guidance on fair value measurements. The new guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. It was effective for certain financial assets and liabilities on January 1, 2008 and for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on January 1, 2009. The adoption of this guidance has not had a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on fair value measurements. Legal and Regulatory Matters Legal See Legal Proceedings in Item 3 of this Form 10 K for information regarding our legal proceedings. 28 Income taxes We regularly assess the likelihood of tax adjustments in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we have operations and account for the related financial statement implications. Tax reserves have been established which we believe to be appropriate given the possibility of tax adjustments. Determining the appropriate level of tax reserves requires us to exercise judgment regarding the uncertain application of tax law. The amount of reserves is adjusted when information becomes available or when an event occurs indicating a change in the reserve is appropriate. Future changes in tax reserve requirements could have a material impact on our results of operations. We are continually under examination by tax authorities in the United States, other countries and local jurisdictions in which we have operations. The years under examination vary by jurisdiction. The current IRS exam of tax years 2001 2004 is estimated to be completed within the next two years and the examination of years 2005 2008 has commenced. In connection with the 2001 2004 exam, we have received notices of proposed adjustments to our filed returns. Tax reserves have been established which we believe to be appropriate given the possibility of tax adjustments. We are also disputing a formal request from the IRS in the form of a civil summons to provide certain company workpapers. We believe that certain documents being sought should not be produced because they are privileged. A decision by the Rhode Island U.S. District Court in a similar case that supported our position was overturned on appeal by the First Circuit Court of Appeals and the federal judicial circuits are now divided on this issue. The taxpayer in the First Circuit decision has filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court requesting review of the First Circuit decision. Also in connection with the 2001 2004 audits, we have entered into a settlement with the IRS regarding the tax treatment of certain lease transactions related to the Capital Services business that we sold in 2006. Prior to 2007, we accrued and paid the IRS the additional tax associated with this settlement. A variety of post 1999 tax years remain subject to examination by other tax authorities, including the U.K., Canada, France, Germany and various U.S. states. Tax reserves have been established which we believe to be appropriate given the possibility of tax adjustments. However, the resolution of such matters could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. During 2010, we expect to reverse tax benefits of approximately $15 million associated with the expiration of out of the money vested stock options and the vesting of restricted stock units previously granted to our employees. These write offs of deferred tax assets will not require the payment of any taxes. Effects of Inflation and Foreign Exchange Inflation, although minimal in recent years, continues to affect worldwide economies and the way companies operate. It increases labor costs and operating expenses, and raises costs associated with replacement of fixed assets such as rental equipment. Despite these growing costs, we have generally been able to maintain profit margins through productivity and efficiency improvements, continual review of both manufacturing capacity and operating expense levels, and, where applicable, price increases. Currency translation decreased our 2009 revenue by approximately 2%. Also, currency translation losses decreased our income before taxes by $13 million. Based on the current contribution from our international operations, a 1% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar would result in a decline in revenue of approximately $16 million and a decline in income from continuing operations before income taxes of approximately $2 million. Although not affecting income, balance sheet related deferred translation losses of $119 million were recorded in 2009 resulting primarily from the strengthening U.S. dollar as compared to the British pound, Euro and Canadian dollar. During 2008, we recorded deferred translation losses of $305 million resulting primarily from the strengthening U.S. dollar as compared to the British pound, Euro and Canadian dollar. During 2007, we recorded deferred translation gains of $165 million resulting primarily from the stronger British pound, Euro and Canadian dollar, as compared to the U.S. dollar. The results of our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations. We enter into foreign exchange contracts primarily to reduce our risk of loss from such fluctuations. Exchange rates can also impact settlement of our intercompany receivables and payables that result from transfers of finished goods inventories between our affiliates in different countries, and intercompany loans. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. At December 31, 2009, we had $924 million, $2 million and $1 million of foreign exchange contracts outstanding maturing in 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively, to buy or sell various currencies. As a result of the use of derivative instruments, we are exposed to counterparty risk. To mitigate such risks, we enter into contracts with only those financial institutions that meet stringent credit requirements as set forth in our derivative policy. We regularly review our credit exposure balances as well as the creditworthiness of our counterparties. Maximum risk of loss on these contracts is limited to the amount of the difference between the spot rate at the date of the contract delivery and the contracted rate. 29 Dividends It is a general practice of our Board of Directors to pay a cash dividend on common stock each quarter. In setting dividend payments, our board considers the dividend rate in relation to our recent and projected earnings and our capital investment opportunities and requirements. We have paid a dividend each year since 1934. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations due to our investing and funding activities and our operations denominated in different foreign currencies. We manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by limiting its impact on earnings and cash flows and lowering our overall borrowing costs. We use a balanced mix of debt maturities and variable and fixed rate debt together with interest rate swaps to execute our strategy. Our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility in earnings and cash flows associated with the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, we enter into various contracts, which change in value as foreign exchange rates change, to protect the value of external and intercompany transactions. The principal currencies actively hedged are the British pound, Canadian dollar and Euro. We employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks. We do not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures. We utilize a Value at Risk (VaR) model to determine the potential loss in fair value from changes in market conditions. The VaR model utilizes a variance/co variance approach and assumes normal market conditions, a 95% confidence level and a one day holding period. The model includes all of our debt and all interest rate derivative contracts as well as our foreign exchange derivative contracts associated with forecasted transactions. The model excludes anticipated transactions, firm commitments, and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by us, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. During 2009 and 2008, our maximum potential one day loss in fair value of our exposure to foreign exchange rates and interest rates, using the variance/co variance technique described above, was not material.
