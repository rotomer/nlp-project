ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Business overview Fiscal 2005 was a very successful year on multiple fronts for Precision Castparts Corp ("PCC" or "the Company"). Spurred by the addition of SPS Technologies ("SPS"), which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, and by vigorous growth in PCCs core aerospace and power generation markets, PCC delivered strong operating results and attained record levels in sales, operating income, net income and earnings per share from continuing operations. The successful integration of SPS was a significant contributor to the strong performance achieved in fiscal 2005. During the year, the acquired SPS operations rapidly realized substantial synergies and operating margin improvement, and in the fourth quarter, the fastener operations of SPS were bolstered by new opportunities from the acquisition of Air Industries Corporation ("AIC"). AICs significant market presence in structural airframe bolts and expertise in manufacturing titanium fastener products greatly expands the manufacturing capabilities and range of products that the Fastener Products segment can offer to its customers. AICs fiscal 2005 operating results, which included only three weeks of activity in the fourth quarter, were immediately accretive to earnings. In addition to the strong performance from the SPS operations, leverage from improving market conditions and increased market shares, coupled with on going cost take outs throughout the Company, helped PCCs pre SPS acquisition base businesses achieve excellent operating results during the year, despite strong headwinds from higher raw material costs and contractual price reductions. Also during the year, the Company divested substantially all of its non core pumps and valves businesses that were part of the now discontinued Fluid Management Products segment, as well as certain non core businesses from the SPS acquisition. These divestitures, which generated $164.2 million of cash, will enable the Company to focus more attention and resources on its core markets and businesses. The Company also retired $200 million of 8.75 percent debt in the fourth quarter, which drove the debt to capitalization ratio from 38.6 percent at the end of fiscal 2004 to 32.1 percent at the end of fiscal 2005. With a strengthening credit profile, PCC is well positioned to take advantage of opportunities for growth in fiscal 2006 and beyond. Looking ahead to fiscal 2006, the stage is set for another strong year. Not only will PCC benefit in fiscal 2006 from the recovery of OEM build rates in both the aerospace and power generation markets, the Company will also benefit from the impact of continuing strong aftermarket sales, market share gains and expansion of PCCs technologies into new markets. PCC also expects to achieve continuing performance improvements from its operations throughout the year. With these favorable conditions, the Company anticipates that overall growth in sales and earnings during the upcoming year will out pace forecasted industry growth rates for the aerospace, power generation and automotive markets.

The former SPS businesses contributed a full year of sales in fiscal 2005 compared to 17 weeks in fiscal 2004. Total aerospace sales increased 36% over fiscal 2004 levels, while as a percent of total sales, fiscal 2005 aerospace sales declined to 55% compared to 62% in fiscal 2004. Power generation sales increased 54 percent over fiscal 2004 levels, and increased from 17 percent of total sales in fiscal 2004 to 18 percent of total sales in fiscal 2005. Sales to the general industrial and other markets grew by 78 percent, and the automotive market grew by 166%, primarily due to a full year of sales from the SPS operations. A recovery in commercial aircraft deliveries, coupled with strong aftermarket sales and increased market share gains in the aerospace and power generation markets led to increased sales in the Investment Cast Products and Forged Products segments. According to JSA Research as of October 2004, commercial aircraft deliveries were forecasted to increase approximately 13 percent in calendar year 2005 from calendar year 2004 compared with declining deliveries since calendar year 2001. Because of manufacturing lead times 12 Precision Castparts Corp. & Subsidiaries required to support aircraft deliveries, PCC began realizing these calendar 2005 forecasted increases during its fiscal 2005. In addition, continued growth in the seamless pipe market in the Forged Products segment, and expansion of the Companys metal injection molding technology in the automotive sector and strength in the pulp and paper market contributed to higher sales in the Industrial Products segment. Cost of goods sold was $2,265.4 million, or 78 percent of sales, in fiscal 2005 as compared to $1,484.9 million, or 78 percent of sales, in fiscal 2004. The flat year over year percentage reflects the impact of leverage from higher sales volume and improved operating efficiencies, offset by increased raw material costs and lower sales prices in fiscal 2005. Selling and administrative expenses were $233.3 million, or 8 percent of sales, in fiscal 2005 compared to $154.0 million, or 8 percent of sales, in fiscal 2004. The flat year over year percentage was due to a full year of SPS results, which has higher SG&A as a percent of sales than PCCs base businesses, offset by the leverage from higher sales volume. Net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2005 was $239.5 million, or $3.60 per share (diluted), which included restructuring and asset impairment charges totaling $0.02 per share (diluted). By comparison, net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2004 was $126.9 million, or $2.20 per share (diluted), which included restructuring and impairment charges totaling $0.13 per share (diluted), and other expense associated with financing the SPS acquisition of $0.12 per share. Fiscal 2005 net loss after discontinued operations was $1.7 million, or a net loss of $0.03 per share (diluted), compared with net income of $117.9 million, or $2.05 per share (diluted) in fiscal 2004. The fiscal 2005 net loss includes charges totaling $248.0 million, or $3.73 per share (diluted), related to the disposition of the pumps and valves businesses. Business acquisitions On March 8, 2005, PCC acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of Air Industries Corporation ("AIC") for $190.7 million paid in cash. AIC is a leading manufacturer of airframe fasteners, which include bolts, pins, and screws made from titanium and nickel based alloys. This acquisition is expected to significantly enhance PCCs presence in the aerospace fastener market by expanding the range of fastener products offered to PCCs aerospace customers. AIC will operate as part of the Fastener Products segment. On December 9, 2003, PCC acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of SPS Technologies, Inc. SPS was acquired to strengthen and build upon the Companys core businesses, technologies and customer relationships. In addition, SPS complementary manufacturing processes provide the Company with opportunities to enhance efficiencies and reduce costs. The aggregate purchase price was $728.8 million, which included $294.2 million of cash, PCC common stock valued at $425.1 million and $9.5 million of cash paid for transaction fees. In addition, SPS paid $39.3 million for change of control payments and transaction fees as of the close of the transaction. The value of the 9.3 million shares of PCC common stock issued in connection with the acquisition was determined based on the quoted market price of PCCs common stock on and around the date of the close of the transaction. SPS is a supplier of fasteners and other metal products to the aerospace, automotive, and general industrial markets. SPS former Specialty Materials and Alloys group now operates as part of the Investment Cast Products segment. A new segment, Fastener Products, was established and comprises SPS former Aerospace Fasteners and Engineered Fasteners groups. SPS former tool group now operates as part of the Industrial Products segment. In addition, three former SPS businessesDacar, which was sold in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, Magnetics, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and Mohawk, which was sold subsequent to the end of fiscal 2005 were classified as held for sale in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, and their results were included in discontinued operations until their disposition. Discontinued operations The Companys financial statements were significantly impacted by activities relating to the planned divestiture of a number of PCCs businesses. These businesses have been accounted for under SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." Accordingly, any operating results of these businesses are presented in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income as discontinued operations, net of income tax, and all prior periods have been reclassified. Fiscal 2005 In the second quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company decided to sell all of the pumps and valves businesses of PCC Flow Technologies, with the exception of E/One. The businesses held for sale were reclassified from the Fluid Management Products segment to discontinued operations. The E/One business was retained and is now included in the Industrial Products segment. All of the pumps and valves businesses, with the exception of PCC Eurovalves, were sold in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. PCC Eurovalves, which is located in The Netherlands, continues to be marketed. PCCs decision to sell the pumps and valves businesses in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 resulted in a charge of $245.0 million, of which $219.1 million was associated with the write down of goodwill. The remainder related to the write down of inventory, other amortizable assets and machinery and equipment to fair value less cost to sell. Approximately $240.0 million of the charge was non cash. Subsequent to the second quarter, the Company recorded additional write downs related to the disposition of the pumps and valves businesses, bringing the total net loss on disposal to $248.0 million. Fiscal 2004 In the third quarter of fiscal 2004, three businesses acquired in the SPS transactionMagnetics, Mohawk, and Dacarwere classified as held for sale and their results were included in discontinued operations. They were classified as discontinued operations because they were deemed to be non core to the Company. Dacar was sold in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, Magnetics was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, and Mohawk was sold in April 2005, subsequent to fiscal year end. In the second quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company incurred asset impairment and disposal charges associated with its decision to sell Newmans, a valve distribution company of PCC Flow Technologies. It was determined that Newmans distribution business did not fit with PCCs manufacturing focused operations and was not performing to the Companys expectations. The Companys decision to sell Newmans resulted in a charge of $19.2 million, principally related to the write down of assets to net realizable value. The Newmans business was sold in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. Precision Castparts Corp. & Subsidiaries 13 Fiscal 2003 In fiscal 2003, PCC incurred charges associated with the closure or sale of certain businesses of the Industrial Products segment and PCC Flow Technologies. Within the Industrial Products segment, the PCC Olofsson and Eldorado machine businesses were closed and the Eldorado gundrill tooling business was sold. In addition, the Company sold its controlling interest in Design Technologies International ("DTI") and certain intangible assets of Olofsson to minority shareholders of DTI. The closure or sale of these operations was in response to a steady and continual decline in the machine tool industry. In addition, PCC closed STW Composites ("STW") as it was deemed to be a non core business to PCC. PCC also entered into an agreement to sell Fastener Engineers & Lewis Machine ("FELM") and began actively marketing PCC Superior Fabrication for sale in the fourth quarter. FELM was sold during the first quarter and PCC Superior Fabrication was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Within PCC Flow Technologies, the Company began marketing Barber Industries in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 and sold the business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. The Company recorded disposal expenses in fiscal 2003 totaling $42.4 million related to the write down of remaining inventory and property, plant and equipment to fair value less cost to sell, the write down of accounts receivable and other current assets to net realizable value, and incremental costs directly related to the closure or sale of the businesses, such as pension, severance and lease termination costs. Restructuring, asset impairment and other non recurring charges The following table provides significant components of amounts recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income related to the Companys restructuring and asset impairment charges. Fiscal 2005 2004 2003 Provision for restructuring: Severance $ $ 8.2 $ 19.7 Other 0.1 1.4 Impairment of long lived assets 1.5 1.3 Total $ 1.6 $ 10.9 $ 19.7 The following table provides a rollforward of amounts included in accrued liabilities for restructuring reserves: Fiscal 2005 2004 2003 Restructuring reserve at beginning of period $ 5.0 $ 14.7 $ 6.1 Provision continuing operations 0.1 9.6 19.7 Cash payments (2.6 ) (19.9 ) (10.1 ) Non cash adjustments (0.5 ) 0.6 (1.0 ) Restructuring reserve at end of period $ 2.0 $ 5.0 $ 14.7 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, PCC recorded provisions for restructuring and impairment of long lived assets totaling $1.6 million, principally related to additional costs associated with a business that was closed several years ago. The tax effected impact of these charges was $1.1 million, or $0.02 per share (diluted). Taking into consideration current and forecasted conditions in markets served by the Company, PCC regularly assesses its cost structure to ensure that operations are properly sized for prevailing market conditions. Based on the Companys most recent assessment, there are no current plans to restructure operations in fiscal 2006. Other expense (income) Other expense of $11.2 million was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 to reflect the write off of unamortized bank fees ($2.8 million) from early termination of bank credit facilities and the termination of an interest rate swap ($8.4 million) associated with debt refinancing, both in connection with the SPS acquisition. Outlook The Company expects that the aerospace and power generation markets will continue to strengthen in fiscal 2006 as aircraft build rates increase and industrial gas turbine businesses recover, coupled with continued market share gains and strong demand in China for seamless pipe. Continued market share gains and expansion of PCCs technologies in the automotive market will also improve sales in fiscal 2006, while other markets served by the Company are expected to be relatively flat, or slightly improved from fiscal 2005. Overall, sales are expected to grow by approximately 10 15 percent from fiscal 2005. The Company anticipates its overall growth in fiscal 2006 will exceed forecasted industry OEM build rates for the aerospace, power generation and automotive markets as a result of increased aftermarket business, continued market share gains and expansion of PCCs technologies into new markets. Operating margins, as a percent of sales, are expected to show modest improvement over fiscal 2005 levels principally due to leverage from higher sales volume and improved operating performance, tempered somewhat by the impact of expected increases in zero margin pass through of higher metal costs. Financial results by segment PCC has organized the Companys business segments along its four major product lines and reports financial results in the following four segments: Investment Cast Products, Forged Products, Fastener Products and Industrial Products. Operating income amounts discussed below exclude restructuring and asset impairment charges. % Change Fiscal Year 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 2005 2004 2003 Net sales Investment Cast Products $ 1,360.6 $ 1,042.8 $ 1,071.3 30 % (3 )% Forged Products 631.7 502.4 566.9 26 (11 ) Fastener Products 691.3 181.3 281 n/a Industrial Products 235.4 186.6 170.3 26 10 Consolidated net sales $ 2,919.0 $ 1,913.1 $ 1,808.5 53 % 6 % Operating income Investment Cast Products $ 256.0 $ 190.4 $ 210.7 34 % (10 )% % of sales 19% 18% 20% Forged Products 76.1 64.7 81.5 18 (21 ) % of sales 12% 13% 14% Fastener Products 88.3 13.5 554 n/a % of sales 13% 7% Industrial Products 42.5 32.5 25.3 31 28 % of sales 18% 17% 15% Corporate expense (42.6 ) (26.9 ) (27.9 ) (58 ) (4 ) Operating income 420.3 274.2 289.6 53 % (5 )% % of sales 14% 14% 16% Provision for restructuring 0.1 8.7 19.7 Impairment of long lived assets 1.5 2.2 Other expense (income) 11.2 (14.5 ) Interest expense, net 56.6 53.3 55.5 Consolidated income before income taxes and minority interest $ 362.1 $ 198.8 $ 228.9 14 Precision Castparts Corp. & Subsidiaries Investment Cast Products The Investment Cast Products segment includes PCC Structurals, PCC Airfoils, and the Specialty Materials and Alloys Group ("SMAG"), which was acquired with SPS in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. These businesses manufacture investment castings, or provide materials and alloys, for aircraft engines, industrial gas turbine (IGT) engines, airframes, armaments, medical prostheses and other industrial applications. % Change Fiscal Year 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 2005 2004 2003 Sales by Market Aerospace $ 847.7 $ 722.7 $ 716.9 17 % 1 % % of total 62% 69% 67% Power Generation 333.0 233.0 297.5 43 (22 ) % of total 24% 22% 28% Automotive 9.7 7.1 2.7 37 163 % of total 1% 1% 0% General Industrial & Other 170.2 80.0 54.2 113 48 % of total 13% 8% 5% Total Sales $ 1,360.6 $ 1,042.8 $ 1,071.3 30 % (3 )% % of total 100% 100% 100% Operating income $ 256.0 $ 190.4 $ 210.7 34 % (10 )% % of sales 19% 18% 20% Fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 The Investment Cast Products segment reported fiscal 2005 sales of $1,360.6 million and operating income of $256.0 million, or 19 percent of sales. Fiscal 2005 sales increased 30 percent from the prior years sales of $1,042.8 million, and operating income increased by 34 percent over the prior years operating income of $190.4 million, or 18 percent of sales. The SMAG businesses contributed a full year of results in fiscal 2005 compared to 17 weeks in fiscal 2004. The increase in sales of the base businesses was driven by continued recovery in the power generation and aerospace markets, with solid aftermarket growth as well as market share gains. The increase in operating income principally reflected the impact of the higher sales volume and operating improvements, partially offset by lower selling prices and higher raw material costs, mainly nickel and cobalt, which have increased approximately 25 percent and 40 percent, respectively, on the London Metal Exchange (LME) and Metal Bulletin COFM.8 Index (Bloomberg) compared to fiscal 2004. The improvement in operating margins as a percentage of sales was mainly due to the leverage from the higher sales volume and improved manufacturing performance, partially offset by the impact of lower selling prices, higher raw material costs and pass through pricing. The Investment Cast Products segment anticipates higher sales associated with the Aerospace and Power Generation markets in fiscal 2006. Operating margins, as a percent of sales, are expected to improve in fiscal 2006 as a result of leverage from the higher sales volume and continued improvements in operating efficiencies, partially offset by the impact of pass through pricing. Fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 The Investment Cast Products segment reported fiscal 2004 sales of $1,042.8 million and operating income of $190.4 million, or 18 percent of sales. Fiscal 2004 sales decreased 3 percent from the prior years $1,071.3 million, and operating income decreased by 10 percent over the prior years $210.7 million, or 20 percent of sales. The addition of SPS SMAG businesses in December 2003 contributed $40.4 million of sales and $6.4 million of operating income, or 16 percent of sales, to fiscal 2004 results. The overall sales decline compared to fiscal 2003 was due to continued weakness in both the aerospace and power generation markets, combined with the impact of price reductions. Despite the sales decline and higher raw material costs compared to fiscal 2003, the Investment Cast Products segment was able to achieve solid operating margins due to continued aggressive cost takeout throughout its operations and improvements in manufacturing performance. Forged Products The Forged Products segment consists of the forging operations of Wyman Gordon. Forged Products sales to the aerospace and power generation markets are derived primarily from the same large engine customers served by the Investment Cast Products segment, with additional aerospace sales going to manufacturers of landing gear and other airframe components. The Forged Products segment also produces seamless pipe for the power generation and the oil and gas industries. % Change Fiscal Year 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 2005 2004 2003 Sales by Market Aerospace $ 439.0 $ 367.8 $ 395.6 19 % (7 )% % of total 70% 73% 70% Power Generation 166.9 90.0 119.0 85 (24 ) % of total 26% 18% 21% Automotive 2.6 0.1 9.9 2500 (99 ) % of total 0% 0% 2% General Industrial & Other 23.2 44.5 42.4 (48 ) 5 % of total 4% 9% 7% Total Sales $ 631.7 $ 502.4 $ 566.9 26 % (11 )% % of total 100% 100% 100% Operating income $ 76.1 $ 64.7 $ 81.5 18 % (21 )% % of sales 12% 13% 14% Fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 The Forged Products segment reported fiscal 2005 sales of $631.7 million and operating income of $76.1 million, or 12 percent of sales. Fiscal 2005 sales increased 26 percent from the prior years sales of $502.4 million, and operating income increased by 18 percent over the prior years operating income of $64.7 million, or 13 percent of sales. The increase in sales includes approximately $18.8 million of higher prices related to pass through of increased nickel costs. The volume increase was due to heavy demand for aerospace components as well as continued demand for seamless pipe to the power generation market in China. Operating income as a percent of sales benefited in the current year from the higher volume, but was lower than last year due to higher material costs, mainly nickel and titanium, which have increased approximately 25 percent and 135 percent, respectively, on the LME (Bloomberg) and TI 6 4 Bulk Weldables Index (metalprices.com) since fiscal 2004. Sales in fiscal 2006 within this segment are expected to benefit from continued growth in the aerospace market and continued growth in extruded pipe sales, as well as recovery in the industrial gas turbine market. Operating income is expected to benefit from the higher sales volume and the favorable impact of contract terms that allow for pass through pricing of higher material costs. While these recoveries will increase segment revenues and protect Precision Castparts Corp. & Subsidiaries 15 operating income, they will have a dampening effect on related improvements in operating income as a percentage of sales. Fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 The Forged Products segment reported sales of $502.4 million for fiscal 2004, a decrease of $64.5 million, with operating income of $64.7 million, or 13 percent of sales, a decrease of $16.8 million from the fiscal 2003 level of $81.5 million, or 14 percent of sales. The sales decline was due to reduced demand for commercial aerospace products as well as products for the power generation market, partially offset by increased demand for military aerospace products. Operating margins within this segment are significantly impacted by the deleveraging effect of the sales decline due to the capital intensive nature of the forging business. Higher raw material costs, as well as price concessions, also reduced operating margins. Cost reductions and benefits from settlement of a supply agreement between Wyman Gordon and Timet helped to partially offset the impact of these items. Fastener Products The Fastener Products segment includes SPS former Aerospace Fasteners and Engineered Fasteners groups that were acquired in December 2003. The businesses that comprise this segment produce fasteners, fastener systems and components for critical applications in the aerospace, automotive and industrial machinery markets. % Change Fiscal Year 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 2005 2004 2003 Sales by Market Aerospace $ 316.4 $ 87.6 $ 261 % n/a % % of total 46% 48% Power Generation 2.7 1.4 93 n/a % of total 0% 1% Automotive 215.6 54.6 295 n/a % of total 31% 30% General Industrial & Other 156.6 37.7 315 n/a % of total 23% 21% Total Sales $ 691.3 $ 181.3 $ 281 % n/a % % of total 100% 100% Operating income $ 88.3 $ 13.5 $ 554 % n/a % % of sales 13% 7% Fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 The Fastener Products segment reported fiscal 2005 sales of $691.3 million and operating income of $88.3 million, or 13 percent of sales. Fiscal 2005 sales increased $510.0 million from the prior years sales of $181.3 million, and operating income increased $74.8 million over the prior years operating income of $13.5 million, or 7 percent of sales. Fiscal 2004 included approximately 17 weeks of activity since PCC acquired SPS on December 9, 2003. The segment was favorably affected by strong aerospace sales and continues to benefit from market share gains at major aerospace customers. Cost take outs and stream lined manufacturing processes have significantly improved operating margins as a percent of sales since the acquisition of SPS. Sales within the Fastener Products segment will continue to grow during fiscal 2006 as a result of improving conditions in the aerospace industry, market share gains and a full year of sales from AIC. Operating income as a percentage of sales should also improve due to continuing realization of synergies, cost take outs and leverage from higher sales. Fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 The Fastener Products segment recorded sales of $181.3 million of sales and operating income of $13.5 million, or 7 percent of sales, for the year, which included approximately 17 weeks of activity since PCC acquired SPS on December 9, 2003. Since its acquisition, the Fastener Products segment has rapidly achieved cost reductions and synergies, while also increasing market share in airframe and aircraft engine sectors and opening up share gain opportunities with major automotive customers. Industrial Products The Industrial Products segment includes J&L Fiber Services, Advanced Forming Technology (AFT), E/One and the Precision Tool Group. J&L Fiber Services produces refiner plates and screen cylinders for use in the pulp and paper industry and rebuilds refiner equipment that is used in the pulping process.

The sales increase reflects the addition of sales from SPS Precision Tool Group, market share gains in the automotive industry, and improved conditions in the aerospace and pulp and paper markets. Operating margins, as a percent of sales, benefited from the higher volume, coupled with increased production at low cost manufacturing facilities in Hungary and India, partially offset by the impact of adding the SPS businesses, which have lower operating margins. In fiscal 2006, sales within this segment should continue to benefit from the consolidation of the Reed Rico and the SPS tool businesses, which will increase PCCs worldwide share of the fastener tooling market. Operating margins are also expected to increase as a result of improved cost structures and leverage from higher volume. 16 Precision Castparts Corp. & Subsidiaries Fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 The Industrial Products segments sales increased by 10 percent, from $170.3 million in fiscal 2003 to $186.6 million in fiscal 2004, and its operating income increased from $25.3 million, or 15 percent of sales, to $32.5 million, or 17 percent of sales. The increase in sales was due to the addition of SPS tool group, which contributed $9.4 million of sales, as well as improved market conditions in the automotive sector. Operating margins benefited from the higher volume, coupled with new product introductions, increased productivity and successful ramp up of production at low cost manufacturing facilities in Hungary and India, partially offset by the impact of adding the SPS businesses, which have lower margins. Interest and taxes Net interest expense in fiscal 2005 was $56.6 million, as compared with $53.3 million in fiscal 2004. The higher interest expense resulted from higher average debt levels and higher effective borrowing rates during fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 was 33 percent, compared with 35 percent in fiscal 2004. The lower tax rate in fiscal 2005 is principally due to recognition of $4.0 million of tax benefits related to the write off of intercompany loans and due to increased earnings in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. Liquidity and capital resources Total assets of $3,625.0 million at April 3, 2005, represented a $130.5 million decrease from the $3,755.5 million balance at March 28, 2004, reflecting the write off of the pumps and valves businesses, partially offset by the acquisition of AIC, higher inventory and accounts receivable balances to support improved business conditions and higher cash balances. Total capitalization at April 3, 2005, was $2,623.4 million, consisting of $843.0 million of debt and $1,780.4 million of equity. The debt to capital ratio decreased from 38.6% at the end of fiscal 2004 to 32.1% at April 3, 2005. Cash requirements for the year included debt payments of $230.3 million, including $200.0 million for the repayment of the Companys 8.75 percent public note due in March 2005, $190.7 million for the acquisition of AIC, $93.4 million of pension contributions ($60.0 million were voluntary), $61.7 million for capital expenditures, $7.7 million for dividends and $10.9 million for discontinued operations. These requirements were funded by $239.5 million of net income from continuing operations adjusted for $97.0 million of depreciation and amortization, $23.7 million of deferred income taxes, $59.9 million for decreased working capital, $164.2 million of proceeds from the sale of the pumps and valves businesses of PCC Flow Technologies and the Magnetics business, $41.2 million from the sale of common stock through ESPP purchases and stock option exercises, and $42.8 million from other activities. The ending cash balance at April 3, 2005 was $153.9 million, up $73.6 million from the fiscal 2004 ending balance. Capital spending of $61.7 million in fiscal 2005 principally provided for equipment maintenance and upgrades, capacity expansion and cost reduction projects. The capital spending plan for fiscal 2006, which is approximately $50.0 million higher than spending in fiscal 2005, provides for cost reduction, capacity expansion, equipment maintenance and upgrades, and safety projects throughout the company. Management believes that the Company can fund requirements for working capital, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, capital spending, cash dividends, scheduled repayment of debt and potential acquisitions from cash generated from operations, borrowing from existing or new bank credit facilities, issuance of public or privately placed debt securities, or the issuance of equity instruments. Contractual obligations and commercial commitments The Company is obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements and lease agreements. The following table represents the Companys contractual cash obligations as of April 3, 2005 (in millions) and the estimated timing of future cash payments: Contractual Cash Obligations Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Long term debt $ 837.0 $ 38.3 $ 41.2 $ 205.8 $ 252.8 $ 55.2 $ 243.7 Operating leases 86.0 20.4 21.0 12.4 10.2 6.8 15.2 Interest on fixed rate debt 157.4 29.6 28.5 25.1 16.4 14.3 43.5 Interest on variable rate debt(1) 53.5 15.5 14.8 13.4 8.9 0.6 0.3 Total $ 1,133.9 $ 103.8 $ 105.5 $ 256.7 $ 288.3 $ 76.9 $ 302.7 (1) Interest on variable rate debt is based on current prevailing interest rates. The table above excludes estimated required cash contributions to the Companys qualified pension plans totaling approximately $89.5 million over the next five years: $15.2 million in fiscal 2006, $12.0 million in fiscal 2007, $15.4 million in fiscal 2008, $24.1 million in fiscal 2009 and $22.8 million in fiscal 2010. The Company also has benefit payments due under its non qualified pension and other post retirement benefit plans that are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See the pension and other postretirement benefit plans footnote to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Critical accounting policies The Company has identified the policies below as critical to PCCs business operations and the understanding of its results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on PCCs business operations are discussed throughout the Managements Discussion and Analysis where such policies affect reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other significant accounting policies, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report. Note that the preparation of this Annual Report requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Revenue recognition The Company recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete. This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the contract or purchase order, ownership and risk of loss have passed to the customer, Precision Castparts Corp. & Subsidiaries 17 collectibility is reasonably assured, and pricing is fixed and determinable. In instances where title does not pass to the customer upon shipment, the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery or customer acceptance, depending on terms of the sales agreement. Service sales, representing aftermarket repair and maintenance and engineering activities, are recognized as services are performed. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in revenue. Accounts receivable reserve The Company evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where PCC is aware of a customers inability to meet its financial obligations (e.g., bankruptcy filings), a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due is recorded to reduce the receivable to the amount the Company reasonably expects will be collected. In addition, the Company records reserves for bad debts based on other quantitative measures, which include the analysis of historical write offs and the age of outstanding receivables. The establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances. Although the Company considers these balances adequate and proper, changes in economic conditions in the markets in which the Company operates could have a material effect on the required reserve balances. Valuation of inventories All inventories are stated at the lower of the cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. Cost for work in process and metal inventories at a significant number of the Companys operations is determined on a last in, first out ("LIFO") basis. The average inventory cost method is utilized for most other inventories. The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess or obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required. Therefore, although management makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of forecast demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of PCCs inventories and reported operating results. Goodwill and acquired intangibles From time to time, the Company acquires businesses in purchase transactions that typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets, which may affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges. The determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the consolidated financial statements. Recently issued accounting standards In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 151, "Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4." SFAS No. 151 clarifies that abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) are required to be recognized as current period charges. The provisions of SFAS No. 151 are effective for our fiscal year beginning April 3, 2006. The Company does not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In December 2004, the FASB finalized SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) ("123R), "Share Based Payment." SFAS No. 123R requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements, with the cost measured based on the estimated fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. SFAS No. 123R allows for either prospective recognition of compensation expense or retrospective recognition, which may be back to the original issuance of SFAS No. 123 or in the year of adoption. The effective date of SFAS No. 123R is the first quarter of the first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005, which is PCCs first quarter of fiscal 2007. PCC is currently evaluating these transition methods and the methodology to be used when adopting this statement. See "Stock based compensation" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 109 1 (FSP 109 1) and 109 2 (FSP 109 2). FSP 109 1 provides guidance on the application of SFAS 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes", with regard to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provision within H.R. 4520 The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Act) that was enacted on October 22, 2004. FSP 109 2 provides guidance on a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to qualifying U.S. taxpayers. The Act contains numerous provisions related to corporate and international taxation including repeal of the Extraterritorial Income (ETI) regime, creation of a new Domestic Production Activities (DPA) deduction and a temporary dividends received deduction related to repatriation of foreign earnings. The Act contains various effective dates and transition periods related to its provisions. Under the guidance provided in FSP 109 1 the new DPA deduction will be treated as a "special deduction" as described in SFAS 109. As such, the special deduction has no effect on the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the enactment date. Rather, the impact of this deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on our income tax return. The repeal of ETI is transitioned in, effective with sales after January 1, 2005. The impact of this change was not material on our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2005. The replacement with a DPA deduction was not in effect for PCC fiscal year ended April 3, 2005 and therefore, did not affect our income tax provision for the year ended April 3, 2005. We do not expect the net effect of the phase out of the ETI deduction and phase in of the new DPA deduction to result in a material impact on our effective income tax rate in fiscal 2006. Under the guidance provided by FSP 109 2, the Financial Accounting Standards Board acknowledged that, due to the proximity of the Acts enactment date to many companies year ends and the fact that numerous provisions within the Act are complex and pending further regulatory guidance, many companies may not be in a position to assess the impact of the Act on their plans for repatriation or reinvestment of foreign earnings. Therefore, the FSP provided companies with a practical exception to the permanent reinvestment standards of SFAS 109 and APB No. 23 by providing additional time to determine the amount of earnings, if any, that they intend to repatriate under the Acts provisions. The company is not yet in a position to decide whether, and to what extent, foreign earnings may be repatriated to the U.S. Therefore, under the guidance provided in FSP 109 2, no deferred tax liability has been recorded in connection with the repatriation provisions of 18 Precision Castparts Corp. & Subsidiaries the Act. We are currently analyzing the impact of the temporary dividends received deduction provisions contained in the Act. Forward looking statements Information included within this Form 10K describing the projected growth and future results and events constitutes forward looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results in future periods may differ materially from the forward looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to fluctuations in the aerospace, power generation, automotive, and other general industrial cycles; the relative success of the Companys entry into new markets; competitive pricing; the financial viability of the Companys significant customers; the availability and cost of energy, materials, supplies, and insurance, the cost of pension and postretirement medical benefits; equipment failures; relations with the Companys employees; the Companys ability to manage its operating costs and to integrate acquired businesses in an effective manner; governmental regulations and environmental matters; risks associated with international operations and world economies; the relative stability of certain foreign currencies; and implementation of new technologies and process improvements. Any forward looking statements should be considered in light of these factors. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release any forward looking information to reflect anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of this document.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK At various times, the Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and prices of strategic raw materials. Fluctuations in the market values of such derivative instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the underlying economic exposures that the instruments are intended to hedge. Because derivative instruments are used solely as hedges and not for speculative trading purposes, they do not represent incremental risk to the Company. For further discussion of derivative financial instruments, refer to the "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," "Fair Value of Financial Instruments" and "Financing Arrangements" sections in "Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements." Interest Rate Risk The Company has variable rate debt obligations that expose the Company to interest rate risk. During the third quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company terminated an interest rate swap that fixed the interest rate on a portion of the outstanding borrowings under its terminated bank credit facility. If market interest rates had averaged 10 percent higher than actual levels in fiscal 2005 or 2004, the effect on the Companys interest expense and net income, after considering the effects of the interest rate swap contracts and interest rate cap, would not have been material. Foreign Currency Risk The majority of the Companys revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars; however, the Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies for transactions denominated in other currencies. As discussed in the "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company had foreign currency hedges in place at April 3, 2005 and March 28, 2004 to reduce such exposure. The potential loss in fair value on such financial instruments from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would not have been material to the financial position of the Company as of the end of fiscal 2005 or fiscal 2004. Material Cost Risk As discussed in the "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company had entered into long term supply agreements to fix the purchase price of strategic raw materials at April 3, 2005 and March 28, 2004. In addition, PCC had escalation clauses related to raw material pricing in certain of the Companys contracts at April 3, 2005 and March 28, 2004. If market rates had averaged 10 percent higher than actual levels in either fiscal 2005 or 2004, the effect on the Companys cost of sales and net earnings, after considering the effects of these agreements and contracts, would not have been material.
