ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Business overview Precision Castparts Corp. (PCC or the Company) completed another successful year in fiscal 2006, attaining record levels of sales, operating income, net income and earnings per share. These results reflected continuing strong conditions in the Companys core aerospace and power generation markets, which were driven by increased OEM build rates, significant market share gains and strong aftermarket sales. The Company also benefited from continuing cost reductions and operational improvements across most of its businesses. During the year, the Company executed on key acquisition strategies to strengthen its market positions and achieve profitable growth well into the future. In the Fastener Products segment, aerospace operations were bolstered by a full year of sales from Air Industries Corporation (AIC), which was acquired in late March 2005, and from the acquisition of the Shur Lok Group in January 2006. These companies greatly expanded the manufacturing capabilities and range of products that the Fastener Products segment offers to its commercial airframe customers, and they helped to counteract the impact of sluggish conditions in the automotive sector by propelling the segment to operating margins in excess of 17 percent for the year. In May 2006, approximately two months into fiscal 2007, the Company received the necessary regulatory approvals and was able to complete the acquisition of Special Metals Corporation (SMC), a world leader in the production of high performance nickel based alloys and super alloys. With annual sales in excess of $1.0 billion, SMC will provide the Company with near term and long term opportunities for profitable growth and significant value creation. As with past acquisitions, PCC will aggressively drive operational efficiencies through SMC with the same vigor and intensity that it gives to its current businesses. In addition to growth coming from the acquisition of SMC, the Company expects OEM build rates will continue to increase in both the aerospace and power generation markets during fiscal 2007, combined with continued market share gains and strong aftermarket sales. PCC has positioned itself on the right platforms, and is currently developing products for new generation aircraft programs, such as the Airbus A380, the Boeing 787, and the JSF and F 22 military aircraft, and expect to have similar opportunities on projects like the Airbus A350. To handle the additional demand for aerospace products, the Company plans to increase manufacturing capacity during fiscal 2007. In addition, the Company expects sales of seamless extruded pipe will increase greater than 15 percent in fiscal 2007, principally driven by increasing demand from the growing power generation market in Asia. PCC believes there continues to be abundant opportunities for further cost reductions and operational efficiencies in every one of its businesses. The realization of these cost improvements, combined with leverage from increasing sales volume, will drive expected margin improvements and value creation in fiscal 2007. 23 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2006 2005 Change % Change Net sales $ 3,546.4 $ 2,919.0 $ 627.4 21 % Cost of goods sold 2,739.1 2,265.4 473.7 21 Selling and administrative expenses 250.7 233.3 17.4 7 Restructuring and impairment 2.3 1.6 0.7 44 Interest expense, net 41.4 56.6 (15.2 ) (27 ) Income before income tax and minority interest 512.9 362.1 150.8 42 Income tax expense 162.2 121.3 40.9 34 Minority interest (1.6 ) (1.3 ) (0.3 ) 23 Net income from continuing operations 349.1 239.5 109.6 46 Net income (loss) from discontinued operations 1.5 (241.2 ) 242.7 101 Net income (loss) $ 350.6 $ (1.7 ) $ 352.3 20,724 % Net income per share from continuing operations (basic) $ 2.62 $ 1.83 $ 0.79 43 % Net income (loss) per share from discontinued operations (basic) 0.01 (1.84 ) 1.85 101 Net income (loss) per share (basic) $ 2.63 $ (0.01 ) $ 2.64 26,400 % Net income per share from continuing operations (diluted) $ 2.57 $ 1.80 $ 0.77 43 % Net income (loss) per share from discontinued operations (diluted) 0.01 (1.81 ) 1.82 101 Net income (loss) per share (diluted) $ 2.58 $ (0.01 ) $ 2.59 25,900 % Fiscal Year Sales by Market 2006 2005 Change % Change Aerospace $ 2,094.3 $ 1,609.8 $ 484.5 30 % % of total 59 % 55 % Power Generation 641.3 510.1 131.2 26 % of total 18 % 18 % Automotive 281.0 275.6 5.4 2 % of total 8 % 9 % General Industrial and Other 529.8 523.5 6.3 1 % of total 15 % 18 % Total Sales $ 3,546.4 $ 2,919.0 $ 627.4 21 % % of total 100 % 100 % Total sales for fiscal 2006 were $3,546.4 million, an increase of $627.4 million, or 21 percent from fiscal 2005 sales of $2,919.0 million. Total aerospace sales increased 30 percent over fiscal 2005 levels, and increased from 55 percent of total sales in fiscal 2005 to 59 percent of total sales in fiscal 2006. Power generation sales increased 26 percent over fiscal 2005 levels, and remained at 18 percent of total sales in fiscal 2006. Sales to the automotive market grew by 2 percent and sales to the general industrial and other markets increased 1 percent. The increase in sales was principally driven by improving conditions in the aerospace and power generation markets, as well as the impact of material pass through pricing, which increased sales by approximately $210 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $75 million in fiscal 2005. The addition of Air Industries Corp. (AIC), which was acquired late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, and the Shur Lok Group, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, also contributed to the sales increase. According to JSA Research, as of December 2005, commercial aircraft deliveries were forecasted to increase approximately 10 percent in calendar year 2005 from calendar year 2004 and are forecast to continue to increase approximately 21 percent in calendar year 24 Table of Contents 2006. Because of manufacturing lead times required to support aircraft deliveries, PCC began realizing these calendar 2006 forecasted increases during the first half of fiscal 2006. In addition, continued growth in the seamless pipe market contributed to increased sales in the Forged Products segment. Cost of goods sold was $2,739.1 million, or 77 percent of sales, in fiscal 2006 as compared to $2,265.4 million, or 78 percent of sales, in fiscal 2005. The improvement in the year over year percentage reflects the impact of leverage from higher sales volume and improved operating efficiencies, partially offset by increased raw material costs and lower sales prices in fiscal 2006. Selling and administrative expenses were $250.7 million, or 7 percent of sales, in fiscal 2006 compared to $233.3 million, or 8 percent of sales, in fiscal 2005. The improved year over year percentage was primarily due to the leverage from the higher sales volume. Net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 was $349.1 million, or $2.57 per share (diluted), which included restructuring and asset impairment charges totaling $0.02 per share (diluted). By comparison, net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2005 was $239.5 million, or $1.80 per share (diluted), which included restructuring and impairment charges totaling $0.01 per share (diluted). Fiscal 2006 net income after discontinued operations was $350.6 million, or $2.58 per share (diluted), compared with a net loss of $1.7 million, or $0.01 per share (diluted) in fiscal 2005. The fiscal 2005 net loss includes charges totaling $248.0 million, or $1.86 per share (diluted), related to the Companys decision to sell the pumps and valves businesses. Business acquisitions Fiscal 2006 On January 6, 2006, PCC completed the acquisition of the Shur Lok Group, which includes the Shur Lok Corporation in Irvine, California, and Shur Lok International located in Petit Rechain, Belgium, for approximately $113.0 million in cash. Shur Lok is a leading manufacturer of highly engineered, critical aerospace fasteners, including inserts, barrel nuts, adjustable diameter bolts, fluid fittings and lock nuts. The Shur Lok product line significantly enhances the basket of fastener products the Company can offer to its commercial airframe customers, while increasing market reach into other critical fastener applications. Shur Lok operates as part of the Fastener Products segment. Fiscal 2005 On March 8, 2005, PCC acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of Air Industries Corporation (AIC) for approximately $198.3 million paid in cash. AIC is a leading manufacturer of airframe fasteners, which include bolts, pins, and screws made from titanium and nickel based alloys. This acquisition is expected to significantly enhance PCCs presence in the aerospace fastener market by expanding the range of fastener products offered to PCCs aerospace customers. AIC operates as part of the Fastener Products segment. Fiscal 2004 On December 9, 2003, PCC acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of SPS Technologies, Inc. SPS was acquired to strengthen and build upon the Companys core businesses, technologies and customer relationships. In addition, SPS complementary manufacturing processes provide the Company with opportunities to enhance efficiencies and reduce costs. The aggregate purchase price was $728.8 million, which included $294.2 million of cash, PCC common stock valued at $425.1 million and $9.5 million of cash paid for transaction fees. In addition, SPS paid $39.3 million for change of control payments and transaction fees as of the close of the transaction. The value of the 9.3 million shares of PCC common stock issued in connection with the acquisition was determined based on the quoted market price of PCCs common stock on and around the date of the close of the transaction. 25 Table of Contents SPS is a supplier of fasteners and other metal products to the aerospace, automotive, and general industrial markets. SPS former Specialty Materials and Alloys group now operates as part of the Investment Cast Products segment. A new segment, Fastener Products, was established and comprises SPS former Aerospace Fasteners and Engineered Fasteners groups. SPS former tool group now operates as part of the Industrial Products segment. In addition, three former SPS businesses Dacar, which was sold in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, Magnetics, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and Mohawk, which was sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 were classified as held for sale in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, and their results were included in discontinued operations until their disposition. Discontinued operations The Companys financial statements were significantly impacted by activities relating to the planned divestiture of a number of PCCs businesses. These businesses have been accounted for under SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. Accordingly, any operating results of these businesses are presented in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations as discontinued operations, net of income tax, and all prior periods have been reclassified. Fiscal 2005 In the second quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company made the decision to sell all of the pumps and valves businesses of PCC Flow Technologies, with the exception of E/One and PCC Eurovalves. The businesses held for sale were reclassified from the Fluid Management Products segment to discontinued operations. The E/One business was retained and is now included in the Industrial Products segment. The sale of the pumps and valves businesses of PCC Flow Technologies was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, and PCC Eurovalves, which is located in The Netherlands, was sold in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. PCCs decision to sell the pumps and valves businesses in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 resulted in a charge of $245.0 million, of which $219.1 million was associated with the write down of goodwill. The remainder of the charge related to the write down of inventory, other amortizable assets and machinery and equipment to fair value less cost to sell. Approximately $240.0 million of the charge was non cash. Subsequent to the second quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company recorded additional write downs related to the disposition of the pumps and valves businesses, bringing the total net loss on disposal to $247.7 million through April 2, 2006. Fiscal 2004 In the third quarter of fiscal 2004, three businesses acquired in the SPS transaction Magnetics, Mohawk, and Dacar were classified as held for sale and their results were included in discontinued operations. They were classified as discontinued operations because they were deemed to be non core to the Company. Dacar was sold in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, Magnetics was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, and Mohawk was sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. In the second quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company incurred asset impairment and disposal charges associated with its decision to sell Newmans, a valve distribution company of PCC Flow Technologies. It was determined that Newmans distribution business did not fit with PCCs manufacturing focused operations and was not performing to the Companys expectations. The Companys decision to sell Newmans resulted in a charge of $19.2 million, principally related to the write down of assets to net realizable value. The Newmans business was sold in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. 26 Table of Contents Restructuring, asset impairment and other non recurring charges The following table provides significant components of amounts recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations related to the Companys restructuring and asset impairment charges. Fiscal 2006 2005 2004 Provision for restructuring: Severance $ 0.6 $ $ 8.2 Other 0.1 1.4 Impairment of long lived assets 1.7 1.5 1.3 Total $ 2.3 $ 1.6 $ 10.9 Fiscal 2006 During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, PCC recorded restructuring and asset impairment charges of $2.3 million, which included $1.7 million primarily due to the write down of a building and equipment to fair value related to consolidation of a machining operation in the Investment Cast Products segment and $0.6 million for severance costs associated with headcount reductions related to downsizing the Companys tooling operation in Ireland. The tax effected impact of these charges was $1.9 million, or $0.02 per share (diluted). Taking into consideration current and forecasted conditions in markets served by the Company, PCC regularly assesses its cost structure to ensure that operations are properly sized for prevailing market conditions. Based on the Companys most recent assessment, there are no current plans to restructure operations in fiscal 2007. Other expense Other expense of $11.2 million was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 to reflect the write off of unamortized bank fees ($2.8 million) from early termination of bank credit facilities and the termination of an interest rate swap ($8.4 million) associated with debt refinancing, both in connection with the SPS acquisition. Special investigation In September and October 2005, the Company received three related reports with respect to concerns about employee misconduct and the proper application of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to certain transactions at the Wyman Gordon Forgings Houston plant, a business unit reported in the Forged Products segment. The matters identified in the reports were referred to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (Audit Committee). The Audit Committee, after due consideration, decided to commence an independent investigation. In November 2005, the Audit Committee expanded the scope of the investigation to review two similar but unrelated reports alleging employee misconduct and improper application of GAAP at J&L Fiber Services, Inc., a business unit reported in the Industrial Products segment. In February 2006, the Audit Committee completed its independent investigation and determined that the Company accounted for certain transactions incorrectly at both identified locations, as described below: The investigation at Wyman Gordon Forgings Houston identified errors in the Companys financial statements from fiscal 2001 through the first quarter of fiscal 2006. These errors, which totaled $1.8 million, represented a net overstatement of expenses through the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The errors 27 Table of Contents primarily related to the failure to properly reconcile accounts and the misapplication of GAAP and Company accounting policies. There were also timing errors related to the improper recognition of revenue within fiscal 2005 of $0.2 million and between the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and the first quarter of fiscal 2006 of $0.2 million. The identified errors resulted from both deliberate and inadvertent acts involving non executive employees. The investigation at J&L Fiber Services, Inc. identified errors in the Companys financial statements from fiscal 2003 through the first quarter of fiscal 2006. These errors, which totaled $5.6 million, represented a net understatement of expenses through the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The errors primarily related to the overstatement of inventories resulting from the failure to properly record excess and obsolete reserves and inadequate cycle counting procedures, the failure to properly reconcile accounts, and the misapplication of GAAP and Company accounting policies, which included improper deferral of expenses. The identified errors resulted from both deliberate and inadvertent acts involving non executive employees. The Companys management concluded, with the concurrence of the Audit Committee, that the impact of these errors was not material to the Companys consolidated financial statements for any interim or annual period in which the errors were found. In reaching this conclusion, the Company reviewed and analyzed the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 99, Materiality, Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 28, Interim Financial Reporting, paragraph 29 and SAB Topic 5F, Accounting Changes Not Retroactively Applied Due to Immateriality, in order to determine that the misstatements were not material on a quantitative or qualitative basis. As a result, the Company recorded a cumulative adjustment in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. The net impact of these corrections was a decrease to pre tax income and net income of $3.8 million and $1.9 million or $0.01 per share (diluted), respectively, in fiscal 2006. The Company took immediate action to address the cause of these errors, including termination of certain individuals, the development of improved policies and procedures, and enhancement of internal controls. In addition, high level reviews at nine additional locations were performed as part of the independent investigation. The findings did not result in identification of any issues that required further investigation. Management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of its internal controls in relation to these findings. Based on managements review and analysis, it was concluded that the control deficiencies that resulted in the errors to the prior period financial statements discussed above were not independently material weaknesses and that when aggregated with other deficiencies also did not constitute a material weakness in the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Outlook The Company expects that the aerospace and power generation markets will continue to strengthen in fiscal 2007 as commercial aircraft build rates and large frame OEM industrial gas turbine deliveries increase. The momentum in aftermarket demand and market share gains is also expected to continue. With the acquisition of SMC, PCC expects some shift in its product mix, with approximately 54 percent of sales going to the aerospace market (versus 59 percent last year) and approximately 23 percent of sales going to general industrial markets (versus 15 percent last year). PCCs base general industrial markets are also expected to grow due to increases in non aerospace military programs such as the howitzer armament program and other land and marine based ordnance programs. Overall, base business sales are expected to approximate market growth for the aerospace, power generation and automotive markets, and approximate GDP for other markets. The acquisition of SMC is expected to increase fiscal 2007 sales by more than 25 percent over fiscal 2006 levels. 28 Table of Contents Operating earnings are expected to benefit from the sales volume increases from the base businesses, continued operating improvements, and 10 months of sales from SMC. Operating margins of the Companys base business, as a percent of sales, is also expected to show improvement over fiscal 2006 levels principally due to leverage from higher sales volume and improved operating performance, partially offset by the dilutive impact of increased material pass through pricing and the impact of expensing stock options. Operating margins will also be diluted by the addition of SMC, which has lower operating margins than the Companys base business. Financial results by segment PCC has organized the Companys business segments along its four major product lines and reports financial results in the following four segments: Investment Cast Products, Forged Products, Fastener Products and Industrial Products. Operating income amounts discussed below exclude restructuring and asset impairment charges and other expense. Fiscal Year % Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 Net sales Investment Cast Products $ 1,609.4 $ 1,360.6 $ 1,042.8 18 % 30 % Forged Products 879.4 631.7 502.4 39 26 Fastener Products 828.0 691.3 181.3 20 281 Industrial Products 229.6 235.4 186.6 (2 ) 26 Consolidated net sales $ 3,546.4 $ 2,919.0 $ 1,913.1 21 % 53 % Segment operating income Investment Cast Products $ 321.9 $ 256.0 $ 190.4 26 % 34 % % of sales 20 % 19 % 18 % Forged Products 108.1 76.1 64.7 42 18 % of sales 12 % 12 % 13 % Fastener Products 144.3 88.3 13.5 63 554 % of sales 17 % 13 % 7 % Industrial Products 31.3 42.5 32.5 (26 ) 31 % of sales 14 % 18 % 17 % Corporate expense (49.0 ) (42.6 ) (26.9 ) (15 ) (58 ) Total segment operating income 556.6 420.3 274.2 32 % 53 % % of sales 16 % 14 % 14 % Provision for restructuring and impairment 2.3 1.6 10.9 Other expense 11.2 Interest expense, net 41.4 56.6 53.3 Consolidated income before income taxes and minority interest $ 512.9 $ 362.1 $ 198.8 29 Table of Contents Investment Cast Products The Investment Cast Products segment includes PCC Structurals, PCC Airfoils and the Specialty Materials and Alloys Group (SMAG), which was acquired with SPS in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. These businesses manufacture investment castings, or provide related investment casting materials and alloys, for aircraft engines, industrial gas turbine (IGT) engines, airframes, armaments, medical prostheses and other industrial applications. Fiscal Year % Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 Sales by Market Aerospace $ 1,023.4 $ 847.7 $ 722.7 21 % 17 % % of total 64 % 62 % 69 % Power Generation 371.8 333.0 233.0 12 43 % of total 23 % 24 % 22 % Automotive 18.1 9.7 7.1 87 37 % of total 1 % 1 % 1 % General Industrial & Other 196.1 170.2 80.0 15 113 % of total 12 % 13 % 8 % Total Sales $ 1,609.4 $ 1,360.6 $ 1,042.8 18 % 30 % % of total 100 % 100 % 100 % Operating income $ 321.9 $ 256.0 $ 190.4 26 % 34 % % of sales 20 % 19 % 18 % Fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 The Investment Cast Products segment reported fiscal 2006 sales of $1,609.4 million and operating income of $321.9 million, or 20 percent of sales. Fiscal 2006 sales increased 18 percent from the prior years sales of $1,360.6 million, and operating income increased by 26 percent over the prior years operating income of $256.0 million, or 19 percent of sales. The increase in sales reflects market share gains, ramped up commercial aerospace OEM build schedules and strengthening demand in the aerospace and IGT aftermarket businesses. Fiscal 2006 sales also include approximately $76 million of higher pricing related to pass through of increased material costs compared to $42 million in fiscal 2005. The increase in operating income principally reflected the impact of the higher sales volume and improved performance, partially offset by higher raw material costs, primarily titanium and nickel, which have increased approximately 94 percent and 4 percent, respectively, on the TI 6 4 Bulk Weldables Index (metalprices.com) and London Metals Exchange (Bloomberg), respectively, compared to fiscal 2005. The continued improvement in operating margins as a percentage of sales was mainly due to the leverage from the higher sales volume and improved manufacturing performance, partially offset by the impact of lower selling prices from contractual agreements, higher raw material costs and pass through pricing. The Investment Cast Products segment anticipates higher sales in fiscal 2007, primarily driven by increased demand from commercial aerospace customers. Operating margins, as a percent of sales, are expected to improve in fiscal 2007 as a result of leverage from the higher sales volume and continued improvements in operating efficiencies, partially offset by the dilution from pass through pricing. Fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 The Investment Cast Products segment reported fiscal 2005 sales of $1,360.6 million and operating income of $256.0 million, or 19 percent of sales. Fiscal 2005 sales increased 30 percent from the prior years $1,042.8 million, and operating income increased by 34 percent over the prior years $190.4 million, or 18 percent of sales. The SMAG businesses contributed a full year of results in fiscal 2005 30 Table of Contents compared to 17 weeks in fiscal 2004. The increase in sales of the base businesses was driven by continued recovery in the power generation and aerospace markets, with solid aftermarket growth as well as market share gains. The increase in operating income principally reflected the impact of the higher sales volume and operating improvements, partially offset by lower selling prices from contractual agreements and higher raw material costs. Forged Products The Forged Products segment consists of the forging operations of Wyman Gordon. Forged Products sales to the aerospace and power generation markets are derived primarily from the same large engine customers served by the Investment Cast Products segment, with additional aerospace sales going to manufacturers of landing gear and other airframe components. The Forged Products segment also produces seamless pipe for the power generation and the oil and gas industries. Fiscal Year % Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 Sales by Market Aerospace $ 602.7 $ 439.0 $ 367.8 37 % 19 % % of total 69 % 70 % 73 % Power Generation 254.6 166.9 90.0 53 85 % of total 29 % 26 % 18 % Automotive 0.6 2.6 0.1 (77 ) 2500 % of total 0 % 0 % 0 % General Industrial & Other 21.5 23.2 44.5 (7 ) (48 ) % of total 2 % 4 % 9 % Total Sales $ 879.4 $ 631.7 $ 502.4 39 % 26 % % of total 100 % 100 % 100 % Operating income $ 108.1 $ 76.1 $ 64.7 42 % 18 % % of sales 12 % 12 % 13 % Fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 The Forged Products segment reported fiscal 2006 sales of $879.4 million and operating income of $108.1 million, or 12 percent of sales. Fiscal 2006 sales increased 39 percent from the prior years sales of $631.7 million, and operating income increased by 42 percent over the prior years operating income of $76.1 million, or 12 percent of sales. Operating income for fiscal 2006 included a cumulative adjustment of $1.8 million taken in the second quarter to correct an overstatement of expenses from fiscal 2001 through the first quarter of fiscal 2006. See Special Investigation discussion above. The increase in sales was primarily due to increased demand for aerospace products, market share gains and aftermarket growth, as well as continued penetration into the Asian power generation market with higher sales of extruded pipe. Fiscal 2006 sales also included approximately $111 million of higher pricing related to pass through of increased raw material costs compared to $19 million in fiscal 2005. Operating income as a percent of sales benefited in the current year from higher volume, but overall remained flat year over year due to higher material costs, mainly titanium and nickel, which have increased approximately 94 percent and 4 percent, respectively, on the TI 6 4 Bulk Weldables Index (metalprices.com) and LME (Bloomberg) since fiscal 2005. Sales in fiscal 2007 within this segment are expected to benefit from volume increases in the aerospace and power generation markets, and from 10 months of sales activity from Special Metals Corporation (SMC), which was acquired in May 2006. Operating income from the base business is expected to benefit from the higher sales volume and the favorable impact of contract terms that allow 31 Table of Contents for pass through pricing of higher material costs. While these recoveries will increase segment revenues and protect operating income, they will have a dampening effect on related improvements in operating income as a percentage of sales. Fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 The Forged Products segment reported fiscal 2005 sales of $631.7 million and operating income of $76.1 million, or 12 percent of sales. Fiscal 2005 sales increased 26 percent from the prior years sales of $502.4 million, and operating income increased by 18 percent over the prior years operating income of $64.7 million, or 13 percent of sales. The sales volume increase was due to heavy demand for aerospace components as well as continued demand for seamless pipe to the power generation market in China. Operating income as a percent of sales benefited in fiscal 2005 from the higher volume, but was lower than fiscal 2004 due to higher material costs. Fastener Products The Fastener Products segment includes SPS former Aerospace Fasteners and Engineered Fasteners groups that were acquired in December 2003. The businesses that comprise this segment produce fasteners, fastener systems and components for critical applications in the aerospace, automotive and industrial machinery markets.

Fiscal 2006 sales increased 20 percent from the prior years sales of $691.3 million, and operating income increased 63 percent over the prior years operating income of $88.3 million, or 13 percent of sales. The increase in sales was due to the addition of Air Industries Corp., which was acquired in March 2005, and the Shur Lok Group, which was acquired in January 2006, and the favorable impact of strong aerospace sales, partially offset by weaker demand from the automotive industry. Operating margins, as a percent of sales, benefited from cost take outs and improved manufacturing processes, as well as increased higher margin aerospace aftermarket business. Sales and operating income within the Fastener Products segment are expected to grow during fiscal 2007 as a result of increased sales volume to the aerospace market, a slight increase in the automotive market, and a full year of operations from Shur Lok. Operating income as a percentage of sales is also expected to improve due to continuing cost take outs and leverage from higher sales. 32 Table of Contents Fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 The Fastener Products segment recorded sales of $691.3 million and operating income of $88.3 million, or 13 percent of sales. Fiscal 2005 sales increased $510.0 million from the prior years sales of $181.3 million, and operating income increased $74.8 million over the prior years operating income of $13.5 million, or 7 percent of sales. Fiscal 2004 included approximately 17 weeks of activity since PCC acquired SPS on December 9, 2003. The segment was favorably affected by strong aerospace sales and continued to benefit from market share gains at major aerospace customers. Cost take outs and stream lined manufacturing processes have significantly improved operating margins as a percent of sales since the acquisition of SPS. Industrial Products The Industrial Products segment includes J&L Fiber Services, Advanced Forming Technology (AFT), E/One and the Precision Tool Group (PTG). J&L Fiber Services produces refiner plates and screen cylinders for use in the pulp and paper industry and rebuilds refiner equipment that is used in the pulping process. AFT manufactures metal injection moldings, metal matrix composites, and ThixoFormed components for numerous industrial applications. E/One manufactures low pressure sewer systems for residential and commercial applications and detection systems for the power generation industry. PTG, which consists of Reed Rico and the SPS tool group, manufactures a broad range of cold forming header and threader tools and dies principally for automotive, aerospace and other industrial applications. Fiscal Year % Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 Sales by Market Aerospace $ 3.5 $ 6.7 $ 6.4 (48 )% 5 % % of total 2 % 3 % 4 % Power Generation 10.2 7.5 6.0 36 25 % of total 4 % 3 % 3 % Automotive 44.4 47.7 41.8 (7 ) 14 % of total 19 % 20 % 22 % General Industrial & Other 171.5 173.5 132.4 (1 ) 31 % of total 75 % 74 % 71 % Total Sales $ 229.6 $ 235.4 $ 186.6 (2 )% 26 % % of total 100 % 100 % 100 % Operating income $ 31.3 $ 42.5 $ 32.5 (26 )% 31 % % of sales 14 % 18 % 17 % Fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 The Industrial Products segments sales decreased by 2 percent, from $235.4 million in fiscal 2005 to $229.6 million in fiscal 2006, and operating income decreased from $42.5 million, or 18 percent of sales, to $31.3 million, or 14 percent of sales. The lower sales compared to last year were driven by weak conditions in PTGs automotive market and J&Ls pulp and paper market. Included in fiscal 2006 operating income is a cumulative charge of $5.6 million taken in the second quarter to correct an understatement of expenses from fiscal 2003 through the first quarter of fiscal 2006 (see Special Investigation discussion above). The year over year decline in operating income as a percentage of sales is primarily due to the deleveraging effect of the lower sales volume, write off of excess inventory due to weak automotive demand and the cumulative charge discussed above. In fiscal 2007, sales within the Industrial Products segment are expected to show growth similar to GDP levels at all operations, including automotive market share gains at AFT resulting from the 33 Table of Contents introduction of new products that use MIM manufacturing processes, increases in V Max sales at J&L and increases in sewer systems and electric utility monitoring systems at E/One. Operating income as a percentage of sales is also expected to increase as a result of performance improvements and leverage from higher volume, coupled with the elimination of the fiscal 2006 accounting adjustment corrections. Fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 The Industrial Products segments sales increased by 26 percent, from $186.6 million in fiscal 2004 to $235.4 million in fiscal 2005, and its operating income increased from $32.5 million, or 17 percent of sales, to $42.5 million, or 18 percent of sales. The sales increase reflects the addition of sales from SPS tool group, market share gains in the automotive industry, and improved conditions in the aerospace and pulp and paper markets. Operating income as a percent of sales benefited from the higher volume and increased production at low cost manufacturing facilities in Hungary and India, partially offset by the impact of adding the SPS businesses, which have lower operating margins. Interest and taxes Net interest expense in fiscal 2006 was $41.4 million, as compared with $56.6 million in fiscal 2005. The lower interest expense is primarily due to reduced debt levels, partially offset by higher interest rates compared to fiscal 2005. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was 32 percent, compared with 33 percent in fiscal 2005. The lower tax rate in fiscal 2006 was principally due to a one time tax benefit in the third quarter of $5.3 million, revisions in estimates of the Extraterritorial Income Exclusion tax benefit for fiscal 2005 and increased earnings in foreign jurisdictions that have lower income tax rates compared with the United States. Liquidity and capital resources Total assets of $3,751.2 million at April 2, 2006 represented a $126.2 million increase from the $3,625.0 million balance at April 3, 2005, reflecting reduced cash balances, partially offset by the acquisition of Shur Lok, and higher inventory and accounts receivable balances to support improved business conditions. Total capitalization at April 2, 2006, was $2,817.1 million, consisting of $676.6 million of debt and $2,140.5 million of equity. The debt to capitalization ratio improved to 24.0% at April 2, 2006 from 32.1% at the end of fiscal 2005. Cash as of April 2, 2006 was $59.9 million, down $94.0 million from the end of fiscal 2005, and total debt was $676.6 million, down $166.4 million since the end of fiscal 2005. In addition to the $166.4 million of net debt payments, cash requirements for the year included $171.5 million of pension contributions ($151.9 million were voluntary), $113.0 million for the acquisition of Shur Lok, $99.2 million for capital expenditures, $139.2 million for increased working capital and $11.9 million for dividends. These requirements were funded by $349.1 million of net income from continuing operations adjusted for $99.2 million of depreciation and amortization, $59.3 million of deferred income taxes, $1.7 million asset impairment, $1.3 million of non cash adjustments related to the special investigation, $26.0 million of proceeds from the sale of assets held for sale, $47.9 million from the sale of common stock through ESPP purchases and stock option exercises and $22.7 million from other activities. Capital spending of $99.2 million in fiscal 2006 principally provided for equipment maintenance and upgrades, capacity expansion and cost reduction projects. The capital spending plan for fiscal 2007, which is anticipated to be significantly higher than spending in fiscal 2006, provides for capital expenditures for the newly acquired SMC, capacity expansion, cost reduction, lease buy outs, and equipment maintenance and upgrades throughout the company. Management believes that the Company can fund requirements for working capital, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, capital spending, cash dividends, scheduled repayment of debt and 34 Table of Contents potential acquisitions from cash generated from operations, borrowing from existing or new bank credit facilities, issuance of public or privately placed debt securities, or the issuance of equity instruments. Contractual obligations and commercial commitments The Company is obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements and lease agreements. The following table represents the Companys contractual cash obligations as of April 2, 2006 (in millions) and the estimated timing of future cash payments: Contractual Cash Obligations Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Long term debt $ 623.1 $ 23.3 $ 173.3 $ 22.8 $ 54.5 $ 120.4 $ 228.8 Operating leases 91.3 23.8 15.2 13.2 10.1 5.8 23.2 Interest on fixed rate debt 133.1 29.1 25.2 16.9 15.5 13.7 32.7 Interest on variable rate debt (1) 29.2 7.3 6.5 6.2 6.0 3.2 Total $ 876.7 $ 83.5 $ 220.2 $ 59.1 $ 86.1 $ 143.1 $ 284.7 (1) Interest on variable rate debt is based on current prevailing interest rates. The table above excludes estimated required cash contributions to the Companys qualified pension plans totaling approximately $57.9 million over the next five years: $10.9 million in fiscal 2007, $11.2 million in fiscal 2008, $11.6 million in fiscal 2009, $11.9 million in fiscal 2010 and $12.3 million in fiscal 2011. These amounts exclude required contributions related to the SMC pension plans acquired subsequent to year end. The Company also has benefit payments due under its non qualified pension and other post retirement benefit plans that are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See the pension and other postretirement benefit plans footnote to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Critical accounting policies The Company has identified the policies below as critical to PCCs business operations and the understanding of its results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on PCCs business operations are discussed throughout the Managements Discussion and Analysis where such policies affect reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other significant accounting policies, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report. Note that the preparation of this Annual Report requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Revenue recognition The Company recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete. This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the contract or purchase order, ownership and risk of loss have passed to the customer, collectibility is reasonably assured, and pricing is fixed and determinable. In instances where title does not pass to the customer upon shipment, the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery or customer acceptance, depending on terms of the sales agreement. Service sales, representing aftermarket repair and maintenance and engineering activities, are recognized as services are performed. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in revenue. Accounts receivable reserve The Company evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where PCC is aware of a customers inability to meet its financial obligations 35 Table of Contents (e.g., bankruptcy filings), a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due is recorded to reduce the receivable to the amount the Company reasonably expects will be collected. In addition, the Company records reserves for bad debts based on other quantitative measures, which include the analysis of historical write offs and the age of outstanding receivables. The establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances. Although the Company considers these balances adequate and proper, changes in economic conditions in the markets in which the Company operates could have a material effect on the required reserve balances. Valuation of inventories All inventories are stated at the lower of the cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. Cost for work in process and metal inventories at a significant number of the Companys operations is determined on a last in, first out (LIFO) basis. The average inventory cost method is utilized for most other inventories. The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess or obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based on the age, historical usage or assumptions about future demand for the inventory. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could have a significant impact on the value of PCCs inventories and reported operating results. Goodwill and acquired intangibles From time to time, the Company acquires businesses in purchase transactions that typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets, which may affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges. The determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the consolidated financial statements. Environmental costs The estimated future costs for known environmental remediation requirements are accrued on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of remediation costs can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of amounts is established, and no amount within the range is better than another, the minimum amount of the range is recorded. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when collection is probable. Adjustments to the Companys accruals may be necessary to reflect new information as investigation and remediation efforts proceed. The amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations in a given period, but the amounts, and the possible range of loss in excess of the amounts accrued, are not reasonably estimable. Total environmental reserves accrued at April 2, 2006 and April 3, 2005 were $35.5 million and $37.5 million, respectively. The amounts accrued relate to estimated liabilities at multiple locations, with the most significant potential liability associated with the Wyman Gordon facility in North Grafton, Massachusetts. Income Taxes Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pre tax earnings based on current tax law and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. 36 Table of Contents Recently issued accounting standards In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS No. 151 clarifies that abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) are required to be recognized as current period charges. The provisions of SFAS No. 151 are effective for our fiscal year beginning April 3, 2006. The Company does not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable. APB Opinion No. 20 Accounting Changes, previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005; however, earlier adoption is permitted for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date of issuance of SFAS No. 154. In December 2004, the FASB finalized SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) (123R), Share Based Payment. SFAS No. 123R requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements, with the cost measured based on the estimated fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. The Company has decided to use the prospective method of application provided for in the standard. Under this method, the Company will begin recognizing compensation cost for equity based compensation for all new or modified grants after the date of adoption. In addition, the Company will recognize the unvested portion of the grant date fair value of awards issued prior to adoption based on the fair values previously calculated for disclosure purposes. The effective date of SFAS No. 123R is the first quarter of the first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005, which will be PCCs first quarter of fiscal 2007. PCC is in the process of evaluating the impact of the revised standard, but currently estimates the recognition of stock based compensation expense for fiscal 2007 will be approximately $20 million, pre tax, or $0.10 per share. In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP No. 123(R) 3, Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share Based Payment Awards. This pronouncement provides an alternative method of calculating the excess tax benefits available to absorb any tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). The Company, which is currently evaluating its available transition alternatives, has until March 30, 2007 to make its one time election. Forward looking statements Information included within this Form 10 K describing the projected growth and future results and events constitutes forward looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results in future periods may differ materially from the forward looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to fluctuations in the aerospace, power generation, automotive, and other general industrial cycles; the relative success of the Companys entry into new markets; competitive pricing; the financial viability of the Companys significant customers; the availability and cost of energy, materials, supplies, and insurance, the cost of pension and postretirement medical benefits; equipment failures; relations with the Companys employees; the Companys ability to manage its operating costs and to integrate acquired businesses in an effective manner; governmental regulations and environmental matters; risks associated with international operations and world economies; the relative stability of certain foreign currencies; and implementation of new technologies and process improvements. Any forward looking statements should be considered in light of these factors. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release any forward looking information to reflect anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of this document. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK At various times, the Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and prices of strategic raw materials. Fluctuations in the market values of such derivative instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the underlying economic exposures that the instruments are intended to hedge. Because derivative instruments are used solely as hedges and not for speculative trading purposes, they do not represent incremental risk to the Company.
