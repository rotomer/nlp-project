ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (in millions, except per share data) Business overview Precision Castparts Corp. (PCC or the Company) completed another very successful year in fiscal 2007, attaining for the third consecutive year record levels of sales, operating income, net income from continuing operations, and earnings per share. These results were principally driven by exceptional performance from Special Metals Corporation (SMC) following its acquisition, by continuing strong conditions in PCCs core aerospace and power generation markets, and by the Companys never ending focus on cost reduction and operational improvements across all of its businesses. Also, during the year, the Company successfully acquired GSC Foundries, Inc. (GSC) and Cherry Aerospace (Cherry), two strategically important tuck in acquisitions for the Investment Cast Products and Fastener Products segments, respectively, and the Company added critical production capacity in its investment casting and forging operations to meet the increasing demand for aerospace products. On the acquisition front, in May 2006 PCC acquired SMC, a world leader in the production of high performance nickel based alloys and super alloys. These alloys are principally used to make forged components that operate under extreme conditions in gas turbines and other critical applications. While SMC currently provides our forging operations with a limited quantity of nickel based alloys for manufacturing aerospace components, it is expected that this internal supply will grow substantially over time, enabling us to manage our overall value stream more cost effectively from raw material to forged components. In addition, SMC supplies nickel based alloys to companies other than PCC that serve both aerospace and non aerospace markets. These non aerospace markets, which represent approximately 73% of SMCs sales, provide diversification and additional growth opportunities for PCC. SMC has performed well beyond our initial projections, making rapid progress in improving yields, increasing production volumes, reducing inventories, and leveraging operational efficiencies. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, PCC completed the acquisitions of GSC and Cherry, both of which fit strategically into our current framework of companies by expanding our product portfolio and market position. GSC will enhance our portfolio of small structural investment casting products, enabling us to produce larger aluminum and smaller steel components than those in our current product line, thereby extending our product reach. Cherry will fill a significant gap in our line of critical aerospace fasteners with its rivets and blind bolts, and will open up potential synergies and economies of scale with our other fastener operations. Also, during the year, PCC increased manufacturing capacity to support higher demand for aerospace products by completing key large scale capital expenditure projects, which included the expansion of the titanium facility at PCC Structurals, additional DS furnaces at PCC Airfoils, a second isothermal forging press at Wyman Gordon, and a GFM rotary forging machine at SMC. These projects, which required approximately $70 million of capital spending during fiscal 2007, will provide approximately $145 million of incremental sales capacity in fiscal 2008. PCC expects fiscal 2008 capital expenditures to approximate fiscal 2007 spending levels, with approximately 30 percent of spending allocated to capacity expansion projects. PCC has positioned itself on new and expanding aerospace and IGT platforms, and continues to capitalize on its strong foundation across all of its markets. This robust market position, coupled with the Companys relentless focus on cost reduction and performance improvement, has converged with positive market forces to create an environment for profitable growth. Looking ahead to fiscal 2008 and beyond, we believe the Company will continue to benefit from increases in OEM aircraft build rates, which include new high content wide body commercial aircraft models and new military aircraft, and from continuing high aircraft utilization rates. The Company also expects solid growth in demand for 25 Table of Contents IGT components and extruded pipe products, as well as for other non aerospace products serving the oil and gas, chemical processing and pollution control industries.

Total aerospace sales increased 37 percent over fiscal 2006 levels, and decreased from 59 percent of total sales in fiscal 2006 to 53 percent of total sales in fiscal 2007. Power generation sales increased 76 percent over fiscal 2006 levels, and increased from 18 percent of total sales in fiscal 2006 to 21 percent of total sales in fiscal 2007. Sales to the general industrial markets increased 105 percent over the prior year, and increased from 15 percent of total sales in fiscal 2006 to 20 percent of total sales in fiscal 2007. Sales to the automotive market grew by 16 percent, decreasing from 8 percent of total sales in fiscal 2006 to 6 percent of total sales in fiscal 2007. The shift in product mix from aerospace to non aerospace markets during the year was driven by the acquisition of SMC in May 2006. Approximately 73% of SMCs sales are to non aerospace markets, which include oil and gas, chemical processing, and pollution control. The overall increase in sales was principally driven by the addition of 10 months of sales from SMC, and by improving conditions in PCCs core aerospace and 26 Table of Contents power generation markets. In addition, pass through pricing of higher material costs increased sales by approximately $393 million this year versus approximately $210 million in fiscal 2006. With regard to growth in the commercial aircraft industry, forecasts from JSA Research as of August 2006 indicate aircraft deliveries are expected to increase approximately 6 percent in calendar year 2007 from calendar year 2006 and are forecast to continue to increase approximately 6 percent in calendar year 2008. Because of manufacturing lead times required to support aircraft deliveries, PCC began realizing these forecasted increases during the second half of fiscal 2006. Cost of goods sold was $4,051.0 million, or 76 percent of sales, in fiscal 2007 as compared to $2,714.2 million, or 77 percent of sales, in fiscal 2006. The improvement in the year over year percentage reflects the impact of leverage from higher sales volume and improved operating efficiencies, partially offset by increased raw material costs in fiscal 2007, primarily nickel and titanium, which have increased approximately 103 percent and 11 percent, respectively, on the London Metals Exchange (Bloomberg) and the TI 6 4 Bulk Weldables Index (metalprices.com), respectively, compared to fiscal 2006. Selling and administrative expenses were $337.2 million, or 6 percent of sales, in fiscal 2007 compared to $247.3 million, or 7 percent of sales, in fiscal 2006. The improved year over year percentage was primarily due to leverage from the higher sales volume. Net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2007 was $614.7 million, or $4.45 per share (diluted). By comparison, net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 was $349.7 million, or $2.58 per share (diluted), which included restructuring and impairment charges totaling $0.01 per share (diluted). Fiscal 2007 net income from continuing operations includes a tax benefit of $11.1 million, or $0.08 per share (diluted), associated with tax refund claims recognized and changes in tax reserves resulting from completed and ongoing audits, compared to a tax benefit of $5.3 million, or $0.04 per share (diluted), in the prior year. Fiscal 2007 net income (including discontinued operations) was $633.1 million, or $4.59 per share (diluted), compared with net income of $350.6 million, or $2.58 per share (diluted) in fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2007 net income includes income of $18.4 million, or $0.14 per share (diluted), from discontinued operations, compared to income of $0.9 million, or no per share impact, in the prior year. Business acquisitions Fiscal 2007 On February 23, 2007, PCC acquired the LLC membership interests of Cherry from Acument Global Technologies, Inc. (Acument) for $300.4 million in cash. Founded in 1939, Cherry encompasses the aerospace operations of Acument, formerly Textron Fastening Systems, and is a manufacturer of aerospace rivets and blind bolts. Cherry employs approximately 500 people at its facility in Santa Ana, California. Cherry will fill a gap in our product line of critical aerospace fasteners and will open up potential synergies and economies of scale with our other fastener operations. The Cherry acquisition is an asset acquisition for tax purposes and operates as part of the Fastener Products segment. On February 2, 2007, PCC acquired the stock of GSC, a manufacturer of aluminum and steel structural investment castings for aerospace, energy, medical, and other end markets for $77.1 million in cash. GSC employs approximately 375 people, primarily at its operations in Ogden, Utah, in addition to a small location in Saltillo, Mexico. GSC will enhance PCCs small structural investment casting portfolio with its ability to produce larger components. The GSC acquisition is an asset acquisition for tax purposes and operates as part of the Investment Cast Products segment. On May 25, 2006, PCC completed the acquisition of SMC, a manufacturer of high performance nickel based alloys and super alloys. SMC currently provides our forging operations with a limited quantity of nickel based alloys for manufacturing aerospace components, and it is expected that this 27 Table of Contents internal supply will grow substantially over time. The aggregate purchase price was $548.1 million, which principally includes $310.6 million for the purchase of shares and $240.1 million for the repayment of SMCs outstanding debt and related termination costs, partially offset by $22.3 million of cash acquired. The transaction was funded through the Companys credit facilities. The SMC acquisition is a stock purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of the Forged Products segment. Fiscal 2006 On January 6, 2006, PCC completed the acquisition of the Shur Lok Group, which includes the Shur Lok Corporation in Irvine, California, and Shur Lok International located in Petit Rechain, Belgium, for approximately $113.0 million in cash. Shur Lok is a manufacturer of highly engineered, critical aerospace fasteners, including inserts, barrel nuts, adjustable diameter bolts, fluid fittings and lock nuts. The Shur Lok product line enhances the basket of fastener products the Company can offer to its commercial airframe customers, while increasing market reach into other critical fastener applications. The Shur Lok acquisition is an asset purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of the Fastener Products segment. Fiscal 2005 On March 8, 2005, PCC acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of Air Industries Corporation (AIC) for approximately $198.3 million in cash. AIC is a manufacturer of airframe fasteners, which include bolts, pins, and screws made from titanium and nickel based alloys. This acquisition enhances PCCs presence in the aerospace fastener market by expanding the range of fastener products offered to PCCs aerospace customers. The AIC acquisition is an asset purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of the Fastener Products segment. Discontinued operations The Companys financial statements were impacted by activities relating to the planned divestiture of a number of PCCs businesses. These businesses have been accounted for under SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. Accordingly, any operating results of these businesses are presented in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations as discontinued operations, net of income tax, and all prior periods have been reclassified. Fiscal 2007 In the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company sold its interest in Wyman Gordon FRISA to its 50% joint venture partner. PCC received $30.0 million in cash for the sale. In addition, the buyer assumed and subsequently paid off $17.4 million of debt upon closing. At the time of the closing, the joint venture entity operated a manufacturing facility located in Mexico that was engaged in the manufacture of forged products using the ring rolling process. FRISA was reclassified from the Forged Products segment to discontinued operations. In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company decided to sell the refiner rebuild business of J&L Fiber Services and to close its AFT Composites business. These businesses were reclassified from the former Industrial Products segment (now the Fastener Products segment) to discontinued operations. Both transactions were completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2005 In the second quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company decided to sell all of the pumps and valves businesses of PCC Flow Technologies, with the exception of E/One and PCC Eurovalves. The businesses held for sale were reclassified from the Fluid Management Products segment to discontinued operations. 28 Table of Contents The E/One business was retained and is now included in the Fastener Products segment. The sale of the pumps and valves businesses of PCC Flow Technologies was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, and PCC Eurovalves, which is located in The Netherlands, was sold in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. PCCs decision to sell the pumps and valves businesses in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 resulted in a charge of $245.0 million, of which $219.1 million was associated with the write down of goodwill. The remainder of the charge related to the write down of inventory, other amortizable assets and machinery and equipment to fair value less cost to sell. Approximately $240.0 million of the charge was non cash. Restructuring, asset impairment and other non recurring charges PCC regularly assesses its cost structure to ensure that operations are properly sized for prevailing market conditions, taking into consideration current and forecasted conditions in markets served by the Company. There were no restructuring or asset impairment charges in fiscal 2007. The following restructuring and asset impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 2006 and 2005. Fiscal 2006 During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, PCC recorded restructuring and asset impairment charges of $2.3 million, which included $1.7 million primarily due to the write down of a building and equipment to fair value related to consolidation of a machining operation in the Investment Cast Products segment, and $0.6 million for severance costs associated with headcount reductions related to downsizing the Companys tooling operation in Ireland. The tax effected impact of these charges was $1.9 million, or $0.01 per share (diluted). Fiscal 2005 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, PCC recorded restructuring and asset impairment charges of $1.6 million, principally related to additional costs associated with a business that was closed several years ago. The tax effected impact of these charges was $1.1 million, or $0.01 per share (diluted). Subsequent events On April 3, 2007, PCC acquired the assets of McWilliams Forge Company, Inc. (McWilliams), a privately held company headquartered in Rockaway, New Jersey, for $90.5 million in cash. Founded in 1880, McWilliams is a leading manufacturer of titanium, nickel and steel forgings, primarily for commercial and military aerospace applications. McWilliams, which employs approximately 120 people at its New Jersey facility, operates both hammer and screw presses for open and closed die forging. McWilliams will operate as part of the Forged Products segment. During May 2007, the Company amended its $1.0 billion bank revolving credit facility. The amendment, among other things, reduces the facility fee and borrowing spread under the Credit Agreement, extends the maturity date of the Credit Agreement to May 2012, with an option, exercisable by the Company, to request up to two one year extensions in the maturity date, subject to the approval of each lender, and permits the Company to request increases in the aggregate principal amount available under the Credit Agreement to a maximum of $1.5 billion, subject to the agreement of each lender to increase their respective commitment. Outlook The Company expects that the same factors contributing to the success of fiscal 2007 will continue through fiscal 2008. These drivers include continued strength in the aerospace and power generation markets resulting from increases in OEM build rates, continued aftermarket demand and market share gains. 29 Table of Contents PCC expects fiscal 2008 sales to grow organically by approximately 10 15%, primarily as a result of growth in the commercial aerospace industry, regaining strength in the IGT market, increased manufacturing capacity, and higher prices related to pass through of increased raw material costs. In addition, the Company will benefit from a full year of sales from the businesses acquired in the current year. PCC expects the shift in product mix trend to continue into fiscal 2008, as SMC penetrates further into non aerospace markets, diversifying the Companys sales profile. Operating earnings are expected to benefit from the sales volume increases and continued operating improvements. Operating margin as a percent of sales is also expected to show improvement over fiscal 2007 levels principally due to leverage from higher sales volume and improved operating performance, partially offset by the dilutive impact of increased material pass through pricing. The Company will remain active on the acquisition front, particularly with tuck in acquisitions that provide a strong strategic fit, while at the same time continually assessing the fit of its existing businesses in order to maintain the Companys strong financial position and competitive profile. Financial results by segment PCC analyzes its operating segments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 131, Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, and manages its business across three reportable segments: Investment Cast Products, Forged Products and Fastener Products. Effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the former Industrial Products segment was integrated into the Fastener Products segment, and all prior periods have been restated to reflect this change in reportable segments. Segment operating income amounts presented below exclude restructuring and asset impairment charges.

These businesses manufacture investment castings, or provide related investment casting materials and alloys, for aircraft engines, IGT engines, airframes, armaments, medical prostheses and other industrial applications. Fiscal Year % Increase/(Decrease) 2007 2006 2005 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Sales by Market Aerospace $ 1,137.9 $ 1,023.4 $ 847.7 11% 21% % of total 63% 64% 62% Power Generation 409.5 371.8 333.0 10 12 % of total 23% 23% 24% General Industrial 235.0 196.1 170.2 20 15 % of total 13% 12% 13% Automotive 15.5 18.1 9.7 (14 ) 87 % of total 1% 1% 1% Total Sales $ 1,797.9 $ 1,609.4 $ 1,360.6 12% 18% % of total 100% 100% 100% Operating income $ 391.5 $ 321.9 $ 256.0 22% 26% % of sales 21.8% 20.0% 18.8% Fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 The Investment Cast Products segment reported fiscal 2007 sales of $1,797.9 million, an increase of 12 percent from the prior years sales of $1,609.4 million. The increase in sales reflects growth in the commercial and military aerospace markets, strengthening demand in the aerospace aftermarket businesses, and approximately $7 million of sales from GSC, which was acquired in the fourth quarter. Sales also include approximately $141 million of higher pricing related to pass through of increased material costs compared to $76 million last year. Operating income for the Investment Cast Products segment was $391.5 million, or 21.8 percent of sales in fiscal 2007, compared to $321.9 million, or 20.0 percent of sales, in fiscal 2006. The increase in operating income reflects the impact of higher sales volume and improved performance, partially offset by higher raw material costs, primarily nickel and titanium, which have increased approximately 103 percent and 11 percent, respectively, on the London Metals Exchange (Bloomberg) and the TI 6 4 Bulk Weldables Index (metalprices.com), respectively, compared to fiscal 2006. The continued improvement in operating margins as a percent of sales was driven by leverage from the increased sales volume and improved manufacturing performance, partially offset by the impact of higher raw material costs and pass through pricing. While the majority of the higher material costs were recovered from favorable contract terms that allow for pass through pricing and protect operating income, they dilute operating income as a percent of sales. Material pass through pricing diluted operating margins by 1.9 percentage points in fiscal 2007 compared to 1.0 percentage point last year. The Investment Cast Products segment anticipates higher sales in fiscal 2008, primarily driven by increased demand from commercial aerospace customers and from a full year of sales from GSC. Additional production capacity has been provided at PCC Structurals and PCC Airfoils to accommodate expected growth in fiscal 2008. Operating margins, as a percent of sales, are expected to improve slightly in fiscal 2008 as a result of leverage from the higher sales volume and continued improvements in operating efficiencies, partially offset by the dilution from pass through pricing. 31 Table of Contents Fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 The Investment Cast Products segment reported fiscal 2006 sales of $1,609.4 million and operating income of $321.9 million, or 20.0 percent of sales. Fiscal 2006 sales increased 18 percent from the prior years $1,360.6 million, and operating income increased by 26 percent over the prior years $256.0 million, or 18.8 percent of sales. The increase in sales reflected market share gains, ramped up commercial aerospace OEM build schedules and strengthening demand in the aerospace and IGT aftermarket businesses. The increase in operating income principally reflected the impact of the higher sales volume and operating improvements, partially offset by lower selling prices from contractual agreements. In addition, material pass through pricing for fiscal 2006 contributed $76 million to sales, diluting operating margins by 1.0 percentage points, compared to fiscal 2005 pass through pricing of $42 million, diluting operating margins by 0.6 percentage points. Forged Products The Forged Products segment includes the operations of Wyman Gordon and SMC, which was acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. These businesses manufacture forged components from sophisticated titanium and nickel based alloys principally for the aerospace and power generation markets, or manufacture nickel and cobalt based alloys used to produce forged components for aerospace and non aerospace markets which include products for oil and gas, chemical processing, and pollution control applications. Forged Products sales to the aerospace and power generation markets are derived primarily from the same large engine customers served by the Investment Cast Products segment, with additional aerospace sales going to manufacturers of landing gear and other airframe components. The Forged Products segment also produces seamless pipe for the power generation and the oil and gas industries. Fiscal Year % Increase/(Decrease) 2007 2006 2005 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Sales by Market Aerospace $ 1,022.5 $ 579.7 $ 431.2 76% 34% % of total 44% 68% 69% Power Generation 703.4 254.6 166.9 176 53 % of total 30% 30% 27% General Industrial 525.2 21.6 24.6 n/m (12 ) % of total 23% 2% 4% Automotive 58.4 0.5 2.6 n/m (81 ) % of total 3% 0% 0% Total Sales $ 2,309.5 $ 856.4 $ 625.3 170% 37% % of total 100% 100% 100% Operating income $ 403.0 $ 107.1 $ 80.2 276% 34% % of sales 17.4% 12.5% 12.8% Fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 The Forged Products segment reported fiscal 2007 sales of $2,309.5 million, an increase of 170 percent from the prior years sales of $856.4 million. Approximately 84% of the increase in sales compared to the prior year reflects the addition of approximately 10 months of sales from SMC. The remaining increase in year over year sales was driven by increased demand for aerospace products, continued penetration into the Asian power generation market, and improving demand in the North American market for extruded pipe. Sales of extruded pipe increased 53 percent year over year, from $177.7 million in fiscal 2006 to $272.6 million in fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2007 sales also include approximately $233 million of higher pricing related to pass through of increased raw material costs, compared to $111 million last year. 32 Table of Contents Operating income for the Forged Products segment was $403.0 million, or 17.4 percent of sales in fiscal 2007, compared to $107.1 million, or 12.5 percent of sales, in fiscal 2006. Operating income as a percent of sales benefited from increased sales volume of higher margin aircraft turbine components, as well as from the impact of successful cost reduction initiatives. In addition to continuing improvements from base businesses, SMC exceeded initial projections and rapidly accelerated its progress in improving yields, increasing production volumes and reducing inventories, thereby significantly improving operating margins each quarter in its first 10 months of operation under PCC. As a result of improving margins at SMC, coupled with more modest improvements in the base business, the segment reported operating margins of 14.0% in the first quarter, 16.1% in the second quarter, 17.4% in the third quarter, and 20.3% in the fourth quarter. These improvements were partially offset by higher material costs, primarily nickel and titanium, which have increased approximately 103 percent and 11 percent, respectively, on the London Metals Exchange (Bloomberg) and the TI 6 4 Bulk Weldables Index (metalprices.com), respectively, compared to fiscal 2006. The pass through of higher raw material costs diluted operating margins by 1.9 percentage points for both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. Sales in fiscal 2008 within this segment are expected to increase principally due to continuing strength in the commercial aerospace cycle and SMCs market share gains in non aerospace markets. We also expect continued growth in extruded pipe sales and regaining strength in the IGT market. Additional production capacity has been provided at Wyman Gordon and SMC to accommodate expected growth in fiscal 2008. Operating income as a percent of sales for SMC is expected to show continued improvement, although trending at a more moderate pace than the first three quarters of ownership. The segments margins will also continue to benefit from the leverage of higher sales volume and further cost reductions, partially offset by the dilution from increased material pass through pricing. Fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 The Forged Products segment reported fiscal 2006 sales of $856.4 million and operating income of $107.1 million, or 12.5 percent of sales. Fiscal 2006 sales increased 37 percent from the prior years sales of $625.3 million, and operating income increased by 34 percent over the prior years operating income of $80.2 million, or 12.8 percent of sales. The increase in sales was primarily due to increased demand for aerospace products, market share gains and aftermarket growth, as well as continued penetration into the Asian power generation market with higher sales of extruded pipe. Fiscal 2006 sales also included approximately $111 million of higher pricing related to pass through of increased raw material costs compared to $19 million in fiscal 2005. Operating income as a percent of sales benefited in fiscal 2006 from higher volume, but overall remained flat year over year due to higher material costs. 33 Table of Contents Fastener Products The Fastener Products segment includes the Aerospace Fasteners and Engineered Fasteners groups. In addition, the segment includes the integration of the former Industrial Products segment, which was effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. The businesses that comprise this segment produce fasteners, fastener systems and components for critical applications in the aerospace, automotive and industrial machinery markets. Fiscal Year % Increase/(Decrease) 2007 2006 2005 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Sales by Market Aerospace $ 668.0 $ 467.9 $ 322.2 43% 45% % of total 53% 45% 35% Power Generation 18.8 14.9 10.2 26 46 % of total 2% 1% 1% General Industrial & Other 314.4 307.5 321.4 2 (4 ) % of total 25% 29% 35% Automotive 252.6 262.3 260.3 (4 ) 1 % of total 20% 25% 29% Total Sales $ 1,253.8 $ 1,052.6 $ 914.1 19% 15% % of total 100% 100% 100% Operating income $ 265.5 $ 176.9 $ 129.2 50% 37% % of sales 21.2% 16.8% 14.1% Fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 The Fastener Products segment reported fiscal 2007 sales of $1,253.8 million, a 19 percent increase from fiscal 2006 sales of $1,052.6 million. The increase in sales resulted from higher sales from the Aerospace Fastener operations, of which approximately $15 million was from the acquisition of Cherry Aerospace in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and approximately $51 million from the acquisition of Shur Lok in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Sales from the Engineered Fastener and IPG operations demonstrated a slower growth rate at 6 percent year over year, principally due to weaker demand from the automotive industry. Operating income for the Fasteners segment was $265.5 million, or 21.2 percent of sales in fiscal 2007, compared to $176.9 million, or 16.8 percent of sales, in fiscal 2006. The improvement in operating margins reflected leverage from the increased sales volume and higher margin aerospace business, as well as the impact of continued efforts to reduce costs and improve manufacturing processes. Sales and operating income within the Fastener Products segment are expected to grow during fiscal 2008 as a result of increased sales volume to the aerospace market and a full year of operations from Cherry. Operating income as a percent of sales is also expected to improve due to continuing cost take outs and leverage from higher sales. Fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 The Fastener Products segment reported fiscal 2006 sales of $1,052.6 million and operating income of $176.9 million, or 16.8 percent of sales. Fiscal 2006 sales increased 15 percent from the prior years sales of $914.1 million, and operating income increased by 37 percent over the prior years operating income of $129.2 million, or 14.1 percent of sales. The increase in sales was due to the addition of AIC, which was acquired in March 2005, and the Shur Lok Group, which was acquired in January 2006, and the 34 Table of Contents favorable impact of strong aerospace sales, partially offset by weaker demand from the automotive industry. Operating margins, as a percent of sales, benefited from cost take outs and improved manufacturing processes, as well as increased higher margin aerospace aftermarket business. Interest and taxes Net interest expense in fiscal 2007 was $52.2 million, as compared with $40.6 million in fiscal 2006. The higher interest expense is primarily due to higher borrowing levels in fiscal 2007, partially offset by a lower effective interest rate resulting from lower borrowing costs associated with the Companys commercial paper program. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 was 33.1 percent, compared with 31.7 percent in fiscal 2006. The increase in the fiscal 2007 tax rate was driven by the phase out of U.S. export incentives, taxes on incremental domestic earnings that are taxed at a higher rate, and decreased tax holiday benefits in foreign jurisdictions (as a percentage of pretax income). The fiscal 2007 effective rate reflects a 1.2 percentage point ($11.1 million) tax benefit from tax audit settlements compared to a 1.0 percentage point ($5.3 million) tax benefit in fiscal 2006. Liquidity and capital resources Total assets of $5,258.7 million at April 1, 2007 represented a $1,508.9 million increase from the $3,749.8 million balance at April 2, 2006. This increase was driven by the addition of SMC, GSC and Cherry assets totaling $1,294.7 million and by increased inventories and receivables to support expected revenue growth in the base businesses. Total capitalization at April 1, 2007, was $3,709.2 million, consisting of $873.0 million of debt and $2,836.2 million of equity. The debt to capitalization ratio improved to 23.5% at April 1, 2007 from 24.0% at the end of fiscal 2006. Cash as of April 1, 2007 was $150.4 million, up $90.5 million from the end of fiscal 2006, and total debt increased from $676.6 million (including $14.0 million related to discontinued operations) at April 2, 2006 to $873.0 million at April 1, 2007, for a total increase of $196.4 million. Debt net of cash, which includes borrowings to finance the acquisitions of SMC, GSC and Cherry, increased to $722.6 million at the end of fiscal 2007 from $616.7 million at the end of fiscal 2006, reflecting an increase of $105.9 million. Adjusting this increase in net debt for the $919.2 million of cash paid to acquire SMC, GSC and Cherry, along with FRISA debt that was sold ($17.4 million) and debt that was assumed with the SMC acquisition ($2.8 million), the Company generated $798.7 million of positive net cash flow for the year. This positive net cash flow consisted primarily of $865.5 million from operating activities, $71.7 million from various asset dispositions and business divestitures, $78.2 million from the issuance of common stock and related tax benefit, and $21.6 million related to the effect of exchange rate changes on foreign cash balances, partially offset by capital expenditures of $221.5 million and dividend payments of $16.3 million. Capital spending of $221.5 million in fiscal 2007 principally provided for equipment maintenance and upgrades, capacity expansion, cost reduction and safety projects. The capital spending plan for fiscal 2008, which is anticipated to approximate spending in fiscal 2007, provides for additional capacity expansion, cost reduction, and equipment maintenance and upgrades throughout the company. During May 2007, the Company amended its $1.0 billion bank revolving credit facility. The amendment, among other things, reduces the facility fee and borrowing spread under the Credit Agreement, extends the maturity date of the Credit Agreement to May 2012, with an option, exercisable by the Company, to request up to two one year extensions in the maturity date, subject to the approval of each lender, and permits the Company to request increases in the aggregate principal amount available under the Credit Agreement to a maximum of $1.5 billion, subject to the agreement of each lender to increase their respective commitment. 35 Table of Contents Management believes that the Company can fund requirements for at least the next 12 months for working capital, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, capital spending, cash dividends, scheduled repayment of debt and potential acquisitions from cash generated from operations, borrowing from existing or new bank credit facilities, issuance of public or privately placed debt securities, or the issuance of equity instruments. Contractual obligations and commercial commitments The Company is obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements and lease agreements. The following table represents the Companys contractual cash obligations as of April 1, 2007 (in millions) and the estimated timing of future cash payments: Contractual Cash Obligations Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Long term debt $ 489.9 $ 170.7 $ 20.2 $ 54.9 $ 15.1 $ 14.7 $ 214.3 Operating leases 78.4 18.8 16.5 12.2 7.3 4.9 18.7 Interest on fixed rate debt 103.4 25.3 16.7 15.3 13.5 12.1 20.5 Interest on variable rate debt(1) 73.7 21.2 21.1 21.0 10.4 Total $ 745.4 $ 236.0 $ 74.5 $ 103.4 $ 46.3 $ 31.7 $ 253.5 (1) Interest on variable rate debt is based on current prevailing interest rates. The table above excludes estimated required cash contributions to the Companys qualified pension plans totaling approximately $170.5 million over the next five years: $30.2 million in fiscal 2008, $31.0 million in fiscal 2009, $32.0 million in fiscal 2010, $36.8 million in fiscal 2011 and $40.5 million in fiscal 2012. The Company also has benefit payments due under its non qualified pension and other post retirement benefit plans that are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Critical accounting policies The Company has identified the policies below as critical to PCCs business operations and the understanding of its results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on PCCs business operations are discussed throughout the Managements Discussion and Analysis where such policies affect reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other significant accounting policies, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report. Note that the preparation of this Annual Report requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Revenue recognition The Company recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete. This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the contract or purchase order, ownership and risk of loss have passed to the customer, collectibility is reasonably assured, and pricing is fixed and determinable. In instances where title does not pass to the customer upon shipment, the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery or customer acceptance, depending on terms of the sales agreement. Service sales, representing aftermarket repair and maintenance and engineering activities, are recognized as services are performed. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in revenue. 36 Table of Contents Accounts receivable reserve The Company evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where PCC is aware of a customers inability to meet its financial obligations (e.g., bankruptcy filings), a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due is recorded to reduce the receivable to the amount the Company reasonably expects will be collected. In addition, the Company records reserves for bad debts based on other quantitative measures, which include the analysis of historical write offs and the age of outstanding receivables. The establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances. Although the Company considers these balances adequate and proper, changes in economic conditions in the markets in which the Company operates could have a material effect on the required reserve balances. Valuation of inventories All inventories are stated at the lower of the cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. Cost for work in process and metal inventories at a significant number of the Companys operations is determined on a last in, first out (LIFO) basis. The average inventory cost method is utilized for most other inventories. The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess or obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based on the age, historical usage or assumptions about future demand for the inventory. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could have a significant impact on the value of PCCs inventories and reported operating results. Goodwill and acquired intangibles From time to time, the Company acquires businesses in purchase transactions that typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets, which may affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges. The determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the consolidated financial statements. Environmental costs The estimated future costs for known environmental remediation requirements are accrued on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of remediation costs can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of amounts is established, and no amount within the range is better than another, the minimum amount of the range is recorded. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when collection is probable. Adjustments to the Companys accruals may be necessary to reflect new information as investigation and remediation efforts proceed. The amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations in a given period, but any amounts, and the possible range of any amounts in excess of those already accrued, are not reasonably estimable at this time. Total environmental reserves accrued at April 1, 2007 and April 2, 2006 were $74.3 million and $35.5 million, respectively. Generally, the increase in environmental reserves over the last year reflects existing liabilities associated with the Companys acquisitions, as discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and is not the result of newly discovered environmental liabilities. In March 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143 (FIN 47). FIN 47 clarified the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 143 and requires a liability to be recorded if the fair value of 37 Table of Contents the obligation can be reasonably estimated. Asset retirement obligations covered by this Interpretation include those for which an entity has a large obligation to perform an asset retirement activity, however the timing or method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may not be within the control of the entity. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. In accordance with FAS 143 and FIN 47, PCC will record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liability can be reasonably estimated. Currently, PCC has identified a known asset retirement obligation associated with environmental contamination at one of its manufacturing facilities. The Company, however, has not recognized a liability under FIN 47 for this retirement obligation because the fair value of remediation at this site cannot be reasonably estimated since the settlement date is unknown at this time. The settlement date is unknown because remediation of this site is not required until production ceases, and the Company has no current or future plans to cease production. This asset retirement obligation, when estimable, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows or business. Income taxes Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pre tax earnings based on current tax law and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Recently issued accounting standards In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 establishes a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. This interpretation clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition of uncertain tax positions. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective for our fiscal 2008 beginning April 2, 2007. The Company does not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and also expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 157 on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) (SFAS No. 158). SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to recognize an asset or liability for the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. For a pension plan, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation; for any other postretirement benefit plan, such as a retiree 38 Table of Contents health care plan, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. SFAS No. 158 also requires the Company to recognize in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), apart from expenses, the actuarial gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits that arise during the period, but that were not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost of the period pursuant to SFAS No 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. SFAS No. 158 does not impact the calculation of net periodic benefit cost. This portion of SFAS No. 158 is effective for the Company for the year ending April 1, 2007. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 resulted in the following impacts: a reduction of $112.4 million in existing prepaid pension costs and intangible assets, the recognition of $64.6 million in accrued pension and postretirement liabilities, and a charge of $177 million ($115.3 million after tax) to accumulated other comprehensive loss. See Note 14 Pension and other postretirement benefit plans for additional information. SFAS No. 158 also requires that an employer measure plan assets and obligations as of the end of the employers fiscal year, eliminating the option in SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions and SFAS No. 106 Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, to measure up to three months prior to the financial statement date. The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year end is effective for PCCs fiscal year ending March 29, 2009. In February, 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159 The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 159 on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Forward looking statements Information included within this Form 10 K describing the projected growth and future results and events constitutes forward looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK At various times, the Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and prices of strategic raw materials. Fluctuations in the market values of such derivative instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the underlying economic exposures that the instruments are intended to hedge. Because derivative instruments are used solely as hedges and not for speculative trading purposes, they do not represent incremental risk to the Company. For further discussion of derivative financial instruments, refer to the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Financing Arrangements sections in
