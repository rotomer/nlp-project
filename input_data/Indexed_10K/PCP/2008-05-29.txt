ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (in millions, except per share data) Business overview We completed another successful year in fiscal 2008, attaining record levels of sales, operating income, net income from continuing operations, and earnings per share. These results were principally driven by continuing strong conditions in our core aerospace and power generation markets, effective volume leverage, and disciplined cost reduction and operational improvements across all of our segments. Also, during the year, we successfully acquired McWilliams and Caledonian, two strategically important acquisitions within the Forged Products segment. In April 2007, we completed the acquisition of McWilliams, a leading manufacturer of titanium, nickel and steel forgings, primarily for commercial and military aerospace applications. McWilliams has established long term relationships with manufacturers of smaller aircraft engines, thereby extending the customer reach of our forging operations. McWilliams operates both hammer and screw presses for open and closed die forging. In July 2007, we completed the acquisition of Caledonian, the market leader in providing nickel superalloy and titanium revert management solutions for the aerospace and industrial gas turbine (IGT) markets. Revert includes metal chips, casting gates, bar ends, forging flash, and other byproducts from casting, forging, and fastener manufacturing processes that can be re melted and reused. The acquisition of Caledonian provides us with the infrastructure and capabilities needed to create a closed loop system for the retention and reuse of internally generated revert. In addition, Caledonian provides access to new sources of material outside the Company and helps determine optimal utilization of revert streams throughout our melting operations worldwide. During the third quarter of fiscal 2008, Greenville Metals, a metal processing operation, became part of the Forged Products segment to take advantage of synergies with Caledonian. Greenville Metals was formerly a business in the Investment Cast Products segment. Also, during the year, we continued to increase manufacturing capacity to support growth in our core markets with completion or initiation of various large scale capital expenditure projects, primarily within the Forged Products segment. We expect fiscal 2009 capital expenditures will be approximately 10 20 percent higher than fiscal 2008 spending levels, with the most significant capacity expansion projects planned within the Investment Cast Products segment to support record demand for IGT products. Looking ahead, we will continue to capitalize on our strong foundation across all markets. We are well positioned on existing as well as new and expanding aerospace platforms, driven by continuing increases in OEM aircraft build rates, high aircraft utilization rates, and an expanding aerospace customer base. We also expect to benefit from solid growth in demand for IGT components and extruded pipe products serving the power generation market, as well as further market penetration in our non aerospace nickel alloys serving the oil and gas, chemical processing and pollution control industries. 22 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Increase/(Decrease) 2008 2007 $ % Net sales $ 6,852.1 $ 5,319.4 $ 1,523.7 29% Cost of goods sold 4,982.3 4,020.2 962.1 24 Selling and administrative expenses 358.9 332.7 26.2 8 Restructuring and asset impairment 6.1 6.1 N/A Interest expense, net 42.3 52.2 (9.9) (19) Income before income tax and minority interest 1,462.5 914.3 548.2 60 Income tax expense 495.4 303.1 192.3 63 Minority interest (1.2) (1.4) 0.2 (14) Net income from continuing operations 965.9 609.8 356.1 58 Net income from discontinued operations 21.4 23.3 (1.9) (8) Net income $ 987.3 $ 633.1 $ 354.2 56% Net income per share from continuing operations (basic) $ 6.99 $ 4.48 $ 2.51 56% Net income per share from discontinued operations (basic) 0.16 0.18 (0.02) (11) Net income per share (basic) $ 7.15 $ 4.66 $ 2.49 53% Net income per share from continuing operations (diluted) $ 6.89 $ 4.42 $ 2.47 56% Net income per share from discontinued operations (diluted) 0.15 0.17 (0.02) (12) Net income per share (diluted) $ 7.04 $ 4.59 $ 2.45 53% Fiscal Year Increase/(Decrease) Sales by Market 2008 2007 $ % Aerospace $ 3,768.3 $ 2,825.3 $ 943.0 33% % of total 55% 53% Power Generation 1,614.6 1,131.7 482.9 43 % of total 24% 21% General Industrial 1,118.0 1,041.8 76.2 7 % of total 16% 20% Automotive 351.2 320.6 30.6 10 % of total 5% 6% Total Sales $ 6,852.1 $ 5,319.4 $ 1,532.7 29% % of total 100% 100% Average market price of key metals Fiscal Year Increase/(Decrease) (per pound) 2008 2007 $ % Nickel $ 15.27 $ 13.32 $ 1.95 15% London Metals Exchange (1) Titanium $ 6.73 $ 15.20 $ (8.47) (56)% Ti 6 4 bulk, Metalprices.com Cobalt $ 34.36 $ 19.78 $ 14.58 74% Metal Bulletin COFM.8 Index (1) (1) Source: Bloomberg Total sales for fiscal 2008 were $6,852.1 million, an increase of $1,523.7 million, or 29 percent, from fiscal 2007 sales of $5,319.4 million. Total aerospace sales increased 33 percent over fiscal 2007 levels, and increased from 53 percent of total sales in fiscal 2007 to 55 percent of total sales in fiscal 2008. Power generation sales increased 43 percent over fiscal 2007 levels, and increased from 21 percent of total sales in fiscal 2007 to 24 percent of total sales in fiscal 2008. Sales to the general industrial markets increased 7 percent over the prior year, and decreased from 20 percent of total sales in fiscal 2007 to 16 percent of total sales in fiscal 2008. Sales to the automotive market grew by 10 percent, decreasing from 6 percent of total sales in fiscal 2007 to 5 percent of total sales in fiscal 2008. The 23 Table of Contents acquisitions of GSC, Cherry, McWilliams and Caledonian collectively contributed approximately $315 million of the year over year increase. The remaining increase in sales was principally driven by continued strength in our core aerospace and power generation markets. In addition, contractual pass through pricing of higher material costs increased sales by approximately $460.9 million this year versus approximately $299.0 million in fiscal 2007. With regard to growth in the commercial aircraft industry, aircraft deliveries increased 8 percent in calendar 2007 from calendar 2006, and forecasts from The Airline Monitor as of January 2008 indicate aircraft deliveries are expected to increase approximately 13 percent in calendar year 2008. Due to manufacturing lead times, our production volumes are approximately 6 to 9 months ahead of aircraft deliveries. Cost of goods sold was $4,982.3 million, or 73 percent of sales, in fiscal 2008 as compared to $4,020.2 million, or 76 percent of sales, in fiscal 2007. The improvement in the year over year percentage reflects the impact of leverage from higher sales volume and improved operating efficiencies, partially offset by increased raw material costs in fiscal 2008, primarily nickel and cobalt, which have increased approximately 15 percent and 74 percent, respectively, on the London Metals Exchange and Metal Bulletin COFM.8 Index, respectively, compared to fiscal 2007. Selling and administrative expenses were $358.9 million, or 5 percent of sales, in fiscal 2008 compared to $332.7 million, or 6 percent of sales, in fiscal 2007. The improved year over year percentage was primarily due to leverage from the higher sales volume and lower expense related to our deferred compensation plan compared to the prior year, partially offset by increased stock based compensation expense. Net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2008 was $965.9 million, or $6.89 per share (diluted), which included restructuring charges totaling $0.03 per share (diluted). By comparison, net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2007 was $609.8 million, or $4.42 per share (diluted). Fiscal 2007 net income from continuing operations included tax benefits of $11.1 million, or $0.08 per share (diluted), associated with tax refund claims and changes in tax reserves resulting from completed and ongoing audits. Fiscal 2008 net income (including discontinued operations) was $987.3 million, or $7.04 per share (diluted), compared with net income of $633.1 million, or $4.59 per share (diluted) in fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2008 net income includes income of $21.4 million, or $0.15 per share (diluted), from discontinued operations, compared to income of $23.3 million, or 0.17 per share (diluted), in the prior year. Business acquisitions Fiscal 2008 On July 5, 2007, we acquired Caledonian Alloys for $208.1 million in cash, of which $165.1 million was paid at close, and we expect two additional contingent payments of approximately $21.5 million each will be paid over the two years subsequent to acquisition. Caledonian is a market leader in providing nickel superalloy and titanium revert management solutions for the aerospace and IGT industries. Revert includes metal chips, casting gates, bar ends, forging flash, and other byproducts from casting, forging, and fastener manufacturing processes that can be re melted and reused. Headquartered in Livingston, Scotland, Caledonian employs approximately 300 people and operates nine revert processing facilities in six countries. The Caledonian acquisition is a stock purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of the Forged Products segment. On April 3, 2007, we acquired McWilliams, a privately held company headquartered in Rockaway, New Jersey, for $91.4 million in cash. Founded in 1880, McWilliams is a leading manufacturer of titanium, nickel and steel forgings, primarily for commercial and military aerospace applications. The company, which employs approximately 120 people at its New Jersey facility, operates both hammer and screw presses for open and closed die forging. The McWilliams acquisition is an asset purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of the Forged Products segment. Fiscal 2007 On February 23, 2007, we acquired Cherry from Acument Global Technologies, Inc. (Acument) for $298.1 million in cash. Founded in 1939, Cherry encompasses the aerospace operations of Acument, formerly Textron Fastening Systems, and is a manufacturer of aerospace rivets and blind bolts. Cherry employs approximately 500 people at its facility in Santa Ana, California. Cherry fills a gap in our product line of critical aerospace fasteners and opens up potential synergies and economies of scale with our other fastener operations. The Cherry acquisition is an asset purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of the Fastener Products segment. 24 Table of Contents On February 2, 2007, we acquired GSC, a manufacturer of aluminum and steel structural investment castings for aerospace, energy, medical, and other end markets for $77.1 million in cash. GSC employed approximately 375 people at its operations in Ogden, Utah and Saltillo, Mexico. The Mexico operation was closed subsequent to the acquisition. GSC enhances our small structural investment casting portfolio with its ability to produce larger components. The GSC acquisition is an asset purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of the Investment Cast Products segment. On May 25, 2006, we acquired SMC, a manufacturer of high performance nickel based alloys and superalloys, which are sold internally and to third party customers. SMC provides our forging operations with nickel based alloys for manufacturing aerospace components, enabling us to manage our overall value stream more cost effectively from raw material to forged components. The aggregate purchase price was $548.1 million, which principally includes $310.6 million for the purchase of shares and $240.1 million for the repayment of SMCs outstanding debt and related termination costs, partially offset by $22.3 million of cash acquired. The SMC acquisition is a stock purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of the Forged Products segment. Fiscal 2006 On January 6, 2006, we acquired the Shur Lok Group, which includes the Shur Lok Corporation in Irvine, California, and Shur Lok International located in Petit Rechain, Belgium, for approximately $113.0 million. Shur Lok is a manufacturer of highly engineered, critical aerospace fasteners, including inserts, barrel nuts, adjustable diameter bolts, fluid fittings and lock nuts. The Shur Lok product line enhances the basket of fastener products we can offer to our commercial airframe customers, while increasing market reach into other critical fastener applications. The Shur Lok acquisition is an asset purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of the Fastener Products segment. Discontinued operations Our financial statements were impacted by activities relating to the planned or completed divestiture of a number of our businesses. These businesses have been accounted for under SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. Accordingly, any operating results of these businesses are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Operations as discontinued operations, net of income tax, and all prior periods have been reclassified. Fiscal 2008 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we entered into an agreement to sell the Unbrako fastener business headquartered in Shannon, Ireland. The transaction is anticipated to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Unbrako has been reclassified from the Fastener Products segment to discontinued operations. Also in the fourth quarter, we decided to close the Kladno alloy manufacturing business located in the Czech Republic. Kladno primarily supplied steel ingots to Wyman Gordons Grafton, Massachusetts operation. Kladno has been reclassified from the Forged Products segment to discontinued operations. In January 2008, we completed the sale of Rescal for approximately $11.2 million. Rescal, which is located in France, was acquired with SMC and has been held for sale since the first quarter of fiscal 2007. The sale of the business generated a tax effected gain of $4.6 million, or $0.03 per share (diluted) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. In January 2008, we completed the sale of Shape Memory Alloys (SMA) for $30.2 million. The SMA business was acquired with SMC in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, and was reclassified from the Forged Products segment to discontinued operations during the third quarter of fiscal 2008. The sale of the business generated a tax effected gain of $16.3 million, or $0.12 per share (diluted), of which $4.0 million, or $0.03 per share (diluted), was recognized in the third quarter of fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2007 In the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we sold our interest in Wyman Gordon FRISA to our 50% joint venture partner for $30.0 million in cash. In addition, the buyer assumed and subsequently repaid $17.4 million of debt 25 Table of Contents upon closing. At the time of the closing, the joint venture entity operated a manufacturing facility located in Mexico that was engaged in the manufacture of forged products using the ring rolling process. FRISA was reclassified from the Forged Products segment to discontinued operations. In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we decided to sell the refiner rebuild business of J&L Fiber Services and close our AFT Composites business. These businesses were reclassified from the former Industrial Products segment (now the Fastener Products segment) to discontinued operations. Both transactions were completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2007. Restructuring, asset impairment and other non recurring charges We regularly assess our cost structure to ensure that operations are properly sized for prevailing market conditions, taking into consideration current and forecasted conditions in markets we serve. The following restructuring and asset impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 2008 and 2006. Fiscal 2008 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Investment Cast Products segment recorded restructuring charges of $6.1 million, primarily for shut down costs associated with an underutilized machining operation located in the United Kingdom. The tax effected impact of these charges was $4.3 million, or $0.03 per share (diluted). Fiscal 2006 During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we recorded restructuring and asset impairment charges of $2.3 million, which included $1.7 million primarily for the write down of a building and equipment to fair value related to consolidation of a machining operation in the Investment Cast Products segment, and $0.6 million for severance costs associated with headcount reductions related to downsizing a tooling operation in Ireland. The tax effected impact of these charges was $1.9 million, or $0.01 per share (diluted). Outlook Looking forward to fiscal 2009, we are well positioned for continued success and profitable growth. We see a continuation of growing demand from all our major markets, and our manufacturing operations are prepared to take advantage of volume leverage and opportunities for cost reduction. We have ramped up capital spending in the last two years to increase production capacity, and we expect additional capital spending in fiscal 2009 to further increase capacity to meet growing demand in our core markets. We will be fully prepared to meet the increased demand from our aerospace customers as new production programs such as the Airbus A380, Boeing 787, F 35 fighter, and KC X tanker come on line. On the IGT front, major turbine programs currently in production and new platforms in development are providing significant growth opportunities across an expanded customer base. Extruded pipe has a growing backlog extending more than 24 months, and our non aerospace nickel alloy operations are steadily opening up new market opportunities. In concert with this top line growth, we have a full pipeline of projects designed to streamline our manufacturing plants and to reduce costs quarter after quarter. We expect fiscal 2009 sales to grow organically by approximately 8 to 10 percent, driven by strong conditions in our core markets and our increased manufacturing capacity. We believe changes in metal prices will continue to impact sales growth during fiscal 2009, as we have already begun to see raw material costs, primarily nickel, decline in the last two quarters. In addition, continued growth in intercompany sales, particularly within our Forged Products segment, will have an impact on reported sales as capacity is utilized for internal demands and these sales are eliminated in consolidation. Internal supply allows us to manage our overall value stream more cost effectively from raw material to forged component. Operating income is expected to benefit from the sales volume increases and continued operational improvements, and operating margin as a percent of sales is also expected to show modest improvement over fiscal 2008 levels principally due to leverage from higher sales volume and improved operating performance across all segments. As in prior years, we will remain active on the acquisition front, continually assessing the strategic fit and value of businesses that have potential for success within our existing framework. At the same time, we will continually assess the suitability and management of our existing businesses in order to maintain our strong financial position and competitive profile. 26 Table of Contents Financial results by segment We analyze our operating segments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 131, Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, and manage our business across three reportable segments: Investment Cast Products, Forged Products and Fastener Products. Effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2008, PCCs Greenville Metals, a metal processing operation, was moved from the Investment Cast Products segment to the Forged Products segment to better align Greenville Metals business with synergies associated with the recent acquisition of Caledonian Alloys. All prior periods have been reclassified to reflect the change in reportable segments. Segment operating income amounts presented below exclude restructuring and asset impairment charges.

(3) Forged Products: Includes intersegment sales of $41.0 million, $7.1 million and $0.9 million for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. (4) Fastener Products: Includes intersegment sales of $2.3 million, $1.8 million and $0.6 million for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 27 Table of Contents Investment Cast Products The Investment Cast Products segment includes PCC Structurals, PCC Airfoils and Specialty Materials and Alloys Group (SMAG). These businesses manufacture investment castings, or provide related investment casting materials and alloys, for aircraft engines, IGT engines, airframes, armaments, medical prostheses and other industrial applications. Fiscal Year % Increase/(Decrease) 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 Sales by Market Aerospace $ 1,314.5 $ 1,133.2 $ 1,019.9 16% 11% % of total 61% 65% 65% Power Generation 567.8 409.5 371.8 39 10 % of total 26% 23% 24% General Industrial 251.1 196.0 166.5 28 18 % of total 12% 11% 10% Automotive 26.6 9.6 13.6 177 (29 ) % of total 1% 1% 1% Total Sales $ 2,160.0 $ 1,748.3 $ 1,571.8 24% 11% % of total 100% 100% 100% Operating income $ 521.8 $ 382.3 $ 315.2 36% 21% % of sales 24.2% 21.9% 20.1% Fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 The Investment Cast Products segment reported fiscal 2008 sales of $2,160.0 million, an increase of 24 percent from the prior years sales of $1,748.3 million. Approximately $45 million, or 11 percent of this increase reflects incremental sales of GSC, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. The remaining increase in sales reflects growth in the commercial and regional aerospace markets and strengthening demand in the IGT power generation businesses. Sales also include $100.4 million of higher pricing related to contractual pass through of increased material costs compared to $55.8 million last year. Operating income for the Investment Cast Products segment was $521.8 million or 24.2 percent of sales in fiscal 2008, compared to $382.3 million, or 21.9 percent of sales, in fiscal 2007. The increase in operating income reflects the impact of higher sales volume, partially offset by higher raw material costs, primarily nickel and cobalt, which have increased approximately 15 percent and 74 percent, respectively, on the London Metals Exchange and Metal Bulletin COFM.8 Index, respectively, compared to fiscal 2007. The continued improvement in operating margins as a percent of sales was driven by leverage from the increased sales volume and improved manufacturing performance, partially offset by the impact of higher raw material costs and pass through pricing. While the majority of the higher material costs were recovered from contractual terms allowing for pass through pricing and protect operating income, they dilute operating income as a percent of sales. Contractual material pass through pricing diluted operating margins by 1.2 percentage points in fiscal 2008 compared to 0.7 percentage points last year. The Investment Cast Products segment anticipates higher sales in fiscal 2009, primarily driven by increased demand from commercial aerospace and IGT customers. Additional capacity expansion projects are planned for completion in fiscal 2009 to accommodate higher demand for IGT products. Operating margins, as a percent of sales, are expected to improve slightly in fiscal 2009 as a result of leverage from the higher sales volume and continued improvements in operating efficiencies. Fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 The Investment Cast Products segment reported fiscal 2007 sales of $1,748.3 million and operating income of $382.3 million, or 21.9 percent of sales. Fiscal 2007 sales increased 11 percent from the prior years $1,571.8 million, and operating income increased by 21 percent over the prior years $315.2 million, or 20.1 percent of sales. The 28 Table of Contents increase in sales reflected growth in the commercial and military aerospace markets, strengthening demand in the aerospace aftermarket businesses, and the addition of sales from GSC. The increase in operating income principally reflected the impact of the higher sales volume and improved performance, partially offset by lower selling prices from contractual agreements. In addition, material pass through pricing for fiscal 2007 contributed $55.8 million to sales, diluting operating margins by 0.7 percentage points, compared to fiscal 2006 pass through pricing of $18.3 million, diluting operating margins by 0.2 percentage points. Forged Products The Forged Products segment includes the operations of Wyman Gordon and SMC, which was acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. These businesses manufacture forged components from sophisticated titanium and nickel based alloys principally for the aerospace and power generation markets, or manufacture nickel and cobalt based alloys used to produce forged components for aerospace and non aerospace markets which include products for oil and gas, chemical processing, and pollution control applications. The segment also provides nickel superalloy and titanium revert management solutions, re melting various material byproducts and reusing them in casting, forging, and fastener manufacturing processes. Forged Products sales to the aerospace and power generation markets are derived primarily from the same large engine customers served by the Investment Cast Products segment, with additional aerospace sales going to manufacturers of landing gear and other airframe components. The Forged Products segment also produces extruded pipe for the power generation and the oil and gas industries. Fiscal Year % Increase/(Decrease) 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 Sales by Market Aerospace $ 1,476.1 $ 1,024.0 $ 556.4 44% 84% % of total 47% 44% 62% Power Generation 1,028.5 703.4 254.6 46 176 % of total 32% 30% 28% General Industrial 574.9 558.9 77.1 3 625 % of total 18% 23% 9% Automotive 88.6 64.3 5.0 38 1,186 % of total 3% 3% 1% Total Sales $ 3,168.1 $ 2,350.6 $ 893.1 35% 163% % of total 100% 100% 100% Operating income $ 699.5 $ 409.5 $ 113.3 71% 261% % of sales 22.1% 17.4% 12.7% Fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 The Forged Products segment reported fiscal 2008 sales of $3,168.1 million, an increase of 35 percent from the prior years sales of $2,350.6 million. Approximately $150 million or 18 percent of the increase in sales from the prior year reflects the acquisitions of McWilliams and Caledonian. The remaining increase in year over year sales was driven by increased demand for aerospace products, improving demand in the North American market for extruded pipe, and a full year of sales from SMC compared to 10 months in the prior year. Sales of extruded pipe increased 38 percent year over year, from $272.6 million in fiscal 2007 to $375.8 million in fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2008 sales also include $345.9 million of higher contractual pricing related to pass through of increased raw material costs, compared to $224.4 million last year. In the current year, the Forged Products segment dedicated more resources for internal production which impacts top line revenues. Total intercompany sales, including sales within and between segments, increased from $258.4 million in fiscal 2007 to $642.4 million in the current year; these sales are eliminated in consolidation. Operating income for the Forged Products segment was $699.5 million or 22.1 percent of sales in fiscal 2008, compared to $409.5 million, or 17.4 percent of sales, in fiscal 2007. Operating income as a percent of sales benefited from increased sales volume, which included increased sales of higher margin power generation 29 Table of Contents products, and from implementation of successful cost reduction initiatives. In addition to continuing improvements from base businesses, SMC continued to make significant margin improvements throughout the year, which were driven by continuing yield improvements, higher production volumes, and inventory reductions. These improvements were partially offset by higher material costs, primarily nickel and cobalt, which have increased approximately 15 percent and 74 percent, respectively, on the London Metals Exchange and Metal Bulletin COFM.8 Index, respectively, compared to fiscal 2007. The contractual pass through of higher raw material costs diluted operating margins by 2.7 percentage points in fiscal 2008 compared to 1.8 percentage points last year. Sales within this segment are expected to increase in fiscal 2009 consistent with growth in the commercial aerospace markets as well as solid growth in extruded pipe sales and other power generation markets. While we expect increases in alloy production volume year over year, the segment is expected to continue to moderately grow its internal supply of materials in fiscal 2009, which will have a negative impact on reported top line revenues. Operating income as a percent of sales is expected to show continued improvement, benefiting from the leverage of higher sales volume and further cost reductions. Fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 The Forged Products segment reported fiscal 2007 sales of $2,350.6 million and operating income of $409.5 million, or 17.4 percent of sales. Fiscal 2007 sales increased 163 percent from the prior years sales of $893.1 million, and operating income increased by 261 percent over the prior years operating income of $113.3 million, or 12.7 percent of sales. The increase in year over year sales was driven by the addition of 10 months of sales from SMC, increased demand for aerospace products, continued penetration in the Asian power generation market, and improving demand in the North American market for extruded pipe. Operating income as a percent of sales benefited from increased sales volume of higher margin power generation components, as well as from the impact of successful cost reduction initiatives. In addition to continuing improvements from base businesses, SMC exceeded initial projections and rapidly accelerated its progress in improving yields, increasing production volumes and reducing inventories, thereby significantly improving operating margins each quarter in its first 10 months of operation under PCC. Fiscal 2007 sales also included $224.4 million of higher pricing related to pass through of increased raw material costs compared to $110.6 million in fiscal 2006, diluting operating margins by 1.8 percent in each period. Fastener Products The Fastener Products segment includes the Aerospace Fasteners and Engineered Fasteners groups. In addition, the segment includes the integration of the former Industrial Products segment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. The businesses that comprise this segment produce fasteners, fastener systems and components for critical applications in the aerospace, automotive and industrial machinery markets. Fiscal Year % Increase/(Decrease) 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 Sales by Market Aerospace $ 977.7 $ 668.0 $ 467.9 46% 43% % of total 64% 55% 47% Power Generation 18.4 18.8 14.9 (2 ) 26 % of total 1% 1% 1% General Industrial & Other 291.9 287.0 276.6 2 4 % of total 19% 24% 27% Automotive 236.0 246.7 255.4 (4 ) (3 ) % of total 16% 20% 25% Total Sales $ 1,524.0 $ 1,220.5 $ 1,014.8 25% 20% % of total 100% 100% 100% Operating income $ 384.2 $ 261.7 $ 174.2 47% 50% % of sales 25.2% 21.4% 17.2% 30 Table of Contents Fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 The Fastener Products segment reported fiscal 2008 sales of $1,524.0 million, a 25 percent increase from fiscal 2007 sales of $1,220.5 million. The increase in sales primarily resulted from higher sales from the Aerospace Fastener operations, of which approximately $121 million represented incremental sales from a full year of Cherry Aerospace, acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Sales from the Engineered Fastener and industrial products operations decreased 3 percent year over year, principally due to weaker demand from the automotive industry. Operating income for the Fasteners segment was $384.2 million or 25.2 percent of sales in fiscal 2008, compared to $261.7 million, or 21.4 percent of sales, in fiscal 2007. The improvement in operating margins reflected leverage from the increased sales volume and increased sales in the higher margin aerospace business, as well as the impact of continued efforts to reduce costs and improve manufacturing processes. Sales and operating income within the Fastener Products segment are expected to grow during fiscal 2009 as a result of increased sales volume to the aerospace market resulting from strong aerospace demand, continued market share gains, and qualification of existing capacity from automotive to aerospace production, partially offset by soft conditions in the North American automotive market. Operating income as a percent of sales is also expected to improve due to continuing cost take outs and leverage from higher sales. Fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 The Fastener Products segment reported fiscal 2007 sales of $1,220.5 million and operating income of $261.7 million, or 21.4 percent of sales. Fiscal 2007 sales increased 20 percent from the prior years sales of $1,014.8 million, and operating income increased by 50 percent over the prior years operating income of $174.2 million, or 17.2 percent of sales. The increase in sales was due to the addition of sales from Cherry Aerospace (acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007) and a full year of sales from Shur Lok (acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006), and the favorable impact of strong aerospace sales, partially offset by weaker demand from the automotive industry. The improvement in operating margins reflected leverage from the increased sales volume and higher margin aerospace business, as well as the impact of continued efforts to reduce costs and improve manufacturing processes. Interest and taxes Net interest expense in fiscal 2008 was $42.3 million, compared with $52.2 million in fiscal 2007. The lower net interest expense was due to reduced debt levels, lower borrowing rates, and higher interest income compared to the prior year. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was 33.9 percent, compared with 33.2 percent in fiscal 2007. The slight increase in tax rate was principally due to reduced tax benefits from audit settlements in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007, and the loss of the extraterritorial income exclusion benefit in 2008, which is partially offset by a larger U.S. manufacturing deduction in 2008. Liquidity and capital resources Total assets of $6,050.1 million at March 30, 2008 represented a $791.4 million increase from the $5,258.7 million balance at April 1, 2007. This increase was driven by the addition of McWilliams and Caledonian assets totaling $388.2 million, and by increased inventories and receivables to support continuing revenue growth in the base businesses. Total capitalization at March 30, 2008, was $4,400.0 million, consisting of $355.0 million of debt and $4,045.0 million of equity. The debt to capitalization ratio declined to 8.1% at March 30, 2008 from 23.5% at the end of fiscal 2007. Cash as of March 30, 2008 was $221.3 million, up $70.9 million from the end of fiscal 2007, and total debt was $355.0 million, down $518.0 million since the end of fiscal 2007. Debt net of cash, which includes $0.3 million of acquired debt from Caledonian, decreased from $722.6 million at the end of fiscal 2007 to $133.7 million at March 30, 2008, reflecting $589.2 million of positive cash flow for fiscal 2008. Excluding cash payments for the acquisitions of Cherry, McWilliams and Caledonian ($254.2 million), and for voluntary pension contributions 31 Table of Contents ($63.0 million), cash flow for fiscal 2008 totaled $906.4 million. This positive net cash flow consisted primarily of $976.7 million from operating activities (adjusted for voluntary pension contributions), $52.3 million from various asset dispositions and business divestitures, and $96.8 million from the issuance of common stock and related tax benefit, partially offset by capital expenditures of $226.3 million and dividend payments of $16.6 million. Capital spending of $226.3 million in fiscal 2008 principally provided for equipment maintenance and upgrades, capacity expansion, cost reduction and safety projects. The capital spending plan for fiscal 2009, which is anticipated to be approximately 10 to 20 percent higher than capital spending in fiscal 2008, provides for additional capacity expansion, cost reduction, and equipment maintenance and upgrades throughout the company. We believe we will be able to meet our short and longer term liquidity needs for working capital, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, capital spending, cash dividends, scheduled repayment of debt and potential acquisitions from cash generated from operations, borrowing from existing or new bank credit facilities, issuance of public or privately placed debt securities, or the issuance of equity instruments. Contractual obligations and commercial commitments We are obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements and lease agreements. The following table represents our contractual cash obligations as of March 30, 2008 and the estimated timing of future cash payments: Contractual Cash Obligations Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Long term debt $ 354.9 $ 20.0 $ 55.1 $ 15.1 $ 14.5 $ 35.0 $ 215.2 Operating leases (1) 77.0 20.4 15.8 10.4 8.0 6.6 15.8 Interest on fixed rate debt 78.0 16.3 14.9 13.5 12.9 12.1 8.3 Interest on variable rate debt (2) 1.6 0.1 0.3 0.9 0.3 Acquisition related obligation 43.0 21.5 21.5 Total $ 554.5 $ 78.3 $ 107.6 $ 39.0 $ 35.4 $ 54.6 $ 239.6 (1) Operating lease obligations include $6.8 million attributable to an operation held for sale. (2) Interest on variable rate debt is based on current prevailing interest rates. Our reserve for uncertain tax positions on March 30, 2008 was $29.6 million. Due to the uncertainties associated with settling these liabilities, we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these liabilities. As a result, our reserve for unrecognized tax benefits is excluded from the table above. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our reserve for uncertain tax positions. The table above also excludes estimated required cash contributions to our qualified pension plans totaling approximately $96.8 million over the next five years: $15.3 million in fiscal 2009, $15.6 million in fiscal 2010, $20.3 million in fiscal 2011, $22.7 million in fiscal 2012 and $22.9 million in fiscal 2013. We also have benefit payments due under our non qualified pension and other post retirement benefit plans that are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Critical accounting policies We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout the Managements Discussion and Analysis where such policies affect reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other significant accounting policies, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report. Note that the preparation of this Annual Report requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. 32 Table of Contents Revenue recognition We recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete. This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the contract or purchase order, ownership and risk of loss have passed to the customer, collectibility is reasonably assured, and pricing is fixed and determinable. In instances where title does not pass to the customer upon shipment, we recognize revenue upon delivery or customer acceptance, depending on terms of the sales agreement. Service sales, representing maintenance and engineering activities, are recognized as services are performed. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in revenue. Valuation of inventories All inventories are stated at the lower of the cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. Cost for inventories at a significant number of our operations is determined on a last in, first out (LIFO) basis. The average inventory cost method is utilized for most other inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based on the age, historical usage or assumptions about future demand for the inventory. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and reported operating results. Goodwill and acquired intangibles From time to time, we acquire businesses in purchase transactions that typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets, which may affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges. The determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the consolidated financial statements. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment and when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Testing for goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations. Such models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions primarily based on future cash flows, expected market growth rate, our estimates of sales volumes, sales prices and related costs, and discount rate applied. Management uses the best available information at the time fair values of the reporting units are estimated; however, changes to managements assumptions used during the impairment testing could affect the consolidated financial statements. Environmental costs The estimated future costs for known environmental remediation requirements are accrued on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of remediation costs can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of amounts is established, and no amount within the range is better than another, the minimum amount of the range is recorded. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when collection is probable. Adjustments to our accruals may be necessary to reflect new information as investigation and remediation efforts proceed. The amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period, but any amounts, and the possible range of any amounts in excess of those already accrued, are not reasonably estimable at this time. Total environmental reserves accrued at March 30, 2008 and April 1, 2007 were $84.0 million and $74.3 million, respectively. Generally, the increase in environmental reserves over the prior year reflects existing liabilities associated with our acquisitions, as discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and is not the result of newly discovered environmental liabilities. In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143 (FIN 47). FIN 47 clarified the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 143 and requires a liability to be recorded if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. Asset retirement obligations covered 33 Table of Contents by this Interpretation include those for which an entity has a large obligation to perform an asset retirement activity, however the timing or method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may not be within the control of the entity. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. In accordance with SFAS No. 143 and FIN 47, we record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liability can be reasonably estimated. Currently, we have identified a known asset retirement obligation associated with environmental contamination at one of our manufacturing facilities. However, we have not recognized a liability under FIN 47 for this retirement obligation because the fair value of remediation at this site cannot be reasonably estimated since the settlement date is unknown at this time. The settlement date is unknown because remediation of this site is not required until production ceases, and we have no current or future plans to cease production. This asset retirement obligation, when estimable, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows or business. Income taxes Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pre tax earnings based on current tax law and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Beginning in fiscal 2008, we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). As a result, we report a liability resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. Recently issued accounting standards In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (SFAS No. 162). SFAS No. 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and establishes the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements that are presented in conformity with GAAP. SFAS No. 162 shall be effective 60 days following the SECs approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) amendments to AU Section 411, The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity With Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The adoption will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. On March 19, 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS No. 161). This new standard requires enhanced disclosures for derivative instruments, including those used in hedging activities. SFAS No. 161 is effective for periods beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The adoption of SFAS No. 161 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. On December 4, 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (Revised), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141(R)), and SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS No. 160). These new standards are the U.S. GAAP outcome of a joint project with the International Accounting Standards Board. SFAS No. 141(R) and SFAS No. 160 introduce significant changes in the accounting for and reporting of business acquisitions and noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary. SFAS No. 141(R) and SFAS No. 160 continue the movement toward the greater use of fair values in financial reporting and increased transparency through expanded disclosures. SFAS No. 141(R) changes how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements at the acquisition date and in subsequent periods. SFAS No. 160 requires noncontrolling interests (previously referred to as minority interests) to be reported as a component of equity, which changes the accounting for transactions with noncontrolling interest holders. SFAS No. 141(R) and SFAS No. 160 are effective for our fiscal 2010. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) and SFAS No. 160 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 34 Table of Contents In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective beginning in fiscal 2009. The adoption of SFAS No. 159 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP, and also expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. On February 12, 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS No. 157 2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, which defers the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually), to fiscal years and interim periods beginning in fiscal 2010. SFAS No. 157, as it applies to financial assets and financial liabilities, is effective beginning in fiscal 2009. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK At various times, we use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and prices of strategic raw materials. Fluctuations in the market values of such derivative instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the underlying economic exposures that the instruments are intended to hedge. Because derivative instruments are used solely as hedges and not for speculative trading purposes, they do not represent incremental risk to the Company. For further discussion of derivative financial instruments, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Interest Rate Risk We have variable rate debt obligations that expose us to interest rate risk. If market interest rates had averaged 10 percent higher than actual levels in fiscal 2008 or 2007, the effect on our interest expense and net income would not have been material. Foreign Currency Risk The majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars; however, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies for transactions denominated in other currencies. As discussed in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, we had foreign currency hedges in place at March 30, 2008 and April 1, 2007 to reduce such exposure. The estimated loss in fair value on foreign currency hedges outstanding as of March 30, 2008, from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in exchange rates relative to USD, would not have been material. Material Cost Risk As discussed in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, we had entered into long term supply agreements to fix the purchase price of strategic raw materials at March 30, 2008 and April 1, 2007. In addition, we had escalation clauses related to raw material pricing in certain of our contracts at March 30, 2008 and April 1, 2007. If market rates had averaged 10 percent higher than actual levels in either fiscal 2008 or 2007, the effect on our cost of sales and net earnings, after considering the effects of these agreements and contracts, would not have been material. 36 Table of Contents
