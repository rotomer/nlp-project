ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (in millions, except per share data) Business overview Our businesses responded aggressively in a very challenging environment in fiscal 2009, attaining record levels of sales, operating income, net income from continuing operations, and earnings per share in the face of weakening foreign currency versus the U.S. dollar, lower average material prices, and a strike at a major aerospace customer. These results were principally driven by continuing strong conditions in our power generation markets and solid aerospace fastener growth, in addition to disciplined cost reduction and operational improvements across all of our segments. Also, during the year, we successfully acquired three strategically important acquisitions within the Forged and Fasteners Products segments. On December 4, 2008, we acquired Hackney Ladish Holding Corp. (Hackney Ladish), a leading producer of forged pipe fittings for critical energy infrastructure and related applications. With more than 80 years of experience manufacturing pipe fittings, Hackney Ladish offers the widest range of product types and sizes in the industry. Fittings are used in piping systems throughout the energy value chain, from drilling through processing and storage. Hackney Ladishs products connect pipe, change the direction of flow, increase or reduce pipe sizes, join or separate flow, or cap pipe ends. This acquisition extends our reach into oil and gas markets and provides profitable growth opportunities for our seamless pipe and nickel alloy tubing operations. Headquartered in Dallas, Texas, Hackney Ladish operates manufacturing facilities in Russellville, Arkansas and Enid, Oklahoma. The Hackney Ladish acquisition is a stock purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of the Forged Products segment. On November 21, 2008, we acquired Fatigue Technology, Inc. (FTI), headquartered in Seattle, Washington. FTI pioneered the cold expansion process in 1969 and is the technology leader in fatigue life extension for both metal and composite airframe fastener holes. FTI has taken this foundation of creating a residual stress field around a cold worked hole to develop innovative solutions that significantly reduce manufacturing and maintenance flow time and costs. The resulting components are easier and faster to install, and the methods of aircraft assembly are enhanced. This acquisition continues our strategy of expanding into additional critical aerospace fastener products, thus offering our customers a wider selection of fasteners to meet all of their requirements. The FTI acquisition is an asset purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of the Fastener Products segment. On September 30, 2008, we acquired Airdrome Holdings, LLC (Airdrome), which consists of Airdrome Precision Components (APC) and AF Aerospace Ltd. (AFA). APC, located in Long Beach, California, is a leading supplier of hydraulic and pneumatic fluid fittings primarily for airframe applications. AFA, located in Rugby, England, manufactures a variety of machined components for aerospace applications, including fittings and other fluid conveyance products, ultra high tensile bolts, and machined details. Fluid fittings, manufactured in nickel, titanium, and stainless steel alloys, are the critical connectors for hoses transporting fuel, hydraulic fluid, and pneumatic pressure throughout an aircraft. This acquisition also fits our strategy of enhancing our critical aerospace fastener family of products to serve our customers better. The Airdrome acquisition is an asset purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of the Fastener Products segment. Also, during the year, we continued to increase manufacturing capacity to support growth in our core markets with completion or initiation of various large scale capital expenditure projects, primarily within the Investment Cast Products segment. We expect fiscal 2010 capital expenditures will be approximately 5 to 10 percent lower than fiscal 2009 spending levels, with the most significant equipment upgrade and capacity expansion projects planned within the Forged Products and Investment Cast Products segments to support production demand. We fully understand the challenges ahead of us through the first and second quarters of fiscal 2010. Our aerospace customers are making corrections to their inventories that will take some anticipated growth out of their schedules and will impact each of our three operating segments. The second quarter will also have its seasonal challenges of scheduled forge shutdowns for maintenance and extended holidays in our European operations. We are taking decisive actions on every front. We expect to see opportunities throughout our businesses to reduce operating costs and to continue to deliver strong margin performance, including higher productivity, more effective material utilization, higher yields, and lower scrap and rework. Looking ahead, we will continue to capitalize on our 23 Table of Contents strong foundation across all markets. Industrial gas turbine (IGT) aftermarket sales are growing, and we continue to gain market share and expand our customer base, countering any softening in our base OEM sales. The seamless pipe market for large coal fired power plants remains stable. In addition, we are attacking new markets and steadily growing positions where we have had little to no share in the past.

Total aerospace sales decreased 4 percent over fiscal 2008 levels, and decreased from 56 percent of total sales in fiscal 2008 to 53 percent of total sales in fiscal 2009. Power generation sales increased 3 percent over fiscal 2008 levels, and increased from 24 percent of total sales in fiscal 2008 to 25 percent of total sales in fiscal 2009. Sales to the general industrial and other markets increased 14 percent over the prior year, and increased from 20 percent of total sales in fiscal 2008 to 22 percent of total sales in fiscal 2009. The increase in sales was driven by the addition of approximately $65 million in sales from Airdrome, Fatigue and Hackney Ladish, which were acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, and from steady improvement in IGT, extruded pipe and aerospace fasteners sales. This was partially offset by the impacts of the Boeing strike, which negatively impacted sales by approximately $184 million in fiscal 2009, and lower nickel alloy selling prices and increased internal sales at our Special Metals businesses, which negatively impacted sales by approximately $179 million and $59 million, respectively. Contractual material pass through pricing also declined, increasing sales by approximately $419.5 million in fiscal 2009 versus approximately $460.9 million in fiscal 2008. Contractual material pass through pricing adjustments are calculated based on market prices such as those shown in the above table in trailing periods from one to twelve months. In addition, our foreign operations reported approximately $152.9 million in reduced U.S. dollar equivalent sales year over year due to the strong increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to international currencies, primarily the British pound, the Euro, Brazilian real and Australian dollar. With regard to the commercial aircraft industry, aircraft deliveries decreased 3.4 percent in calendar year 2008, and Boeing and Airbus deliveries combined show a relatively flat growth rate through calendar year 2009. Due to manufacturing lead times, our production volumes are approximately 6 to 9 months ahead of aircraft deliveries. Cost of goods sold was $4,838.1 million, or 71 percent of sales, in fiscal 2009 as compared to $4,895.9 million, or 73 percent of sales, in fiscal 2008. The improvement in the year over year percentage reflects increased productivity and improved material utilization compared to fiscal 2008. Contractual material pass through pricing diluted gross margin by 1.9 percentage points in fiscal 2009 compared to 2.0 percentage points last year. Selling and administrative expenses were $390.1 million, or 6 percent of sales, in fiscal 2009 compared to $353.5 million, or 5 percent of sales, in fiscal 2008. The higher year over year percentage was primarily due to increased stock based compensation expense and the inclusion of our three new acquisitions in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and a full year of Caledonian operations, partially offset by lower expense related to our deferred compensation plan compared to the prior year. Net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2009 was $1,038.1 million, or $7.38 per share (diluted), which included restructuring charges totaling $0.06 per share (diluted). By comparison, net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2008 was $959.1 million, or $6.84 per share (diluted), which also included restructuring charges totaling $0.03 per share (diluted). Fiscal 2009 net income (including discontinued operations) was $1,044.5 million, or $7.43 per share (diluted), compared with net income of $987.3 million, or $7.04 per share (diluted) in fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2009 net income includes income of $6.4 million, or $0.05 per share (diluted), from discontinued operations, compared to income of $28.2 million, or $0.20 per share (diluted), in the prior year. Fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 Total sales for fiscal 2008 were $6,749.8 million, an increase of $1,529.0 million, or 29 percent, from fiscal 2007 sales of $5,220.8 million. Total aerospace sales increased 33 percent over fiscal 2007 levels, and increased from 54 percent of total sales in fiscal 2007 to 56 percent of total sales in fiscal 2008. Power generation sales increased 46 percent over fiscal 2007 levels, and increased from 22 percent of total sales in fiscal 2007 to 24 percent of total sales in fiscal 2008. Sales to the general industrial and other markets increased 5 percent over the prior year, and decreased from 24 percent of total sales in fiscal 2007 to 20 percent of total sales in fiscal 2008. The acquisitions of GSC Foundries, Inc. (GSC), Cherry Aerospace LLC (Cherry), McWilliams and Caledonian Alloys Group Limited (Caledonian) collectively contributed approximately $315 million of the year over year increase. The remaining increase in sales was principally driven by continued strength in our core aerospace and power generation markets. In addition, contractual pass through pricing of higher material costs increased sales by approximately $460.9 million this year versus approximately $299.0 million in fiscal 2007. With regard to growth in the commercial aircraft 25 Table of Contents industry, aircraft deliveries increased 8 percent in calendar 2007 from calendar 2006, and decreased 3.4 percent in calendar 2008 from calendar 2007. Due to manufacturing lead times, our production volumes are approximately 6 to 9 months ahead of aircraft deliveries. Cost of goods sold was $4,895.9 million, or 73 percent of sales, in fiscal 2008 as compared to $3,937.4 million, or 75 percent of sales, in fiscal 2007. The improvement in the year over year percentage reflects the impact of leverage from higher sales volume and improved operating efficiencies, partially offset by increased raw material costs in fiscal 2008, primarily nickel and cobalt, which increased approximately 15 percent and 74 percent, respectively, on the London Metals Exchange and Metal Bulletin COFM.8 Index, respectively, compared to fiscal 2007. Selling and administrative expenses were $353.5 million, or 5 percent of sales, in fiscal 2008 compared to $326.9 million, or 6 percent of sales, in fiscal 2007. The improved year over year percentage was primarily due to leverage from the higher sales volume and lower expense related to our deferred compensation plan compared to the prior year, partially offset by increased stock based compensation expense. Net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2008 was $959.1 million, or $6.84 per share (diluted), which included restructuring charges totaling $0.03 per share (diluted). By comparison, net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2007 was $603.5 million, or $4.37 per share (diluted). Fiscal 2007 net income from continuing operations included tax benefits of $11.1 million, or $0.08 per share (diluted), associated with tax refund claims and changes in tax reserves resulting from completed and ongoing audits. Fiscal 2008 net income (including discontinued operations) was $987.3 million, or $7.04 per share (diluted), compared with net income of $633.1 million, or $4.59 per share (diluted) in fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2008 net income includes income of $28.2 million, or $0.20 per share (diluted), from discontinued operations, compared to income of $29.6 million, or $0.22 per share (diluted), in the prior year. Business acquisitions Fiscal 2009 In the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we acquired three entities for a total cost of approximately $469.3 million, which was primarily paid in cash. These transactions resulted in $308.3 million of goodwill (of which $216.2 million is deductible for tax purposes) and $55.2 million of other intangible assets, including tradenames with indefinite lives valued at approximately $31.5 million. The impact of these acquisitions was not material to our consolidated results of operations; consequently, pro forma information has not been included. As of March 29, 2009, the purchase price allocations are subject to further refinement as analyses are completed. The following is a description of the three acquisitions. On December 4, 2008, we acquired Hackney Ladish Holding Corp. (Hackney Ladish), a leading producer of forged pipe fittings for critical energy infrastructure and related applications. With more than 80 years of experience manufacturing pipe fittings, Hackney Ladish offers the widest range of product types and sizes in the industry. Fittings are used in piping systems throughout the energy value chain, from drilling through processing and storage. Hackney Ladishs products connect pipe, change the direction of flow, increase or reduce pipe sizes, join or separate flow, or cap pipe ends. This acquisition extends our reach into oil and gas markets and provides profitable growth opportunities for our seamless pipe and nickel alloy tubing operations. Headquartered in Dallas, Texas, Hackney Ladish operates manufacturing facilities in Russellville, Arkansas and Enid, Oklahoma. The Hackney Ladish acquisition is a stock purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of the Forged Products segment. On November 21, 2008, we acquired Fatigue Technology, Inc. (FTI), headquartered in Seattle, Washington. FTI pioneered the cold expansion process in 1969 and is the technology leader in fatigue life extension for both metal and composite airframe fastener holes. FTI has taken this foundation of creating a residual stress field around a cold worked hole to develop innovative solutions that significantly reduce manufacturing and maintenance flow time and costs. The resulting components are easier and faster to install, and the methods of aircraft assembly are enhanced. This acquisition continues our strategy of expanding into additional critical aerospace fastener products, thus offering our customers a wider selection of fasteners to meet all of their requirements. The FTI acquisition is an asset purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of the Fastener Products segment. 26 Table of Contents On September 30, 2008, we acquired Airdrome Holdings, LLC (Airdrome), which consists of Airdrome Precision Components (APC) and AF Aerospace Ltd. (AFA). APC, located in Long Beach, California, is a leading supplier of hydraulic and pneumatic fluid fittings primarily for airframe applications. AFA, located in Rugby, England, manufactures a variety of machined components for aerospace applications, including fittings and other fluid conveyance products, ultra high tensile bolts, and machined details. Fluid fittings, manufactured in nickel, titanium, and stainless steel alloys, are the critical connectors for hoses transporting fuel, hydraulic fluid, and pneumatic pressure throughout an aircraft. This acquisition also fits our strategy of enhancing our critical aerospace fastener family of products to serve our customers better. The Airdrome acquisition is an asset purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of the Fastener Products segment. Fiscal 2008 On July 5, 2007, we acquired Caledonian Alloys Group Limited (Caledonian) for approximately $208.1 million in cash, of which $165.1 million was paid at close, and $21.2 million ($21.5 million based on acquisition date exchange rate) was paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. We expect to pay one additional contingent payment of approximately $15.4 million ($21.5 million based on acquisition date exchange rate) in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Caledonian is a market leader in providing nickel superalloy and titanium revert management solutions for the aerospace and industrial gas turbine (IGT) industries. Revert includes metal chips, casting gates, bar ends, forging flash, and other byproducts from casting, forging, and fastener manufacturing processes that can be re melted and reused. The acquisition of Caledonian provides us with the infrastructure and capabilities needed to create a closed loop system for the retention and reuse of internally generated revert. In addition, Caledonian provides access to new sources of material outside the Company and helps determine optimal utilization of revert streams throughout our melting operations worldwide. Headquartered in Livingston, Scotland, Caledonian operated nine revert processing facilities in six countries as of the date of acquisition. The Caledonian acquisition is a stock purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of the Forged Products segment. This transaction resulted in $149.3 million of goodwill (which is not deductible for tax purposes) and other intangibles. On April 3, 2007, we acquired McWilliams, a privately held company in Rockaway, New Jersey, for $91.4 million in cash. Founded in 1880, McWilliams is a leading manufacturer of titanium, nickel and steel forgings, primarily for commercial and military aerospace applications. McWilliams operates both hammer and screw presses for open and closed die forging at its New Jersey facility. The McWilliams acquisition is an asset purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of the Forged Products segment. Fiscal 2007 On February 23, 2007, we acquired Cherry from Acument Global Technologies, Inc. (Acument) for $298.1 million in cash. Founded in 1939, Cherry encompasses the aerospace operations of Acument, formerly Textron Fastening Systems, and is a manufacturer of aerospace rivets and blind bolts at its facility in Santa Ana, California. Cherry fills a gap in our product line of critical aerospace fasteners and opens up potential synergies and economies of scale with our other fastener operations. The Cherry acquisition is an asset purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of the Fastener Products segment. On February 2, 2007, we acquired GSC, a manufacturer of aluminum and steel structural investment castings for aerospace, energy, medical and other end markets for $77.1 million in cash. GSC has operations in Ogden, Utah. The Saltillo, Mexico operation was closed subsequent to the acquisition. GSC enhances our small structural investment casting portfolio with its ability to produce larger components. The GSC acquisition is an asset purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of the Investment Cast Products segment. On May 25, 2006, we acquired SMC, a manufacturer of high performance nickel based alloys and superalloys, which are sold internally and to third party customers. SMC provides our forging operations with nickel based alloys for manufacturing aerospace components, enabling us to manage our overall value stream more cost effectively from raw material to forged components. The aggregate purchase price was $528.3 million, which principally included $310.6 million for the purchase of shares and $240.1 million for the repayment of SMCs outstanding debt and related termination costs, partially offset by $22.3 million of cash acquired. The SMC acquisition is a stock purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of the Forged Products segment. 27 Table of Contents Discontinued operations Our financial statements were impacted by activities relating to the planned or completed divestiture of a number of our businesses. These businesses have been accounted for under SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. Accordingly, any operating results of these businesses are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Income as discontinued operations, net of income tax, and all prior periods have been reclassified. Fiscal 2009 In the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we decided to dispose of two automotive fastener operations. The decision to discontinue these automotive fastener operations resulted from their non core nature coupled with further erosion in the automotive market. These operations have been reclassified from the Fasteners Products segment to discontinued operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. In the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we sold the stock of our Technova entities, a foreign operation held for sale and previously recorded as discontinued from our former Flow Technologies pumps and valves business. The transaction resulted in a gain of approximately $3.0 million. Fiscal 2008 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we entered into an agreement to sell the Unbrako fastener business headquartered in Shannon, Ireland. The sale was completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, resulting in a gain of approximately $3.5 million. Unbrako was reclassified from the Fastener Products segment to discontinued operations. Also in the fourth quarter, we decided to sell the Kladno alloy manufacturing business located in the Czech Republic. Kladno primarily supplied steel ingots to Wyman Gordons Grafton, Massachusetts operation. Kladno was reclassified from the Forged Products segment to discontinued operations and continues to be marketed. In January 2008, we completed the sale of Rescal for approximately $11.2 million. Rescal, which is located in France, was acquired with SMC and was held for sale since the first quarter of fiscal 2007. The sale of the business generated a tax effected gain of $4.6 million, or $0.03 per share (diluted) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. In January 2008, we completed the sale of Shape Memory Alloys (SMA) for $30.2 million. The SMA business was acquired with SMC in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, and was reclassified from the Forged Products segment to discontinued operations during the third quarter of fiscal 2008. The sale of the business generated a tax effected gain of $16.3 million, or $0.12 per share (diluted), of which $4.0 million, or $0.03 per share (diluted), was recognized in the third quarter of fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2007 In the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we sold our interest in Wyman Gordon FRISA to our 50% joint venture partner for $30.0 million in cash. In addition, the buyer assumed and subsequently repaid $17.4 million of debt upon closing. At the time of the closing, the joint venture entity operated a manufacturing facility located in Mexico that was engaged in the manufacture of forged products using the ring rolling process. FRISA was reclassified from the Forged Products segment to discontinued operations. In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we decided to sell the refiner rebuild business of J&L Fiber Services and close our AFT Composites business. These businesses were reclassified from the former Industrial Products segment (now the Fastener Products segment) to discontinued operations. Both transactions were completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2007. Restructuring, asset impairment and other non recurring charges We regularly assess our cost structure to ensure that operations are properly sized for prevailing market conditions, taking into consideration current and forecasted conditions in markets we serve. The following restructuring and asset impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 2009 and 2008. 28 Table of Contents Fiscal 2009 In the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we incurred restructuring and impairment charges of $11.8 million pursuant to plans to downsize operations across all segments. We had been gearing up for aerospace growth into fiscal 2010, whereas future demand now appears to be flattening out, particularly in the casting and forging aerospace markets. The charges consisted of $9.3 million for employee severance expenses and $2.5 million for impairments and relocation expenses related with long lived assets. These restructuring plans provided for terminations of approximately 990 employees in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009 and first quarter of fiscal 2010. The restructuring and impairment charges recorded by the Investment Cast Products segment, Forged Products segment and Fastener Products segment were $5.2 million, $3.7 million and $2.9 million, respectively, during fiscal 2009. As of March 29, 2009, $2.1 million remained in accrued liabilities related to the restructuring plans. The tax effected impact of these charges was $7.9 million, or $0.06 per share (diluted). Fiscal 2008 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Investment Cast Products segment recorded restructuring charges of $6.1 million, primarily for shut down costs associated with an underutilized machining operation located in the United Kingdom. The tax effected impact of these charges was $4.3 million, or $0.03 per share (diluted). Overall Outlook, Impacts of the Global Economic Recession and Program Delays Recent economic events have created recessionary economic conditions in many industries and created a crisis in global financial markets including commercial credit markets. While we are not immune to impacts of the current global recession, we believe our strong financial position will enable us to take advantage of opportunities in our markets served and continue to make operational improvements in our businesses. During the recently completed fiscal 2009, approximately 53 percent of our sales were to customers in the global aerospace markets. Until the recent economic events occurred, we believed, based on customer forecasts, that the aerospace production rates would continue to experience growth throughout fiscal 2010 and possibly beyond, particularly due to anticipated build rates of major new aerospace programs such as the Boeing 787 and Airbus A380, each of which contains significant per ship set revenue for PCC. We had built up our employee base in anticipation of that growth. We believe that although aerospace production rates will remain flat for fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009 levels, sales will be negatively impacted by inventory corrections due in part to delays in both the Boeing 787 and Airbus A380 programs. We still believe that these programs will represent significant future revenue streams for the Company, but the revenues will be recognized later than originally anticipated. During the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we recognized restructuring charges of $11.8 million (before income taxes), which primarily related to downsizing the workforce in anticipation of the moderating future aerospace growth in the near term. We have, however, been able to increase our market share in aerospace, particularly in the Fasteners Products segment. Our most significant customers in the aerospace industry are primarily large, well financed businesses that we believe have the ability to weather the economic downturn. Therefore, while there is significant uncertainty as to the direction of the economy in future periods, we do not anticipate significant collection issues with our accounts receivable or marketability of our in process inventories. However, our customers depend on demand from their end use customers, as well as the end use customers financial viability, of which we are unable to make an assessment. We must rely on the forecasted information provided from time to time by our customers as guidance with regard to the impacts from the current and future economic environment. During fiscal 2009, approximately 25 percent of our sales were to customers in the global power generation markets, which include our IGT business as well as sales of our seamless extruded pipe. We expect steady demand in both of these product lines due to demand rates, large current sales backlogs and our ability to win further market share. Our most significant customers in the power generation markets are primarily large, well financed businesses that we believe should have the ability to weather the economic downturn or are customers for which sales are backed by letters of credit on which we believe there is little risk of default. Therefore, we do not anticipate significant collection issues with our accounts receivable or marketability of our in process inventories. However, our customers depend on demand from their end use customers, as well as the end use customers financial viability, of which we are unable to make an assessment. We must rely on the forecasted information provided from time to time by our customers as guidance with regard to the impacts from the current and future economic environment. 29 Table of Contents The remaining 22 percent of our sales in fiscal 2009 were into general industrial markets, including the automotive markets. It is difficult to summarize the opportunities and challenges in these markets, because the circumstances vary widely from one individual market to another. We have taken, and will continue to take, precautionary measures with customers in these markets to limit our exposure, to the extent possible, to potential bankruptcies and other financial issues experienced by these customers. These measures include shortening cash collection terms, regular updating of credit profiles, discontinuance of further business with customers not paying in a timely manner and the requirement of cash in advance of shipments, among others. Due to the diversity of markets and customer profiles in these businesses and the precautionary steps referred to previously, we do not anticipate severe impacts on our business or significant exposure to credit losses in these markets. However, it is reasonably possible that we may experience unanticipated unfavorable impacts. We follow an investment philosophy of diversified investing and risk mitigation when managing our pension plans. The investments in our pension plans, which totaled approximately $1.2 billion as of the end of fiscal 2009, have experienced investment losses that averaged approximately 5 percent during fiscal 2009. This compares with our weighted average expected long term annual investment return of 8 percent for U.S. plans and 7.5 percent for non U.S. plans. The losses on our pension investments will result in increased net periodic pension expense in fiscal 2010. In the first month of fiscal 2010, we contributed $190.6 million to our defined benefit pension plans, including a voluntary contribution of $188.9 million, to increase plan funding and to mitigate the impact of these pension investment losses on our income in future years. We believe our financial position and liquidity will allow us to make all required pension contributions as well as any additional voluntary contributions that management deems advisable. At this time, the Company does not expect to make any additional voluntary contributions to the defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2010. See the Changes in Financial Condition and Liquidity section for a discussion of the impact of the global financial climate and credit shortage on liquidity. Financial results by segment We analyze our operating segments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 131, Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, and manage our business across three reportable segments: Investment Cast Products, Forged Products and Fastener Products. Segment operating income amounts presented below exclude restructuring and asset impairment charges.

(3) Forged Products: Includes intersegment sales of $75.6 million, $41.0 million and $8.3 million for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. (4) Fastener Products: Includes intersegment sales of $3.3 million, $2.3 million and $1.8 million for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Investment Cast Products The Investment Cast Products segment includes PCC Structurals, PCC Airfoils and SMAG. These businesses manufacture investment castings, or provide related investment casting materials and alloys, for aircraft engines, IGT engines, airframes, armaments, medical prostheses and other industrial applications. Fiscal Year % Increase/(Decrease) 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 Sales by Market: Aerospace $ 1,316.8 $ 1,314.5 $ 1,133.2 0% 16% % of total 57% 61% 65% Power Generation 686.2 567.8 409.5 21% 39% % of total 30% 26% 23% General Industrial & Other 288.3 277.7 205.6 4% 35% % of total 13% 13% 12% Total Sales $ 2,291.3 $ 2,160.0 $ 1,748.3 6% 24% Operating income $ 586.3 $ 521.8 $ 382.3 12% 36% % of sales 25.6% 24.2% 21.9% Fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 The Investment Cast Products segment reported fiscal 2009 sales of $2,291.3 million, an increase of 6 percent from the prior years sales of $2,160.0 million. The year over year increase in sales reflects continuing strength and increased customer penetration in the global IGT markets and solid growth in aerospace markets in the first half of the fiscal year prior to the Boeing strike, which we estimate negatively impacted sales by approximately $112 million in fiscal 2009, and approximately $28 million in reduced U.S. dollar equivalent sales year over year due to the strong increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to international currencies, primarily the British pound. Sales also include $81.3 million of higher pricing related to contractual pass through of increased material costs compared to $100.4 million in fiscal 2008. Operating income for the Investment Cast Products segment was $586.3 million or 25.6 percent of sales in fiscal 2009, compared to $521.8 million, or 24.2 percent of sales, in fiscal 2008. The increase in operating income reflects 31 Table of Contents the impact of cost reductions and improved productivity and lower raw material costs, primarily nickel and titanium, which have decreased approximately 50 percent and 61 percent, respectively, on the London Metals Exchange (LME) and Metalprices.com, respectively, compared to fiscal 2008, which helped to offset the negative impact of lost sales due to the Boeing strike. The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a negative impact of approximately $5 million on operating income in fiscal 2009. The continued improvement in operating margins as a percent of sales was driven by higher productivity, effective material utilization and lower scrap costs. Contractual material pass through pricing diluted operating margins by 0.9 percentage points in fiscal 2009 compared to 1.2 percentage points last year. The Investment Cast Products segment anticipates slightly reduced sales in fiscal 2010, primarily driven by decreased demand from commercial aerospace as the industry completes inventory corrections in the first half of the fiscal year to adjust from previous growth expectations. [Continued weakness in international currencies would also impact this segment.] Reduced aerospace sales and negative currency impact are expected to be partially offset by continued growth in power generation sales, with additional capacity utilized to support this growth. Operating margins, as a percent of sales, are expected to improve in fiscal 2010 as a result of continued improvements in operating efficiencies. Fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 The Investment Cast Products segment reported fiscal 2008 sales of $2,160.0 million, an increase of 24 percent from the prior years sales of $1,748.3 million. Approximately $45 million, or 11 percent of this increase reflects incremental sales of GSC, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. The remaining increase in sales reflects growth in the commercial and regional aerospace markets and strengthening demand in the IGT power generation businesses from fiscal 2008. Sales also include $100.4 million of higher pricing related to contractual pass through of increased material costs compared to $55.8 million in fiscal 2007. Operating income for the Investment Cast Products segment was $521.8 million or 24.2 percent of sales in fiscal 2008, compared to $382.3 million, or 21.9 percent of sales, in fiscal 2007. The increase in operating income reflects the impact of higher sales volume, partially offset by higher raw material costs, primarily nickel and cobalt, which increased approximately 15 percent and 74 percent, respectively, on the London Metals Exchange and Metal Bulletin COFM.8 Index, respectively, compared to fiscal 2007. The continued improvement in operating margins as a percent of sales was driven by leverage from the increased sales volume and improved manufacturing performance, partially offset by the impact of higher raw material costs and pass through pricing. While the majority of the higher material costs were recovered from contractual terms allowing for pass through pricing to protect operating income, they dilute operating income as a percent of sales. Contractual material pass through pricing diluted operating margins by 1.2 percentage points in fiscal 2008 compared to 0.7 percentage points last year. 32 Table of Contents Forged Products The Forged Products segment includes the operations of Wyman Gordon and SMC, which was acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. These businesses manufacture forged components from sophisticated titanium and nickel based alloys principally for the aerospace and power generation markets, or manufacture nickel and cobalt based alloys used to produce forged components for aerospace and non aerospace markets which include products for oil and gas, chemical processing, and pollution control applications. The segment also provides nickel superalloy and titanium revert management solutions, re melting various material byproducts and reusing them in casting, forging, and fastener manufacturing processes. Forged Products sales to the aerospace and power generation markets are derived primarily from the same large engine customers served by the Investment Cast Products segment, with additional aerospace sales to manufacturers of landing gear and other airframe components. The Forged Products segment also produces extruded pipe for the power generation and the oil and gas industries. Fiscal Year % Increase/(Decrease) 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 Sales by Market: Aerospace $ 1,158.0 $ 1,476.1 $ 1,024.0 (22 )% 44% % of total 39% 47% 44% Power Generation 997.6 1,064.1 704.1 (6 )% 51% % of total 33% 33% 30% General Industrial & Other 822.8 627.9 622.5 31 % 1% % of total 28% 20% 26% Total Sales $ 2,978.4 $ 3,168.1 $ 2,350.6 (6 )% 35% Operating income $ 652.9 $ 699.5 $ 409.5 (7 )% 71% % of sales 21.9% 22.1% 17.4% Fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 The Forged Products segment reported fiscal 2009 sales of $2,978.4 million, a decrease of 6 percent from the prior years sales of $3,168.1 million. The acquisition of Hackney Ladish in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 contributed approximately $24 million in incremental sales over the prior year. The decrease in sales from the prior year reflects the decline in external selling prices of nickel alloy from the segments three primary mills, which negatively impacted external sales by approximately $179 million in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008. Nickel prices decreased approximately 50 percent on the LME compared to fiscal 2008. In addition, we estimate fiscal 2009 was negatively impacted by the Boeing strike by approximately $60 million. In fiscal 2009, the Forged Products segment dedicated more resources for internal production which impacted top line revenues by approximately $59 million. In addition, the segments foreign operations reported approximately $85 million in reduced U.S. dollar equivalent sales year over year due to the strong increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to international currencies, primarily the British pound and Australian dollar. These declines were partially offset by a 40.3 percent increase in extruded pipe sales. Fiscal 2009 sales also include $325.9 million of higher contractual pricing related to pass through of increased raw material costs, compared to $345.9 million last year. Total intercompany sales, including sales within and between segments, increased from $642.4 million in fiscal 2008 to $836.0 million in fiscal 2009. These sales are eliminated in consolidation. Operating income for the Forged Products segment was $652.9 million or 21.9 percent of sales in fiscal 2009, compared to $699.5 million, or 22.1 percent of sales, in fiscal 2008. Operating income was negatively impacted by lost sales related to the Boeing strike and the impact of the 29,000 ton press failure at the segments Houston facility during the year. In addition, the weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a negative impact of approximately $15 million on operating income in fiscal 2009. Increased efficiencies and improved internal coordination of resources and material utilization helped to partially offset the negative impact. The contractual pass through of higher raw material costs diluted operating margins by 2.7 percentage points in both fiscal 2009 and 2008. Sales within this segment are expected to be lower in fiscal 2010 consistent with declines in the commercial aerospace markets, partially offset by continued demand in extruded pipe, non aerospace nickel alloy sales from 33 Table of Contents our Special Metals Corporation mills and a full year of sales from Hackney Ladish. While we see opportunities for increased market share, the segment is also expected to continue to moderately grow its internal supply of materials in fiscal 2010, which will have a negative impact on reported top line revenues. Continued weakness in international currencies would also impact this segment. Operating income as a percent of sales is expected to show improvement, benefiting from the expected increase in extruded pipe sales and further cost reduction initiatives. Fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 The Forged Products segment reported fiscal 2008 sales of $3,168.1 million, an increase of 35 percent from the previous years sales of $2,350.6 million. Approximately $150 million or 18 percent of the increase in sales reflects the acquisitions of McWilliams and Caledonian. The remaining increase in year over year sales was driven by increased demand for aerospace products, improving demand in the North American market for extruded pipe, and a full year of sales from SMC compared to 10 months in fiscal 2007. Sales of extruded pipe increased 38 percent year over year, from $272.6 million in fiscal 2007 to $375.8 million in fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2008 sales also include $345.9 million of higher contractual pricing related to pass through of increased raw material costs, compared to $224.4 million in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, the Forged Products segment dedicated more resources for internal production which impacts top line revenues. Total intercompany sales, including sales within and between segments, increased from $258.4 million in fiscal 2007 to $642.4 million in fiscal 2008. These sales are eliminated in consolidation. Operating income for the Forged Products segment was $699.5 million or 22.1 percent of sales in fiscal 2008, compared to $409.5 million, or 17.4 percent of sales, in fiscal 2007. Operating income as a percent of sales benefited from increased sales volume, which included increased sales of higher margin power generation products, and from implementation of successful cost reduction initiatives. In addition to continuing improvements from base businesses, SMC continued to make significant margin improvements throughout the year, which were driven by continuing yield improvements, higher production volumes, and inventory reductions. These improvements were partially offset by higher material costs, primarily nickel and cobalt, which increased approximately 15 percent and 74 percent, respectively, on the London Metals Exchange and Metal Bulletin COFM.8 Index, respectively, compared to fiscal 2007. The contractual pass through of higher raw material costs diluted operating margins by 2.7 percentage points in fiscal 2008 compared to 1.8 percentage points in fiscal 2007. Fastener Products The Fastener Products segment includes the Aerospace Fasteners and Engineered Fasteners groups. In addition, the segment includes the integration of the former Industrial Products segment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. The businesses that comprise this segment produce fasteners, fastener systems and components for critical applications in the aerospace, automotive and industrial machinery markets as well as applications and monitoring units utilized in the power generation industry. Fiscal Year % Increase/(Decrease) 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 Sales by Market: Aerospace $ 1,136.5 $ 977.7 $ 668.0 16 % 46 % % of total 73% 69% 60% Power Generation 19.4 18.4 18.8 5 % (2 )% % of total 1% 1% 1% General Industrial & Other 402.3 425.6 435.1 (5 )% (2 )% % of total 26% 30% 39% Total Sales $ 1,558.2 $ 1,421.7 $ 1,121.9 10 % 27 % Operating income $ 459.0 $ 373.7 $ 251.7 23 % 48 % % of sales 29.5% 26.3% 22.4% 34 Table of Contents Fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 The Fastener Products segment reported fiscal 2009 sales of $1,558.2 million, a 10 percent increase from fiscal 2008 sales of $1,421.7 million. The increase in sales primarily resulted from aerospace sales growing approximately 16 percent compared to the prior year largely due to market share gains. The growth in aerospace sales included approximately $41 million related to Airdrome and FTI, which were acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. The segment overcame negative pressures due to the Boeing strike, which accounted for a decrease in Fastener Products sales of approximately $12 million in fiscal 2009. Additional negative impacts to sales in this segment included the continuation of a depressed North American automotive market, coupled with softening in both the European and Brazilian automotive markets, as well as weakness in other areas of the general industrial market. In addition, our foreign operations reported approximately $39 million in reduced U.S. dollar equivalent sales year over year due to the strong increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to international currencies, primarily the British pound and Brazilian real. Operating income for the Fasteners segment was $459.0 million or 29.5 percent of sales in fiscal 2009, compared to $373.7 million, or 26.3 percent of sales, in fiscal 2008. The improvement in operating margins reflected leverage from the increased sales volume and increased sales in the higher margin aerospace business, as well as the impact of continued efforts to reduce costs and improve manufacturing processes. This was slightly offset by the weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which had a negative impact of approximately $10 million on operating income in fiscal 2009. Fastener Products segment sales are expected to be relatively flat during fiscal 2010 as a result of decreased demand from aerospace customers primarily in the business jet and distributor businesses, partially offset by continued market share gains and a full year of sales from the acquisitions that were completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Continued weakness in international currencies would also impact this segment. Operating income as a percent of sales is expected to improve due to continuing cost take outs. Fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 The Fastener Products segment reported fiscal 2008 sales of $1,421.7 million, a 27 percent increase from fiscal 2007 sales of $1,121.9 million. The increase in sales primarily resulted from higher sales from the Aerospace Fastener operations, of which approximately $121 million represented incremental sales from a full year of Cherry Aerospace, acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Sales from the Engineered Fastener and industrial products operations decreased 4 percent year over year, principally due to weaker demand from the automotive industry. Operating income for the Fasteners segment was $373.7 million or 26.3 percent of sales in fiscal 2008, compared to $251.7 million, or 22.4 percent of sales, in fiscal 2007. The improvement in operating margins reflected leverage from the increased sales volume and increased sales in the higher margin aerospace business, as well as the impact of continued efforts to reduce costs and improve manufacturing processes. Interest and taxes Net interest expense in fiscal 2009 was $10.4 million, compared with $42.3 million in fiscal 2008. The lower net interest expense was due to significantly reduced debt levels, lower borrowing rates, and higher interest income earned on higher average cash balances compared to the prior year. Net interest expense in fiscal 2008 was $42.3 million, compared with $52.0 million in fiscal 2007. The lower net interest expense in fiscal 2008 was due to reduced debt levels, lower borrowing rates, and higher interest income compared to the previous year. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was 34.2 percent, 0.3 percentage points higher than the 33.9 percent effective tax rate in fiscal 2008. The increase in tax rate was principally due to reduced tax benefits from lower foreign tax rates, a decrease in benefits from the U.S. manufacturing deduction (due to increased tax deductions for pension contributions), and a reduction in favorable audit settlements year over year, partially offset by an increase in benefits from the federal research credit. 35 Table of Contents The effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was 33.9 percent, compared with 33.2 percent in fiscal 2007. The slight increase in tax rate was principally due to reduced tax benefits from audit settlements in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007, and the loss of the extraterritorial income exclusion benefit in 2008, which was partially offset by a larger U.S. manufacturing deduction in 2008 compared to 2007. Liquidity and capital resources Total assets of $6,721.4 million at March 29, 2009 represented a $671.3 million increase from the $6,050.1 million balance at March 30, 2008, principally reflecting a $498.0 million addition of total assets from the acquisitions of Airdrome, Fatigue and Hackney Ladish, in addition to $333.2 million of higher cash balances. Partially offsetting this increase was lower accounts receivable balances due to lower external sales and the timing of sales and customer payments. Total capitalization at March 30, 2009, was $5,165.8 million, consisting of $306.0 million of debt and $4,859.8 million of equity. The debt to capitalization ratio improved to 5.9% at March 29, 2009 from 8.1% at the end of fiscal 2008, reflecting the impact of reduced debt resulting from strong cash flows from operations and the impact of increased equity from earnings. Cash as of March 29, 2009 was $554.5 million, up $333.2 million from the end of fiscal 2008, and total debt was $306.3 million (including $0.3 million from discontinued operations), down $48.7 million since the end of fiscal 2008. The net positive cash flow of $381.9 million reflects cash generation from operations of $1,103.1 million and $48.2 million from the issuance of common stock and related tax benefits, partially offset by $469.3 million of cash paid for the acquisitions of Airdrome, Fatigue and Hackney Ladish, capital expenditures of $204.7 million, effect of exchange rate changes of $86.4 million, and cash dividends of $16.7 million. Capital spending of $204.7 million in fiscal 2009 principally provided for additional capacity expansion, cost reduction and equipment upgrades throughout the Company. The capital spending plan for fiscal 2010, which is anticipated to be approximately 5 to 10 percent lower than capital spending in fiscal 2009, provides for equipment maintenance and upgrades, cost reduction and certain capacity expansion projects throughout the company. During fiscal 2009, we contributed $23.3 million to the defined benefit pension plans, of which $8.0 million was voluntary. In addition, we contributed $17.5 million to the other postretirement benefit plans during fiscal year 2009. In the first month of fiscal 2010, we contributed $190.6 million to the defined benefit pension plans, of which $188.9 million was voluntary. We expect to contribute approximately $16.1 million of required contributions in fiscal 2010, for total contributions to the defined benefit pension plans of approximately $205.0 million in fiscal 2010. In addition, we expect to contribute approximately $11.2 million to the other postretirement benefit plans during fiscal year 2010. We believe we will be able to meet our short and longer term liquidity needs for working capital, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, capital spending, cash dividends, scheduled repayment of debt and potential acquisitions from cash generated from operations, borrowing from our existing $1.0 billion revolving credit facility or new bank credit facilities, the issuance of public or privately placed debt securities, or the issuance of equity instruments. As noted above, our revolving bank credit facility (Credit Agreement) provides available borrowing up to $1.0 billion through May 2012. Our unused borrowing capacity as of March 29, 2009 was $984.4 million under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains various standard financial covenants, including maintenance of minimum net worth, interest coverage ratio and leverage ratio. The financial covenants in the Credit Agreement are our most restrictive covenants. Our covenant requirements and actual ratios as of March 29, 2009 were as follows (dollars in millions): Covenant Requirement Actual Consolidated minimum net worth (1) $2,619.1 (minimum) $ 4,859.8 Consolidated interest coverage ratio (1) 2.25:1.00 (minimum) 80.20:1.00 Consolidated leverage ratio (1) 3.25:1.00 (maximum) 0.17:1.00 (1) Terms are defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement filed as an exhibit to Form 8 K on October 19, 2005. 36 Table of Contents As of March 29, 2009, we were in compliance with all financial covenants of our loan agreements. Historically, we have also issued commercial paper as a method of raising short term liquidity. We believe we continue to have the ability to issue commercial paper, even in the current credit markets, and have issued minor amounts of commercial paper in the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter to cover short term cash requirements. We do not anticipate any changes in our ability to borrow under our current credit facility, but changes in the financial condition of the participating financial institutions could negatively impact our ability to borrow funds in the future. Should that circumstance arise, we believe that we would be able to arrange any needed financing, although we are not able to predict what the terms of any such borrowings would be, or the source of the borrowed funds, due to the current instability in the global credit markets. Contractual obligations and commercial commitments We are obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements and lease agreements. The following table represents our contractual cash obligations as of March 29, 2009 and the estimated timing of future cash payments: Contractual Cash Obligations Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Long term debt $ 306.0 $ 55.2 $ 15.4 $ 14.7 $ 5.3 $ 205.0 $ 10.4 Operating leases (1) 63.2 18.7 12.5 9.7 7.8 5.1 9.4 Interest on fixed rate debt 64.0 15.2 13.8 13.3 12.4 8.6 0.7 Interest on variable rate debt (2) 0.4 0.3 0.1 Acquisition related obligation 15.4 15.4 Total $ 449.0 $ 104.8 $ 41.8 $ 37.7 $ 25.5 $ 218.7 $ 20.5 (1) Operating lease obligations include $0.2 million attributable to an operation held for sale. (2) Interest on variable rate debt is based on current prevailing interest rates. Our reserve for uncertain tax positions on March 29, 2009 was $28.5 million. Due to the uncertainties associated with settling these liabilities, we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these liabilities. As a result, our reserve for unrecognized tax benefits is excluded from the table above. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our reserve for uncertain tax positions. The table above also excludes estimated required cash contributions to our qualified pension plans totaling approximately $215.2 million over the next five years: $16.1 million in fiscal 2010, $43.7 million in fiscal 2011, $49.1 million in fiscal 2012, $44.1 million in fiscal 2013 and $62.2 million in fiscal 2014. Due to the $188.9 million voluntary contribution made in the first month of fiscal 2010, actual required cash contributions in future years are expected to be less than the amounts stated above. We also have benefit payments due under our non qualified pension and other post retirement benefit plans that are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Critical accounting policies We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout the Managements Discussion and Analysis where such policies affect reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other significant accounting policies, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report. Note that the preparation of this Annual Report requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. 37 Table of Contents Revenue recognition We recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete. This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the contract or purchase order, ownership and risk of loss have passed to the customer, collectibility is reasonably assured, and pricing is fixed and determinable. In instances where title does not pass to the customer upon shipment, we recognize revenue upon delivery or customer acceptance, depending on terms of the sales agreement. Service sales, representing maintenance and engineering activities, are recognized as services are performed. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in revenue. Valuation of inventories All inventories are stated at the lower of the cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory or the estimated market value of the inventory. Cost for inventories at a significant number of our operations is determined on a last in, first out (LIFO) basis. The average inventory cost method is utilized for most other inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based on the age, historical usage or assumptions about future demand for the inventory. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and reported operating results. Goodwill and acquired intangibles From time to time, we acquire businesses in purchase transactions that typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets, which may affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges. The determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the consolidated financial statements. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at a minimum each fiscal year in the second quarter or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Our reporting units consist of the three operating segments within our Investment Cast Products reportable operating segment and the two operating segments within our Forged Products reportable operating segment as well as a number of reporting units in our Fasteners Products operating segment. The Fasteners Products operating segment includes several aggregated component units (referred to as the Fasteners Products reporting unit) and three other reporting units for which the segment manager regularly reviews performance. During fiscal 2009, PCC Precision Tool group (PTG) was included in the Fasteners Group reporting unit as the business is closely related and integral to the Fasteners Group reporting unit. During fiscal 2008, PTG was a separate reporting unit. We performed an impairment test for the Fasteners Products reporting unit as a result of this change and no impairment was indicated. There were no other changes to our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing during fiscal 2008 and 2009. Testing for goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations. Such models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions primarily based on future cash flows, expected market growth rates, our estimates of sales volumes, sales prices and related costs, and the discount rate applied, which reflects the weighted average cost of capital. Management uses the best available information at the time fair values of the reporting units are estimated; however, estimates could be materially impacted by factors such as changes in growth trends and specific industry conditions, with the potential for a corresponding adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements potentially resulting in impairment of the goodwill. We also consider comparable transactions to estimate the fair value of the reporting units. The cash flow models used to determine fair value are most sensitive to the expected future cash flows and the discount rate for each reporting unit. The discount rate used in the cash flow models for the fiscal 2009 goodwill impairment analysis averaged 10%. The annual growth rate for earnings before interest and taxes varied by reporting unit and ranged from 4% to 20% over the initial five year forecast period. A sensitivity analysis determined that using terminal growth rates of 3%, 4% or 5% would not result in impairment in the fiscal 2009 goodwill impairment analysis. We performed a sensitivity analysis on both of these factors and determined that the forecast for future earnings before interest and taxes used in the cash flow model could decrease by 10% and the discount rate used could increase by a factor of 4% from the rate utilized, and the goodwill of our reporting units 38 Table of Contents would not be impaired. The reporting unit that would be most sensitive to worsening economic conditions has $12.4 million of goodwill recorded as of March 29, 2009. Other than the change in reporting units within the Fasteners operating segment, there were no triggering events during the third and fourth quarters requiring a goodwill impairment test in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Environmental costs The estimated future costs for known environmental remediation requirements are accrued on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of remediation costs can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of amounts is established, and no amount within the range is better than another, the minimum amount of the range is recorded. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when collection is probable. Adjustments to our accruals may be necessary to reflect new information as investigation and remediation efforts proceed. The amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period, but any amounts, and the possible range of any amounts in excess of those already accrued, are not reasonably estimable at this time. Total environmental reserves accrued at March 29, 2009 and March 30, 2008 were $83.4 million and $84.0 million, respectively. FASB Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143 (FIN 47) clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 143 and requires a liability to be recorded if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. Asset retirement obligations covered by this Interpretation include those for which an entity has a significant obligation to perform an asset retirement activity, however the timing or method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may not be within the control of the entity. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. In accordance with SFAS No. 143 and FIN 47, we record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liability can be reasonably estimated. Currently, we have identified a known asset retirement obligation associated with environmental contamination at one of our manufacturing facilities. However, we have not recognized a liability under FIN 47 for this retirement obligation because the fair value of remediation at this site cannot be reasonably estimated since the settlement date is unknown at this time. The settlement date is unknown because remediation of this site is not required until production ceases, and we have no current or future plans to cease production. This asset retirement obligation, when estimable, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows or business. Income taxes Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pre tax earnings based on current tax law and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Beginning in fiscal 2008, we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). As a result, we report a liability resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. Pension and other postretirement benefit plans We sponsor many domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans. Our pension and postretirement benefit plans are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). Plan assets have been valued at fair value in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. 39 Table of Contents Pension and postretirement expense and liability amounts are derived from several significant assumptions, including the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rate. We derive a market based discount rate from yields on high quality, liquid fixed income securities at a specific measurement period, at the end of our fiscal year for valuation of our pension liabilities. We use only highly rated bonds (AA/Aa or higher) to estimate the interest rate at which our pension benefits could be settled. Our assumed return on plan assets is derived from a review of past performance, anticipated future performance in light of market conditions and our investment allocation and consultation with our investment advisors. As the assumed rate of return on plan assets is a long term assumption, it is not anticipated to be as volatile as the discount rate, which is a point in time measurement. For our U.S. Plans, we used a long term rate of return assumption of 8.0% to calculate the 2009 and 2010 net periodic pension cost. For our non U.S. Plans, we used a long term rate of return assumption of 7.5% to calculate the 2009 and 2010 net periodic pension cost. For our U.S. Plans, we used a discount rate assumption of 7.25% for the total benefit obligation of our pension plans at our March 29, 2009 measurement date. For our non U.S. Plans, we used a discount rate assumption of 6.68% for the total benefit obligation of our pension plans at our March 29, 2009 measurement date. For fiscal 2009, our U.S. net periodic pension expense was $25.1 million and non U.S. net periodic pension income was $0.3 million. We estimate that for fiscal 2010, our U.S. net periodic pension expense will be approximately $30.8 million and non U.S. net periodic pension income will be approximately $0.7 million. The table below quantifies the approximate impact, as of March 29, 2009, of a one quarter percentage point decrease in our assumptions for discount rate and expected return on assets, holding other assumptions constant. 0.25 Percentage Point Decrease Increase in annual costs: Discount rate $ 3.1 Expected long term rate of return 3.4 Increase in projected benefit obligation: Discount rate $ 44.0 The approximate impact, as of March 29, 2009, of a one percentage point increase in our assumption for the health care cost trend rate, holding other assumptions constant, on our total service and interest cost components and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation is not significant. Recently issued accounting standards In April 2009, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 107 1 and APB 28 1, Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments (FSP FAS 107 1 and APB 28 1), which amends SFAS No. 107, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, and APB Opinion No. 28, Interim Financial Reporting, to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim and annual reporting periods. FSP FAS 107 1 and APB 28 1 is effective for our first quarter ending June 28, 2009. The adoption of FSP FAS 107 1 and ABP 28 1 may require additional disclosures regarding financial instruments; however, it will not impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 132(R) 1, Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets. This FSP provides guidance on an employers disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. This FSP is effective for the Company in fiscal 2010. As FSP No. 132(R) 1 only requires enhanced disclosures, the adoption of this FSP will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (SFAS No. 162). SFAS No. 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and establishes the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements that are presented in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). SFAS No. 162 will be effective 60 days following the SECs 40 Table of Contents approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) amendments to AU Section 411, The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity With Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 142 3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP No. FAS 142 3). This FSP amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142). The objective of this FSP is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under SFAS No. 141 (Revised), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141(R)) and other U.S. GAAP. This FSP is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, and will be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date. On March 19, 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS No. 161). This new standard requires enhanced disclosures for derivative instruments, including those used in hedging activities. We adopted SFAS No. 161 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. As SFAS No. 161 only requires enhanced disclosures, the adoption of SFAS No. 161 did not impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. On December 4, 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(Revised), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141(R)), and SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS No. 160). These new standards are the U.S. GAAP outcome of a joint project with the International Accounting Standards Board. SFAS No. 141(R) and SFAS No. 160 introduce significant changes in the accounting for and reporting of business acquisitions and noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary. SFAS No. 141(R) and SFAS No. 160 continue the movement toward the greater use of fair values in financial reporting and increased transparency through expanded disclosures. SFAS No. 141(R) changes how business acquisitions are accounted for, including expensing acquisition costs as incurred, and will impact financial statements at the acquisition date and in subsequent periods. SFAS No. 160 requires noncontrolling interests (previously referred to as minority interests) to be reported as a component of equity, which changes the accounting for transactions with noncontrolling interest holders. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of our fiscal year 2010. Generally, the effects of SFAS No. 141(R) will depend on future acquisitions. SFAS No. 160 is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The adoption of SFAS No. 160 will not have a significant impact on the reporting of our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows as noncontrolling interests are not material to the financial statements. On April 1, 2007, we adopted the recognition and disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS No. 158), which required that our Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect the funded status of the pension and postretirement plans. We have historically used a December 31 measurement date for our pension and postretirement plans. Effective for fiscal year 2009, we measured plan assets and obligations as of March 29, 2009, the end of our fiscal year, eliminating the use of the option in SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions and SFAS No. 106 Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, to measure up to three months prior to the financial statement date. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result of the adoption of the change in measurement date, we recorded a decrease to the ending balance of retained earnings as of March 29, 2009 of $5.8 million after tax. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK At various times, we use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and prices of strategic raw materials. Fluctuations in the market values of such derivative instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the underlying economic exposures that the instruments are intended to hedge. Because derivative instruments are used solely as hedges and not for speculative trading purposes, they do not represent incremental risk to the Company. For further discussion of derivative financial instruments, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Interest Rate Risk We have variable rate debt obligations that expose us to interest rate risk. If market interest rates had averaged 10 percent higher than actual levels in fiscal 2009 or 2008, the effect on our interest expense and net income would not have been material. Foreign Currency Risk The majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars; however, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies for transactions denominated in other currencies. As discussed in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, we had foreign currency hedges in place at March 29, 2009 and March 30, 2008 to reduce such exposure. The estimated loss in fair value on foreign currency hedges outstanding as of March 29, 2009, from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in exchange rates, would not have been material. Material Cost Risk We entered into long term supply agreements to fix the purchase price of strategic raw materials at March 29, 2009 and March 30, 2008. In addition, we had escalation clauses related to raw material pricing in certain of our contracts at March 29, 2009 and March 30, 2008. If market rates had averaged 10 percent higher than actual levels in either fiscal 2009 or 2008, the effect on our cost of sales and net earnings, after considering the effects of these agreements and contracts, would not have been material. 42 Table of Contents
