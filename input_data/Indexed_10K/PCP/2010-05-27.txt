ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (in millions, except per share data) Business overview Our businesses aggressively focused on opportunities in a very challenging environment in fiscal 2010, improving year over year segment operating margins despite facing destocking from aerospace, European industrial gas turbine (IGT) and Chinese pipe customers, and lower average metal selling prices. These results were principally driven by a continued focus on cost reduction and operational improvements across all of our segments. Also, during the year, we successfully acquired a strategically important business within the Forged Products segment and acquired a minority interest in a Chinese pipe business. On September 30, 2009, we completed the acquisition of Carlton Forge Works and a related entity (Carlton) for approximately $847 million in cash, comprised of approximately $502 million of cash on hand (reduced $3 million due to working capital adjustments) and the proceeds of approximately $345 million of commercial paper debt issuance. Carlton, a leading manufacturer of seamless rolled rings for critical aerospace applications, offers nickel, titanium, and steel rolled rings across the widest range of product sizes in the industry. Carlton broadens our forging capabilities and enables us to provide a full range of forged products to our aerospace engine customers. The Carlton acquisition is an asset purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of our Forged Products segment. On January 15, 2010, we acquired a 49% equity interest in Yangzhou Chengde Steel Tube Co., Ltd (Chengde) for approximately $351 million in cash, comprised of approximately $111 million of cash on hand and the proceeds of approximately $240 million of commercial paper debt issuance. Chengde is a leading manufacturer of seamless, extruded pipe for boiler applications in coal fired power plants, as well as pipe and tubing for other energy related applications, such as compressed natural gas. The company operates from one facility with a manufacturing footprint of nearly 6 million square feet, in the Jiangsu Province of China. Chengde has built a leading position in the Chinese boiler pipe market and has begun to make inroads into export markets. Also, during the year, we continued to upgrade manufacturing equipment and increase operational productivity with the completion or initiation of various large scale cost reduction projects, primarily within the Forged Products segment. We expect fiscal 2011 capital expenditures will be approximately equal to fiscal 2010 spending levels, with the most significant equipment upgrade and cost reduction projects planned within the Forged Products and Investment Cast Products segments. We fully understand the challenges ahead of us through the first half of fiscal 2011. Our Chinese pipe customers are making adjustments to their inventories as they transition to building larger, more eco friendly coal fired plants that will result in two full quarters of reduced seamless pipe shipments within our Forged products segment and our recently acquired Chinese pipe business. The second quarter will also have its seasonal challenges of scheduled forge shutdowns for maintenance and extended holidays in our European operations. Looking ahead, we anticipate a strong second half of fiscal 2011. Operations across all of our segments have established new cost structures that are poised to achieve solid results as the anticipated volume begins to return in the second half of fiscal 2011. We expect to see a realignment of component orders and aircraft build rates and initial 787 orders as production ramps up. IGT schedules should stabilize and we believe we will continue to gain market share and expand our customer base. We expect seamless pipe shipments will recover as Chinese inventory is depleted. We will manage the expected upturn as we did the downturn, with continued attention to daily results and focus on optimum performance. 23 Table of Contents Fiscal Year % Increase/(Decrease) 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Net sales $ 5,486.6 $ 6,801.2 $ 6,718.6 (19 )% 1 % Cost of goods sold 3,693.4 4,818.6 4,873.4 (23 )% (1 )% Selling and administrative expenses 370.8 386.4 349.3 (4 )% 11 % Restructuring and asset impairment 11.3 6.1 (100 )% 85 % Interest expense, net 13.1 10.4 42.3 26 % (75 )% Income before income tax and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 1,409.3 1,574.5 1,447.5 (11 )% 9 % Income tax expense 485.6 538.1 490.2 (10 )% 10 % Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 1.4 100 % 0 % Net income from continuing operations 925.1 1,036.4 957.3 (11 )% 8 % Net (loss) income from discontinued operations (2.5 ) 8.4 31.2 (130 )% (73 )% Net income 922.6 1,044.8 988.5 (12 )% 6 % Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest (0.8 ) (0.3 ) (1.2 ) 167 % (75 )% Net income attributable to Precision Castparts Corp.

Total aerospace sales decreased 17 percent over fiscal 2009 levels, and increased from 53 percent of total sales in fiscal 2009 to 54 percent of total sales in fiscal 2010. Power generation sales decreased 15 percent over fiscal 2009 levels, and increased from 25 percent of total sales in fiscal 2009 to 27 percent of total sales in fiscal 2010. Sales to the general industrial and other markets decreased 30 percent over the prior year, and decreased from 22 percent of total sales in fiscal 2009 to 19 percent of total sales in fiscal 2010. The decrease in sales was driven by reduced demand from destocking aerospace, European IGT and Chinese pipe customers, weakness in the general industrial and power markets, and lower average metal selling prices. Excluding the impacts of currency, metal prices, and the acquisition of Carlton, aerospace volume decreased approximately $525 million, or 17%, general industrial and other markets decreased approximately $244 million, or 20%, and power markets decreased approximately $155 million, or 11% compared to the same period last year. Lower nickel alloy selling prices from the Forged segments three primary mills negatively impacted sales by approximately $170 million compared to the prior year. Contractual material pass through pricing, which reflects the impact of escalation formulas included in certain long term agreements, also declined, increasing sales by approximately $288.5 million in fiscal 2010 versus approximately $419.5 million in fiscal 2009, a decrease of $131.0 million. Contractual material pass through pricing adjustments are calculated based on market prices such as those shown in the above table in trailing periods from one to twelve months. In addition, our foreign operations reported approximately $41 million in reduced U.S. dollar equivalent sales year over year due to the increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to international currencies, primarily the British pound. The remaining decrease is primarily attributable to lower average metal selling prices at our businesses that employ price in effect metal pricing, and various other factors. These decreases were partially offset by approximately $135 million of sales from Carlton, which was acquired in the third quarter of this year. With regard to growth in the commercial aircraft industry, based on data from the Airline Monitor as of January 2010, Boeing and Airbus aircraft deliveries increased moderately from calendar year 2008 to 2009, largely due to the Boeing strike in 2008. The Airline Monitor expects Boeing and Airbus aircraft deliveries to be relatively flat in calendar year 2010 as compared to 2009. Due to manufacturing lead times, our production volumes are generally 6 to 9 months ahead of aircraft deliveries and therefore, based on build rates, should also have been relatively flat. However, our sales have been negatively impacted by a discrepancy between order rates and engine builds, which we believe has been due to inventory destocking in the supply chain. We expect our aerospace sales to increase in fiscal 2011 as a result of the industrys higher projected 787 deliveries in calendar year 2011. Cost of goods sold was $3,693.4 million, or 67 percent of sales, in fiscal 2010 as compared to $4,818.6 million, or 71 percent of sales, in fiscal 2009. The improvement in the year over year percentage reflects increased productivity and improved material utilization compared to fiscal 2009. Contractual material pass through pricing diluted gross margin by 1.8 percentage points in fiscal 2010 compared to 1.9 percentage points last year. Selling and administrative expenses were $370.8 million, or 7 percent of sales, in fiscal 2010 compared to $386.4 million, or 6 percent of sales, in fiscal 2009. The higher year over year percentage was primarily due to higher expense related to our deferred compensation plan as compared to the prior year and the fixed nature of selling and administrative expenses coupled with a decrease in sales. Net income from continuing operations (attributable to PCC) for fiscal 2010 was $924.3 million, or $6.50 per share (diluted). By comparison, net income from continuing operations (attributable to PCC) for fiscal 2009 was $1,036.1 million, or $7.37 per share (diluted), which included restructuring charges totaling $0.05 per share (diluted). Fiscal 2010 net income (including discontinued operations) was $921.8 million, or $6.49 per share (diluted), compared with net income of $1,044.5 million, or $7.43 per share (diluted) in fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2010 net income includes a loss of $2.5 million, or $0.01 per share (diluted), from discontinued operations, compared to income of $8.4 million, or $0.06 per share (diluted), in the prior year. 25 Table of Contents Fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 Total sales for fiscal 2009 were $6,801.2 million, an increase of $82.6 million, or 1 percent, from fiscal 2008 sales of $6,718.6 million. Total aerospace sales decreased 4 percent over fiscal 2008 levels, and decreased from 56 percent of total sales in fiscal 2008 to 53 percent of total sales in fiscal 2009. Power generation sales increased 4 percent over fiscal 2008 levels, and increased from 24 percent of total sales in fiscal 2008 to 25 percent of total sales in fiscal 2009. Sales to the general industrial and other markets increased 14 percent over the prior year, and increased from 20 percent of total sales in fiscal 2008 to 22 percent of total sales in fiscal 2009. The increase in sales was driven by the addition of approximately $65 million in sales from Airdrome, Fatigue and Hackney Ladish, which were acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, and from steady improvement in IGT, extruded pipe and aerospace fasteners sales. This was partially offset by the impacts of the Boeing strike, which negatively impacted sales by approximately $184 million in fiscal 2009, and lower nickel alloy selling prices and increased internal sales at our Special Metals businesses, which negatively impacted sales by approximately $179 million and $59 million, respectively. Contractual material pass through pricing also declined, increasing sales by approximately $419.5 million in fiscal 2009 versus approximately $460.9 million in fiscal 2008. Contractual material pass through pricing adjustments are calculated based on market prices such as those shown in the above table in trailing periods from one to twelve months. In addition, our foreign operations reported approximately $152.9 million in reduced U.S. dollar equivalent sales year over year due to the strong increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to international currencies, primarily the British pound, the Euro, Brazilian real and Australian dollar. With regard to the commercial aircraft industry, aircraft deliveries decreased 3.4 percent in calendar year 2008, and Boeing and Airbus deliveries combined increased moderately from calendar year 2008 to 2009. Due to manufacturing lead times, our production volumes are approximately 6 to 9 months ahead of aircraft deliveries. Cost of goods sold was $4,818.6 million, or 71 percent of sales, in fiscal 2009 as compared to $4,873.4 million, or 73 percent of sales, in fiscal 2008. The improvement in the year over year percentage reflects increased productivity and improved material utilization compared to fiscal 2008. Contractual material pass through pricing diluted gross margin by 1.9 percentage points in fiscal 2009 compared to 2.0 percentage points in fiscal 2008. Selling and administrative expenses were $386.4 million, or 6 percent of sales, in fiscal 2009 compared to $349.3 million, or 5 percent of sales, in fiscal 2008. The higher year over year percentage was primarily due to increased stock based compensation expense and the inclusion of three acquisitions in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and a full year of Caledonian operations, partially offset by lower expense related to our deferred compensation plan compared to fiscal 2008. Net income from continuing operations (attributable to PCC) for fiscal 2009 was $1,036.1 million, or $7.37 per share (diluted), which included restructuring charges totaling $0.05 per share (diluted). By comparison, net income from continuing operations (attributable to PCC) for fiscal 2008 was $956.1 million, or $6.82 per share (diluted), which also included restructuring charges totaling $0.03 per share (diluted). Fiscal 2009 net income (including discontinued operations) was $1,044.5 million, or $7.43 per share (diluted), compared with net income of $987.3 million, or $7.04 per share (diluted) in fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2009 net income includes income of $8.4 million, or $0.06 per share (diluted), from discontinued operations, compared to income of $31.2 million, or $0.22 per share (diluted), in fiscal 2008. Acquisitions On January 15, 2010, we acquired a 49% equity interest in Yangzhou Chengde Steel Tube Co., Ltd (Chengde) for approximately $351 million in cash, comprised of approximately $111 million of cash on hand and the proceeds of approximately $240 million of commercial paper debt issuance. This investment is accounted for under the equity method as we have significant influence over, but not control of, the major operating and financial policies of Chengde. The carrying value of this investment as of March 28, 2010 was $356.3 million and was included in investment in unconsolidated affiliates in our consolidated balance sheet. The carrying value of our investment in Chengde exceeded the amount of underlying equity in net assets of Chengde by approximately $170 million as of the date we acquired Chengde. This difference arose through the valuation process that was applied to the assets acquired. Chengde is a leading manufacturer of seamless, extruded pipe for boiler applications in coal fired power plants, as well as pipe and tubing for other energy related applications, such as compressed natural gas. The 26 Table of Contents company operates from one facility with a manufacturing footprint of nearly 6 million square feet, in the Jiangsu Province of China. Chengde has built a leading position in the Chinese boiler pipe market and has begun to make inroads into export markets. In addition, the following business acquisitions were accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, the results of operations have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Income since the acquisition dates. Fiscal 2010 On September 30, 2009, we completed the acquisition of Carlton Forge Works and a related entity (Carlton) for approximately $847 million in cash, comprised of approximately $502 million of cash on hand (reduced $3 million due to working capital adjustments) and the proceeds of approximately $345 million of commercial paper debt issuance. Carlton, a leading manufacturer of seamless rolled rings for critical aerospace applications, offers nickel, titanium, and steel rolled rings across the widest range of product sizes in the industry. Carlton broadens our forging capabilities and enables us to provide a full range of forged products to our aerospace engine customers. The Carlton acquisition is an asset purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of our Forged Products segment. This transaction resulted in $400.1 million of goodwill (which is deductible for tax purposes) and $336.7 million of other intangible assets, including tradenames with indefinite lives valued at $89.1 million, customer relationships with indefinite lives valued at $204.8 million, customer relationships with finite lives valued at $3.7 million, backlog valued at $10.2 million and revenue sharing agreements valued at $28.9 million. We also recorded a long term liability related to the fair value of a pre existing revenue sharing agreement valued at $92.0 million. The impact of this acquisition was not material to our consolidated results of operations; consequently, pro forma information has not been included. Fiscal 2009 In the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we acquired three entities for a total cost of approximately $469.4 million, which was primarily paid in cash. These transactions resulted in $320.2 million of goodwill (of which $217.1 million is deductible for tax purposes) and $59.9 million of other intangible assets, including tradenames with indefinite lives valued at approximately $34.7 million. The impact of these acquisitions was not material to our consolidated results of operations; consequently, pro forma information has not been included. The following is a description of the three acquisitions. On December 4, 2008, we acquired Hackney Ladish Holding Corp. (Hackney Ladish), a leading producer of forged pipe fittings for critical energy infrastructure and related applications. With more than 80 years of experience manufacturing pipe fittings, Hackney Ladish offers the widest range of product types and sizes in the industry. Fittings are used in piping systems throughout the energy value chain, from drilling through processing and storage. Hackney Ladishs products connect pipe, change the direction of flow, increase or reduce pipe sizes, join or separate flow, or cap pipe ends. This acquisition extends our reach into oil and gas markets and provides profitable growth opportunities for our seamless pipe and nickel alloy tubing operations. Hackney Ladish operates manufacturing facilities in Russellville, Arkansas and Enid, Oklahoma. The Hackney Ladish acquisition is a stock purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of the Forged Products segment. On November 21, 2008, we acquired Fatigue Technology, Inc. (FTI), headquartered in Seattle, Washington. FTI pioneered the cold expansion process in 1969 and is the technology leader in fatigue life extension for both metal and composite airframe fastener holes. FTI has taken this foundation of creating a residual stress field around a cold worked hole to develop innovative solutions that significantly reduce manufacturing and maintenance flow time and costs. The resulting components are easier and faster to install, and the methods of aircraft assembly are enhanced. This acquisition continues our strategy of expanding into additional critical aerospace fastener products, thus offering our customers a wider selection of fasteners to meet all of their requirements. The FTI acquisition is an asset purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of the Fastener Products segment. On September 30, 2008, we acquired Airdrome Holdings, LLC (Airdrome), which consists of Airdrome Precision Components (APC) and AF Aerospace Ltd. (AFA). APC, located in Long Beach, California, is a leading 27 Table of Contents supplier of hydraulic and pneumatic fluid fittings primarily for airframe applications. AFA, located in Rugby, England, manufactures a variety of machined components for aerospace applications, including fittings and other fluid conveyance products, ultra high tensile bolts, and machined details. Fluid fittings, manufactured in nickel, titanium, and stainless steel alloys, are the critical connectors for hoses transporting fuel, hydraulic fluid, and pneumatic pressure throughout an aircraft. This acquisition also fits our strategy of enhancing our critical aerospace fastener family of products to serve our customers better. The Airdrome acquisition is an asset purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of the Fastener Products segment. Fiscal 2008 On July 5, 2007, we acquired Caledonian Alloys Group Limited (Caledonian) for approximately $208.1 million in cash, of which $165.1 million was paid at close, and $21.2 million ($21.5 million based on acquisition date exchange rate) was paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. We paid one additional contingent payment of approximately $17.3 million ($21.5 million based on acquisition date exchange rate) in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Caledonian is a market leader in providing nickel superalloy and titanium revert management solutions for the aerospace and industrial gas turbine (IGT) industries. Revert includes metal chips, casting gates, bar ends, forging flash, and other byproducts from casting, forging, and fastener manufacturing processes that can be re melted and reused. The acquisition of Caledonian provides us with the infrastructure and capabilities needed to create a closed loop system for the retention and reuse of internally generated revert. In addition, Caledonian provides access to new sources of material outside the Company and helps determine optimal utilization of revert streams throughout our melting operations worldwide. Headquartered in Livingston, Scotland, Caledonian operated nine revert processing facilities in six countries as of the date of acquisition. The Caledonian acquisition is a stock purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of the Forged Products segment. This transaction resulted in $149.3 million of goodwill (which is not deductible for tax purposes) and other intangibles. On April 3, 2007, we acquired McWilliams, a privately held company in Rockaway, New Jersey, for $91.4 million in cash. Founded in 1880, McWilliams is a leading manufacturer of titanium, nickel and steel forgings, primarily for commercial and military aerospace applications. McWilliams operates both hammer and screw presses for open and closed die forging at its New Jersey facility. The McWilliams acquisition is an asset purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of the Forged Products segment. Discontinued operations Our financial statements were impacted by activities relating to the planned or completed divestiture of certain of our businesses. These businesses have been accounted for under discontinued operations guidance. Accordingly, any operating results of these businesses are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Income as discontinued operations, net of income tax, and all prior periods have been reclassified. Fiscal 2010 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we decided to dispose of a small non core business in the Fasteners Products segment and reclassified it to discontinued operations. In the third quarter of fiscal 2010, we decided to divest a small non core business in the Investment Cast Products segment and reclassified it to discontinued operations. The sale of the business was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. The transaction resulted in a gain of approximately $11.4 million (net of tax) in fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2009 In the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we decided to dispose of two automotive fastener operations. The decision to discontinue these automotive fastener operations resulted from their non core nature coupled with further erosion in the automotive market. These operations have been reclassified from the Fasteners Products segment to discontinued operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. We recognized an impairment loss of approximately $8.7 million (net of tax) in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 related to these automotive fastener businesses held for sale due to continued erosion in the automotive market. 28 Table of Contents In the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we sold the stock of several small entities, a group of foreign operations held for sale and previously recorded as discontinued from our former Flow Technologies pumps and valves business. The transaction resulted in a net gain of approximately $3.0 million in fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2008 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we entered into an agreement to sell a fastener business headquartered in Shannon, Ireland. The sale was completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, resulting in a gain of approximately $3.5 million. This fastener business was reclassified from the Fastener Products segment to discontinued operations. Also in the fourth quarter, we decided to sell an alloy manufacturing business located in the Czech Republic. This business primarily supplied steel ingots to Wyman Gordons Grafton, Massachusetts operation. This alloy manufacturing business was reclassified from the Forged Products segment to discontinued operations and continues to be marketed. In January 2008, we completed the sale of a business located in France that produced alloys for approximately $11.2 million. This business was held for sale since the first quarter of fiscal 2007. The sale of the business generated a tax effected gain of $4.6 million, or $0.03 per share (diluted) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. In January 2008, we completed the sale of a specialty wire business for $30.2 million. This business was acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, and was reclassified from the Forged Products segment to discontinued operations during the third quarter of fiscal 2008. The sale of the business generated a tax effected gain of $16.3 million, or $0.12 per share (diluted), of which $4.0 million, or $0.03 per share (diluted), was recognized in the third quarter of fiscal 2008. Restructuring, asset impairment and other non recurring charges We regularly assess our cost structure to ensure that operations are properly sized for prevailing market conditions, taking into consideration current and forecasted conditions in markets we serve. During fiscal 2010, we did not incur any restructuring or impairment charges. The following restructuring and asset impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 2009 and 2008. Fiscal 2009 In the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we incurred restructuring and impairment charges of $11.3 million pursuant to plans to downsize operations across all segments. We had been gearing up for aerospace growth into fiscal 2010, whereas demand decreased, particularly in the casting and forging aerospace markets. The charges consisted of $9.0 million for employee severance expenses and $2.3 million for impairments and relocation expenses associated with long lived assets. These restructuring plans provided for terminations of approximately 980 employees in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009 and first quarter of fiscal 2010. The restructuring and impairment charges recorded by the Investment Cast Products segment, Forged Products segment and Fastener Products segment were $5.2 million, $3.7 million and $2.4 million, respectively, during fiscal 2009. As of March 28, 2010 and March 29, 2009, $0 and $2.1 million, respectively, remained in accrued liabilities related to the restructuring plans. The tax effected impact of these charges was $7.5 million, or $0.05 per share (diluted). Fiscal 2008 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Investment Cast Products segment recorded restructuring charges of $6.1 million, primarily for shut down costs associated with an underutilized machining operation located in the United Kingdom. The tax effected impact of these charges was $4.3 million, or $0.03 per share (diluted). Impacts of the Global Economic Recession and Program Delays Economic events created recessionary economic conditions around the world in many industries in fiscal 2009 and 2010. Although many countries and industries are recovering, weakness persists in many areas. While we are 29 Table of Contents not immune to impacts of the global recession, we believe our strong financial position enables us to take advantage of opportunities in our markets served, continue to make operational improvements in our businesses and benefit from the economic recovery. During the 2010 fiscal year, approximately 54 percent of our sales were to customers in the global aerospace markets. Until the recession occurred and aerospace program delays were announced, customer schedules indicated that the aerospace production rates would continue to experience growth throughout fiscal 2010 and possibly beyond, particularly due to anticipated build rates of major new aerospace programs such as the Boeing 787 and Airbus A380, each of which contains significant per ship set revenue for PCC. Aircraft manufacturer schedules now indicate that aerospace production rates will remain relatively flat for the first half of fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 levels, but we expect to see a realignment of component build rates and aircraft production schedules as destocking ends in the supply chain and as Boeing 787 and Airbus A380 production starts to ramp up in the second half of fiscal 2011. Our most significant customers in the aerospace industry are primarily large, well financed businesses that we believe have the ability to weather the economic downturn. Therefore, while there is significant uncertainty as to the direction of the economy in future periods, we have not experienced, and do not anticipate significant collection issues with our accounts receivable or marketability of our in process inventories. However, our customers depend on demand from their end use customers, as well as the end use customers financial viability, of which we are unable to make an assessment. We must rely on the forecasted information provided from time to time by our customers as guidance with regard to the impacts from the current and future economic environment. During fiscal 2010, approximately 27 percent of our sales were to customers in the global power markets, which include our IGT business as well as sales of our seamless extruded pipe. Demand in our OEM IGT markets has softened and during the latter half of fiscal 2010, we experienced the beginning of destocking by our European customers. During our fiscal 2010 fourth quarter, seamless pipe sales declined due to a change in Chinese customers ordering patterns as they started to work through current inventory and transition to building larger, more eco friendly coal fired plants. Our most significant customers in the power markets are primarily large, well financed businesses that we believe should have the ability to weather the economic downturn or are customers for which sales are backed by letters of credit on which we believe there is little risk of default. Therefore, we have not experienced and do not anticipate significant collection issues with our accounts receivable or marketability of our in process inventories. However, our customers depend on demand from their end use customers, as well as the end use customers financial viability, of which we are unable to make an assessment. We must rely on the forecasted information provided from time to time by our customers as guidance with regard to the impacts from the current and future economic environment. The remaining 19 percent of our sales in fiscal 2010 were into general industrial markets. It is difficult to summarize the opportunities and challenges in these markets, because the circumstances vary widely from one individual market to another. We have taken, and will continue to take, precautionary measures with customers in these markets to limit our exposure, to the extent possible, to potential bankruptcies and other financial issues experienced by these customers. These measures include shortening cash collection terms, regular updating of credit profiles, discontinuance of further business with customers not paying in a timely manner and the requirement of cash in advance of shipments, among others. Due to the diversity of markets and customer profiles in these businesses and the precautionary steps referred to previously, we have not experienced and do not anticipate severe impacts on our business or significant exposure to credit losses in these markets. However, it is possible that we may experience unanticipated unfavorable impacts. We follow an investment philosophy of diversified investing and risk mitigation when managing our pension plans. The investments in our pension plans totaled approximately $1.5 billion at the end of fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2010, we contributed $211.8 million to our defined benefit pension plans, including voluntary contributions of $192.6 million, to increase plan funding. We believe our financial position and liquidity will allow us to make all required pension contributions as well as any additional voluntary contributions that management deems advisable. We made a voluntary contribution of $100.0 million to the defined benefit pension plans in early fiscal 2011. See the Changes in Financial Condition and Liquidity section for a discussion of the impact of the global financial climate and credit shortage on liquidity. 30 Table of Contents Financial results by segment We analyze our operating segments and manage our business across three reportable segments: Investment Cast Products, Forged Products and Fastener Products. Segment operating income amounts presented below exclude restructuring and asset impairment charges.

(3) Forged Products: Includes intersegment sales of $64.1 million, $75.6 million and $41.0 million for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. (4) Fastener Products: Includes intersegment sales of $2.3 million, $3.3 million and $2.3 million for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 31 Table of Contents Investment Cast Products The Investment Cast Products segment manufactures investment castings, or provides related investment casting materials and alloys, for aircraft engines, IGT engines, airframes, armaments, medical prostheses and other industrial applications. Fiscal Year % Increase/(Decrease) 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Sales by Market: Aerospace $ 1,045.1 $ 1,314.5 $ 1,310.5 (20 )% 0% % of total 57% 58% 61% Power 580.6 686.2 562.3 (15 )% 22% % of total 31% 30% 26% General Industrial & Other 225.6 271.4 265.1 (17 )% 2% % of total 12% 12% 13% Total Sales $ 1,851.3 $ 2,272.1 $ 2,137.9 (19 )% 6% Operating income $ 560.0 $ 582.7 $ 517.4 (4 )% 13% % of sales 30.2% 25.6% 24.2% Fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 The Investment Cast Products segment reported fiscal 2010 sales of $1,851.3 million, a decrease of 19 percent from the prior years sales of $2,272.1 million. The year over year decrease in sales primarily reflects a continued disconnect between aerospace order rates and engine builds related to customer destocking, which negatively impacted aerospace sales by approximately $210 million, or 18%. Power market sales were down by $75 million, or 12%, compared to last year as a result of destocking by European IGT customers, which is anticipated to continue through the first half of fiscal 2011. Sales also include $40.7 million of higher pricing related to contractual pass through of increased material costs compared to $81.3 million in fiscal 2009, a decrease of $40.6 million. In addition, our foreign operations reported approximately $10 million in reduced U.S. dollar equivalent sales year over year due to the increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to international currencies, primarily the British pound. Operating income for the Investment Cast Products segment was $560.0 million or 30.2 percent of sales in fiscal 2010, compared to $582.7 million, or 25.6 percent of sales, in fiscal 2009. Despite the challenges of continued destocking, the segment improved operating margins by 4.6 percentage points year over year due to increased labor productivity, improved material utilization and lower scrap and rework costs. Contractual material pass through pricing diluted operating margins by 0.7 percentage points in fiscal 2010 compared to 1.0 percentage points last year. The Investment Cast Products segment experienced a slight improvement in aerospace OEM order rates at the end of fiscal 2010 and anticipates growing aerospace OEM and aftermarket sales in the second half of fiscal 2011 as Boeing 787 production ramps up and destocking ends. We anticipate the segment will be able to effectively leverage fiscal 2010 cost takeouts as volume returns in fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 The Investment Cast Products segment reported fiscal 2009 sales of $2,272.1 million, an increase of 6 percent from the prior years sales of $2,137.9 million. The year over year increase in sales reflects continuing strength and increased customer penetration in the global IGT markets and solid growth in aerospace markets in the first half of the fiscal year prior to the Boeing strike, which we estimate negatively impacted sales by approximately $112 million in fiscal 2009, and approximately $28 million in reduced U.S. dollar equivalent sales year over year due to the strong increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to international currencies, primarily the British pound. Sales also include $81.3 million of higher pricing related to contractual pass through of increased material costs compared to $100.4 million in fiscal 2008. 32 Table of Contents Operating income for the Investment Cast Products segment was $582.7 million or 25.6 percent of sales in fiscal 2009, compared to $517.4 million, or 24.2 percent of sales, in fiscal 2008. The increase in operating income reflects the impact of cost reductions and improved productivity, which helped to offset the negative impact of lost sales due to the Boeing strike. The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a negative impact of approximately $5 million on operating income in fiscal 2009. The continued improvement in operating margins as a percent of sales was driven by higher productivity, effective material utilization and lower scrap costs. Contractual material pass through pricing diluted operating margins by 1.0 percentage points in fiscal 2009 compared to 1.2 percentage points in fiscal 2008. Forged Products The Forged Products segment manufactures forged components from sophisticated titanium and nickel based alloys principally for the aerospace and power generation markets, and manufactures nickel and cobalt based alloys used to produce forged components for aerospace and non aerospace markets which include products for oil and gas, chemical processing, and pollution control applications. The segment also provides nickel superalloy and titanium revert management solutions, re melting various material byproducts and reusing them in casting, forging, and fastener manufacturing processes. Forged Products sales to the aerospace and power generation markets are derived primarily from the same large engine customers served by the Investment Cast Products segment, with additional aerospace sales to manufacturers of landing gear and other airframe components. The Forged Products segment also produces extruded pipe for the power generation and the oil and gas industries. Fiscal Year % Increase/(Decrease) 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Sales by Market: Aerospace $ 956.0 $ 1,158.0 $ 1,476.1 (17 )% (22 )% % of total 42% 39% 47% Power 857.2 997.6 1,064.1 (14 )% (6 )% % of total 37% 33% 33% General Industrial & Other 469.8 822.8 627.9 (43 )% 31 % % of total 21% 28% 20% Total Sales $ 2,283.0 $ 2,978.4 $ 3,168.1 (23 )% (6 )% Operating income $ 529.7 $ 652.9 $ 699.5 (19 )% (7 )% % of sales 23.2% 21.9% 22.1% Fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 The Forged Products segment reported fiscal 2010 sales of $2,283.0 million, a decrease of 23 percent from the prior years sales of $2,978.4 million. The acquisition of Carlton in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 contributed approximately $135 million in incremental sales over the prior year. The decrease in sales from the prior year reflects a decline in general industrial and other markets, which negatively impacted sales by approximately $184 million, or 30%, and aerospace OEM and aftermarket destocking, which negatively impacted aerospace sales by approximately $180 million, or 21%. A decline in power markets negatively impacted sales by $77 million, or 10%, compared to the prior year. The lower selling prices of external nickel alloy sales from the segments three primary mills negatively impacted external sales by approximately $170 million in fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2010 sales also include $240.7 million of higher contractual pricing related to pass through of increased raw material costs compared to $325.9 million last year, a decrease of $85.2 million. In addition, our foreign operations reported approximately $21 million in reduced U.S. dollar equivalent sales year over year due to the increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to international currencies, primarily the British pound. Operating income for the Forged Products segment was $529.7 million or 23.2 percent of sales in fiscal 2010, compared to $652.9 million, or 21.9 percent of sales, in fiscal 2009. Operating income was negatively impacted by reduced sales volume coupled with the segments high fixed cost base, the loss of higher margin energy products, 33 Table of Contents and rapid escalation in metal pricing toward the end of fiscal 2010, which exerted downward pressure on segment operating margins due to a lag in customer pricing. The contractual pass through of higher raw material costs diluted operating margins by 2.7 percentage points in both fiscal 2010 and 2009. Sales of seamless pipe within this segment are expected to decline in the first half of fiscal 2011 compared to early fiscal 2010 due to a change in Chinese customers ordering patterns as they work through current inventory and start to transition to building larger, more eco friendly coal fired plants. Moving into the second half of fiscal 2011, this evolution is expected to be a positive driver for pipe sales. For the latter half of fiscal 2011, similar to Investment Cast Products, the segments aerospace OEM and aftermarket schedules are showing solid increases as Boeing 787 production ramps up, destocking ends and results include a full year of Carlton. Operating income is expected to show improvement, benefiting from continued recovery of material costs and improved operational performance levels. Fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 The Forged Products segment reported fiscal 2009 sales of $2,978.4 million, a decrease of 6 percent from the prior years sales of $3,168.1 million. The acquisition of Hackney Ladish in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 contributed approximately $24 million in incremental sales over the prior year. The decrease in sales from the prior year reflects the decline in external selling prices of nickel alloy from the segments three primary mills, which negatively impacted external sales by approximately $179 million in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008. Nickel prices decreased approximately 50 percent on the LME compared to fiscal 2008. In addition, we estimate fiscal 2009 was negatively impacted by the Boeing strike by approximately $60 million. In fiscal 2009, the Forged Products segments three primary mills dedicated more resources for internal production which impacted top line revenues by approximately $59 million. In addition, the segments foreign operations reported approximately $85 million in reduced U.S. dollar equivalent sales year over year due to the strong increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to international currencies, primarily the British pound and Australian dollar. These declines were partially offset by a 40.3 percent increase in extruded pipe sales. Fiscal 2009 sales also include $325.9 million of higher contractual pricing related to pass through of increased raw material costs, compared to $345.9 million last year. Total intercompany sales, including sales within and between segments, increased from $642.4 million in fiscal 2008 to $836.0 million in fiscal 2009. These sales are eliminated in consolidation. Operating income for the Forged Products segment was $652.9 million or 21.9 percent of sales in fiscal 2009, compared to $699.5 million, or 22.1 percent of sales, in fiscal 2008. Operating income was negatively impacted by lost sales related to the Boeing strike and the impact of the 29,000 ton press failure at the segments Houston facility during the year. In addition, the weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a negative impact of approximately $15 million on operating income in fiscal 2009. Increased efficiencies and improved internal coordination of resources and material utilization helped to partially offset the negative impact. The contractual pass through of higher raw material costs diluted operating margins by 2.7 percentage points in both fiscal 2009 and 2008. 34 Table of Contents Fastener Products The Fastener Products segment produces fasteners, fastener systems and components for critical applications in the aerospace, automotive and industrial machinery markets as well as applications and monitoring units utilized in the power generation industry. Fiscal Year % Increase/(Decrease) 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Sales by Market: Aerospace $ 990.3 $ 1,134.2 $ 976.0 (13 )% 16 % % of total 73% 73% 69% Power 16.8 19.4 18.4 (13 )% 5 % % of total 1% 1% 1% General Industrial & Other 345.2 397.1 418.2 (13 )% (5 )% % of total 26% 26% 30% Total Sales $ 1,352.3 $ 1,550.7 $ 1,412.6 (13 )% 10 % Operating income $ 439.3 $ 459.1 $ 373.6 (4 )% 23 % % of sales 32.5% 29.6% 26.4% Fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 The Fastener Products segment reported fiscal 2010 sales of $1,352.3 million, a 13 percent decrease from fiscal 2009 sales of $1,550.7 million. The decrease in sales primarily resulted from further aerospace aftermarket and distributor destocking coupled with a decline in regional/business jet demand, which negatively impacted year over year aerospace sales by $135 million, or 12% (excluding the impact of currency). A decline in general industrial and other markets negatively impacted sales by $43 million, or 12% (excluding the impact of currency), compared to the prior year. In addition, our foreign operations reported approximately $10 million in reduced U.S. dollar equivalent sales year over year due to the increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to international currencies, primarily the British pound. Operating income for the Fasteners segment was $439.3 million or 32.5 percent of sales in fiscal 2010, compared to $459.1 million, or 29.6 percent of sales, in fiscal 2009. The higher operating margin was a result of continuous, aggressive cost improvement projects undertaken throughout fiscal 2010, resulting in productivity improvements, better utilization of assets, and effective cost management across the segment. With aerospace destocking at an end, direct aerospace OEM orders are experiencing a gradual recovery, with solid upside in the second half of fiscal 2011 in response to Boeing 787 production. Distribution and aftermarket deliveries are anticipated to grow in the same time frame. These increased volumes, driven across the businesss improved cost structure, will help the segment achieve even stronger operational performance. Fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 The Fastener Products segment reported fiscal 2009 sales of $1,550.7 million, a 10 percent increase from fiscal 2008 sales of $1,412.6 million. The increase in sales primarily resulted from aerospace sales growing approximately 16 percent compared to the prior year largely due to market share gains. The growth in aerospace sales included approximately $41 million related to Airdrome and FTI, which were acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. The segment overcame negative pressures due to the Boeing strike, which accounted for a decrease in Fastener Products sales of approximately $12 million in fiscal 2009. Additional negative impacts to sales in this segment included the continuation of a depressed North American automotive market, coupled with softening in both the European and Brazilian automotive markets, as well as weakness in other areas of the general industrial market. In addition, our foreign operations reported approximately $39 million in reduced U.S. dollar equivalent sales year over year due to the strong increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to international currencies, primarily the British pound and Brazilian real. Operating income for the Fasteners segment was $459.1 million or 29.6 percent of sales in fiscal 2009, compared to $373.6 million, or 26.4 percent of sales, in fiscal 2008. The improvement in operating margins reflected 35 Table of Contents leverage from the increased sales volume and increased sales in the higher margin aerospace business, as well as the impact of continued efforts to reduce costs and improve manufacturing processes. This was slightly offset by the weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which had a negative impact of approximately $10 million on operating income in fiscal 2009. Interest and taxes Net interest expense in fiscal 2010 was $13.1 million, compared with $10.4 million in fiscal 2009. The higher net interest expense was primarily due to lower interest income earned on lower interest rates and lower average cash balances. Net interest expense in fiscal 2009 was $10.4 million, compared with $42.3 million in fiscal 2008. The lower net interest expense was due to significantly reduced debt levels, lower borrowing rates, and higher interest income earned on higher average cash balances compared to fiscal 2008. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was 34.5 percent, 0.3 percentage points higher than the 34.2 percent effective tax rate in fiscal 2009. The slight increase in the full year tax rate compared to the prior year was primarily due to reduced benefits from the U.S. manufacturing deduction, an increase in state taxes and non benefitted foreign losses in the current year; offset by increased benefits from foreign earnings taxed at rates lower than the statutory U.S. tax rate. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was 34.2 percent, 0.3 percentage points higher than the 33.9 percent effective tax rate in fiscal 2008. The increase in tax rate was principally due to reduced tax benefits from lower foreign tax rates, a decrease in benefits from the U.S. manufacturing deduction (due to increased tax deductions for pension contributions), and a reduction in favorable audit settlements year over year, partially offset by an increase in benefits from the federal research credit. Liquidity and capital resources Total assets of $7,660.7 million at March 28, 2010 represented a $939.3 million increase from the $6,721.4 million balance at March 29, 2009. The increase principally reflects cash generated during the year from operations totaling $909.8 million and the addition of $907.0 million of total assets from the acquisition of Carlton, partially offset by $846.9 million in cash paid to acquire Carlton. Total capitalization at March 28, 2010 was $6,141.7 million, consisting of $250.0 million of debt and $5,891.7 million of equity. The debt to capitalization ratio declined to 4.1% at March 28, 2010 from 5.9% at the end of fiscal 2009, reflecting the impact of increased equity from earnings and lower cumulative translation adjustments, in addition to reduced debt. Cash as of March 28, 2010 was $112.4 million, down $442.1 million from the end of fiscal 2009, and total debt was $250.0 million, down $56.3 million since the end of fiscal 2009. The negative net cash flow of $385.8 million reflects $846.9 million of cash paid for the acquisition of Carlton, $351.0 million paid for the acquisition of our interest in Chengde, capital expenditures of $169.5 million, $17.3 million paid related to the acquisition of Caledonian, and cash dividends of $16.9 million, partially offset by cash generated from operations of $909.8 million and $89.0 million from the issuance of common stock. Capital spending of $169.5 million in fiscal 2010 principally provided for cost reduction and equipment upgrades throughout the Company. The capital spending plan for fiscal 2011, which is anticipated to be similar to the capital spending level in fiscal 2010, will be targeted for equipment upgrades and cost reduction and productivity projects throughout the Company. During fiscal 2010, we contributed $211.8 million to the defined benefit pension plans, of which $192.6 million was voluntary. In addition, we contributed $11.2 million to the other postretirement benefit plans during fiscal year 2010. We expect to contribute approximately $112.5 million to the defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2011, of which $103.7 million is voluntary. We expect to contribute approximately $10.8 million to the other postretirement benefit plans during fiscal year 2011. We believe we will be able to meet our short and longer term liquidity needs for working capital, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, capital spending, cash dividends, scheduled repayment of debt and 36 Table of Contents potential acquisitions from cash generated from operations, borrowing from our existing $1.0 billion revolving credit facility or new bank credit facilities, the issuance of public or privately placed debt securities, or the issuance of equity instruments. As noted above, our revolving bank credit facility (Credit Agreement) provides available borrowing up to $1.0 billion through May 2012. Our unused borrowing capacity as of March 28, 2010 was $983.4 million under the Credit Agreement, reduced by a $16.6 million workers compensation letter of credit issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The Credit Agreement contains various standard financial covenants, including maintenance of minimum net worth, interest coverage ratio and leverage ratio. The financial covenants in the Credit Agreement are our most restrictive covenants. Our covenant requirements and actual ratios as of March 28, 2010 were as follows (dollars in millions): Covenant Requirement Actual Consolidated minimum net worth (1) $3,079.9 (minimum) $ 5,891.7 Consolidated interest coverage ratio (1) 2.25:1.00 (minimum) 92.78:1.00 Consolidated leverage ratio (1) 3.25:1.00 (maximum) 0.15:1.00 (1) Terms are defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. As of March 28, 2010, we were in compliance with all financial covenants of our loan agreements. Historically, we have also issued commercial paper as a method of raising short term liquidity. We believe we continue to have the ability to issue commercial paper, even in the current credit markets, and have issued commercial paper in the third and fourth quarters to cover acquisitions and short term cash requirements. We do not anticipate any changes in our ability to borrow under our current credit facility, but changes in the financial condition of the participating financial institutions could negatively impact our ability to borrow funds in the future. Should that circumstance arise, we believe that we would be able to arrange any needed financing, although we are not able to predict what the terms of any such borrowings would be, or the source of the borrowed funds. Contractual obligations and commercial commitments We are obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements and lease agreements. The following table represents our contractual cash obligations as of March 28, 2010 and the estimated timing of future cash payments: Contractual Cash Obligations Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Long term debt $ 250.0 $ 15.1 $ 14.6 $ 5.2 $ 204.9 $ 4.8 $ 5.4 Operating leases (1) 66.5 19.7 15.8 12.1 8.1 6.0 4.8 Interest on fixed rate debt 38.3 11.0 10.5 9.6 6.6 0.4 0.2 Interest on variable rate debt (2) 10.8 2.2 2.8 3.3 2.5 Total $ 365.6 $ 48.0 $ 43.7 $ 30.2 $ 222.1 $ 11.2 $ 10.4 (1) Operating lease obligations include $0.6 million attributable to an operation held for sale. (2) Interest on variable rate debt is based on current prevailing interest rates. Our reserve for uncertain tax positions at March 28, 2010 was $25.4 million. Due to the uncertainties associated with settling these liabilities, we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these liabilities. As a result, our reserve for unrecognized tax benefits is excluded from the table above. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our reserve for uncertain tax positions. The table above also excludes estimated required cash contributions to our qualified pension plans totaling approximately $71.0 million over the next five years: $12.5 million in fiscal 2011, $14.0 million in fiscal 2012, $14.5 million in fiscal 2013, $15.0 million in fiscal 2014 and $15.0 million in fiscal 2015. We also have benefit payments due under our non qualified pension and other post retirement benefit plans that are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 37 Table of Contents Critical accounting policies We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout the Managements Discussion and Analysis where such policies affect reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other significant accounting policies, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report. Note that the preparation of this Annual Report requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Revenue recognition We recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete. This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the contract or purchase order, ownership and risk of loss have passed to the customer, collectibility is reasonably assured, and pricing is fixed and determinable. In instances where title does not pass to the customer upon shipment, we recognize revenue upon delivery or customer acceptance, depending on terms of the sales agreement. Service sales, representing maintenance and engineering activities, are recognized as services are performed. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in revenue. Valuation of inventories All inventories are stated at the lower of the cost of purchase or manufacture of the inventory or the estimated market value of the inventory. Cost for inventories at a significant number of our operations is determined on a last in, first out (LIFO) basis. The average inventory cost method is utilized for most other inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based on the age, historical usage or assumptions about future demand for the inventory. We also regularly review inventory balances on a LIFO basis to ensure the balances are stated at the lower of cost or market as of the balance sheet date. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and reported operating results. Goodwill and acquired intangibles From time to time, we acquire businesses in purchase transactions that typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets, which may affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges. The determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the consolidated financial statements. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at a minimum each fiscal year at the end of the second month in the second quarter or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. For fiscal 2010, our reporting units consisted of the three operating segments within our Investment Cast Products reportable operating segment, two operating segments within our Forged Products reportable operating segment, as well as a number of reporting units in our Fasteners Products operating segment. The Fasteners Products operating segment includes several aggregated component units (referred to as the Fasteners Products reporting unit) and three other reporting units for which the segment manager regularly reviews performance. Testing for goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations. Such models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions primarily based on future cash flows, expected market growth rates, our estimates of sales volumes, sales prices and related costs, and the discount rate applied, which reflects the weighted average cost of capital. Management uses the best available information at the time fair values of the reporting units are estimated; however, estimates could be materially impacted by factors such as changes in growth trends and specific industry conditions, with the potential for a corresponding adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements potentially resulting from an impairment of the goodwill. We also consider comparable transactions to estimate the fair value of 38 Table of Contents the reporting units. The cash flow models used to determine fair value are most sensitive to the expected future cash flows and the discount rate for each reporting unit. The discount rate used in the cash flow models for the fiscal 2010 goodwill impairment analysis ranged from 10% to 15% depending on the reporting unit. The annual growth rate for earnings before interest and taxes varied by reporting unit and ranged from 3% to 90% over the initial five year forecast period. A sensitivity analysis determined that using terminal growth rates of 3%, 4% or 5% would not result in impairment in the fiscal 2010 goodwill impairment analysis. We performed a sensitivity analysis on both of these factors and determined that the forecast for future earnings before interest and taxes used in the cash flow model could decrease by 17% and the discount rate utilized could increase by 2%, and the goodwill of our reporting units would not be impaired. The reporting unit that would be most sensitive to worsening economic conditions has $12.4 million of goodwill recorded as of March 28, 2010. Environmental costs The estimated future costs for known environmental remediation requirements are accrued on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of remediation costs can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of amounts is established, and no amount within the range is better than another, the minimum amount of the range is recorded. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when collection is probable. Adjustments to our accruals may be necessary to reflect new information as investigation and remediation efforts proceed. The amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period, but any amounts, and the possible range of any amounts in excess of those already accrued, are not reasonably estimable at this time. Total environmental reserves accrued at March 28, 2010 and March 29, 2009 were $75.6 million and $83.4 million, respectively. Guidance on asset retirement and environmental obligations clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation and requires a liability to be recorded if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. Asset retirement obligations covered by this guidance include those for which an entity has a significant obligation to perform an asset retirement activity, however the timing or method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may not be within the control of the entity. This guidance also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. In accordance with the asset retirement and environmental obligations guidance, we record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liability can be reasonably estimated. Currently, we have identified known asset retirement obligations associated with environmental contamination at two of our manufacturing facilities. However, we have not recognized a liability under this guidance for these retirement obligations because the fair value of remediation at these sites cannot be reasonably estimated since the settlement date is unknown at this time. The settlement date is unknown because remediation of these sites is not required until production ceases, and we have no current or future plans to cease production. These asset retirement obligations, when estimable, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows or business. Income taxes Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pre tax earnings based on current tax law and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Tax benefits arising from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant tax authorities. The amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. 39 Table of Contents Pension and other postretirement benefit plans We sponsor many domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans. Our pension and postretirement benefit plans are accounted for in accordance with defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans accounting guidance. Plan assets have been valued at fair value in accordance with this guidance. Pension and postretirement expense and liability amounts are derived from several significant assumptions, including the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rate. We derive a market based discount rate from yields on high quality, liquid fixed income securities, at the end of our fiscal year for valuation of our pension liabilities. We use only highly rated bonds (AA/Aa or higher) to estimate the interest rate at which our pension benefits could be settled. Our assumed return on plan assets is derived from a review of past performance, anticipated future performance in light of market conditions and our investment allocation and consultation with our investment advisors. As the assumed rate of return on plan assets is a long term assumption, it is not anticipated to be as volatile as the discount rate, which is a point in time measurement. For our U.S. Plans, we used a long term rate of return assumption of 8.0% to calculate the 2009 and 2010 net periodic pension cost. For our non U.S. Plans, we used a long term rate of return assumption of 7.5% to calculate the 2009 and 2010 net periodic pension cost. In developing the long term rate of return on plan assets assumptions, we evaluated input from third party pension consultants and actuaries, reviewed asset allocation and investment strategies, ranges of projected and historical returns, and inflation and economic assumptions. The expected return assumptions are derived from asset allocations within the Companys target asset allocation ranges consistent with the Companys diversified investment approach. For our U.S. Plans, we used a discount rate assumption of 6.25% for the total benefit obligation of our pension plans at our March 28, 2010 measurement date. For our non U.S. Plans, we used a discount rate assumption of 5.83% for the total benefit obligation of our pension plans at our March 28, 2010 measurement date. For fiscal 2010, our U.S. net periodic pension expense was $30.9 million and non U.S. net periodic pension income was $0.3 million. We estimate that for fiscal 2011, our U.S. net periodic pension expense will be approximately $37.8 million and non U.S. net periodic pension income will be approximately $1.4 million. The table below quantifies the approximate impact, as of March 28, 2010, of a one quarter percentage point decrease in our assumptions for discount rate and expected return on assets, holding other assumptions constant. 0.25 Percentage Point Decrease Increase in annual costs: Discount rate $ 4.5 Expected long term rate of return 4.6 Increase in projected benefit obligation: Discount rate $ 54.5 The approximate impact, as of March 28, 2010, of a one percentage point increase in our assumption for the health care cost trend rate, holding other assumptions constant, on our total service and interest cost components and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation is not significant. Recently issued accounting standards In January 2010, the FASB issued guidance which requires new disclosures and clarifies existing disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. Specifically, the changes require disclosure of transfers into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, and also require more detailed disclosure about the activity within Level 3 fair value measurements. This guidance was effective for the Company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, except for disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements of Level 3 assets and liabilities, which will be effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures, the adoption did not and will not impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance to require an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprises variable interest gives it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity. This guidance 40 Table of Contents will be effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance on the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Codification), which establishes the Codification as the source of authoritative U.S. GAAP recognized by the FASB to be applied to nongovernmental entities. This guidance was effective for the Company in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. The adoption did not impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2008, the FASB issued guidance on an employers disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. This guidance was effective for the Company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. As the guidance only required enhanced disclosures, the adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued guidance on business combinations and noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements. This guidance introduces significant changes in the accounting for and reporting of business acquisitions and noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary. This guidance continues the movement toward the greater use of fair values in financial reporting and increased transparency through expanded disclosures. The business combinations guidance changes how business acquisitions are accounted for, including expensing acquisition costs as incurred, and will impact financial statements at the acquisition date and in subsequent periods. The noncontrolling interests guidance requires noncontrolling interests (previously referred to as minority interests) to be reported as a component of equity, which changes the accounting for transactions with noncontrolling interest holders. The business combinations guidance was effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of our fiscal 2010, and was applicable to our acquisition of Carlton on September 30, 2009. The noncontrolling interests guidance was effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The adoption of the noncontrolling interests guidance did not have a significant impact on the reporting of our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as noncontrolling interests are not material to the financial statements. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK At various times, we use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and prices of strategic raw materials. Fluctuations in the market values of such derivative instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the underlying economic exposures that the instruments are intended to hedge. Because derivative instruments are used solely as hedges and not for speculative trading purposes, they do not represent incremental risk to the Company. For further discussion of derivative financial instruments, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Interest Rate Risk We have variable rate debt obligations that expose us to interest rate risk. If market interest rates had averaged 10 percent higher than actual levels in fiscal 2010 or 2009, the effect on our interest expense and net income would not have been material. Foreign Currency Risk The majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars; however, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies for transactions denominated in other currencies. As discussed in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, we had foreign currency hedges in place at March 28, 2010 and March 29, 2009 to reduce such exposure. The estimated loss in fair value on foreign currency hedges outstanding as of March 28, 2010, from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in exchange rates, would not have been material. Material Cost Risk We entered into long term supply agreements to fix the purchase price of certain strategic raw materials at March 28, 2010 and March 29, 2009. In addition, we had escalation clauses related to raw material pricing in certain of our sales contracts at March 28, 2010 and March 29, 2009. If market rates had averaged 10 percent higher than actual levels in either fiscal 2010 or 2009, the effect on our cost of sales and net earnings, after considering the effects of these supply agreements and sales contracts, would not have been material. 42 Table of Contents
