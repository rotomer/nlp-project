ITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS(in millions, except per share data) Business overviewAlthough fiscal 2011 brought a long awaited recovery in commercial aerospace markets for our Investment Cast Products and Forged Products segments, we continued to face challenges in the power markets and in all markets for our Fastener Products segment. While overall industrial gas turbine ("IGT") markets remained relatively flat in fiscal 2011, we continued to experience significant weakness in sales volumes and pricing for our Forged Products seamless extruded pipe products. Despite these challenges, we achieved solid year over year increases in sales, operating income, net income from continuing operations, and earnings per share. These results were primarily driven by strong aerospace and general industrial growth and continued focus on maximizing operational leverage. We also generated $1,038.0 million of cash from operations and our cash balance reached a record level of more than $1.1 billion. As part of our continued focus on expanding our product lines and markets, we completed two small acquisitions in fiscal 2011, and in May 2011, we agreed to acquire the assets of PB Fasteners, a strategically important acquisition that will improve our position on new, advanced composite based aerospace platforms. In January 2011, we acquired an additional 1% equity interest in Yangzhou Chengde Steel Tube Co., Ltd (Chengde) for approximately $7 million in cash, increasing our equity interest to 50%. Chengde is a leading manufacturer of seamless, extruded pipe for boiler applications in coal fired power plants, as well as pipe and tubing for other energy related applications, such as compressed natural gas. Also, during the year, we continued to upgrade manufacturing equipment and increase operational productivity with the completion or initiation of various large scale cost reduction projects, primarily within the Forged Products segment. We expect our baseline capital expenditures for fiscal 2012 to be moderately higher than fiscal 2011 based on our current forecasts. These expenditures will be targeted for cost reduction projects and equipment upgrades within our Forged Products and Investment Cast Products segments. Capacity expansion projects that arise in excess of the base forecast will be evaluated on their own merits during the fiscal year based on demand.During the latter half of fiscal 2011, we received orders for aerospace castings and forgings from our customers to support previously announced build rates of both base commercial aircraft programs and the Boeing 787. We believe these orders will help drive sales increases through calendar 2012 and beyond. In our Fastener Products segment, we expect to transition gradually toward a similar recovery in original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") and distributor orders toward the back end of fiscal 2012, once production rates associated with current build rates deplete our customers current inventories. We are seeing some promising upside in our other major markets, including opportunities in our seamless pipe business, and we expect to gain some traction in our IGT operations as the year progresses. From many perspectives market position, manufacturing discipline, balance sheet we have a solid foundation for continued profitable growth. We are well positioned with our customer base to grow sales and build our share in the years ahead. We will continue to focus on opportunities targeted at increasing the overall value of the company. 21Table of Contents Fiscal Year % Increase/(Decrease) 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009Net sales$6,220.1 $5,459.2 $6,770.8 14 % (19)%Costs and expenses: Cost of goods sold4,326.7 3,668.8 4,792.1 18 % (23)%Selling and administrative expenses390.6 367.1 381.9 6 % (4)%Restructuring and asset impairment 10.9 % (100)%Interest expense, net9.0 13.1 10.6 (31)% 24 %Total costs and expenses4,726.3 4,049.0 5,195.5 Income before income tax expense and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates1,493.8 1,410.2 1,575.3 6 % (10)%Income tax expense(499.7) (485.7) (538.4) 3 % (10)%Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates16.6 1.4 1,086 % 100 %Net income from continuing operations1,010.7 925.9 1,036.9 9 % (11)%Net income (loss) from discontinued operations4.1 (3.3) 7.9 224 % (142)%Net income1,014.8 922.6 1,044.8 10 % (12)%Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest(1.3) (0.8) (0.3) 63 % 167 %Net income attributable to Precision Castparts Corp.

The increase in sales compared to the prior year was driven by improved aerospace demand, resulting in an increase in aerospace sales of approximately $581 million, or 19 percent, over fiscal 2010 levels, as our aerospace customer order schedules have aligned with base commercial aircraft build rates, particularly within the Investment Cast and Forged Products segments. Aerospace sales increased from 54 percent of total sales in fiscal 2010 to 57 percent of total sales in fiscal 2011. General industrial sales increased $286 million, or 28 percent, over the prior year, and increased from 19 percent of total sales in fiscal 2010 to 21 percent of total sales in fiscal 2011. Higher external selling prices of nickel alloy from the Forged Products segments three primary mills, which increased 38% on the London Metals Exchange ("LME") compared to the prior year, added approximately $111 million to top line revenues in fiscal 2011 versus fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011 also includes four quarters of sales from Carlton Forge Works ("Carlton"), which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. These increases were partially offset by a decline in seamless pipe sales of approximately $217 million, or 42 percent, over fiscal 2010 levels. Sales to the power market (which includes IGT and seamless pipe) decreased from 27 percent of total sales in fiscal 2010 to 22 percent of total sales in fiscal 2011. Contractual material pass through pricing, which reflects the impact of escalation formulas included in certain long term agreements, also declined, increasing sales by approximately $233.4 million in fiscal 2011 versus approximately $249.6 million in fiscal 2010, a decrease of $16.2 million. Contractual material pass through pricing adjustments are calculated based on market prices such as those shown in the above table in trailing periods from one to twelve months. With regard to growth in the commercial aircraft industry, based on data from the Airline Monitor as of January 2011, Boeing and Airbus aircraft deliveries are expected to moderately increase through calendar year 2011 as compared to 2010. Due to manufacturing lead times and scheduled build rates, our production volumes are generally 4 to 6 months ahead of aircraft deliveries. The Airline Monitor is projecting further growth in aircraft deliveries in calendar year 2012 primarily driven by Boeing 787 production rates, and therefore we anticipate that our aerospace sales will continue to increase modestly through fiscal 2012. Cost of goods sold was $4,326.7 million, or 70 percent of sales, in fiscal 2011 as compared to $3,668.8 million, or 67 percent of sales, in fiscal 2010. Cost of goods sold as a percent of sales was negatively impacted by the reduced seamless pipe volume, which was replaced by lower margin general industrial sales in the Forged Products segment. In addition, lower sales of core product lines in the Fasteners Products segment were replaced with sales of less complex, lower margin products. These decreases were partially offset by the effective leverage of increased aerospace volume due to significantly improved cost structures throughout the Company. Contractual material pass through pricing diluted gross margin by 1.2 percentage points in fiscal 2011 compared to 1.6 percentage points last year.Selling and administrative expenses were $390.6 million, or 6 percent of sales, in fiscal 2011 compared to $367.1 million, or 7 percent of sales, in fiscal 2010. The lower year over year percentage was primarily due to the fixed nature of selling and administrative expenses coupled with an increase in sales compared to the prior year.Net income from continuing operations (attributable to PCC) for fiscal 2011 was $1,009.4 million, or $7.01 per share (diluted). By comparison, net income from continuing operations (attributable to PCC) for fiscal 2010 was $925.1 million, or $6.51 per share (diluted). Fiscal 2011 net income attributable to PCC (including discontinued operations) was $1,013.5 million, or $7.04 per share (diluted), compared with net income of $921.8 million, or $6.49 per share (diluted) in fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011 net income includes $4.1 million, or $0.03 per share (diluted), from discontinued operations, compared to a net loss of $3.3 million, or $0.02 per share (diluted), in the prior year. 23Table of ContentsFiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 Total sales for fiscal 2010 were $5,459.2 million, a decrease of $1,311.6 million, or 19 percent, from fiscal 2009 sales of $6,770.8 million. Total aerospace sales decreased 17 percent over fiscal 2009 levels, and increased from 53 percent of total sales in fiscal 2009 to 54 percent of total sales in fiscal 2010. Power generation sales decreased 15 percent over fiscal 2009 levels, and increased from 25 percent of total sales in fiscal 2009 to 27 percent of total sales in fiscal 2010. Sales to the general industrial and other markets decreased 31 percent over the prior year, and decreased from 22 percent of total sales in fiscal 2009 to 19 percent of total sales in fiscal 2010. The decrease in sales was driven by reduced demand from destocking aerospace, European IGT and Chinese pipe customers, weakness in the general industrial and power markets, and lower average metal selling prices. Excluding the impacts of currency, metal prices, and the acquisition of Carlton, aerospace volume decreased approximately $525 million, or 17%, general industrial and other markets decreased approximately $244 million, or 20%, and power markets decreased approximately $155 million, or 11% compared to the same period last year. Lower nickel alloy selling prices from the Forged Products segments three primary mills negatively impacted sales by approximately $170 million compared to fiscal 2009. Contractual material pass through pricing, which reflects the impact of escalation formulas included in certain long term agreements, also declined, increasing sales by approximately $249.6 million in fiscal 2010 versus approximately $419.5 million in fiscal 2009, a decrease of $169.9 million. Contractual material pass through pricing adjustments are calculated based on market prices such as those shown in the above table in trailing periods from one to twelve months. In addition, our foreign operations reported approximately $41 million in reduced U.S. dollar equivalent sales year over year due to the increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to international currencies, primarily the British pound. The remaining decrease is primarily attributable to lower average metal selling prices at our businesses that employ price in effect metal pricing, and various other factors. These decreases were partially offset by approximately $135 million of sales from Carlton, which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Cost of goods sold was $3,668.8 million, or 67 percent of sales, in fiscal 2010 as compared to $4,792.1 million, or 71 percent of sales, in fiscal 2009. The improvement in the year over year percentage reflects increased productivity and improved material utilization compared to fiscal 2009. Contractual material pass through pricing diluted gross margin by 1.6 percentage points in fiscal 2010 compared to 1.9 percentage points in fiscal 2009. Selling and administrative expenses were $367.1 million, or 7 percent of sales, in fiscal 2010 compared to $381.9 million, or 6 percent of sales, in fiscal 2009. The higher year over year percentage was primarily due to higher expense related to our deferred compensation plan as compared to fiscal 2009 and the fixed nature of selling and administrative expenses coupled with a decrease in sales. Net income from continuing operations (attributable to PCC) for fiscal 2010 was $925.1 million, or $6.51 per share (diluted). By comparison, net income from continuing operations (attributable to PCC) for fiscal 2009 was $1,036.6 million, or $7.37 per share (diluted), which included restructuring charges totaling $0.05 per share (diluted). Fiscal 2010 net income (including discontinued operations) was $921.8 million, or $6.49 per share (diluted), compared with net income of $1,044.5 million, or $7.43 per share (diluted) in fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2010 net income includes a loss of $3.3 million, or $0.02 per share (diluted), from discontinued operations, compared to income of $7.9 million, or $0.06 per share (diluted), in fiscal 2009. AcquisitionsFiscal 2011 On January 3, 2011, we acquired an additional 1% equity interest in Yangzhou Chengde Steel Tube Co., Ltd (Chengde) for approximately $7 million in cash, increasing our equity interest to 50%. We continue to account for this investment under the equity method as we currently do not exercise control of the major operating and financial policies of Chengde. The carrying value of this investment as of April 3, 2011 was $395.1 million and was included in investment in unconsolidated affiliates in our consolidated balance sheet. The carrying value of our investment in Chengde exceeded the amount of underlying equity in net assets of Chengde by approximately $183 million as of April 3, 2011. This difference arose through the valuation process that was applied to the assets acquired. Fiscal 2010On January 15, 2010, we acquired a 49% equity interest in Chengde for approximately $355 million in cash, comprised of approximately $115 million of cash on hand and the proceeds of approximately $240 million of commercial paper debt issuance (subsequently repaid). Chengde is a leading manufacturer of seamless, extruded pipe for boiler applications in coal fired power plants, as well as pipe and tubing for other energy related applications, such as compressed natural gas. The company operates from one facility with a manufacturing footprint of nearly 6 million square feet in the Jiangsu Province of China. Chengde has built a leading position in the Chinese boiler pipe market and has begun to make inroads into export markets. 24Table of ContentsThe following business acquisitions were accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, the results of operations have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Income since the acquisition dates.On September 30, 2009, we completed the acquisition of Carlton Forge Works and a related entity (Carlton) for approximately $847 million in cash, comprised of approximately $502 million of cash on hand and the proceeds of approximately $345 million of commercial paper debt issuance (subsequently repaid). Carlton, a leading manufacturer of seamless rolled rings for critical aerospace applications, offers nickel, titanium, and steel rolled rings across the widest range of product sizes in the industry. Carlton broadens our forging capabilities and enables us to provide a full range of forged products to our aerospace engine customers. The Carlton acquisition is an asset purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of our Forged Products segment. This transaction resulted in $400.1 million of goodwill (which is deductible for tax purposes) and $336.7 million of other intangible assets, including tradenames with indefinite lives valued at $89.1 million, customer relationships with indefinite lives valued at $204.8 million, customer relationships with finite lives valued at $3.7 million, backlog valued at $10.2 million and revenue sharing agreements valued at $28.9 million. We also recorded a long term liability related to the fair value of a pre existing revenue sharing agreement valued at $92.0 million. The impact of this acquisition was not material to our consolidated results of operations; consequently, pro forma information has not been included. Fiscal 2009In the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we acquired three entities for a total cost of approximately $469.4 million, which was primarily paid in cash. These transactions resulted in $320.2 million of goodwill (of which $217.1 million is deductible for tax purposes) and $59.9 million of other intangible assets, including tradenames with indefinite lives valued at approximately $34.7 million. The impact of these acquisitions was not material to our consolidated results of operations; consequently, pro forma information has not been included. The following is a description of the three acquisitions.On December 4, 2008, we acquired Hackney Ladish Holding Corp. (Hackney Ladish), a leading producer of forged pipe fittings for critical energy infrastructure and related applications. With more than 80 years of experience manufacturing pipe fittings, Hackney Ladish offers the widest range of product types and sizes in the industry. Fittings are used in piping systems throughout the energy value chain, from drilling through processing and storage. Hackney Ladishs products connect pipe, change the direction of flow, increase or reduce pipe sizes, join or separate flow, or cap pipe ends. This acquisition extends our reach into oil and gas markets and provides profitable growth opportunities for our seamless pipe and nickel alloy tubing operations. Hackney Ladish operates manufacturing facilities in Russellville, Arkansas and Enid, Oklahoma. The Hackney Ladish acquisition is a stock purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of the Forged Products segment.On November 21, 2008, we acquired Fatigue Technology, Inc. (FTI), headquartered in Seattle, Washington. FTI pioneered the cold expansion process in 1969 and is the technology leader in fatigue life extension for both metal and composite airframe fastener holes. FTI has taken this foundation of creating a residual stress field around a cold worked hole to develop innovative solutions that significantly reduce manufacturing and maintenance flow time and costs. The resulting components are easier and faster to install, and the methods of aircraft assembly are enhanced. This acquisition continues our strategy of expanding into additional critical aerospace fastener products, thus offering our customers a wider selection of fasteners to meet all of their requirements. The FTI acquisition is an asset purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of the Fastener Products segment.On September 30, 2008, we acquired Airdrome Holdings, LLC (Airdrome), which consisted of Airdrome Precision Components (APC) and AF Aerospace Ltd. (AFA). APC, located in Long Beach, California, is a leading supplier of hydraulic and pneumatic fluid fittings primarily for airframe applications. AFA, located in Rugby, England, manufactures a variety of machined components for aerospace applications, including fittings and other fluid conveyance products, ultra high tensile bolts, and machined details. Fluid fittings, manufactured in nickel, titanium, and stainless steel alloys, are the critical connectors for hoses transporting fuel, hydraulic fluid, and pneumatic pressure throughout an aircraft. This acquisition also fits our strategy of enhancing our critical aerospace fastener family of products to serve our customers better. The Airdrome acquisition is an asset purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of the Fastener Products segment. Discontinued operationsOur financial statements were impacted by activities relating to the planned or completed divestiture of certain of our businesses. These businesses have been accounted for under discontinued operations guidance. Accordingly, any operating results of these businesses are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Income as discontinued operations, net of income tax, and all prior periods have been reclassified.Fiscal 2011During the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we sold an automotive fastener business. The transaction resulted in a gain of approximately $6.4 million (net of tax).25Table of ContentsDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we decided to divest a small non core business in the Fastener Products segment and reclassified it to discontinued operations.Fiscal 2010 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we decided to dispose of a small non core business in the Fasteners Products segment and reclassified it to discontinued operations. The sale of the business was completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2011.In the third quarter of fiscal 2010, we decided to divest a small non core business in the Investment Cast Products segment and reclassified it to discontinued operations. The sale of the business was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. The transaction resulted in a gain of approximately $11.4 million (net of tax) in fiscal 2010.Fiscal 2009In the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we decided to dispose of two automotive fastener operations. The decision to discontinue these automotive fastener operations resulted from their non core nature coupled with further erosion in the automotive market. These operations were reclassified from the Fasteners Products segment to discontinued operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. We recognized an impairment loss of approximately $8.7 million (net of tax) in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 related to these automotive fastener businesses held for sale due to continued erosion in the automotive market. The sale of these businesses was completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2011.In the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we sold the stock of several small entities, a group of foreign operations held for sale and previously recorded as discontinued from our former Flow Technologies pumps and valves business. The transaction resulted in a net gain of approximately $3.0 million in fiscal 2009. Restructuring, asset impairment and other non recurring chargesWe regularly assess our cost structure to ensure that operations are properly sized for prevailing market conditions, taking into consideration current and forecasted conditions in markets we serve. During fiscal 2011 and 2010, we did not incur any restructuring or impairment charges. The following restructuring and asset impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 2009.Fiscal 2009In the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we incurred restructuring and impairment charges of $10.9 million pursuant to plans to downsize operations across all segments. We had been gearing up for aerospace growth into fiscal 2010, whereas demand decreased, particularly in the casting and forging aerospace markets. The charges consisted of $8.6 million for employee severance expenses and $2.3 million for impairments and relocation expenses associated with long lived assets. These restructuring plans provided for terminations of approximately 980 employees in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009 and first quarter of fiscal 2010. The restructuring and impairment charges recorded by the Investment Cast Products segment, Forged Products segment and Fastener Products segment were $5.2 million, $3.7 million and $2.0 million, respectively, during fiscal 2009. The tax effected impact of these charges was $7.2 million, or $0.05 per share (diluted). As of April 3, 2011 and March 28, 2010, no accrued liabilities remained related to the restructuring plans. Subsequent Event In May 2011, we agreed to acquire the assets of PB Fasteners ("PB"). PB is an industry leader in the design and manufacturing of fastener products for airframe applications, including the development of the SLEEVbolt fastening system. Sleeved fastener technology is critical to mitigating the impact of lightning strikes on the Boeing 787 and other composite based aircraft. Located in Gardena, California, PB entered the aerospace fastener business in 1967. The acquisition is expected to be completed early in fiscal 2012, after which PBs results will be reported as part of the Fastener Products segment. Impacts of the Global Economic Recession and RecoveryEconomic events created recessionary economic conditions around the world in many industries in fiscal 2009 and 2010. Although many countries and industries are recovering, weakness persists in certain areas. While we are not immune to impacts from the lingering effects of the global recession, we believe our strong financial position enables us to take advantage of opportunities in our markets served, continue to make operational improvements in our businesses and benefit from the continuing economic recovery. During fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, approximately 57 percent and 54 percent, respectively, of our sales were to customers in the global aerospace markets. Until the recession occurred and aerospace program delays were announced, customer schedules indicated that the aerospace production rates would continue to experience growth throughout fiscal 2010 and possibly beyond, particularly due to anticipated build rates of major new commercial aerospace programs such as the Boeing 26Table of Contents787 and Airbus A380, each of which contains significant per ship set revenue for PCC. Aerospace production rates began to recover in fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 levels, and we have seen a realignment of component build rates and aircraft production schedules indicating an end to destocking in the supply chain. We expect to see further order increases as Boeing 787 production starts to ramp up in the latter half of fiscal 2012, as well as increased build rates on other commercial aircraft model production projected for fiscal 2012. Our most significant customers in the aerospace industry are primarily large, well financed businesses that we believe have the ability to weather economic downturns. We must rely on the forecasted information provided from time to time by our customers as guidance with regard to the impacts from the current and future economic environment. During fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, approximately 22 percent and 27 percent, respectively, of our sales were to customers in the global power markets, which include our IGT business as well as sales of our seamless extruded pipe. Demand in our OEM IGT markets has softened, and during the latter half of fiscal 2010, we experienced the beginning of destocking by our European customers, which continued through the first half of our fiscal 2011. Starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and continuing through fiscal 2011, we have experienced significant sales declines in our seamless pipe products as Chinese customers utilize existing inventory. We must rely on the forecasted information provided from time to time by our customers as guidance with regard to the impacts from the current and future economic environment. The remaining 21 percent and 19 percent of our respective sales in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 were into general industrial markets. It is difficult to summarize the opportunities and challenges in these markets, because the circumstances vary widely from one individual market to another. We experienced declines in general industrial sales during the recession but have seen a recovery in the latter part of fiscal 2010 and throughout fiscal 2011 in sales to general industrial markets. This recovery helped replace sales in power markets as noted above.We follow an investment philosophy of diversified investing and risk mitigation when managing our pension plans. The investments in our pension plans totaled approximately $1.7 billion at the end of fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2011, we contributed $115.9 million to our defined benefit pension plans, including voluntary contributions of $100.0 million, to increase plan funding. We believe our financial position and liquidity will allow us to make all required pension contributions as well as any additional voluntary contributions that management deems advisable. We made a voluntary contribution of $50.0 million to the defined benefit pension plans in early fiscal 2012. In addition, the investments in our plans experienced positive returns of $120.6 million in fiscal 2011 and $162.8 million in fiscal 2010 as global investment markets recovered after experiencing losses of $105.3 million during the recession in fiscal 2009.See the Changes in Financial Condition and Liquidity section for a discussion of the impact of the global financial climate and credit shortage on liquidity. 27Table of ContentsFinancial results by segmentWe analyze our operating segments and manage our business across three reportable segments: Investment Cast Products, Forged Products and Fastener Products.

Fiscal Year % Increase/(Decrease) 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009Sales by Market: Aerospace$1,304.8 $1,045.1 $1,314.5 25 % (20)%% of total62% 57% 58% Power555.8 580.6 686.2 (4)% (15)%% of total27% 31% 30% General Industrial & Other235.0 225.6 271.4 4 % (17)%% of total11% 12% 12% Total Sales$2,095.6 $1,851.3 $2,272.1 13 % (19)%Operating income$665.5 $560.0 $582.7 19 % (4)%% of sales31.8% 30.2% 25.6% Fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 The Investment Cast Products segment reported fiscal 2011 sales of $2,095.6 million, an increase of 13.0 percent from the prior years sales of $1,851.3 million. The year over year increase in sales reflects the realignment of aerospace OEM orders with production rates and aftermarket increases driven by engine schedules. Aerospace sales increased approximately $260 million, or 25 percent, over the prior year as the destocking ended and orders driven by previously announced increases in base aircraft build rates realigned with customer demand. In addition, external alloy sales from Cannon Muskegon more than doubled over last year, which we believe is a leading indicator of the aerospace rebound. IGT sales decreased approximately $33 million, or 6 percent, compared to last year due to continued customer destocking that began in the latter half of fiscal 2010; however, the segment experienced an increase in OEM shipments in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Sales also include $51.1 million of higher pricing related to contractual pass through of increased material costs compared to $40.7 million in fiscal 2010, an increase of $10.4 million. Operating income for the Investment Cast Products segment was $665.5 million or 31.8 percent of sales in fiscal 2011, compared to $560.0 million, or 30.2 percent of sales, in fiscal 2010. Operating income increased compared to the prior year primarily due to improved leverage on increased aerospace throughput combined with improved cost performance. The segment improved operating margin by 1.6 percentage points year over year driven by continuous focus on productivity, scrap and rework, and other variable cost improvements in the segments manufacturing operations. Contractual material pass through pricing diluted operating margins by 0.8 percentage points in fiscal 2011 compared to 0.7 percentage points last year.The Investment Cast Products segment anticipates growing aerospace OEM sales in fiscal 2012 as Boeing 787 and other base commercial aircraft production orders continue to ramp up and will effectively leverage increased aerospace throughput. On the IGT front, the segment expects to gain traction going forward based on some orders received during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and customer inquiries about future product availability. Fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 The Investment Cast Products segment reported fiscal 2010 sales of $1,851.3 million, a decrease of 19 percent from the prior years sales of $2,272.1 million. The year over year decrease in sales primarily reflects a continued disconnect between aerospace order rates and engine builds related to customer destocking, which negatively impacted aerospace sales by approximately $210 million, or 18%. Power market sales were down by $75 million, or 12% (excluding the impacts of currency and metal pricing), compared to last year as a result of destocking by European IGT customers. Sales also include $40.7 million of higher pricing related to contractual pass through of increased material costs compared to $81.3 million in fiscal 2009, a decrease of $40.6 million. In addition, our foreign operations reported approximately $10 million in reduced U.S. dollar equivalent sales year over year due to the increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to international currencies, primarily the British pound. 29Table of ContentsOperating income for the Investment Cast Products segment was $560.0 million or 30.2 percent of sales in fiscal 2010, compared to $582.7 million, or 25.6 percent of sales, in fiscal 2009. Despite the challenges of continued destocking, the segment improved operating margins by 4.6 percentage points year over year due to increased labor productivity, improved material utilization and lower scrap and rework costs. Contractual material pass through pricing diluted operating margins by 0.7 percentage points in fiscal 2010 compared to 1.0 percentage points in fiscal 2009.Forged ProductsThe Forged Products segment manufactures forged components from sophisticated titanium and nickel based alloys principally for the aerospace and power markets, and manufactures nickel and cobalt based alloys used to produce forged components for aerospace and non aerospace markets which include products for oil and gas, chemical processing, and pollution control applications. The segment also provides nickel superalloy and titanium revert management solutions, re melting various material byproducts and reusing them in casting, forging, and fastener manufacturing processes. Forged Products sales to the aerospace and power markets are derived primarily from the same large engine customers served by the Investment Cast Products segment, with additional aerospace sales to manufacturers of landing gear and other airframe components. The Forged Products segment also produces extruded pipe for the power and oil and gas industries. Fiscal Year % Increase/(Decrease) 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009Sales by Market: Aerospace$1,317.1 $956.0 $1,158.0 38 % (17)%% of total47% 42% 39% Power775.3 857.2 997.6 (10)% (14)%% of total28% 37% 33% General Industrial & Other687.3 469.8 822.8 46 % (43)%% of total25% 21% 28% Total Sales$2,779.7 $2,283.0 $2,978.4 22 % (23)%Operating income$539.4 $529.7 $652.9 2 % (19)%% of sales19.4% 23.2% 21.9% Fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 The Forged Products segment reported fiscal 2011 sales of $2,779.7 million, an increase of 22 percent from the prior years sales of $2,283.0 million. Similar to Investment Cast Products, previous destocking activities associated with customer owned aerospace inventory ended and new orders sparked commercial activity in this segment as aerospace sales improved by approximately $361 million, or 38 percent, year over year. General industrial sales also showed continued strength, increasing by approximately $218 million, or 46 percent, compared to the prior year. Fiscal 2011 also includes four quarters of sales from Carlton, which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Partially offsetting these increases was a decline in power markets of approximately $82 million, or 10 percent, compared to the prior year due to significantly lower core seamless pipe shipments. Higher external selling prices of external alloy sales from the segments three primary mills added approximately $111 million to top line revenues in fiscal 2011 versus fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011 sales also include $170.4 million of contractual pricing related to pass through of increased raw material costs compared to $201.8 million last year, a decrease of $31.4 million. Operating income for the Forged Products segment was $539.4 million or 19.4 percent of sales in fiscal 2011, compared to $529.7 million, or 23.2 percent of sales, in fiscal 2010. The slight increase in operating income year over year was primarily driven by solid leverage from increased aerospace volume and the contribution from increased general industrial business, partially offset by weak seamless pipe performance. The segments operating margin decreased by more than 3 percentage points in the current year due to the negative impact of reduced seamless pipe volume and pricing. Growth in the segments lower margin general industrial markets also negatively impacted operating margin. Higher metal selling prices at the segments three primary mills diluted operating margins by 0.8 percentage points in the current year. The contractual pass through of higher raw material costs diluted operating margins by 1.3 percentage points in fiscal 2011 compared to 2.2 percentage points last year.The segments aerospace OEM schedules are showing solid increases as previously announced build rates in both base commercial aircraft and Boeing 787 production ramp up, which will continue to drive aerospace sales levels through fiscal 30Table of Contents2012 and beyond. Seamless pipe shipments within this segment began to improve toward the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, and the trend is expected to continue in fiscal 2012. Operating income is expected to show improvement, benefiting from some recovery of core seamless pipe sales and higher aerospace sales.Fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 The Forged Products segment reported fiscal 2010 sales of $2,283.0 million, a decrease of 23 percent from the prior years sales of $2,978.4 million. The acquisition of Carlton in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 contributed approximately $135 million in incremental sales over the prior year. The decrease in sales from the prior year reflects a decline in general industrial and other markets, which negatively impacted sales by approximately $184 million, or 30% (excluding the impacts of currency and metal pricing), and aerospace OEM and aftermarket destocking, which negatively impacted aerospace sales by approximately $180 million, or 21%. A decline in power markets negatively impacted sales by $77 million, or 10%, compared to the prior year (excluding the impacts of currency and metal pricing). The lower selling prices of external nickel alloy sales from the segments three primary mills negatively impacted external sales by approximately $170 million in fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2010 sales also include $201.8 million of higher contractual pricing related to pass through of increased raw material costs compared to $325.9 million in fiscal 2009, a decrease of $124.1 million. In addition, our foreign operations reported approximately $21 million in reduced U.S. dollar equivalent sales year over year due to the increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to international currencies, primarily the British pound.Operating income for the Forged Products segment was $529.7 million or 23.2 percent of sales in fiscal 2010, compared to $652.9 million, or 21.9 percent of sales, in fiscal 2009. Operating income was negatively impacted by reduced sales volume coupled with the segments high fixed cost base, the loss of higher margin energy products, and rapid escalation in metal pricing toward the end of fiscal 2010, which exerted downward pressure on segment operating margins due to a lag in customer pricing. The contractual pass through of higher raw material costs diluted operating margins by 2.2 percentage points in fiscal 2010 compared to 2.7 percentage points in fiscal 2009. Fastener ProductsThe Fastener Products segment produces fasteners, fastener systems and components for critical applications in the aerospace, automotive and industrial machinery markets as well as applications and monitoring units utilized in the power generation industry. Fiscal Year % Increase/(Decrease) 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009Sales by Market: Aerospace$950.1 $989.9 $1,133.7 (4)% (13)%% of total71% 75% 75% Power17.2 16.8 19.4 2 % (13)%% of total1% 1% 1% General Industrial & Other377.5 318.2 367.2 19 % (13)%% of total28% 24% 24% Total Sales$1,344.8 $1,324.9 $1,520.3 2 % (13)%Operating income$411.0 $440.2 $459.7 (7)% (4)%% of sales30.6% 33.2% 30.2% Fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 The Fastener Products segment reported fiscal 2011 sales of $1,344.8 million, a 2 percent increase from fiscal 2010 sales of $1,324.9 million. Strong general industrial sales helped to increase year over year sales by approximately $59 million, or 19 percent. Offsetting this increase was a decline in aerospace fastener sales of approximately $40 million, or 4 percent, compared to the prior year. Aerospace volume suffered from delays in the Boeing 787 production schedule and continued weakness in orders from distributors, as current aircraft production was supplied out of existing customer inventory. This segment was able to increase sales of lower margin, non core aerospace products in order to maintain volume and mitigate the impact of the decline in core aerospace sales.Operating income for the Fasteners segment was $411.0 million or 30.6 percent of sales in fiscal 2011, compared to $440.2 million, or 33.2 percent of sales, in fiscal 2010. Segment operating margins were negatively affected by the shift away from core aerospace products to lower margin, less complex fasteners, and increased general industrial volume. 31Table of ContentsThe most significant future catalysts for segment growth continue to be the Boeing 787 ramp up and the recovery of fastener distribution orders. As those inventory levels fall, and production demand increases, the segment is poised to benefit from market improvement and additional share gains anticipated to begin toward the latter half of fiscal 2012. These increased volumes, driven across the business improved cost structure, will help the segment achieve stronger operational performance.Fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 The Fastener Products segment reported fiscal 2010 sales of $1,324.9 million, a 13 percent decrease from fiscal 2009 sales of $1,520.3 million. The decrease in sales primarily resulted from further aerospace aftermarket and distributor destocking coupled with a decline in regional/business jet demand, which negatively impacted year over year aerospace sales by $135 million, or 12% (excluding the impact of currency). A decline in general industrial and other markets negatively impacted sales by $40 million, or 12% (excluding the impact of currency), compared to the prior year. In addition, our foreign operations reported approximately $10 million in reduced U.S. dollar equivalent sales year over year due to the increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to international currencies, primarily the British pound.Operating income for the Fasteners segment was $440.2 million or 33.2 percent of sales in fiscal 2010, compared to $459.7 million, or 30.2 percent of sales, in fiscal 2009. The higher operating margin was a result of continuous, aggressive cost improvement projects undertaken throughout fiscal 2010, resulting in productivity improvements, better utilization of assets, and effective cost management across the segment.Interest and taxesNet interest expense in fiscal 2011 was $9.0 million, compared with $13.1 million in fiscal 2010. The lower net interest expense was primarily due to reduced interest expense resulting from lower debt balances and lower borrowing rates, and increased interest income resulting from higher cash balances. Net interest expense in fiscal 2010 was $13.1 million, compared with $10.6 million in fiscal 2009. The higher net interest expense was primarily due to lower interest income earned on lower interest rates and lower average cash balances. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was 33.5 percent, 0.9 percentage points lower than the 34.4 percent effective tax rate in fiscal 2010. The decrease in the full year tax rate compared to the prior year was primarily due to increased benefits from the federal manufacturing deduction and a reduction in non benefited foreign losses, partially offset by reduced benefits from earnings taxed at rates lower than the U.S statutory tax rate.The effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was 34.4 percent, 0.2 percentage points higher than the 34.2 percent effective tax rate in fiscal 2009. The slight increase in the full year tax rate compared to the prior year was primarily due to reduced benefits from the U.S. manufacturing deduction, an increase in state taxes and non benefited foreign losses in fiscal 2010; offset by increased benefits from foreign earnings taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate. Liquidity and capital resourcesTotal assets of $8,955.9 million at April 3, 2011 represented a $1,295.2 million increase from the $7,660.7 million balance at March 28, 2010. The increase principally reflects cash generated during the year from operations totaling $1,038.0 million and the strengthening of the British Pound, Euro, and Australian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar. Total capitalization at April 3, 2011 was $7,401.1 million, consisting of $236.6 million of debt and $7,164.5 million of equity. The debt to capitalization ratio declined to 3.2% at April 3, 2011 from 4.1% at the end of fiscal 2010, reflecting the impact of increased equity from earnings and stock issuances, in addition to reduced debt levels.Cash as of April 3, 2011 was $1,159.0 million, an increase of $1,046.6 million from the end of fiscal 2010, and total debt was $236.6 million, down $13.4 million since the end of fiscal 2010. The net cash flow of $1,060.0 million reflects cash generated from operations of $1,038.0 million and $116.3 million from the issuance of common stock, partially offset by capital expenditures of $120.4 million and cash paid to acquire businesses of $37.2 million.Capital spending of $120.4 million in fiscal 2011 principally provided for equipment upgrades and cost reduction and productivity projects throughout the Company. We expect our baseline capital expenditures for fiscal 2012 to be moderately higher than fiscal 2011 based on our current forecasts. These expenditures will be targeted for cost reduction projects and equipment upgrades within our Forged Products and Investment Cast Products segments. Capacity expansion projects that arise in excess of the base forecast will be evaluated on their own merits during the fiscal year based on demand.During fiscal 2011, we contributed $115.9 million to the defined benefit pension plans, of which $100.0 million was voluntary. In the first month of fiscal 2012, we made a $50.0 million voluntary contribution to the defined benefit pension plans. We expect to contribute approximately $11.2 million of required contributions in fiscal 2012, for total contributions to 32Table of Contentsthe defined benefit pension plans of approximately $61.2 million in fiscal 2012. In addition, we contributed $47.0 million to the other postretirement benefit plans during fiscal 2011. We expect to contribute approximately $7.5 million to the other postretirement benefit plans during fiscal 2012.In July 2010, we paid $38.3 million to one of our postretirement medical benefit plans that was jointly administered with a union. This payment and the related administrative changes remove PCC and its affiliates from any further financial, administrative or fiduciary responsibilities to this plan, and we therefore accounted for these events as a settlement of the plan and reversed the related liability. There was no significant gain or loss associated with the settlement. We believe we will be able to meet our short and longer term liquidity needs for working capital, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, capital spending, cash dividends, scheduled repayment of debt and potential acquisitions from cash generated from operations, borrowings from our existing $1.0 billion revolving credit facility or new bank credit facilities, the issuance of public or privately placed debt securities, or the issuance of equity instruments. Our revolving bank credit facility (Credit Agreement) provides available borrowing up to $1.0 billion through May 2012. Our unused borrowing capacity as of April 3, 2011 was $980.9 million under the Credit Agreement, reduced by a $19.1 million workers compensation letter of credit issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The Credit Agreement contains various standard financial covenants, including maintenance of minimum net worth, interest coverage ratio and leverage ratio. The financial covenants in the Credit Agreement are our most restrictive covenants.Our covenant requirements and actual ratios as of April 3, 2011 were as follows (dollars in millions): Covenant RequirementActualConsolidated minimum net worth(1)$3,586.7 (minimum)$7,164.5 Consolidated interest coverage ratio(1)2.25:1.00 (minimum)109.73:1.00 Consolidated leverage ratio(1)3.25:1.00 (maximum)0.14:1.00 (1)Terms are defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.As of April 3, 2011, we were in compliance with all financial covenants of our loan agreements.Historically, we have also issued commercial paper as a method of raising short term liquidity. We believe we continue to have the ability to issue commercial paper and have issued commercial paper to cover acquisitions and short term cash requirements in recent quarters. During fiscal 2011, the largest daily balance of outstanding commercial paper borrowings was $210 million early in the first quarter with all borrowings repaid prior to the end of the second quarter. We do not anticipate any changes in our ability to borrow under our current credit facility, but changes in the financial condition of the participating financial institutions could negatively impact our ability to borrow funds in the future. Should that circumstance arise, we believe that we would be able to arrange any needed financing, although we are not able to predict what the terms of any such borrowings would be, or the source of the borrowed funds. Contractual obligations and commercial commitmentsWe are obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements and lease agreements. The following table represents our contractual payment obligations as of April 3, 2011 and the estimated timing of future cash payments: Contractual Cash ObligationsTotal 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 ThereafterLong term debt$236.6 $14.7 $5.4 $206.2 $4.9 $5.4 $ Operating leases(1)77.2 19.4 14.7 11.1 8.8 4.9 18.3 Interest on fixed rate debt27.0 10.4 9.4 6.6 0.4 0.2 Interest on variable rate debt(2)6.6 2.1 2.3 2.2 Total$347.4 $46.6 $31.8 $226.1 $14.1 $10.5 $18.3 (1)Operating lease obligations include $0.2 million attributable to an operation held for sale.(2)Interest on variable rate debt is based on current prevailing interest rates. 33Table of ContentsOur reserve for uncertain tax positions at April 3, 2011 was $12.3 million. Due to the uncertainties associated with settling these liabilities, we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these liabilities. As a result, our reserve for unrecognized tax benefits is excluded from the table above. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our reserve for uncertain tax positions.The table above also excludes estimated required cash contributions to our qualified pension plans totaling approximately $60.7 million over the next five years: $11.2 million in fiscal 2012, $12.0 million in fiscal 2013, and $12.5 million in fiscal 2014, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016. We also have benefit payments due under our non qualified pension and other post retirement benefit plans that are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Critical accounting policiesWe have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis where such policies affect reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other significant accounting policies, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report. Note that the preparation of this Annual Report requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.Revenue recognitionWe recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete. This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the contract or purchase order, ownership and risk of loss have passed to the customer, collectibility is reasonably assured, and pricing is fixed and determinable. In instances where title does not pass to the customer upon shipment, we recognize revenue upon delivery or customer acceptance, depending on terms of the sales agreement. Service sales, representing maintenance and engineering activities, are recognized as services are performed. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in revenue.Valuation of inventoriesAll inventories are stated at the lower of their cost or market value, with the market value being determined based on sales in the ordinary course of business. Cost for inventories at a significant number of our operations is determined on a last in, first out (LIFO) basis. The average inventory cost method is utilized for most other inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based on the age, historical usage or assumptions about future demand for the inventory. We also regularly review inventory balances on a LIFO basis to ensure the balances are stated at the lower of cost or market as of the balance sheet date. For those inventories valued using LIFO, their carrying value may be higher or lower than current replacement costs for such inventory, since the LIFO costing assumption matches current costs with current sales, not with current inventory values. When the LIFO cost is greater than the current cost, there is an increased likelihood that our inventories could be subject to write downs to market value. While historical write downs have not been material, if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and reported operating results.Goodwill and acquired intangiblesFrom time to time, we acquire businesses in purchase transactions that typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets, which may affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges. The determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the consolidated financial statements.Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets related to our continuing operations are tested for impairment at a minimum each fiscal year at the end of the second month in the second quarter or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. For fiscal 2011, our reporting units consisted of two operating segments within our Investment Cast Products reportable operating segment, two operating segments within our Forged Products reportable operating segment, as well as three reporting units in our Fasteners Products reportable operating segment. The Fasteners Products operating segment includes several aggregated component units (referred to as the Fasteners Products reporting unit) and two other reporting units for which the segment manager regularly reviews performance. 34Table of ContentsTesting for goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations. Such models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions primarily based on future cash flows, expected market growth rates, our estimates of sales volumes, sales prices and related costs, and the discount rate applied, which reflects the weighted average cost of capital. Management uses the best available information at the time fair values of the reporting units are estimated; however, estimates could be materially impacted by factors such as changes in growth trends and specific industry conditions, with the potential for a corresponding adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements potentially resulting from an impairment of the goodwill. We also consider comparable transactions to estimate the fair value of the reporting units. The cash flow models used to determine fair value are most sensitive to the expected future cash flows and the discount rate for each reporting unit. The discount rate used in the cash flow models for the fiscal 2011 goodwill impairment analysis ranged from 10% to 15% depending on the reporting unit. The annual growth rate for earnings before interest and taxes varied by reporting unit and ranged from 5% to 17% over the initial five year forecast period. A sensitivity analysis determined that using terminal growth rates of 3%, 4% or 5% would not result in impairment in the fiscal 2011 goodwill impairment analysis. We performed a sensitivity analysis on both of these factors and determined that the forecast for future earnings before interest and taxes used in the cash flow model could decrease by 30% or the discount rate utilized could increase by 5%, and the goodwill of our reporting units would not be impaired. The reporting unit that would be most sensitive to worsening economic conditions has $78.9 million of goodwill recorded as of April 3, 2011.The impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets encompasses calculating the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, impairment is recorded. For fiscal 2011 and 2010, it was determined that the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets was greater than the carrying value.Environmental costsThe estimated future costs for known environmental remediation requirements are accrued on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of remediation costs can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of amounts is established, and no amount within the range is better than another, the minimum amount of the range is recorded. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when collection is probable. Adjustments to our accruals may be necessary to reflect new information as investigation and remediation efforts proceed. The amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period, but any amounts, and the possible range of any amounts in excess of those already accrued, are not reasonably estimable at this time. Total environmental reserves accrued at April 3, 2011 and March 28, 2010 were $66.8 million and $75.6 million, respectively.Guidance on asset retirement and environmental obligations clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation and requires a liability to be recorded if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. Asset retirement obligations covered by this guidance include those for which an entity has a significant obligation to perform an asset retirement activity; however, the timing or method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may not be within the control of the entity. This guidance also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation.In accordance with the asset retirement and environmental obligations guidance, we record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liability can be reasonably estimated. Currently, we have identified known asset retirement obligations associated with environmental contamination at two of our manufacturing facilities. However, we have not recognized a liability under this guidance for these retirement obligations because the fair value of remediation at these sites cannot be reasonably estimated since the settlement date is unknown at this time. The settlement date is unknown because remediation of these sites is not required until production ceases, and we have no current plans to cease production in the future. These asset retirement obligations, when estimable, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows or business.Income taxesProvisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pre tax earnings based on current tax law and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Tax benefits arising from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant tax authorities. The amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest amount of tax 35Table of Contentsbenefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.Pension and other postretirement benefit plansWe sponsor many U.S. and non U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Our pension and postretirement benefit plans are accounted for in accordance with defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans accounting guidance. Plan assets have been valued at fair value in accordance with this guidance. Pension and postretirement expense and liability amounts are derived from several significant assumptions, including the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rate. Pension and postretirement expense and liability amounts are derived from several significant assumptions, including the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rate. For valuation of our pension liabilities, we derive a market based discount rate from yields on high quality, liquid fixed income securities at the end of our fiscal year. We use only highly rated bonds (AA/Aa or higher) to estimate the interest rate at which our pension benefits could be effectively settled. For our U.S. Plans, we used a discount rate assumption of 5.75% for the total benefit obligation of our pension plans at our April 3, 2011 measurement date. For our non U.S. Plans, we used a discount rate assumption of 5.88% for the total benefit obligation of our pension plans at our April 3, 2011 measurement date. In developing the long term rate of return on plan assets assumptions, we evaluate input from third party investment consultants and actuaries, review asset allocation and investment strategies, ranges of projected and historical returns, and inflation and economic assumptions. The expected return assumptions are derived from asset allocations within the Companys target asset allocation ranges consistent with our diversified investment approach. As the assumed rate of return on plan assets is a long term assumption, it is not anticipated to be as volatile as the discount rate, which is a point in time measurement. For our U.S. Plans, we used a long term rate of return assumption of 8.0% to calculate the 2011 and 2010 net periodic pension cost. For our non U.S. Plans, we used a long term rate of return assumption of 7.5% to calculate the 2011 and 2010 net periodic pension cost. For fiscal 2011, our U.S. net periodic pension expense was $26.6 million and non U.S. net periodic pension income was $1.8 million. We estimate that for fiscal 2012, our U.S. net periodic pension expense will be approximately $26.1 million and non U.S. net periodic pension income will be approximately $3.6 million. Our U.S. net postretirement benefit cost was $6.4 million for fiscal 2011, and we estimate that for fiscal 2012, our U.S. net postretirement benefit cost will be $5.5 million.The table below quantifies the approximate impact, as of April 3, 2011, of a one quarter percentage point decrease in our assumptions for discount rate and expected return on assets, holding other assumptions constant. 0.25 PercentagePoint DecreaseIncrease in annual costs: Discount rate$6.0 Expected long term rate of return$4.3 Increase in projected benefit obligation: Discount rate$59.0 The approximate impact, as of April 3, 2011, of a one percentage point increase in our assumption for the health care cost trend rate, holding other assumptions constant, on our total service and interest cost components and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation is not significant. Recently issued accounting standardsIn May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance which amends existing measurement guidance and expands disclosure requirements for fair value measurements, particularly for Level 3 (as defined in the accounting guidance) inputs. This guidance will be effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.In January 2010, the FASB issued guidance which requires new disclosures and clarifies existing disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. Specifically, the changes require disclosure of transfers into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 (as defined in the accounting guidance) fair value measurements, and also require more detailed disclosure about the activity within Level 3 fair value measurements. This guidance was effective for the Company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, 36Table of Contentsexcept for disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements of Level 3 assets and liabilities, which will be effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures, the adoption did not and will not impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In October 2009, the FASB issued amendments to the accounting and disclosure for revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements. These amendments modify the criteria for recognizing revenue and require enhanced disclosures for multiple element deliverable revenue arrangements. This guidance will be effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance to require an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprises variable interest gives it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity. This guidance was effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The adoption of this guidance did not impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK At various times, we use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and prices of strategic raw materials. Because derivative instruments are used solely as hedges and not for speculative trading purposes, fluctuations in the market values of such derivative instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the underlying economic exposures that the instruments are intended to hedge. For further discussion of derivative financial instruments, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.Interest Rate RiskWe have variable rate debt obligations that expose us to interest rate risk. If market interest rates had averaged 10 percent higher than actual levels in fiscal 2011 or 2010, the effect on our interest expense and net income would not have been material.Foreign Currency RiskThe majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars; however, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies for transactions denominated in other currencies. As discussed in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, we had foreign currency hedges in place at April 3, 2011 and March 28, 2010 to reduce such exposure. The estimated loss in fair value on foreign currency hedges outstanding as of April 3, 2011, from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in exchange rates, would not have been material.Material Cost RiskWe have entered into long term supply agreements to fix the purchase price of certain strategic raw materials as of April 3, 2011 and March 28, 2010. In addition, we had escalation clauses related to raw material pricing in certain of our sales contracts at April 3, 2011 and March 28, 2010. If market rates had averaged 10 percent higher than actual levels in either fiscal 2011 or 2010, the effect on our cost of sales and net earnings, after considering the effects of these supply agreements and sales contracts, would not have been material. 37Table of Contents
