ITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS(in millions, except per share data)Business overviewDuring fiscal 2012, we leveraged our solid contractual positions in traditional end markets of aerospace and IGT and gained traction in newer businesses such as aerostructures and oil and gas. The commercial aerospace market is robust and does not appear to be slowing down. We are well positioned to benefit from increased base production build rates announced by Boeing and Airbus, and Boeing 787 production is beginning to gain traction. Within our power markets, we experienced solid IGT sales growth, driven by both improved OEM schedules and aftermarket demand for spares. We also generated more than $1.0 billion of cash from operations during fiscal 2012 and revenue reached a record level, exceeding $7.2 billion. As part of our continued focus on expanding our product lines and markets, we completed eight acquisitions in fiscal 2012. The acquisition of the rings operations of Unison Engine Components ("Tru Form"), which closed in the second quarter of fiscal 2012, broadens our forged product range, adding flash welded and cold rolled rings to our portfolio. Tru Form, which supplies all prime engine OEMs, has exposure to every major commercial aircraft in production today. The addition of PB Fasteners, which closed early in the third quarter of fiscal 2012, further strengthens our fastener product line, adds to our already strong position on the Boeing 787, and will provide opportunities on other composite aircraft in the future. In addition to our already served end markets, we are rapidly expanding our aerospace reach and positioning ourselves with customers in the oil and gas industry. Aided by the acquisitions of Rollmet and KLAD, we have made great strides in penetrating the oil and gas markets. We received two significant orders with major oil and gas customers, which will provide incremental sales in fiscal 2013. In early fiscal 2013, we acquired RathGibson, LLC, which gives us additional manufacturing capabilities to serve the oil and gas industry and will enable us to offer more comprehensive bids on severe service projects. We also have a strong focus on development of our aerostructures platform. With the integration of Primus actively underway, we have already begun to capture valuable synergies and to achieve top and bottom line growth. In May 2012, we acquired Centra Industries ("Centra"), a state of the art aerostructures manufacturer located in Ontario, Canada. Centra manufactures a range of machined airframe components and assemblies, in both aluminum and hard metals. Also in May 2012, we agreed to acquire Dickson Testing Company ("Dickson") and Aerocraft Heat Treating Company ("Aerocraft"). Dickson offers a full range of destructive testing services including: mechanical properties; metallurgical and chemical analyses; and low cycle fatigue testing. Aerocraft provides precision heat treating services for titanium and nickel alloy forgings and castings used in the aerospace industry, as well as other related services including straightening, de twisting and forming. During fiscal 2012, we focused on upgrading manufacturing equipment and increasing operational productivity with the completion or initiation of several large scale cost reduction projects throughout the Company. We also acquired several small strategic tuck in acquisitions that expanded our manufacturing capabilities. We expect our baseline capital expenditures for fiscal 2013 to be moderately higher than fiscal 2012 based on our current forecasts. These expenditures will be targeted for equipment upgrades, capacity expansion, and cost reduction and productivity projects across all segments.Our net periodic pension expense for fiscal 2013 is estimated to increase by $32 million, primarily due to a reduction in discount rates and amortization of actuarial losses. However, improved operating performance at every one of our manufacturing sites continues to be our prime focus. We have achieved strong base incremental margins across all segments over the past year. Over the long term, as a Company, we are focused daily on delivering strong incremental margins as our sales increase, as our results have clearly demonstrated over the past year. We have the right tools, and we have the right people, who know how to put these tools to work to deliver results and the opportunity for both top and bottom line growth has never been better.20Table of Contents Fiscal Year % Increase/(Decrease) 2012 2011 2010 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010Net sales$7,214.6 $6,220.1 $5,459.2 16 % 14 %Costs and expenses: Cost of goods sold4,949.3 4,326.7 3,668.8 14 % 18 %Selling and administrative expenses448.1 390.6 367.1 15 % 6 %Interest expense, net5.2 9.0 13.1 (42)% (31)%Total costs and expenses5,402.6 4,726.3 4,049.0 Income before income tax expense and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates1,812.0 1,493.8 1,410.2 21 % 6 %Income tax expense(594.4) (499.7) (485.7) 19 % 3 %Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates14.6 16.6 1.4 (12)% 1,086 %Net income from continuing operations1,232.2 1,010.7 925.9 22 % 9 %Net (loss) income from discontinued operations(6.4) 4.1 (3.3) (256)% 224 %Net income1,225.8 1,014.8 922.6 21 % 10 %Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest(1.7) (1.3) (0.8) 31 % 63 %Net income attributable to Precision Castparts Corp.

The increase in sales compared to the prior year was driven by solid aerospace growth of approximately $888 million, or 25 percent, over fiscal 2011 levels, particularly within the Investment Cast and Forged Products segments. Boeing and Airbus accelerated base production build rates throughout fiscal 2012 and Boeing 787 production began to ramp up. Aerospace sales increased from 57 percent of total sales in fiscal 2011 to 62 percent of total sales in fiscal 2012. Sales within our power market increased approximately $164 million, or 12%, over the prior year. Factors contributing to this increase include solid IGT sales performance, driven by both OEM orders and aftermarket demand, and growth in oil and gas sales, primarily in the Forged Products segment, partially offset by further reductions in interconnect pipe sales. Sales to the power market (which includes IGT, oil and gas and interconnect pipe) decreased from 22 percent of total sales in fiscal 2011 to 21 percent of total sales in fiscal 2012. General industrial sales declined approximately $57 million, or 4 percent, over the prior year, as we focused on growing higher margin, intercompany activity. We used more of our internal assets for billet production, with intercompany activity increasing approximately $260 million, or 24%, over last year. General industrial and other sales decreased from 21 percent of total sales in fiscal 2011 to 17 percent of total sales in fiscal 2012. We acquired eight businesses during fiscal 2012, which contributed approximately $400 million to sales in fiscal 2012 (also included in market changes discussed above). Higher external selling prices of nickel alloy from the Forged Products segments three primary mills added approximately $150 million to top line revenues in fiscal 2012 versus fiscal 2011. Contractual material pass through pricing increased sales by approximately $301.0 million in fiscal 2012 versus approximately $233.4 million in fiscal 2011, an increase of $67.6 million. Contractual material pass through pricing adjustments are calculated based on market prices such as those shown in the above table in trailing periods from one to twelve months. Although nickel prices decreased 11% on the London Metals Exchange ("LME") compared to the prior year, volume increases, customer directed forward purchases ofnickel, and material price escalators associated with other raw materials drove the increase in material pass through and selling prices of nickel alloy over the prior year.With regard to growth in the commercial aircraft industry, based on data from The Airline Monitor as of January 2012, Boeing and Airbus aircraft deliveries are expected to moderately increase through calendar year 2012 as compared to 2011. Due to manufacturing lead times and scheduled build rates, our production volumes are generally 6 to 9 months ahead of aircraft deliveries. The Airline Monitor is projecting further growth in aircraft deliveries in calendar year 2013, and therefore we anticipate that our aerospace sales will continue to increase in fiscal 2013. Cost of goods sold was $4,949.3 million, or 69 percent of sales, in fiscal 2012 as compared to $4,326.7 million, or 70 percent of sales, in fiscal 2011. Cost of goods sold as a percent of sales was positively impacted by effective leverage on increased sales volume, increased internal metal sourcing in an effort to reduce costs, and other operational improvements. These decreases were partially offset by by the inclusion of lower margin sales from the acquisitions in the Forged and Fastener Products segments and new product development costs. Contractual material pass through pricing diluted gross margin by 1.4 percentage points in fiscal 2012 compared to 1.2 percentage points last year.Selling and administrative expenses were $448.1 million, or 6 percent of sales, in fiscal 2012 compared to $390.6 million, or 6 percent of sales, in fiscal 2011. The largest increase in selling and administrative expenses over the prior year is attributable to additional expenses from the fiscal 2012 acquisitions.22Table of ContentsNet income from continuing operations attributable to PCC for fiscal 2012 was $1,230.5 million, or $8.45 per share (diluted). By comparison, net income from continuing operations attributable to PCC for fiscal 2011 was $1,009.4 million, or $7.01 per share (diluted). Fiscal 2012 net income attributable to PCC including discontinued operations was $1,224.1 million, or $8.41 per share (diluted), compared with net income of $1,013.5 million, or $7.04 per share (diluted) in fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2012 results include a net loss of $6.4 million, or $0.04 per share (diluted), from discontinued operations, compared to net income of $4.1 million, or $0.03 per share (diluted), in the prior year.Fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 Total sales for fiscal 2011 were $6,220.1 million, an increase of $760.9 million, or 14 percent, from fiscal 2010 sales of $5,459.2 million. The increase in sales compared to fiscal 2010 was driven by improved aerospace demand, resulting in an increase in aerospace sales of approximately $581 million, or 19 percent, over fiscal 2010 levels, as our aerospace customer order schedules aligned with base commercial aircraft build rates, particularly within the Investment Cast and Forged Products segments. Aerospace sales increased from 54 percent of total sales in fiscal 2010 to 57 percent of total sales in fiscal 2011. General industrial sales increased $286 million, or 28 percent, over fiscal 2010, and increased from 19 percent of total sales in fiscal 2010 to 21 percent of total sales in fiscal 2011. Higher external selling prices of nickel alloy from the Forged Products segments three primary mills, which increased 38% on the London Metals Exchange ("LME") compared to fiscal 2010, added approximately $111 million to top line revenues in fiscal 2011 versus fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011 also included four quarters of sales from Carlton Forge Works ("Carlton"), which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. These increases were partially offset by a decline in seamless pipe sales of approximately $217 million, or 42 percent, over fiscal 2010 levels. Sales to the power market (which includes IGT and seamless pipe) decreased from 27 percent of total sales in fiscal 2010 to 22 percent of total sales in fiscal 2011. Contractual material pass through pricing, which reflects the impact of escalation formulas included in certain long term agreements, also declined, increasing sales by approximately $233.4 million in fiscal 2011 versus approximately $249.6 million in fiscal 2010, a decrease of $16.2 million. Contractual material pass through pricing adjustments are calculated based on market prices such as those shown in the above table in trailing periods from one to twelve months. Cost of goods sold was $4,326.7 million, or 70 percent of sales, in fiscal 2011 as compared to $3,668.8 million, or 67 percent of sales, in fiscal 2010. Cost of goods sold as a percent of sales was negatively impacted by the reduced seamless pipe volume, which was replaced by lower margin general industrial sales in the Forged Products segment. In addition, lower sales of core product lines in the Fasteners Products segment were replaced with sales of less complex, lower margin products. These decreases were partially offset by the effective leverage of increased aerospace volume due to significantly improved cost structures throughout the Company. Contractual material pass through pricing diluted gross margin by 1.2 percentage points in fiscal 2011 compared to 1.6 percentage points in fiscal 2010.Selling and administrative expenses were $390.6 million, or 6 percent of sales, in fiscal 2011 compared to $367.1 million, or 7 percent of sales, in fiscal 2010. The lower year over year percentage was primarily due to the fixed nature of selling and administrative expenses coupled with an increase in sales compared to fiscal 2010.Net income from continuing operations attributable to PCC for fiscal 2011 was $1,009.4 million, or $7.01 per share (diluted). By comparison, net income from continuing operations attributable to PCC for fiscal 2010 was $925.1 million, or $6.51 per share (diluted). Fiscal 2011 net income attributable to PCC including discontinued operations was $1,013.5 million, or $7.04 per share (diluted), compared with net income of $921.8 million, or $6.49 per share (diluted) in fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011 net income includes $4.1 million, or $0.03 per share (diluted), from discontinued operations, compared to a net loss of $3.3 million, or $0.02 per share (diluted), in fiscal 2010.AcquisitionsFiscal 2012On July 14, 2011, we acquired the rings operations of Unison Engine Components ("Tru Form") from GE Aviation, an operating unit of General Electric Company. Tru Form is a leader in the manufacture of flash welded and cold rolled rings for jet engine and gas turbine applications, including spacer rings, combustion casings and liners, low pressure turbine casings, and fan cases. The innovative Tru Form cold rolling process produces a near net shaped part from a flash welded ring, reducing material and machining costs and enabling the production of more complex part shapes. Tru Form employs approximately 275 people across its three locations in Wilkes Barre and Mountaintop, Pennsylvania, and Tyseley, England. The Tru Form acquisition was an asset purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of the Forged Products segment. On July 22, 2011, we acquired the assets of the Rollmet business ("Rollmet") from Rockwell Collins. Rollmet has developed a unique cold roll extrusion process to manufacture precision thin wall pipe across a range of materials, including nickel alloys, stainless steel, aluminum, and carbon steel. Rollmets products are utilized in a variety of oil and gas 23Table of Contentsapplications, as well as motor cases for missile programs. Rollmet has approximately 70 employees and operates one facility in Irvine, California.

Headquartered in Bellevue, Washington, Primus employs approximately 1,500 people across five manufacturing locations, including three in the Seattle, Washington area, as well as Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Suzhou, China. The Primus acquisition was a stock purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of the Fastener Products segment. This transaction resulted in $422.1 million of goodwill and $505.3 million of other intangible assets, including customer relationships with indefinite lives valued at $468.5 million, customer relationships with finite lives valued at $15.6 million and backlog valued at $21.2 million. We also recorded a long term liability related to the fair value of loss contracts valued at $85.3 million.On October 4, 2011, we acquired the assets of PB Fasteners ("PB"). PB is an industry leader in the design and manufacturing of fastener products for airframe applications, including the development of the SLEEVbolt fastening system. PBs sleeve bolt technology is critical to mitigating the impact of lightning strikes on the Boeing 787 aircraft and other composite body aircraft. Located in Gardena, California, PB entered the aerospace fastener business in 1967. The PB acquisition was an asset purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of the Fastener Products segment. Over the course of fiscal 2012, we completed several additional acquisitions which were not material, but do provide us with additional manufacturing capabilities. The purchase price allocations for each business acquisition above, in addition to four minor acquisitions, are subject to further refinement. The impact of these acquisitions is not material to our consolidated results of operations; consequently, pro forma information has not been included.Fiscal 2011 On January 3, 2011, we acquired an additional 1% equity interest in Yangzhou Chengde Steel Tube Co., Ltd (Chengde) for approximately $7 million in cash, increasing our equity interest to 50%. We continue to account for this investment under the equity method as we currently do not exercise control of the major operating and financial policies of Chengde. The carrying value of this investment as of April 1, 2012 was $424.3 million and was included in investment in unconsolidated affiliates in our consolidated balance sheet. The carrying value of our investment in Chengde exceeded the amount of underlying equity in net assets of Chengde by approximately $189 million as of April 1, 2012. This difference arose through the valuation process that was applied to the assets acquired. Fiscal 2010On September 30, 2009, we completed the acquisition of Carlton Forge Works and a related entity (Carlton) for approximately $847 million in cash, comprised of approximately $502 million of cash on hand and the proceeds of approximately $345 million of commercial paper debt issuance (subsequently repaid). Carlton, a leading manufacturer of seamless rolled rings for critical aerospace applications, offers nickel, titanium, and steel rolled rings across the widest range of product sizes in the industry. Carlton broadens our forging capabilities and enables us to provide a full range of forged products to our aerospace engine customers. The Carlton acquisition is an asset purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of our Forged Products segment. This transaction resulted in $400.1 million of goodwill (which is deductible for tax purposes) and $336.7 million of other intangible assets, including tradenames with indefinite lives valued at $89.1 million, customer relationships with indefinite lives valued at $204.8 million, customer relationships with finite lives valued at $3.7 million, backlog valued at $10.2 million and revenue sharing agreements valued at $28.9 million. We also recorded a long term liability related to the fair value of a pre existing revenue sharing agreement valued at $92.0 million. The impact of this acquisition was not material to our consolidated results of operations; consequently, pro forma information has not been included. On January 15, 2010, we acquired a 49% equity interest in Chengde for approximately $355 million in cash, comprised of approximately $115 million of cash on hand and the proceeds of approximately $240 million of commercial paper debt issuance (subsequently repaid). Chengde is a leading manufacturer of seamless, extruded pipe for boiler applications in coal fired power plants, as well as pipe and tubing for other energy related applications, such as compressed natural gas. The company operates from one facility with a manufacturing footprint of nearly 6 million square feet in the Jiangsu Province of China. Chengde has built a leading position in the Chinese boiler pipe market and has begun to make inroads into export markets. The above business acquisitions, in addition to four minor acquisitions in fiscal 2012, were accounted for under the 24Table of Contentsacquisition method of accounting (except for the investment in Chengde, which was accounted for under the equity method) and, accordingly, the results of operations have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Income since the acquisition date. Discontinued operationsOur financial statements were impacted by activities relating to the planned or completed divestiture of certain of our businesses. These businesses have been accounted for under discontinued operations guidance. Accordingly, any operating results of these businesses are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Income as discontinued operations, net of income tax, and all prior periods have been reclassified.Fiscal 2012During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we decided to divest a small non core business in the Fastener Products segment and reclassified it to discontinued operations.Fiscal 2011During the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we sold an automotive fastener business. The transaction resulted in a gain of approximately $6.4 million (net of tax).During the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we decided to divest a small non core business in the Fastener Products segment and reclassified it to discontinued operations. We have entered into an agreement to sell this business and expect to complete the transaction in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.Fiscal 2010 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we decided to dispose of a small non core business in the Fasteners Products segment and reclassified it to discontinued operations. The sale of the business was completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2011.In the third quarter of fiscal 2010, we decided to divest a small non core business in the Investment Cast Products segment and reclassified it to discontinued operations. The sale of the business was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. The transaction resulted in a gain of approximately $11.4 million (net of tax) in fiscal 2010.In the second quarter of fiscal 2010, we recognized an impairment loss of approximately $8.7 million (net of tax) related to two automotive fastener businesses held for sale due to continued erosion in the automotive market. The sale of these businesses was completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2011. Subsequent eventsOn April 2, 2012, we acquired RathGibson, LLC ("RathGibson").

Aerospace sales increased approximately $183 million, or 14 percent, over the prior year driven by higher build rates of commercial aircraft, including the Boeing 787, and the greater frequency of takeoffs and landings. This segment also experienced solid increases in commercial and military aftermarket sales. Within our power market, IGT sales increased by approximately $57 million, or 11%, over the prior year, driven by both OEM orders and aftermarket demand. The increases in aerospace and IGT sales were partially offset by declines in general industrial and other sales. Sales also include $76.9 million of higher pricing related to contractual pass through of increased material costs compared to $51.1 million in fiscal 2011, an increase of $25.8 million. Operating income for the Investment Cast Products segment was $766.4 million or 32.9 percent of sales in fiscal 2012, compared to $665.5 million, or 31.8 percent of sales, in fiscal 2011. Operating income increased compared to the prior year as the segment continues to generate solid incremental margins on increased sales volumes into aerospace and IGT markets. The segment improved operating margin by 1.1 percentage points year over year driven by the solid drop through on increased volume, partially offset by costs associated with anticipated volume increases, including maintenance and training expenses. Contractual material pass through pricing diluted operating margins by 1.1 percentage points in fiscal 2012 compared to 0.8 percentage points last year.The Investment Cast Products segment anticipates growing aerospace OEM sales driven by the announced increases in Airbus and Boeing base program build rates in late calendar 2012 and early 2013, as well as by 787 production, which will continue to be a strong contributor to segment sales as build schedules ramp through this calendar year and into the next. On the IGT front, OEM sales are beginning to trend positively, providing further upside potential. We estimate that our net periodic pension expense for fiscal 2013 will increase by $13 million, primarily due to a reduction in discount rates and amortization of actuarial losses.Fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 The Investment Cast Products segment reported fiscal 2011 sales of $2,095.6 million, an increase of 13.0 percent from fiscal 2010 sales of $1,851.3 million. The year over year increase in sales reflects the realignment of aerospace OEM orders with production rates and aftermarket increases driven by engine schedules. Aerospace sales increased approximately $260 million, or 25 percent, over fiscal 2010 as the destocking ended and orders driven by previously announced increases in base aircraft build rates realigned with customer demand. In addition, external alloy sales from Cannon Muskegon more than doubled over fiscal 2010, which we believe is a leading indicator of the aerospace rebound. IGT sales decreased approximately $33 million, or 6 percent, compared to fiscal 2010 due to continued customer destocking that began in the latter half of fiscal 2010; however, the segment experienced an increase in OEM shipments in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Sales also include $51.1 million of higher pricing related to contractual pass through of increased material costs compared to $40.7 million in fiscal 2010, an increase of $10.4 million. 27Table of ContentsOperating income for the Investment Cast Products segment was $665.5 million or 31.8 percent of sales in fiscal 2011, compared to $560.0 million, or 30.2 percent of sales, in fiscal 2010. Operating income increased compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to improved leverage on increased aerospace throughput combined with improved cost performance. The segment improved operating margin by 1.6 percentage points year over year driven by continuous focus on productivity, scrap and rework, and other variable cost improvements in the segments manufacturing operations. Contractual material pass through pricing diluted operating margins by 0.8 percentage points in fiscal 2011 compared to 0.7 percentage points in fiscal 2010.Forged ProductsThe Forged Products segment manufactures forged components from sophisticated titanium and nickel based alloys principally for the aerospace and power markets, and manufactures nickel and cobalt based alloys used to produce forged components for aerospace and non aerospace markets which include products for oil and gas, chemical processing, and pollution control applications. The segment also provides nickel superalloy and titanium revert management solutions, re melting various material byproducts and reusing them in casting, forging, and fastener manufacturing processes. Forged Products sales to the aerospace and power markets are derived primarily from the same large engine customers served by the Investment Cast Products segment, with additional aerospace sales to manufacturers of landing gear and other airframe components. The Forged Products segment also produces extruded pipe for the power and oil and gas industries.

Fiscal 2012 results include the benefit from the acquisitions of KLAD, Tru Form and Rollmet for part of the year. Similar to Investment Cast Products, this segment experienced robust OEM and aftermarket aerospace activity as aerospace sales improved by approximately $375 million, or 28 percent, year over year. In addition, sales within our power market increased approximately $90 million, or 12%, compared to the prior year. Factors contributing to this increase include growth in IGT sales due to market share gains and oil and gas sales aided by the acquisitions of Rollmet and KLAD, partially offset by a decline in interconnect pipe shipments. Although interconnect pipe sales continued to lag fiscal 2011 levels, demand is beginning to improve. General industrial sales declined approximately $55 million, or 8%, during fiscal 2012, as the segment used more of its internal assets for billet production, with intercompany activity increasing approximately $187 million, or 25%, over last year. Higher external selling prices of external alloy sales from the segments three primary mills added approximately $150 million to top line revenues in fiscal 2012 versus fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2012 sales also include $210.3 million of contractual pricing related to pass through of increased raw material costs compared to $170.4 million last year, an increase of $39.9 million. Operating income for the Forged Products segment was $686.2 million or 21.5 percent of sales in fiscal 2012, compared to $539.4 million, or 19.4 percent of sales, in fiscal 2011. The increase in operating income year over year was primarily driven by solid leverage from increased aerospace and IGT volume and the contribution from the acquisitions. The segments operating margins increased by 2.1 percentage points year over year despite higher development costs associated with testing and qualifying new oil and gas products. Operationally, the segment achieved strong base incremental drop though and increased internal metal sourcing to reduce costs. The contractual pass through of higher raw material costs diluted operating margins by 1.5 percentage points in fiscal 2012 compared to 1.3 percentage points last year.28Table of ContentsThe Forged Products segment is poised for further aerospace growth in fiscal 2013 as base commercial aircraft and Boeing 787 production schedules begin to build. We foresee numerous opportunities for sales growth in oil and gas markets in fiscal 2013 and going forward. Delivery of the segments Saudi Aramco nickel casing order is scheduled to begin late in the first half of fiscal 2013 and the ADNOC nickel casing order is expected to start shipping in the second quarter of fiscal 2013. We expanded our power platform with the acquisition of RathGibson, which closed two days into the first quarter of fiscal 2013. RathGibson gives us further manufacturing capabilities to serve the oil and gas industry and will enable us to offer more comprehensive bids on severe service projects going forward. We estimate that our net periodic pension expense for fiscal 2013 will increase by $10 million, primarily due to a reduction in discount rates and amortization of actuarial losses.Fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 The Forged Products segment reported fiscal 2011 sales of $2,779.7 million, an increase of 22 percent from fiscal 2010 sales of $2,283.0 million. Similar to Investment Cast Products, previous destocking activities associated with customer owned aerospace inventory ended and new orders sparked commercial activity in this segment as aerospace sales improved by approximately $361 million, or 38 percent, year over year. General industrial sales also showed continued strength, increasing by approximately $218 million, or 46 percent, compared to fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011 also includes four quarters of sales from Carlton, which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Partially offsetting these increases was a decline in power markets of approximately $82 million, or 10 percent, compared to fiscal 2010 due to significantly lower core seamless pipe shipments. Higher external selling prices of external alloy sales from the segments three primary mills added approximately $111 million to top line revenues in fiscal 2011 versus fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011 sales also include $170.4 million of contractual pricing related to pass through of increased raw material costs compared to $201.8 million in fiscal 2010, a decrease of $31.4 million. Operating income for the Forged Products segment was $539.4 million or 19.4 percent of sales in fiscal 2011, compared to $529.7 million, or 23.2 percent of sales, in fiscal 2010. The slight increase in operating income year over year was primarily driven by solid leverage from increased aerospace volume and the contribution from increased general industrial business, partially offset by weak seamless pipe performance. The segments operating margin decreased by more than 3 percentage points in fiscal 2011 due to the negative impact of reduced seamless pipe volume and pricing. Growth in the segments lower margin general industrial markets also negatively impacted operating margin. Higher metal selling prices at the segments three primary mills diluted operating margins by 0.8 percentage points in fiscal 2011. The contractual pass through of higher raw material costs diluted operating margins by 1.3 percentage points in fiscal 2011 compared to 2.2 percentage points in fiscal 2010.Fastener ProductsThe Fastener Products segment manufacturers highly engineered fasteners, fastener systems, aerostructures, and precision components, primarily for critical aerospace applications. The balance of the segments sales is derived from construction, automotive, heavy truck and general industrial markets, including farm machinery, mining and construction equipment, shipbuilding, machine tools, medical equipment, appliances and recreation.

Fiscal 2012 results include the contribution from the Primus and PB Fasteners acquisitions for part of the year. This segment experienced a solid recovery in aerospace sales compared to the prior year, which increased approximately $330 million, or 35 percent, driven by a steady acceleration in orders for the segments critical aerospace core fastener products and the contribution from acquisitions. While the gap between order levels and commercial aircraft production rates continued to close, the segment still lagged the build rates as customer inventory levels continued to be depleted. In terms of the aerostructure products within the segment, sales are tracking closely to increased commercial build rates. General industrial sales increased approximately $17 million, or 5%, over the prior year.Operating income for the Fasteners segment was $488.1 million or 28.7 percent of sales in fiscal 2012, compared to $411.0 million, or 30.6 percent of sales, in fiscal 2011. The increased volume of core product running through the Fastener Products businesses is starting to drive solid incremental drop through, however, operating margins were reduced by 1.7% percentage points due to the inclusion of lower margin sales from the acquisitions in fiscal 2012 results. Although the acquisitions continue to have a dilutive effect on segment operating margins, they are quickly adopting PCC operational methods and are beginning to demonstrate solid performance improvements. The Fastener Products segment is expected to benefit when Boeing 787 production schedules accelerate and core aerospace product sales recover, although, there is no current line of sight related to the timing of these items. We also expanded our presence in the aerostructures business with the acquisition of Centra Industries in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Aerostructures will continue to be a platform for our long term profitable growth. We estimate that our net periodic pension expense for fiscal 2013 will increase by $4 million, primarily due to a reduction in discount rates and amortization of actuarial losses.Fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 The Fastener Products segment reported fiscal 2011 sales of $1,344.8 million, a 2 percent increase from fiscal 2010 sales of $1,324.9 million. Strong general industrial sales helped to increase year over year sales by approximately $59 million, or 19 percent. Offsetting this increase was a decline in aerospace fastener sales of approximately $40 million, or 4 percent, compared to fiscal 2010. Aerospace volume suffered from delays in the Boeing 787 production schedule and continued weakness in orders from distributors, as current aircraft production was supplied out of existing customer inventory. This segment was able to increase sales of lower margin, non core aerospace products in order to maintain volume and mitigate the impact of the decline in core aerospace sales.Operating income for the Fasteners segment was $411.0 million or 30.6 percent of sales in fiscal 2011, compared to $440.2 million, or 33.2 percent of sales, in fiscal 2010. Segment operating margins were negatively affected by the shift away from core aerospace products to lower margin, less complex fasteners, and increased general industrial volume. Interest and taxesNet interest expense during fiscal 2012 was $5.2 million, compared with $9.0 million during fiscal 2011. The reduced interest expense was primarily due to lower debt balances, partially offset by a make whole prepayment of interest associated with the early retirement of our remaining outstanding private note. The private note was repaid in November 2011 in advance of its August 2014 stated maturity. Interest income increased as a result of an increase in cash balances invested outside the U.S. earning rates higher than U.S. interest rates.Net interest expense in fiscal 2011 was $9.0 million, compared with $13.1 million in fiscal 2010. The lower net interest expense was primarily due to reduced interest expense resulting from lower debt balances and lower borrowing rates, and increased interest income resulting from higher cash balances. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 was 32.8 percent, 0.7 percentage points lower than the 33.5 percent effective tax rate in fiscal 2011. The decrease in the full year tax rate compared to the prior year was primarily due to a reduction in state taxes, increased benefits from earnings taxed at rates lower than the U.S statutory tax rate, and benefits from non recurring adjustments to prior year tax assets and liabilities, partially offset by reduced benefits from the research and development credit.The effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was 33.5 percent, 0.9 percentage points lower than the 34.4 percent effective tax rate in fiscal 2010. The decrease in the full year tax rate compared to the prior year was primarily due to increased benefits from the federal manufacturing deduction and a reduction in non benefited foreign losses, partially offset by reduced benefits from earnings taxed at rates lower than the U.S statutory tax rate.30Table of ContentsLiquidity and capital resourcesTotal assets of $10,558.8 million at April 1, 2012 represented a $1,602.9 million increase from the $8,955.9 million balance at April 3, 2011. The increase principally reflects cash generated during the year from business operations totaling $1,038.3 million and increased receivables in support of higher sales. Inventories also increased driven by purchases to support increasing sales, increasing internal metal and product sourcing, and an inventory build in anticipation of maintenance scheduled in the second quarter of fiscal 2013. In addition, tangible and intangible assets recorded in the acquisitions of Rollmet, Tru Form, Primus and PB Fasteners contributed to the increase.Total capitalization at April 1, 2012 was $8,573.0 million, consisting of $208.2 million of debt and $8,364.8 million of equity. The debt to capitalization ratio declined to 2.4% at April 1, 2012 from 3.2% at the end of fiscal 2011, reflecting debt reductions and the impact of increased equity from earnings and stock issuances through employee stock compensation programs, partially offset by an increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to our pension and other postretirement plans.Cash as of April 1, 2012 was $698.7 million, a decrease of $460.3 million from the end of fiscal 2011, and total debt was $208.2 million, down $28.4 million since the end of fiscal 2011. The net negative cash flow reflects cash paid to acquire businesses (net of cash acquired) of $1,423.9 million and capital expenditures of $192.1 million, partially offset by cash generated from operations of $1,038.3 million and $122.1 million from the issuance of common stock.Capital spending of $192.1 million in fiscal 2012 principally provided for cost reduction and productivity projects and equipment upgrades throughout the Company. We expect our baseline capital expenditures for fiscal 2013 to be moderately higher than fiscal 2012 based on our current forecasts. These expenditures will be targeted for equipment upgrades, capacity expansion, and cost reduction and productivity projects across all segments.During fiscal 2012, we contributed $69.4 million to the defined benefit pension plans, of which $50.0 million was voluntary. In the first month of fiscal 2013, we made an additional $50.0 million voluntary contribution to the defined benefit pension plans. We expect to contribute approximately $12.4 million of required contributions in fiscal 2013, for total contributions to the defined benefit pension plans of approximately $62.4 million in fiscal 2013. In addition, we contributed $8.5 million to the other postretirement benefit plans during fiscal 2012. We expect to contribute approximately $7.0 million to the other postretirement benefit plans during fiscal 2013.In July 2010, we paid $38.3 million to one of our postretirement medical benefit plans that was jointly administered with a union. This payment and the related administrative changes remove PCC and its affiliates from any further financial, administrative or fiduciary responsibilities to this plan, and we therefore accounted for these events as a settlement of the plan and reversed the related liability. There was no significant gain or loss associated with the settlement. During fiscal 2012, we closed on eight acquisitions in the amount of $1,423.9 million. These acquisitions were funded from cash on hand and the proceeds from commercial paper debt issuances, which was repaid prior to the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2012.Historically, we have issued commercial paper as a method of raising short term liquidity. We believe we continue to have the ability to issue commercial paper and have issued commercial paper to cover acquisitions and short term cash requirements in recent quarters. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of April 1, 2012 or April 3, 2011. During fiscal 2012, the average amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding was $57.6 million and the weighted average interest rate was 0.3%. During fiscal 2011, the average amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding was $21.5 million and the weighted average interest rate was 0.3%. During fiscal 2012 and 2011, the largest daily balance of outstanding commercial paper borrowings was $390.0 million and $210.0 million, respectively. We do not anticipate any changes in our ability to borrow under our current credit facility, but changes in the financial condition of the participating financial institutions could negatively impact our ability to borrow funds in the future. Should that circumstance arise, we believe that we would be able to arrange any needed financing, although we are not able to predict what the terms of any such borrowings would be, or the source of the borrowed funds. On November 30, 2011, we entered into a credit agreement (the New Credit Agreement) with Bank of America, N.A. as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and Citibank, N.A., as Syndication Agents, and other lenders from time to time party thereto (collectively the Lenders). On the same day, we also terminated our prior credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. and the other lenders under such agreement. The New Credit Agreement consists of a five year, $1.0 billion revolving credit facility (with a $500 million increase option, subject to approval of the Lenders) maturing November 30, 2016, unless extended pursuant to two 364 day extension options (subject to approval of the Lenders). The New Credit Agreement is unsecured and contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, and financial and other covenants. 31Table of ContentsOur unused borrowing capacity as of April 1, 2012 was $1.0 billion under the New Credit Agreement. Our financial covenant requirement and actual ratio as of April 1, 2012 was as follows: Covenant RequirementActualConsolidated leverage ratio165.0%(maximum)2.4% (1)Terms are defined in the New Credit Agreement.As of April 1, 2012, we were in compliance with the financial covenant in the New Credit Agreement.We believe we will be able to meet our short and longer term liquidity needs for working capital, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, capital spending, cash dividends, scheduled repayment of debt and potential acquisitions with the cash generated from operations, borrowing from our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility or new bank credit facilities, the issuance of public or privately placed debt securities, or the issuance of equity instruments. Contractual obligations and commercial commitmentsWe are obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements and lease agreements. The following table represents our contractual payment obligations as of April 1, 2012 and the estimated timing of future cash payments: Contractual Cash ObligationsTotal 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 ThereafterLong term debt$208.2 $0.5 $202.0 $0.2 $5.5 $ $Operating leases(1)147.4 28.2 22.7 18.5 13.6 9.8 54.6Cash contributions to qualified pension plans60.8 12.4 12.1 12.1 12.1 12.1 Interest on fixed rate debt23.0 10.5 8.0 1.8 1.7 1.0 Interest on variable rate debt(2)3.7 2.1 1.6 Total$443.1 $53.7 $246.4 $32.6 $32.9 $22.9 $54.6 (1)Operating lease obligations include $42.8 million attributable to operations held for sale.(2)Interest on variable rate debt is based on current prevailing interest rates.Our reserve for uncertain tax positions at April 1, 2012 was $12.9 million. Due to the uncertainties associated with settling these liabilities, we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these liabilities. As a result, our reserve for unrecognized tax benefits is excluded from the table above. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our reserve for uncertain tax positions.We also have benefit payments due under our non qualified pension and other post retirement benefit plans that are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Critical accounting policiesWe have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis where such policies affect reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other significant accounting policies, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report. Note that the preparation of this Annual Report requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.Revenue recognitionWe recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete. This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the contract or purchase order, ownership and risk of loss have passed to the customer, collectibility is reasonably assured, and pricing is fixed and determinable. In instances where title does not pass to the customer 32Table of Contentsupon shipment, we recognize revenue upon delivery or customer acceptance, depending on terms of the sales agreement. Service sales, representing maintenance and engineering activities, are recognized as services are performed. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in revenue.Valuation of inventoriesAll inventories are stated at the lower of their cost or market value, with the market value being determined based on sales in the ordinary course of business. Cost for inventories at a significant number of our operations is determined on a last in, first out (LIFO) basis. The average inventory cost method is utilized for most other inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based on the age, historical usage or assumptions about future demand for the inventory. We also regularly review inventory balances on a LIFO basis to ensure the balances are stated at the lower of cost or market as of the balance sheet date. For those inventories valued using LIFO, their carrying value may be higher or lower than current replacement costs for such inventory, since the LIFO costing assumption matches current costs with current sales, not with current inventory values. When the LIFO cost is greater than the current cost, there is an increased likelihood that our inventories could be subject to write downs to market value. While historical write downs have not been material, if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and reported operating results.Goodwill and acquired intangiblesFrom time to time, we acquire businesses in purchase transactions that typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets, which may affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges. The determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the consolidated financial statements.Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets related to our continuing operations are tested for impairment at a minimum each fiscal year at the end of the second month in the second quarter or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets exceeds their fair value. For fiscal 2012, our reporting units consisted of two operating segments within our Investment Cast Products reportable operating segment, two operating segments within our Forged Products reportable operating segment, as well as four reporting units in our Fastener Products reportable operating segment. PCC Aerostructures, which was acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2012, will be tested for goodwill impairment in fiscal 2013. The Fastener Products operating segment includes several aggregated component units (referred to as the Fastener Products reporting unit), PCC Aerostructures, and two other reporting units.Testing for goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations. Such models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions primarily based on future cash flows, expected market growth rates, our estimates of sales volumes, sales prices and related costs, and the discount rate applied, which reflects the weighted average cost of capital. Management uses the best available information at the time fair values of the reporting units are estimated; however, estimates could be materially impacted by factors such as changes in growth trends and specific industry conditions, with the potential for a corresponding adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements potentially resulting from an impairment of the goodwill. We also consider comparable transactions to estimate the fair value of the reporting units. The cash flow models used to determine fair value are most sensitive to the expected future cash flows and the discount rate for each reporting unit. The discount rate used in the cash flow models for the fiscal 2012 goodwill impairment analysis ranged from 9% to 15% depending on the reporting unit. The annual growth rate for earnings before interest and taxes varied by reporting unit and ranged from 3% to 11% over the initial five year forecast period. A sensitivity analysis determined that using terminal growth rates of 3%, 4% or 5% would not result in impairment in the fiscal 2012 goodwill impairment analysis. We performed a sensitivity analysis on both of these factors and determined that the forecast for future earnings before interest and taxes used in the cash flow model could decrease by 36% or the discount rate utilized could increase by 5%, and the goodwill of our reporting units would not be impaired. The reporting unit that would be most sensitive to worsening economic conditions has $78.9 million of goodwill recorded as of April 1, 2012.The impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets encompasses calculating the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, impairment is recorded. For fiscal 2012 and 2011, it was determined that the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets was greater than the carrying value.Environmental costsThe estimated future costs for known environmental remediation requirements are accrued on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of remediation costs can be reasonably estimated. When 33Table of Contentsonly a range of amounts is established, and no amount within the range is better than another, the minimum amount of the range is recorded. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when collection is probable. Adjustments to our accruals may be necessary to reflect new information as investigation and remediation efforts proceed. The amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period, but any amounts, and the possible range of any amounts in excess of those already accrued, are not reasonably estimable at this time. Total environmental liabilities accrued at April 1, 2012 and April 3, 2011 were $71.4 million and $66.8 million, respectively.Guidance on asset retirement and environmental obligations clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation and requires a liability to be recorded if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. Asset retirement obligations covered by this guidance include those for which an entity has a significant obligation to perform an asset retirement activity; however, the timing or method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may not be within the control of the entity. This guidance also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation.In accordance with the asset retirement and environmental obligations guidance, we record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liability can be reasonably estimated. Currently, we have identified known asset retirement obligations associated with environmental contamination at two of our manufacturing facilities. However, we have not recognized a liability under this guidance for these retirement obligations because the fair value of remediation at these sites cannot be reasonably estimated since the settlement date is unknown at this time. The settlement date is unknown because remediation of these sites is not required until production ceases, and we have no current plans to cease production. These asset retirement obligations, when estimable, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows or business.Income taxesProvisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pre tax earnings based on current tax law and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Tax benefits arising from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant tax authorities. The amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.Pension and other postretirement benefit plansWe sponsor many U.S. and non U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Our pension and postretirement benefit plans are accounted for in accordance with defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans accounting guidance. Plan assets have been valued at fair value in accordance with this guidance. Pension and postretirement expense and liability amounts are derived from several significant assumptions, including the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rate. For valuation of our pension liabilities, we derive a market based discount rate from yields on high quality, liquid fixed income securities at the end of our fiscal year. We use only highly rated bonds (AA/Aa or higher) to estimate the interest rate at which our pension benefits could be effectively settled. For our U.S. Plans, we used a discount rate assumption of 4.85% for the total benefit obligation of our pension plans at our April 1, 2012 measurement date. For our non U.S. Plans, we used a discount rate assumption of 5.27% for the total benefit obligation of our pension plans at our April 1, 2012 measurement date. In developing the long term rate of return on plan assets assumptions, we evaluate input from third party investment consultants and actuaries, review asset allocation and investment strategies, ranges of projected and historical returns, and inflation and economic assumptions. The expected return assumptions are derived from asset allocations within the Companys target asset allocation ranges consistent with our diversified investment approach. As the assumed rate of return on plan assets is a long term assumption, it is not anticipated to be as volatile as the discount rate, which is a point in time measurement. For our U.S. Plans, we used a long term rate of return assumption of 8.0% to calculate the 2012 and 2011 net periodic pension cost. For our non U.S. Plans, we used a long term rate of return assumption of 7.5% to calculate the 2012 and 2011 net periodic pension cost. For fiscal 2012, our U.S. net periodic pension expense was $25.7 million and non U.S. net periodic pension income was $3.5 million. We estimate that for fiscal 2013, our U.S. net periodic pension expense will be approximately $51.2 million and non U.S. net periodic pension expense will be approximately $3.0 million. The increase in estimated expense is 34Table of Contentsprimarily due to a reduction in the discount rates used in determining the net periodic pension cost and amortization of actuarial losses. Absent increases in interest rates, higher asset values and or higher contributions, net periodic pension cost will increase further in future years. Our U.S. net postretirement benefit cost was $5.5 million for fiscal 2012, and we estimate that for fiscal 2013, our U.S. net postretirement benefit cost will be $6.4 million.The table below quantifies the approximate impact, as of April 1, 2012, of a one quarter percentage point decrease in our assumptions for discount rate and expected return on assets, holding other assumptions constant. 0.25 PercentagePoint DecreaseIncrease in annual costs: Discount rate$6.9Expected long term rate of return$4.2Increase in projected benefit obligation: Discount rate$71.8 The approximate impact, as of April 1, 2012, of a one percentage point increase in our assumption for the health care cost trend rate, holding other assumptions constant, on our total service and interest cost components and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation is not significant.Recently issued accounting standardsIn December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance increasing disclosures regarding offsetting assets and liabilities. For derivatives and financial assets and liabilities, the amendments require disclosure of gross asset and liability amounts, amounts offset on the balance sheet, and amounts subject to the offsetting requirements but not offset on the balance sheet. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and is to be applied retrospectively. As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures, the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance that requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or two separate but consecutive statements. This guidance does not change the items that must be reported in OCI. In December 2011, the FASB deferred some aspects of the June guidance that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments. The FASB is considering whether to present the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and is to be applied retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating how it will report comprehensive income, but either method permitted will constitute a change in the Companys financial statement presentation. In September 2011, the FASB issued guidance to aid in an entitys assessment of goodwill and whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Under this guidance, an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The amendments include a number of events and circumstances for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment. This pronouncement will be effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. As this guidance only modifies the requirements of impairment testing, the adoption will not impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In September 2011, the FASB also issued guidance that increases the quantitative and qualitative disclosures an employer is required to provide about its participation in significant multiemployer plans that offer pension or other postretirement benefits. The objective of this guidance is to enhance the transparency of disclosures about the significant multiemployer plans in which an employer participates, the level of the employers participation in those plans, the financial health of the plans, and the nature of the employers commitments to the plans. This pronouncement has been adopted and disclosure is included within Note 18Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans. As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures, the adoption did not impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In May 2011, the FASB issued guidance that amends existing measurement guidance and expands disclosure requirements for fair value measurements, particularly for "Level 3" (as defined in the accounting guidance) inputs. This guidance was effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.35Table of ContentsIn January 2010, the FASB issued guidance that requires certain disclosures and clarifies existing disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. Specifically, the changes require disclosure of transfers into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 (as defined in the accounting guidance) fair value measurements, and also require more detailed disclosure about the activity within Level 3 fair value measurements. This guidance was effective for the Company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, except for disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements of Level 3 assets and liabilities, which was effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures, the adoption did not impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.In October 2009, the FASB issued amendments to the accounting and disclosure for revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements. These amendments modify the criteria for recognizing revenue and require enhanced disclosures for multiple element deliverable revenue arrangements. This guidance was effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK At various times, we use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and prices of strategic raw materials. Because derivative instruments are used solely as hedges and not for speculative trading purposes, fluctuations in the market values of such derivative instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the underlying economic exposures that the instruments are intended to hedge. For further discussion of derivative financial instruments, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.Interest Rate RiskWe have variable rate debt obligations that expose us to interest rate risk. If market interest rates had averaged 10 percent higher than actual levels in fiscal 2012 or 2011, the effect on our interest expense and net income would not have been material.Foreign Currency RiskThe majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars; however, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies for transactions denominated in other currencies. As discussed in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, we had foreign currency hedges in place at April 1, 2012 and April 3, 2011 to reduce such exposure. The estimated loss in fair value on foreign currency hedges outstanding as of April 1, 2012, from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in exchange rates, would not have been material.Material Cost RiskWe have entered into long term supply agreements to fix the purchase price of certain strategic raw materials as of April 1, 2012 and April 3, 2011. In addition, we had escalation clauses related to raw material pricing in certain of our sales contracts at April 1, 2012 and April 3, 2011. If market rates had averaged 10 percent higher than actual levels in either fiscal 2012 or 2011, the effect on our cost of sales and net earnings, after considering the effects of these supply agreements and related sales contracts, would not have been material.36Table of Contents
