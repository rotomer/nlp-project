Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors that May Affect Future Operating Results, for a discussion of certain factors that could cause the Companys actual operating results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements. General In June 2004, the Company changed its corporate name from Patterson Dental Company to Patterson Companies, Inc. (Patterson or the Company). Patterson retained its existing Nasdaq stock symbol. The new corporate name was adopted to reflect Pattersons expanding base of business, which now encompasses the veterinary and rehabilitation supply markets, as well as its traditional base of operations in the dental supply market. Pattersons operating units include Patterson Dental, Webster Veterinary and Patterson Medical, formerly known as AbilityOne Corporation. Patterson is a value added distributor serving three major markets: North American dental supply; U.S. companion pet (dogs, cats and other common household pets) and equine veterinary supply; and the worldwide rehabilitation and non wheelchair assistive products supply market. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to Patterson or the Company include its subsidiaries: Direct Dental Supply Co., Patterson Dental Canada Inc., Patterson Dental Supply, Inc., Webster Veterinary Supply, Inc., PDC Funding Company, LLC, Patterson Technology Center, Inc., Colwell Systems, Inc, Webster Management LP, AbilityOne Products Corp., Patterson Medical Products, Inc., Sammons Preston Canada, Inc., AM FAB, Inc., Tumble Forms, Inc., Midland Manufacturing Company, Inc., J.A. Preston Corporation, Milburn Distributions, Inc., AbilityOne Homecraft Limited, AbilityOne Limited, AbilityOne Kinetec S. A. and AOC Vertriebs GmbH. Patterson began distributing dental supplies in 1877. The modern history of the business dates to May 1985, when the Companys management and certain investors purchased the Company from a subsidiary of The Beatrice Companies, Inc. Patterson became a publicly traded company in October 1992. The Company is a corporation organized under the laws of Minnesota. The Company historically reported under one operating segment, dental supply. In July 2001, the Company purchased the veterinary supply assets of J. A. Webster, Inc., which became a reportable business segment. Then in September 2003, the Company acquired AbilityOne Products Corp., creating a third business that serves the rehabilitation supply market. The Companys three reportable segments, dental supply, veterinary supply and rehabilitation supply, are strategic business units that offer similar products and services to different customer bases. Each business is a market leader with a strong competitive position, serves a fragmented market that offers consolidation opportunities and offers relatively low cost consumable supplies, making the Companys value added business proposition highly attractive to customers. Dental Supply Overview As Pattersons largest business, Patterson Dental is one of the two largest distributors of dental products in North America. The business has operations in the United States and Canada. Patterson Dental, a full service, value added supplier to dentists, dental laboratories, institutions, and other healthcare professionals, provides: consumable products (including x ray film, restorative materials, hand instruments and sterilization products); basic and advanced technology dental equipment; practice management and clinical software; patient education systems; and office forms and stationery. Patterson Dental offers its customers a broad selection of dental products including more than 90,000 stock keeping units (SKUs) of which approximately 4,000 are private label products sold under the Patterson name. Patterson Dental also offers customers a full range of related services including dental equipment installation, maintenance and repair, dental office design and equipment financing. Patterson Dental markets its dental products and services through approximately 1,425 direct sales representatives, 348 of whom are equipment specialists. 2 Table of Contents Patterson Dental has over 125 years of experience providing quality service to dental professionals. Net sales of this segment have increased from $165.8 million in fiscal 1986 to over $1.8 billion in fiscal 2005, operating margins have increased every year since fiscal 1985 and profitability has increased from an operating loss in fiscal 1986 to operating income of $235.4 million in fiscal 2005. Patterson estimates the dental supply market it serves to be approximately $5.6 billion annually and that its share of this market is approximately 32%. The underlying structure of the dental supply market consists of a sizeable geographically dispersed number of fragmented dental practices and is attractive for the Companys role as a value added, full service distributor. According to the American Dental Association, there are over 156,000 dentists practicing in the United States in approximately 135,000 dental practices. In Canada, there are approximately 18,000 licensed dentists according to the Canadian Dental Association. The average general practitioner generated approximately $550,000 in annual revenue in 2002, while the average specialty practitioner produced about $780,000. The Company believes that a dentist uses between 5% and 7% of annual revenue to purchase consumable supplies used in the daily operations of the practice. This translates into between $27,500 and $38,500 of supplies being purchased by the average practice each year. The Company believes the average dental practitioner purchases about 40% of their supplies from their top supplier. Total expenditures for dental services in the United States increased from $31 billion in 1990 to $79 billion in 2004. Domestic dental care expenditures are projected by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to grow 6% annually, reaching $116 billion by the year 2010. The Company believes that the demand for dental services, equipment and supplies will continue to be influenced by the following factors: Demographics. The U.S. population grew from 235 million in 1980 to 294 million in 2004, and is expected to reach 309 million by 2010. The median age of the population is also increasing and Patterson believes that older dental patients spend more on a per capita basis for dental services. Dental products and techniques. Technological developments in dental products have contributed to advances in dental techniques and procedures, including cosmetic dentistry and dental implants. Demand for certain dental procedures. Demand is growing for preventive dentistry and specialty services such as periodontic (the treatment of gums), endodontic (root canals), orthodontic (braces), and other dental procedures that enable patients to keep their natural teeth longer and improve their appearance. Increased dental office productivity. The number of dentists per 100,000 persons in the U.S. is forecasted to decline over the next two decades. As a result, the number of patients per dental practice is expected to grow. For this reason dentists are showing increased willingness to invest in dental equipment and office infrastructure that can strengthen the productivity of their practices. Demand for infection control products. Greater public awareness as well as regulations and guidelines instituted by OSHA, the American Dental Association and state regulatory authorities have resulted in increased use of infection control (asepsis) products such as protective clothing, gloves, facemasks, and sterilization equipment to prevent the spread of communicable diseases such as AIDS, hepatitis and herpes. Coverage by dental plans. An increasing number of dental services are being funded by private dental insurance. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services statistics on expenditures for dental services in the United States indicate that private dental insurance paid approximately 50% of the $79 billion in total expenditures for 2004. Strategy Pattersons objective is to remain a leading national distributor of supplies, equipment and related services in the market while continuing to improve its profitability and enhance its value to customers. To achieve this objective, Patterson has adopted a strategy of emphasizing its value added, full service capabilities, using technology to enhance customer service, continuing to improve operating efficiencies, and growing through internal expansion and acquisitions. Emphasizing Value Added, Full Service Capabilities. The Company believes that its customers value full service and responsive delivery of quality supplies and equipment, in addition to competitive prices. Customers also increasingly expect suppliers to be knowledgeable about products and services, and generally a superior sales representative can create a special relationship with the practitioner by providing an informational link to the overall industry. The Companys knowledgeable sales representatives assist customers in the selection and purchase of supplies. In addition, the high quality sales force allows Patterson to offer broader product lines. Most dentists are independent, sole practitioners who are unable to store and manage large volumes of supplies in their offices. Patterson 3 Table of Contents meets its customers requirements by delivering frequent, small quantity orders rapidly and reliably from its strategically located distribution centers. Equipment specialists, technology representatives, and service technicians also support the Companys value added strategy in the dental supply market. Equipment specialists offer consultation on office design, equipment requirements and financing. Technology representatives provide guidance on integrating technology solutions including practice management and clinical software, digital radiography, custom hardware and networking into the dental practice. The Companys experienced service technicians perform equipment installation, maintenance and repair services including services on products not purchased through Patterson. Using Technology to Enhance Customer Service. As part of its commitment to providing superior customer service, the Company offers its customers easy order placement. The Company has offered electronic ordering capability to its dental supply segment since 1987 when it first introduced Remote Order Entry (REMOSM). The Company believes that its computerized order entry systems help to establish relationships with new customers and increase loyalty among existing customers. The remote order entry systems permit customers to place orders from their offices directly to Patterson 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Over the years, the Company has continued to introduce new order entry systems designed to meet the varying needs of its customers. Today the Company offers four systems to the dental supply segment, eMAGINE&reg;, REMOSM, PDXpress&reg; and www.pattersoncompanies.com. Customers, as well as the Companys sales force, use these systems. Over the years, the number of orders transmitted electronically has grown steadily to approximately 57% of Pattersons consumable dental product volume or $570 million in fiscal year 2005. In fiscal 2002, the Company introduced its newest order entry system, eMAGINE&reg;. eMAGINE&reg; has become the standard platform for the sales representative and includes many new features and upgrades including: up to three years of order history for the customers reference, faster searches for products and reports, order tracking, instant information on monthly product specials, descriptions and photographs of popular products and an electronic custom catalog, including a printable version with scannable bar codes. For those dental customers not using eMAGINE&reg;, the Company offers two alternative order entry products. REMOSM gives customers direct and immediate ordering access through a personal computer to a database containing Pattersons complete inventory. PDXpress&reg; is a handheld order entry system that eliminates handwritten order forms by permitting a user to scan a product bar code from an inventory tag system or from Pattersons bar coded catalog. These systems, including eMAGINE&reg;, are provided at no additional charge to customers who maintain certain minimum purchase requirements. The goal of the Companys Internet strategy is to distribute information and service related products over the Internet to enhance customers practices and to increase sales force productivity. The Companys Internet environment includes order entry, access to Patterson Today articles and manufacturers product information. Additionally, Patterson utilizes a tool, InfoSource, to provide real time customer and Company information to the Companys sales force, managers and vendors via the Internet. In addition to enhancing customer service, by offering electronic order entry systems to its customers, the Company enables its sales representatives to spend more time with existing customers and to call on additional customers. The Companys propriety practice management and clinical software, EagleSoft&reg;, is developed and maintained by the Patterson Technology Center, which the Company believes is unique among dental distribution companies. Software and digital radiography customers also have access to the support capabilities of the Patterson Technology Center. In addition to troubleshooting problems through its customer call center, the Patterson Technology Center designs and configures local area networks and assembles custom hardware. The Patterson Technology Center also develops and supports the Companys order entry systems. Continuing to Improve Operating Efficiencies. Patterson continues to implement programs designed to improve operating efficiencies and allow for continued sales growth over time. These programs include a wide variety of initiatives from investing in management information systems to consolidating distribution centers. Recent initiatives include upgrading the Companys communications architecture, developing and implementing a new technical service system, and implementation of the shared services concept. The Company has improved operating efficiencies by converting its communications architecture to faster, higher capacity data lines that combine voice and data transmissions while reducing overall communication costs. In fiscal 2005, the Company implemented a new equipment proposal system for its sales representatives. The system has the look and feel of the Companys eMAGINE&reg; product and automates the equipment proposal and ordering process. Additionally, the Company has made substantial progress in the development and implementation of a new field service management tool for its technical service operations. This new tool will allow the Company to fundamentally change its technical service business processes, improving the Companys ability to coordinate the actions of its service technicians and enhancing customer service while reducing the overall cost of operations. As a result of these and other efforts, the Company expects to continue to improve its operating leverage and efficiencies going forward. 4 Table of Contents An integral part of Companys shared services concept is the consolidation and leveraging of distribution centers between the segments of the Company. The execution of this strategy is expected to take several years and is in the early stages. In fiscal 2005, the Company accomplished significant goals that included opening the first new shared distribution facility and currently has five locations that stock and ship products of multiple segments. Growing Through Internal Expansion and Acquisitions. The Company intends to continue to grow by opening additional sales offices, hiring established sales representatives, hiring and training college graduates as territory sales representatives, and acquiring other distributors in order to enter new markets and expand its customer base. The Company believes that it is well positioned to take advantage of expected continued consolidation in the dental distribution market. Over the past 18 years the Company has made a number of acquisitions, including the following: Dental distribution acquisitions in the United States In August 1987, Patterson acquired the D.L. Saslow Co., which at the time was the third largest distributor of dental products in the United States. Between 1989 and 2005, Patterson acquired certain assets of 25 smaller dental dealers throughout the United States. During fiscal 2002, the Company acquired Thompson Dental Company of Columbia, SC, a leading value added distributor of dental supplies, equipment and services in the mid Atlantic and southeastern U.S. Thompson ranked among the 10 largest dental distributors in the country. Dental distribution acquisitions in Canada In October 1993, Patterson Dental completed the acquisition of Healthco International, Inc.s Canadian subsidiary, Healthco Canada, Inc. In August 1997, the Company acquired Canadian Dental Supply Ltd., which expanded the Companys market share in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario. In July 2002, the Company acquired Distribution Quebec Dentaire, Inc., augmenting the Companys market share in Quebec. As a combined operation known as Patterson Dental Canada Inc., this subsidiary, which the Company believes is one of the two largest full service dental products distributors in Canada, employs approximately 495 people, 130 of whom are sales representatives. Printed office products acquisitions In October 1996, Patterson acquired the Colwell Systems division of Deluxe Corporation. Colwell Systems, also known as Patterson Office Supplies, produces and sells a variety of printed office products used in medical, dental and veterinary offices. Software acquisitions In July 1997, Patterson Dental acquired EagleSoft, Inc., a developer and marketer of Windows&reg; based practice management and clinical software for dental offices. EagleSoft, now known as the Patterson Technology Center, is located in Effingham, Illinois. In September 2000, the Company acquired eCheck up.com, a web based, value added service that complements and expands the Companys current product offerings to the front office of the dental practice. eCheck up.com is an Internet service that provides on line practice performance and benchmarking services to subscribing dental customers through its website. In December 2001, the Company purchased Modern Practice Technologies, a company that provides custom computing solutions to the dental industry. This acquisition helped Patterson to position itself to provide all of the custom hardware and networking required for interfacing the entire dental office. In May 2004, Patterson Dental acquired CAESY Education Systems, Inc., the leading provider of electronic patient education services to dental practices in North America. Headquartered in Vancouver, Washington, CAESY provides dental practices with a range of communications media that educate patients about professional dental care, procedures and treatment alternatives with the goal of influencing patient decisions about dental services and increasing the productivity of the dental professional. Educational materials are communicated through recordable CD/DVD media, computer programs and the dentists web site. These materials can be used within the dental waiting room, at chair side and in the patients home. 5 Table of Contents Products and Services The following table sets forth the sales by principal categories of products and services offered to dental supply customers: 2005 2004 2003 Consumable and printed products 54 % 57 % 59 % Equipment and software 37 34 32 Other (1) 9 9 9 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) Consists of other value added products and services including technical service and software maintenance. Consumable and Printed Products Dental Supplies. Patterson offers a broad product line of consumable dental supplies such as x ray film and solutions; impression materials; restorative materials (composites and alloys); hand instruments; sterilization products; anesthetics; infection control products such as protective clothing, gloves and facemasks; paper, cotton and other disposable products; toothbrushes and a full line of dental accessories including instruments, burs, and diamonds. Patterson markets its own private label line of dental supplies including anesthetics, instruments, preventive and restorative products, and cotton and paper products. Compared to most name brand supplies, the private label line provides lower prices for the Companys customers and higher margins for the Company. Printed Office Products. Patterson Dental provides a variety of printed office products, office filing supplies, and practice management systems to office based healthcare providers including dental, veterinary and medical offices. Products include custom printed products, insurance and billing forms, stationery, envelopes and business cards, labels, file folders, appointment books and other stock office supply products. Products are sold through two channels: The Companys dental and veterinary supply sales force Direct mail catalogs distributed to over 100,000 customers several times a year A staff of telemarketing personnel located in Champaign, Illinois supports both channels. Orders are received by telephone, through the mail or electronically from the dental and veterinary distribution order processing system. Equipment and Software Dental Equipment. Patterson Dental is the largest supplier of dental equipment in the U.S. and Canada by a factor of more than two times when compared to its next largest competitor. It offers a wide range of dental equipment products including x ray machines, high and low speed handpieces, dental chairs, dental handpiece control units, diagnostic equipment, sterilizers, dental lights and compressors. The Company also distributes newer technology equipment that provides customers with the tools to improve productivity and patient satisfaction. Examples of such innovative and high productivity products include the CEREC&reg; family of products, a chair side restoration system; digital x rays; and inter oral cameras. Software. Patterson develops and markets its own line of practice management and clinical software for dental professionals. Products include software for scheduling, billing, charting and storage/retrieval of digital images. The Company also sells software products developed by third parties including Sidexis by Sirona, Dimax2 by Planmeca and VixWin by Gendex. These value added products are designed to help achieve office productivity improvements, which translates into higher profitability for the customer. Hardware. Patterson Dental offers custom hardware and networking solutions required for integrating the entire dental office. This product offering is available to all of the Companys dental customers. This initiative marked another step in Pattersons overall strategy of providing customers with the convenience and cost effectiveness of a virtually complete range of products and value added services and is one of the newest components of Pattersons single source solution for dental offices. 6 Table of Contents Patient Education Services. With the acquisition of CAESY Education Systems, Inc., Patterson Dental expanded its offering of value added services to include patient education services. These communications tools are designed to influence patient decisions about services in an efficient, cost effective manner. Other Software Services. The Company offers a variety of services to complement its software products such as service agreements, electronic claims processing and billing statement processing. These services provide value to customers by allowing them to keep products current, or receive payments more rapidly while obtaining greater productivity. Equipment Installation, Repair and Maintenance. To keep their practices running efficiently, dentists require reliable performance from their equipment. All major equipment sold by Patterson includes installation and Pattersons 90 day labor warranty at no additional charge. Patterson also provides complete repair and maintenance services for all dental equipment, whether or not purchased from Patterson, including 24 hour handpiece repair service. In addition to service technicians who provide installation and repair services on basic dental equipment, the Company has also invested in personnel who specialize in installing and troubleshooting issues with technology solutions such as practice management software, digital imaging products, hardware and networking. The goal of this group, which is comprised of both local service technicians and the Patterson Technology Center, is to help customers integrate newer technology into their dental practice. The Patterson Technology Center helps the customer minimize costly downtime by offering a single point of contact for post sale technology related issues. A new technical service tool is being developed and implemented that will both enhance customer service as well as reduce costs of the Companys traditional and technology specific service personnel. Dental Office Design. Patterson provides dental office layout and design services through the use of a computer aided design (CAD) program. Equipment specialists can create original or revised dental office designs in a fraction of the time required to produce conventional drawings. Customers purchasing major equipment items receive dental office design services at no additional charge. Equipment Financing. Patterson Dental provides a variety of options to fulfill its customers financing needs. For qualified purchasers of equipment, the Company will arrange financing for the customer through Patterson or a third party. For non equipment related needs, customers are referred to a third party organization. This alternative allows the Company to offer its customers convenience while still meeting their diverse financing needs. In fiscal 2005, the Company originated over $316.7 million of equipment finance contracts. The Company, or its vendor partner, financed approximately 42% of the equipment purchased by customers during fiscal 2005. Since November 1998, Patterson has also maintained one or more finance referral agreements with an outside finance company to provide a more extensive selection of finance opportunities to its customers. This might include financing for practice transactions, working capital, leasing, real estate and long term capital. Currently this service is provided by HPSC Inc. There are no recourse provisions under this agreement. Patterson receives referral fees under this agreement and HPSC Inc. extends credit and services the accounts. To meet the needs of its customers, Patterson also initiates installment sale contracts that can be sold to either a commercial paper conduit managed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., or to a group of banks led by U.S. Bank National Association. Patterson created a special purpose entity (SPE), PDC Funding Company, LLC, a wholly owned and fully consolidated subsidiary, and entered into a Receivables Purchase Agreement in order to participate in the commercial paper conduit. The Company transfers installment sale contracts to the SPE. In turn, the SPE sells the contracts to the commercial paper conduit. The limit under this agreement, as amended, is $400 million of contract purchases. There is no recourse to the Company for contracts purchased by the commercial paper conduit, but there is a holdback equal to 10% of the contracts. The group of banks, led by U.S. Bank, can also purchase the Companys installment sale contracts that are secured by dental equipment, on a limited recourse basis. The contract purchase agreement with the banks allows for a maximum capacity of $100 million. Patterson services the customer contracts under both of the preceding arrangements for which it receives a fee. 7 Table of Contents Sales and Marketing During fiscal 2005, Patterson Dental sold products or services to over 116,000 customers in the U.S. and Canada who made one or more purchases during the year. Patterson Dentals customers include dentists, laboratories, institutions and other healthcare professionals. No single customer accounted for more than 1% of sales during fiscal 2005, and Patterson is not dependent on any single customer or geographic group of customers. The Companys sales and marketing efforts are designed to establish and improve customer relationships through personal interaction with its sales representatives and frequent direct marketing contact, which underscores the Companys value added approach. A primary component of Pattersons value added approach is its sales force. Due to the fragmented nature of the dental supply market, Patterson believes that a large sales force is necessary to reach potential customers and to provide full service. Sales representatives provide an informational link to the overall industry; assist practitioners in selecting and purchasing products and help customers efficiently manage their supply inventories. Each representative works within an assigned sales territory under the supervision of a location (branch) manager. Sales representatives are all Patterson employees and are generally compensated on a commission basis, with some, less experienced, representatives receiving a base salary and commission. To assist its sales representatives, Patterson Dental publishes a variety of catalogs and fliers containing product and service information. Dental customers receive a full line product catalog containing over 30,000 inventoried items. The catalog includes pictures of products, detailed descriptions and specifications of products and is utilized by practitioners as a reference source. Selected consumable supplies, new products, specially priced items and high demand items such as infection control products are promoted through merchandise fliers printed and distributed bimonthly to the dental supply market. In addition, dental equipment sold by Patterson is featured in Pattersons tri yearly publication, Patterson Today, which also includes articles on dental office design, trends in dental practice, products and services offered by Patterson and information on equipment maintenance. To enhance the total value it brings to its customers, Patterson Dental created a value added benefit program for its preferred customers. The Patterson PlusSM program entitles its best dental customers to priority technical services, automated supply management systems at no charge, a variety of product discounts and reduced rates on financial products, practice management software and technical services. Distribution Patterson Dental believes that responsive delivery of quality supplies and equipment is a key element to providing complete customer satisfaction. Patterson ships dental consumable supplies from 10 strategically located distribution centers in the U.S. and Canada. Orders for consumable dental supplies can be placed by telephone or electronically 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Printed office products are shipped from the Companys manufacturing facility in Illinois. All orders are routed through Pattersons centralized computer ordering, shipping and inventory management systems, which are linked to each of the Companys strategically located distribution centers. If an item is not available in the distribution center nearest to the customer, the computer system automatically directs shipment of the item from another center. Rapid and accurate order fulfillment is another principal component of the Companys value added approach. Patterson Dental estimates that 98% of its consumable goods orders are shipped to the customer on time, which is generally within 24 hours. In order to assure the availability of Patterson Dentals broad product lines for prompt delivery to customers, Patterson must maintain sufficient inventories at its distribution centers. Purchasing of consumables and standard equipment is centralized and the purchasing department uses a real time perpetual inventory system to manage inventory levels. The Companys inventory consists mostly of consumable supply items. By utilizing its computerized inventory management and ordering systems, the Company is able to accurately predict inventory turns in order to minimize inventory levels for each item. Patterson Dentals 96 dental sales offices are generally configured with display areas where the latest dental equipment can be demonstrated. Dental equipment inventory is generally custom ordered and is staged at the Companys sales offices before delivery to dental offices for installation. 8 Table of Contents To maximize the operating efficiencies and streamline its cost structure, the Company has begun to implement a strategy to leverage its distribution center infrastructure and business systems. In fiscal 2005, the Company opened its first new shared facility in South Carolina, which stocks both dental and veterinary supply inventory and allowed for the closing of a previously existing stand alone veterinary distribution center in nearby Charlotte, North Carolina. Additionally, three historically dental only distribution centers began stocking high volume rehabilitation supply products during the past year. Further consolidation and leveraging of our distribution centers are expected to continue over the next several years, including a shared distribution center in the Seattle, Washington area that began to stock both dental and veterinary supply products in early fiscal 2006. Sources of Supply Effective purchasing is a key strategy the Company has adopted in order to achieve its objective of continuing to improve profitability. The Company has a program to effectuate electronic data interchange (EDI) with its major vendor partners. In fiscal 2005, the Company processed 69% of its dental vendor invoices using EDI capabilities. In addition, 53% of Pattersons dental purchase order volume was conducted employing EDI, which represented 66% of dental purchase order dollars placed during the fiscal year. Utilizing EDI allows the Company to improve efficiencies and reduce administrative costs. Patterson Dental obtains products from approximately 1,100 vendors in the dental segment. Patterson has exclusive distribution agreements with several quality dental equipment manufacturers including Sirona Dental Systems GmbH for the CEREC&reg;, and Schick Technologies, Inc. for digital x rays. The Company is the only national dealer for A dec equipment, including chairs, units and cabinetry. A dec is the largest manufacturer of dental equipment in the U.S. While the Company makes purchases from many suppliers and there is generally more than one source of supply for most of the categories of products sold by the Company, the concentration of business with key suppliers is considerable. The Companys top ten supply vendors accounted for approximately 52% and 51% of the cost of dental products sold in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. Of these ten, the top two vendors accounted for 12% and 11%, respectively, of fiscal 2005 cost of sales, while one vendor accounted for 11% of the total in fiscal 2004. Competition The highly competitive U.S. dental products distribution industry consists principally of national, regional and local full service distributors and mail order distributors. The dental supply market is extremely fragmented. In addition to Patterson and one other national, full service firm, Sullivan Schein Dental, a unit of Henry Schein, Inc., there are at least 19 full service distributors that operate on a regional level, and hundreds of small local distributors. Also, some manufacturers sell directly to end users. The Company approaches its markets by emphasizing and delivering a value added model to the practitioner. To differentiate itself from its competition it deploys a strategy of premium customer service, a highly qualified and motivated sales force, experienced service technicians, an extensive breadth and mix of products and services, accurate and timely delivery of product, strategic location of sales offices and distribution centers, and competitive pricing. The Company also experiences competition in Canada in the dental supply market. The principal competitor is a national, full service dental distributor, Henry Schein Ash Arcona, a unit of Henry Schein, Inc. The Company believes it competes in Canada on essentially the same basis as in the United States. Veterinary Supply Overview Webster Veterinary, or Webster, is the leading distributor of veterinary supplies to companion pet (dogs, cats and other common household pets) veterinary clinics in the eastern United States. Management believes Webster is the second largest distributor of companion pet veterinary supplies nationally. In addition, through its fiscal 2005 acquisition of Milburn Distributions, Inc., Webster is the leading national equine distributor in the United States. Webster provides products used for the diagnosis, treatment and or prevention of diseases in companion pets and equine animals. Founded in 1946 and headquartered in Sterling, Massachusetts, Webster has developed a strong brand identity as a value added, full service distributor of a virtually complete range of consumable supplies, equipment, diagnostic supplies, biologicals (vaccines) and pharmaceuticals. Webster does not distribute pet foods. Websters product offering, totaling more than 10,000 items, is sold by approximately 136 field sales representatives. In addition to its core business of distributing veterinary products, Webster has a significant agency commission business with a few large 9 Table of Contents pharmaceutical manufacturers. Under the agency relationships, Webster typically earns a commission for soliciting orders through its sales force. In the agency relationship, Webster processes the order to the manufacturer but handles none of the product nor does Webster bill and collect from the customer. The agency commissions that Webster earns range from 3% to 10%, a portion of which is shared with the direct sales personnel. Websters agency commissions accounted for approximately 2% of its net sales in fiscal 2005. Net sales by Webster in fiscal 2005 were $292.0 million. Operating income totaled $15.0 million. The Company estimates the market for pharmaceuticals and supplies sold to companion pet and equine veterinarians through distribution is approximately $2.6 billion on an annual basis. Based upon the estimated $2.6 billion market, the Company believes its share of this market is approximately 12% after annualizing the impact of the Milburn acquisition. Similar to the dental supply market, the veterinary supply market is fragmented and geographically diverse. There are approximately 65,000 veterinarians practicing at 24,000 animal health clinics. The vast majority, approximately 73% of veterinarians, work in private animal health clinics specializing in small animals, predominately companion pets. The average private veterinary practice generates approximately $770,000 of annual revenue. These practices purchase between $80,000 and $120,000 of supplies each year, and similar to the dental practitioner, do not maintain a large supply of inventory on hand. The typical veterinary practice purchases approximately 80% of its supplies from its top two suppliers. The average purchase of consumables by the veterinary practice is noticeably higher than that of the dental practitioner due predominately to pharmaceutical products which are administered and dispensed by veterinarians. According to a market study prepared by KPMG LLP for three veterinary professional organizations in 1999, the demand for veterinary services has historically grown significantly faster than growth in the overall economy. Total expenditures for veterinary services in the United States grew at an inflation adjusted real annual rate of 7.2% from 1980 through 1997, and are projected to grow 5% on a real basis annually, through the year 2015. The companion pet segment is the fastest growing area of the overall U.S. veterinary supply market. The Company believes this growth is sustainable due to the following favorable factors: Number of households with companion pets. The number of households with companion pets is steadily expanding which increases the demand for veterinary services. Today, 63% of U.S. households own a companion pet compared with 56% in 1988. Overall, 45% of all households in the U.S. own more than one type of pet. Veterinary expenditures per household. The amount companion pet owners are willing to spend caring for their pets is increasing substantially. The American Pet Products Manufacturers Association estimates that pet owners will spend $35.9 billion in 2005 to care for the American pet population, or $520 per household. This is more than a 100% increase over the $17 billion spent in 1994. Veterinary products and techniques. Many new therapeutic and preventive products are being developed for the companion pet market. Technological developments have resulted in new innovative veterinary products and advances in veterinary services. Strategy Websters objective is to build a leading national position in the companion pet veterinary market through internal expansion and acquisitions, while continuing to improve its profitability and enhance its value to customers. Its key strategies and priorities for accomplishing this are to open new geographic markets, make acquisitions that expand market share, emphasize value added capabilities, consistently improve operating efficiencies and broaden the product offering. Growing Through Internal Expansion and Acquisitions. In April 2004, Webster acquired the assets of ProVet, which was the companion pet veterinary supply division of Lextron, Inc. ProVet was a distributor with locations in Indianapolis, Kansas City, Houston, Denver and Seattle. Management believes this acquisition made Webster the second largest distributor of companion pet veterinary supplies in the U.S. This acquisition added 44 sales representative territories expanding Websters geographic coverage to include the states of Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Colorado, Nevada, Idaho and Oregon. In addition, the acquisition increased market coverage in Washington state and Texas where Webster already had a presence. In October 2004, Webster acquired Milburn Distributions, Inc., the largest distributor specializing in the U.S. equine veterinary supply market. Milburns annualized sales exceed $50 million. The company operates facilities in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Texas and Florida. Most companion pet and large animal veterinary supply distributors have not successfully served the nations equine veterinarians due to the highly specialized nature of this niche market. Milburn has capitalized on this opportunity by focusing exclusively on the unique needs of equine veterinarians. Emphasizing Value Added, Full Service Capabilities. Webster believes that veterinary customers value full service and responsive delivery of product, in addition to competitive prices. Customers also increasingly expect suppliers to be knowledgeable about 10 Table of Contents products and services, and generally a superior sales representative can create a special relationship with the practitioner by providing an informational link to the overall industry. Websters knowledgeable sales representatives assist customers in the selection and purchasing of supplies. Most veterinarians are independent, sole practitioners who are unable to store and manage large volumes of supplies in their offices. Webster meets its customers requirements by delivering frequent, small quantity orders rapidly and reliably from its strategically located distribution centers. Continuing to Improve Operating Efficiencies. Webster continuously pursues opportunities to lower costs and improve efficiencies. This is being done through the sharing of distribution capacity with all three business segments and the integration of new and proven systems that improve service levels and can be shared with multiple business segments. A new corporate level officer position was created in early fiscal 2005 in order to identify, implement and manage shared services strategies across all business segments. This process started when the Company created a veterinary version of the eMAGINE&reg; electronic order entry system and began to distribute veterinary products from its Kent, Washington dental distribution center. This strategy continues to be executed, as additional distribution centers are being integrated, are currently under construction, or are being planned, which include capacity for distributing dental as well as veterinary and rehabilitation products. In addition, a new customer system that can be used by multiple business segments but will maintain the same look and feel of the eMAGINE&reg; system was implemented initially in the veterinary supply segment and is now fully deployed. The new system provides customer support staff with integrated customer information on one screen and is being utilized by the veterinary segment. Broaden the Product Line. Webster continuously seeks to broaden its portfolio of product offerings to maximize the opportunities within its existing customer base. For example, in fiscal 2005 Websters expansion of its product offerings included the entire line of Pfizer Animal Health equine products, Rimadyl&reg; canine analgesic, Vetsulin canine insulin, Continuum small animal vaccines, equine anti inflammatory Surpass&reg;, feline nutraceutical Enisyl F and canine nutraceutical Welactin. Webster also strives to consistently introduce innovative products. In fiscal 2005, Webster successfully launched its private label initiative to supply veterinary customers with quality consumable goods (exam gloves, sutures, surgical blades and microscope slides) at value prices. This initiative will continue in fiscal 2006 with the introduction of various white goods such as gauze, elastic bandages, and porous tape. Management believes that product innovation allows Webster to maintain its competitive position and helps fuel internal growth. Management also believes that its emphasis on new product offerings enables its sales force to remain effective in creating demand among veterinarians. Products and Services The following table sets forth the sales by principal categories of products and services offered to veterinary supply customers: 2005 2004 2003 Consumable and printed products 94 % 94 % 94 % Equipment 4 4 4 Other 2 2 2 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % Consumable and Printed Products Webster offers its customers a broad selection of veterinary supply products including consumable supplies, pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, and biologicals. Consumable supplies distributed by Webster include lab supplies, various types and sizes of paper goods, needles and syringes, gauze and wound dressings, sutures, latex gloves, orthopedic and casting products. Websters pharmaceutical products include anesthetics, antibiotics, injectibles, ointments and nutraceuticals. The diagnostics product category includes on site testing products for heartworm, FIV, FELV and Parvo virus. Biological products are comprised of vaccines and injectibles. Many of the office supply products sold to the dental supply market are also offered to the veterinary supply market. Equipment Equipment sold by Webster generally consists of machines for hospital, laboratory and general surgical use within the veterinary practice. Equipment sales accounted for about 4% of veterinary segment sales in fiscal 2005. Webster offers innovative, quality equipment that differentiates Webster from the competition. New equipment offerings in fiscal 2005 included Scan X Veterinary Digital Imaging 11 Table of Contents System, Radiograph Digital Converter, Canis Major Wet Dental/Treatment Lift Table and Fixed Exam Lift Table, Suburban Surgical Companys quality cages, runs, tables and treatment centers and Ultrasource ultrasound. About 50% of veterinary equipment orders are drop shipped directly to the customer, of which 15% are custom ordered from the manufacturer. The balance of veterinary equipment is distributed in a fashion similar to consumable supplies. Other Other products and services include commissions on agency sales, finance charges on customer accounts and freight recovery on shipments to customers. Sales and Marketing A primary component of Websters value added approach is its sales force. Due to the fragmented nature of the veterinary supply market, Webster believes that a large sales force is necessary to reach potential customers and to provide full service. Sales representatives provide an informational link to the overall industry, assist practitioners in selecting and purchasing products, and help customers efficiently manage their supply inventories. Each representative works within an assigned sales territory under the supervision of a location (branch) manager. Sales representatives are employees and are generally compensated on a commission basis, with some, less experienced, representatives receiving a base salary and commission. To assist its sales representatives, Webster publishes a catalog, which contains approximately 10,000 SKUs. This catalog includes detailed descriptions and specifications of products and is utilized by practitioners as a reference source. Selected consumable supplies, new products, specially priced items and high demand items are promoted through merchandise fliers printed and distributed monthly. During fiscal 2005, Webster released an updated version of its website. Based upon the proven technology of the Patterson Dental website, this new site allows customers the ability to order items twenty four hours a day, seven days a week. The website also incorporates value added functions that permit customers to check their invoice, payment and credit history, build a shopping list of frequently purchased items and track their order status. Distribution At April 30, 2005, the decentralized distribution network in the veterinary supply segment consisted of 15 distribution centers. The distribution network is complemented by telesales representatives who are responsible for processing approximately 70% of customer orders in this segment. In order to meet the rapid delivery requirements of customers, most consumable products are delivered within 24 hours. Webster estimates that approximately 98% of its consumable orders are delivered to the customer on time. During fiscal year 2005, Webster merged its existing Charlotte, NC distribution center into Pattersons new Blythewood, SC distribution facility. The strategy to share distribution facilities between multiple business segments will continue to be executed over a period of time. Sources of Supply Webster obtains products from nearly 500 vendors. While Webster makes purchases from many suppliers and there is generally more than one source of supply for most of the categories of products, the concentration of business with key suppliers is considerable. In fiscal 2005 and 2004, Websters top 10 veterinary supply manufacturers comprised 64% and 76%, respectively, and the single largest supplier comprised 19% and 22%, respectively, of the total cost of veterinary supply sales. Competition Within the companion pet market segment, competitors range from small local distributors to large national and regional full service companies, and to a lesser extent, mail order distributors or buying groups. Webster also competes directly with pharmaceutical companies who sell certain products directly to the customer. The Company approaches its markets by emphasizing and delivering a value added model to the practitioner. To differentiate itself from its competition it deploys a strategy of premium customer service, a highly qualified and motivated sales force, an extensive breadth and mix of products and services, accurate and timely delivery of product, strategic location of sales offices and competitive pricing. 12 Table of Contents Rehabilitation Supply Overview Patterson Medical, formerly known as AbilityOne Corporation, is headquartered in Bolingbrook, Illinois and is the worlds leading distributor of rehabilitation medical supplies and non wheelchair assistive products. Patterson Medical believes it offers the most comprehensive range of distributed and self manufactured rehabilitation products to health care professionals globally. Its mission is to provide health care professionals and their patients with access to products that improve peoples lives by helping them to attain their highest achievable level of independence, safety and comfort. Patterson Medical operates as Sammons Preston Rolyan in North America and Homecraft in International markets. Patterson Medical serves as the gateway through which over 30,000 rehabilitation products originating from more than 2,000 suppliers and manufacturers are sold to a diverse customer base with an emphasis on physical therapists (PTs) and occupational therapists (OTs). It offers its customers a one stop shop through what it believes to be the most comprehensive catalog in the industry, the largest direct sales force and the categorys most efficient customer service and distribution operations. Major channels of distribution are acute care hospitals, long term care facilities, rehabilitation clinics, dealers and schools. In addition, Patterson believes Patterson Medicals reputation, global market presence and highly transferable business model will facilitate entry into new markets. Patterson Medical offers a wide range of differentiated, non invasive products and expertise to users and their health care providers, while focusing on niches, worldwide, where its capabilities, reputation and customer partnerships can result in a competitive advantage. Its goal is to become its customers first choice for rehabilitation medical supplies and assistive products in each of its chosen markets. Patterson Medical is highly diversified with no single product, customer or purchasing group representing a significant percentage of total revenue. In addition, given the relatively small average and median order size (approximately $225 and $70, respectively), Patterson Medicals products often do not represent a major expense category for its customers. In March 2002, Patterson Medical completed the acquisition of the Smith & Nephew Rehabilitation (SNR) division of Smith & Nephew plc, and in doing so, acquired the Rolyan, Homecraft and Kinetec brand names. The SNR acquisition added 3,500 additional products, as well as a broad array of other brand names and proprietary products. The acquisition of SNR combined the two leading distributors of rehabilitation medical supplies to create what Patterson believes is the only one stop shop in the industry. Patterson Medical manufactures or has exclusively manufactured for it products representing approximately 30% of its total revenue and purchases products representing the remaining 70%. Approximately 80% of its revenue is in North America. Patterson Medical believes the rehabilitation medical supplies and assistive products industry is approximately $4.2 billion in the U.S. and $5.8 billion worldwide and is expected to grow 6% to 8% over the next several years. Industry growth is driven by strong growth in the physical and occupational therapy markets and favorable demographic trends associated with the aging of the baby boom generation. Patterson Medical does not compete in wheelchairs, a market estimated to be approximately $1.0 billion in the U.S. ($1.4 billion worldwide). Therefore, Patterson Medicals addressable market (defined as the collective market for products sold by Patterson Medical) is approximately $3.2 billion in the U.S. and $4.4 billion worldwide. Patterson Medical believes that it has an industry leading market share of approximately 5% in a highly fragmented rehabilitation and assistive products market. Patterson Medical believes that the demand for rehabilitation products will continue to be influenced by the following factors: Favorable Demographics. Favorable demographic trends such as extended life expectancy, active lifestyles and a general willingness to spend discretionary income on health care and well being, are expected to contribute to increased demand for products distributed by Patterson Medical. Specifically, the aging baby boomer population, together with their increased disposable income and desire for independence, will fuel product purchases to assist with the frailties associated with old age and provide sustained sales growth. The U.S. Census Bureau has projected the 85 and older population in the U.S. to more than triple from four million in 2000 to 14 million by 2040. The 65 to 84 year old population is expected to more than double during the same time period. Current trends indicate that these age groups represent the majority of home and community based health care patients. The aging of the population is a revenue growth driver because approximately 10% of people over the age of 65 and approximately 50% of people over the age of 85 need assistance with everyday activities. Patterson Medical believes it is well 13 Table of Contents positioned to benefit from this trend by providing aids to daily living, namely dressing devices; toileting, dining, bathing aids; and grooming devices, all of which promote greater patient independence, improved patient responsibility and improved responsiveness to treatment. Increasing Number of PTs and OTs, Patterson Medicals Primary User Groups. According to the U.S. Department of Labor Occupational Outlook Handbook, there were approximately 132,000 PTs and 78,000 OTs in the U.S. in 2000. Approximately two thirds of PTs were employed in either hospitals or offices of physical therapists. The remaining one third of PTs was employed in home health agencies, outpatient rehabilitation clinics, physician offices and nursing homes. The majority of OTs work in hospitals, including many in rehabilitation and psychiatric hospitals. The remaining OTs work in outpatient occupational therapy offices and clinics, schools, home health agencies, nursing homes, community mental health centers, adult day care programs, job training services and residential care facilities. The demand for PTs and OTs is expected to remain strong largely driven by the (i) increase in the number of individuals with disabilities or limited function requiring therapy services; (ii) rapidly growing elderly population which is particularly vulnerable to chronic and debilitating conditions that require therapeutic services; (iii) baby boom generation which is entering the prime age for heart attacks and strokes, increasing the demand for cardiac and physical rehabilitation; (iv) advances in medical technology which permit treatment of more disabling conditions; and (v) widespread interest in health promotion. Increasing Frequency of Reconstructive and Implant Surgery. Another important driver of the growth in the PT market is the growing need for rehabilitation products resulting from the increasing frequency of reconstructive implant procedures, including hip and knee replacements. The worldwide reconstructive implant market is currently in excess of $5.0 billion and expected to grow between 7% and 8% annually. This growth trajectory is largely driven by favorable demographics, as patient populations are expanding at both ends of the age spectrum. Among seniors, more active lifestyles and longer life expectancies are responsible for the increasing frequency of reconstructive implants. Younger patients are opting for reconstructive implants over less invasive alternatives due to improved and longer lasting implant technology. Patterson Medical believes it is well positioned to benefit from the growth in reconstructive implants, by providing orthopedic products, namely Continuous Passive Motion machines and splinting, which are critical to post operatory rehabilitation. International Operations Patterson Medicals international operations are based in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and made up of two divisions: Homecraft in the U.K. and Kinetec in France. The international operations broadly reflect the same business model as used in the North American market. In the U.K., Homecraft operations include sales and marketing, customer service, distribution, purchasing and administration. In France, Kinetec is a self contained manufacturing unit with limited sales and marketing, distribution, administration and purchasing. Homecraft is a leading supplier of aids to daily living (ADL) and rehabilitation products in the U.K., and a significant player in the international markets. Having developed and designed many proprietary products, Homecraft is the prime source for numerous established and market leading ADL brands, including products sold under the Sammons Preston Rolyan brand. The Homecraft catalog offers a broad line of ADL, therapy, rehabilitation and pediatric products containing over 10,000 items. Their catalog is circulated to PTs, OTs, loan equipment stores and private clinics, trade outlets and the general public. Homecrafts central sales and marketing strategy is to provide a one stop shop proposition to hospitals, local government and trade customers throughout the U.K. Customers are reached through a combination of mail order, a 13 person sales force, telemarketing and in market promotional and exhibition activity. Kinetec consists of two operations, the manufacturing and distribution of Continuous Passive Motions machines (CPMs) on a worldwide basis and the sale and distribution of Sammons Preston Rolyan and Homecraft products in France. Products are marketed to customers through product brochures, mailings, tele marketing and a 6 person sales force that covers the French rehabilitation market. Strategy Patterson Medicals objective is to be the customers first choice for rehabilitation medical supplies and non wheelchair assistive products in each of its chosen markets. It intends to grow through internal expansion and acquisitions in both rehabilitation and related products. 14 Table of Contents Emphasizing Value Added, Full Service Capabilities. Patterson Medical currently offers its customers a one stop shop for products through its industry leading catalog with over 20,000 items, focused primarily on physical and occupational therapy products. Patterson Medical adds new products each year to its ever expanding catalog and is committed to doing so long term. Consistent with Patterson Medicals current product offering, some of these new products are branded, exclusive or self manufactured. Patterson Medical recognizes that different customer groups have very different economic, product, distribution channel requirements and treatment goals. Patterson Medical proactively attempts to anticipate and flexibly respond to the diverse needs of its customers, while focusing on niches, worldwide, where its capabilities, reputation and customer partnerships can result in a competitive advantage. As such, Patterson Medical foresees an on going evolution of its product offerings to meet the ever increasing demands of its diverse customer segments. Continuing to Improve Operating Efficiencies. Patterson Medicals existing infrastructure is scaleable without significant investment requirements for the next few years. This allows Patterson Medical to enjoy bottom line growth in excess of top line metrics. Additionally, Patterson Medicals proprietary products, which consist of self manufactured products, products manufactured for Patterson Medical and products sold through exclusive distribution arrangements, represent approximately 30% of total revenues. These items help to provide Patterson Medical with a comprehensive range of rehabilitation medical supplies. Patterson Medical believes that its performance culture, oriented toward continuous improvement and best practices, will contribute to the achievement of greater productivity and operating income gains. Growing Through Internal Expansion and Acquisitions. Patterson Medical believes it is well positioned to continue to expand in its core markets. Patterson Medicals market presence, clinical understanding and close customer relationships allow Patterson Medical to anticipate and flexibly respond to the diverse needs of its customers. Patterson Medical believes its market knowledge, strong vendor relationships and manufacturing capabilities will continue to drive the delivery of value added solutions through the continual enrichment of its product mix. Additionally, Patterson Medical believes its broad portfolio of national accounts and commitment to expand its sales force will enhance Patterson Medicals growth and penetration within its current and new customer base. In connection with the SNR transaction, Patterson Medical acquired Homecraft. Patterson Medical is leveraging this platform to accelerate international expansion, in terms of both product lines and geographic regions. Since the SNR transaction, Patterson Medical has added over 550 pages of new products to the Homecraft catalog. Homecraft and Kinetec brought with them a proven capability to source products at very favorable costs and at high levels of quality from China, which has resulted in meaningful cost savings. Patterson Medicals management team believes its business model is transferable to other countries, and is using Homecraft to cultivate new relationships through an enhanced product array, sales effort, distribution capabilities and catalog expertise. In May 2004, Patterson Medical acquired the assets of Medco Supply Company, Inc., or Medco, from NCH Corporation. With sales of approximately $40 million, Medco is one of the nations leading sports medicine distributors and is based in Buffalo, New York. It sells first aid, safety and medical consumable products, as well as consumable supplies and equipment to podiatrists. The complete product offering includes approximately 10,000 SKUs that are sold through direct mail catalogs and 15 territory sales people. Medco markets to athletic trainers, schools and school nurses, daycare providers and healthcare professionals including podiatrists, chiropractors and physical therapists. Patterson Medical operates in the highly fragmented rehabilitation medical supplies and non wheelchair assistive products industry. Patterson Medicals competition is generally either locally or regionally focused. Patterson Medical intends to opportunistically pursue expansion opportunities in order to add products, customers and capabilities, which will further differentiate Patterson Medical from its competition. Patterson Medical plans to penetrate several new markets. Target markets with significant core business product overlap include chiropractic, podiatry, sports medicine and institutional activities and crafts. These markets are similar to Patterson Medicals core business in that they are characterized by large patient volumes and heavy reliance on the course of treatment advice of the respective professional. Products and Services The following table sets forth the sales by principal categories offered to rehabilitation supply customers: 2005 2004 Consumable and printed products 85 % 81 % Equipment 11 15 Other 4 4 Total 100 % 100 % 15 Table of Contents Consumable and Printed Products Patterson Medical offers a large selection of supply products that can be categorized as follows: Aids to Daily Living dressing devices, toileting, dining, bathing aids and grooming devices Orthopedic Soft Goods / Splints braces, splints and orthonics for protecting, supporting and positioning Clinical product that assists in the examination and treatment of patients, such as exercise bands, putty, weights balls and mats Mobility walkers, canes and wheelchair accessories such as gloves, trays and carrying bags Pediatric Seating and Positioning rolls, wedges, specialty seating and standers and mobility assistance products for special needs children. This category also includes sensory motor stimulation products such as toys, crafts and devices to assist with balance.

These products include parallel bars, treatment tables, mat platforms, treadmills, stationary bicycles and CPMs. Sales and Marketing Its customers generally know Patterson Medical as Sammons Preston Rolyan in the U.S. and Canada, and Homecraft in the remainder of the world. The Sammons Preston Rolyan and Homecraft business models, which Patterson Medical employs in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., have successfully driven revenue growth and profitability. A core element of Sammons Preston Rolyans strategy is to maintain the most comprehensive single catalog of rehabilitation products and supplies. The catalogs, published for over 50 years, are considered the gold standard of the industry and feature the most comprehensive product offering with longstanding industry leading positions and recognized brand names. Patterson Medical has an experienced sales force, national account contracts with major customer groups, unmatched customer service within the industry and proven ability to introduce new products each year, allowing Patterson Medical to compete across the entire spectrum of the rehabilitation medical supplies and non wheelchair assistive products industry. Sammons Preston Rolyans national accounts group works closely with its sales force to meet the changing needs of its expanding account base. The product management group works closely with customers, suppliers and the sales force to evaluate new products for inclusion in Sammons Preston Rolyans product offering. Sammons Preston Rolyan adds approximately 2,500 new products to the catalog each year. Sammons Preston Rolyans U.S. national accounts program is staffed by seasoned professionals who have developed a comprehensive portfolio of contracts. Furthermore, the integrated Sammons Preston Rolyan organization has national contracts with major purchasing groups within each submarket, including hospitals, nursing homes and dealers. For many years, Sammons Preston and SNR had the only national sales forces in the U.S. dedicated to the clinical education and sale of products to institutionally based PTs and OTs. With the recent integration of SNR, Patterson Medicals clinical presence and sales capability have been enhanced with a broader product offering and a more complete range of proprietary brands. The Patterson Medical sales professionals, many whom are therapists, are located throughout the U.S. and Canada. These sales professionals have utilized the extensive product line and the comprehensive national contracts portfolio to establish direct sales to U.S. hospitals, nursing homes and rehab clinics. Patterson Medical also distributes to national distributors and local dealers. 16 Table of Contents The rehabilitation medical supplies and non wheelchair assistive products that Patterson Medical offers are generally not subject to reimbursement pressures from Medicare and Medicaid. Patterson Medical does not engage in third party billing and collection activities, but sells to customers, including dealers, who provide this service. The rehabilitation medical supplies and non wheelchair assistive products industry is highly fragmented. No one manufacturer, distributor or customer represents a significant portion of Patterson Medicals revenue. Distribution Patterson Medicals distribution process centers on its ability to fill small unit size and small dollar amount orders. In the U.S., over 5,000 packages ship daily from six locations. The primary distribution center is located in Bolingbrook, IL, with certain high volume product also fulfilled from multi segment facilities within the Patterson distribution network. Approximately 95% of the packages in the U.S. ship via UPS. Patterson Medicals call center operates from 7am 7pm Monday through Friday, processing in excess of 4,000 calls per day. Order entry capability from 7pm 7am from Monday through Friday and weekends exists through an offsite, third party contractor with limited systems access. The combination of in house staff, supplemented with contracted, third party services, provide customers with 24 hours a day, seven days a week ordering capabilities. In addition, fax orders and EDI capabilities support the larger, more technologically advanced customers, including dealers, hospital and long term care facilities. While Internet ordering capabilities currently exist, customer reception to ordering products via the Internet is currently minimal, but growing. Sources of Supply Among Patterson Medicals core strengths is its ability to obtain premier products from vendors. Patterson Medical purchases its products from over 2,000 suppliers and manufacturers. Although no single supplier accounted for more than 4% of Patterson Medicals total purchases in fiscal 2005, Patterson Medical frequently is the largest single customer of these manufacturers. Suppliers view the ability to distribute their products through Sammons Preston Rolyan and Homecraft positively due to reputation, longstanding industry leading position, comprehensive catalogs, national account contracts, sales force presence and distribution capabilities. Patterson Medical continually works at strengthening its supplier relationships through the introduction of supplier programs. Competition Patterson Medical believes it is the only national player to offer, one stop shopping to its customers. Patterson Medicals competition is generally highly fragmented, locally or regionally focused and without the product offering necessary to be a one stop shop. Patterson Medicals national (and recently acquired international) scale and purchasing power provide Patterson Medical with a favorable cost position and strong pricing trends relative to its competition.

Trademarks Patterson has registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office the marks Patterson&reg;, PDXpress&reg;, EagleSoft&reg; and eMAGINE&reg;. With the addition of AbilityOne, the Company acquired the marks Sammons, Preston, Roylan, Homecraft and numerous other tradenames and trademarks. The Company believes that the Patterson mark is well recognized in the dental products industry and by dental professionals, and is therefore a valuable asset of the Company. 17 Table of Contents Employees As of April 30, 2005, the Company had approximately 5,950 employees.

The Company believes its properties are in good operating condition and are suitable for the purposes for which they are being used. Dental Supply Patterson Dental has 10 dental distribution centers as well as a location used to ship printed office products. Distribution facilities are located in California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington and Quebec and Alberta, Canada. Patterson Dental owns approximately 70%, or 345,000 square feet, of its total distribution space and the balance is 19 Table of Contents leased. The dental supply segment is headquartered in the Companys principal executive offices. This segment also maintains sales and administrative offices inside the United States at 89 locations in over 40 states and at 11 locations in Canada. Substantially all of these locations are leased. Patterson Dental has one owned manufacturing facility used to produce printed office products. Veterinary Supply Headquartered in Sterling, Massachusetts, the veterinary supply segment has 15 veterinary distribution centers totaling over 300,000 square feet. Sales and administrative personnel for the veterinary segment reside with the distribution facilities. Facilities are located in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Florida, Texas, North Carolina, Alabama, Missouri, Colorado, Washington, Kentucky, Arizona and Indiana. Additionally, product is now shipping from two distribution facilities within the Patterson shared services distribution network. Rehabilitation Supply Patterson Medical is headquartered in Bolingbrook, Illinois, and owns or leases approximately 360,000 square feet, or 11 facilities, worldwide. Approximately 45% of the total facility space is dedicated to distribution, 40% is allocated to manufacturing and the balance is for sales and administrative offices. The Company owns about 40% of the total space utilized. Domestically, the rehabilitation supply segment maintains facilities in Illinois, Wisconsin, South Carolina, New York and Michigan. Internationally, this segment has four facilities located in Britain, France and Canada. Additionally, high volume product is stocked and shipped from three distribution centers that are shared with the dental supply segment. These shared distribution centers are located in California, Florida and Texas. Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS There are no material legal proceedings pending against the Company. The Company has been involved in various product related and employment related legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Some of these proceedings involve product liability claims arising out of the use of dental products manufactured by third parties and distributed by the Company. The Company believes that if any such product liability cases were determined in favor of the claimants, the manufacturers of such products would have primary responsibility for any damages because Patterson is a distributor of finished goods manufactured by third parties. In the event a manufacturer of a defective product is unable to pay a judgment for which the Company may be jointly liable, the Company could have liability for the entire judgment. Since May 1985, the Company has maintained product liability insurance coverage for any potential liability for claims arising out of products sold by the Company. The Company believes that any liabilities which might result from claims relating to events occurring after May 1985, would be adequately covered by such insurance and that any unfavorable results in such cases would not have a material adverse effect on the Companys business or financial condition. With respect to claims relating to events occurring prior to May 1985, the agreement providing for the acquisition of Patterson from The Beatrice Companies, Inc. provides that Beatrice and its successors are obligated to indemnify the Company for losses exceeding a litigation reserve established at the time of the acquisition. To date, the successor to Beatrice has not been asked to indemnify the Company regarding any matters. Although the Company has insurance coverage for product liability claims relating to events occurring after May 1985 and may be entitled to indemnification from third parties under certain circumstances, any additional litigation could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business or financial condition in the future.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview The Companys fiscal 2005 financial information is summarized in this Managements Discussion and Analysis, the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the related Notes. The following background is essential to more fully understand the Companys financial information. Patterson operates a distribution business in three complementary markets: dental supply, veterinary supply and rehabilitation supply. Historically the Companys strategy for growth focused on internal growth and the acquisition of smaller distributors and businesses offering related products and services to the dental market. In fiscal 2002, the Company expanded its strategy to take advantage of a parallel growth opportunity in the veterinary supply market by acquiring the assets of J. A. Webster, Inc. The Company added a third component to its business platform in fiscal 2004 when it entered the rehabilitation supply market with the acquisition of AbilityOne Products Corp. (AbilityOne) on September 12, 2003. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for more on this transaction. AbilityOne is now known as Patterson Medical Products, Inc. (Patterson Medical). The historical operating performance of the veterinary supply and rehabilitation supply businesses are somewhat different than the dental supply business. Gross margin percentages in the veterinary business are typically in the low to mid 20s compared to the mid 30s for dental. The operating expense rate is also lower in the veterinary business than in the dental business. Gross margin percentages in the rehabilitation business are in the low to mid 40s while operating expense in relation to sales, including the amortization of intangibles, is higher than dental. There are several important aspects of the Companys business, including: (1) market growth in the various markets it operates; (2) internal growth; (3) growth through acquisition; and (4) continued focus on controlling costs and enhancing efficiency. Management defines 22 Table of Contents internal growth as the increase in net sales from period to period, excluding the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, and the net sales, for a period of twelve months following the transaction date, of businesses that it has acquired. With these factors in mind, management has established certain operating objectives, which include increasing net sales four percentage points faster than the average market growth rate and improving operating margins by 50 basis points annually. The Company did not anticipate achieving its objective related to operating margins in fiscal 2005 because of the substantial amounts of intangible asset amortization from recent acquisitions, including Patterson Medical, and absorbing the costs of the acquisitions throughout the year. The Company does anticipate achieving its objective of a 50 basis point improvement in operating margins in fiscal 2006. The Company made significant progress toward its objective of driving long term, sustainable improvements in sales, profitability and cash flow in fiscal 2005. Net sales in 2005 increased 23.0% from the prior year, including internal growth of 12.1%. There was an estimated impact of 1.7% to fiscal 2005 sales due to an extra, or fifty third week (the Company uses a fifty two, fifty three week convention ending on the last Saturday in April). Also included in the increase in net sales for the year ended April 30 is a favorable foreign currency translation impact of 0.5%, with the remaining sales increase predominately attributed to acquisitions. The Company also achieved a 20 basis point improvement in its operating margin and increased net income by 22.9%. Results for fiscal year 2003 include the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets resulting in the cessation of goodwill amortization. Additional information regarding the adoption of SFAS No. 142 is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. That information is incorporated by reference into this section of this report. Results of Operations The following table summarizes the consolidated results of operations over the past three fiscal years as a percent of sales: 2005 2004 2003 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 64.4 % 64.3 % 65.3 % Gross margin 35.6 % 35.7 % 34.7 % Operating expenses 23.1 % 23.4 % 23.9 % Operating income 12.5 % 12.3 % 10.8 % Interest expense 0.6 % 0.4 % Other income, net 0.2 % 0.3 % 0.4 % Income before taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change 12.1 % 12.2 % 11.2 % Income taxes 4.5 % 4.6 % 4.2 % Income before cumulative effect of accounting change 7.6 % 7.6 % 7.0 % Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 Net Sales. Net sales for the year ended April 30, 2005 totaled $2,421.5 million, a 23.0% increase from $1,969.3 million reported for the previous year. Fiscal 2005 included an extra, or fifty third week as compared to fiscal 2004, which included fifty two weeks. The Companys fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of April each year. The estimated impact of the extra week contributed 1.7% of the fiscal 2005 sales growth. Sales of our largest business unit, dental supply, increased 13.5%. Excluding the impact of the extra week, foreign currency exchange translation related to our Canadian operations, and the acquisition of CAESY, sales grew 11.5% in fiscal 2005. Sales of dental consumable supplies experienced strong growth of 8.9%. After the estimated impact of the extra week, consumables sales rose approximately 7%, which is on the high end of our estimated market growth of 5% to 7%. Sales of equipment and related software within this business unit continued to be a principal sales growth driver, improving by 21.5%. While sales growth was seen across various equipment categories, demand for new technology equipment was particularly robust, with sales of the CEREC&reg; 3D dental restorative system up 39% for the year, while sales of digital radiography systems, including related software and hardware, rose 31%. Sales of other services and products, consisting primarily of parts, technical service, software support and insurance e claims, grew 11.1%. 23 Table of Contents The increase in veterinary supply sales of 38.5% included contributions from the acquisitions of ProVet in late fiscal 2004 and Milburn in October 2004, as well as the impact of an extra week. Two other unique factors affected the comparability of sales between fiscal years 2005 and 2004. First, ProHeart 6, an injectable heartworm medication, was voluntarily recalled by its manufacturer in September 2004. This recall resulted in lost revenues of approximately $6 million in fiscal 2005. Second, a temporary pharmaceutical distribution agreement was in place during fiscal 2004 until the third quarter, at which time the agreement was converted to an agency arrangement, resulting in lower sales. This agency arrangement remained the same for the balance of fiscal 2004 and for all of fiscal 2005. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions, extra week, ProHeart 6 recall and distribution agreement conversion, net sales increased 7.8% in the veterinary supply business. The September 2003 acquisition of Patterson Medical resulted in the creation of the rehabilitation supply business unit which contributed sales of $142.3 million in fiscal 2004. With a full year of operations, as well as the acquisition of Medco, revenues more than doubled to $295.3 million in fiscal 2005. On a pro forma basis, as if the acquisition of Patterson Medical was effective at the beginning of fiscal 2004, and excluding the estimated impact of the extra week, foreign currency translation related to foreign operations, and the Medco acquisition, sales grew by 8.7%. Gross Margin. Gross margin declined 10 basis points in fiscal 2005 to 35.6%. The Company did experience a sequential improvement each quarter after the first in fiscal 2005, including a 50 basis point improvement between the third and fourth quarter. In fiscal 2005, dental supply gross margins increased 20 basis points reflecting favorable product mix, including the newly acquired CAESY product offerings. Gross margin decreases in the other business units offset the improvement in the dental unit. There are continuing pricing pressures within the veterinary supply market that are affecting margins. Additionally, the recent acquisitions of ProVet and Milburn carry lower gross margin than the traditional Webster business. Patterson Medicals gross margin decline is attributable largely to a shift in product mix. Operating Expenses. The consolidated operating expense ratio decreased to 23.1%, down 30 basis points from 23.4% a year ago. The dental ratio improved 40 basis points, reflecting operating leverage on additional sales. The veterinary segment experienced an increase in its operating expense ratio of 1.2 percentage points, as the recent acquisitions, which had higher costs structures than the traditional Webster business, have been assimilated into the segments existing structure. Patterson Medicals operating expense ratio increased 40 basis points. Contributing to the increase in the expense ratio were additional catalog costs, including costs related to the Medco business acquired in May 2004, and additional amortization expense. Consolidated amortization expense in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 was $12.2 million and $7.2 million, respectively. The $5 million increase was due primarily to amortization on certain intangible assets related to the acquisition of Patterson Medical, some of which are being amortized on an accelerated basis due to their nature. Also, a non compete agreement of approximately $0.7 million was written off in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. The Company anticipates depreciation and amortization expense will decrease by $3 to $4 million in fiscal 2006. Operating Income. Operating income increased 24.6% and improved 20 basis points as a percent of sales. A full year of operations from Patterson Medical and improved operating leverage in the dental segment were the primary drivers of the operating margin improvement. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased from $9.6 million to $15.1 million as a result of the mid fiscal 2004 debt financing related to the acquisition of Patterson Medical. The Company paid down substantial amounts of debt during the year. However much of this debt could not be paid until late in the year based on terms of the agreements. Thus, fiscal 2005 interest expense was not significantly affected by the debt retirements. Other Income, net. Other income, net of other expenses, was consistent year over year. Composed primarily of finance interest income in both years, net other income was $6.5 million for fiscal 2005 compared to $6.6 million for fiscal 2004. 24 Table of Contents Income Taxes. The effective income tax rate in fiscal 2005 was 37.4%, a slight decrease from 37.6% in fiscal 2004. The decrease was due to the addition of the foreign operations of Patterson Medical, particularly in the U.K.. The U.K. operations caused the estimated annual effective tax rate to decline since the rates in the U.K. were less than in the United States during the year. Earnings Per Share. Earnings per share increased to $1.32, up $0.24 or 22% from the $1.08 earnings per share reported in fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003 Net Sales. Net sales for the year ended April 24, 2004 totaled $1,969.3 million, an 18.9% increase from $1,657.0 million reported for the previous year. Sales in the dental supply market increased 9.9%. Sales of dental equipment continued to be a principal sales growth driver for the dental supply segment, increasing 17.9% paced by robust demand for such new technology products as the CEREC&reg; 3D dental restorative system and digital radiography. Consumable supplies grew 5.3% due primarily to contributions from an expanded sales force and an increased focus on marketing efforts in this area. Sales of other services and products, consisting primarily of parts, technical service, software support and insurance e claims, grew 10.8%. Canadian dental sales increased 15.8% in fiscal 2004, 1.1% excluding currency gains. Sales of the Webster Veterinary Supply unit increased 13.4% for the year to $210.7 million. Webster sales include the impact of a temporary pharmaceutical distribution agreement that was in place last year but was converted back into an agency arrangement in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, as well as the April 16, 2004 acquisition of ProVet, a companion pet veterinary distributor. On a comparable basis, excluding the revenues from the change in the distribution agreement and the ProVet acquisition, sales in this segment increased 9.1% in fiscal 2004. Rehabilitation supply sales stemming from the Patterson Medical acquisition amounted to $142.3 million. On a pro forma basis, sales increased about 6.0%. Gross Margins. Gross margins increased a full percentage point in fiscal 2004 to 35.7% due primarily to the impact of the Patterson Medical acquisition, which has margins in the mid to low 40s. Dental supply gross margins increased 50 basis points reflecting favorable product mix along with some pricing improvement. Product mix benefited from sales of the higher margin CEREC 3D dental restorative system as well as digital radiography and related software. Offsetting the higher margins discussed above was a decline in veterinary supply margins due to sales under the temporary pharmaceutical distribution agreement, which carried a much lower margin than historical levels for most of the fiscal year. Operating Expenses. Fiscal 2004 included seven and one half months of results from Patterson Medical. Excluding the impact of this acquisition, operating expenses increased 7.3% from prior year levels but declined to 23.2% as a percent of sales, or 70 basis points. This resulted from improved operating leverage in both the dental and veterinary supply segments. The dental segment gained leverage on the operating expense line despite substantial investments in the sales organization, the new technical service system and other corporate objectives. As a percent of sales, the veterinary segment showed a 1.3 percentage point improvement in expenses year over year. Operating expenses as a percent of sales for Patterson Medical were approximately two percentage points higher than the remainder of the business due to the amortization of certain intangible assets resulting from the accounting for the acquisition. Operating Income. Operating income increased 35.5% and improved 150 basis points as a percent of sales. The acquisition of Patterson Medical, increased sales of higher margin dental equipment and improved operating leverage accounted for most of the increase. 25 Table of Contents Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $9.6 million as a result of debt put in place to finance the acquisition of Patterson Medical, including the write off of $1.3 million of origination fees on the bridge loan used to close the acquisition, which was retired during the period. Other Income, net. Other income, net of expenses, was $6.6 million for fiscal 2004 compared to $7.5 million for fiscal 2003. This reduction occurred in finance income and was caused by a decrease in invested funds, due to the use of cash on hand to partially fund the acquisition of Patterson Medical, and lower interest rates on investments. Income Taxes. The effective income tax rate in fiscal 2004 was 37.6%, unchanged from the prior year. While the Company had more foreign income, the tax rate in the foreign jurisdictions did not have a substantial impact on the overall tax rate. Earnings Per Share. Earnings per share increased to $1.08, up $0.23 or 27% from the $0.85 reported in fiscal 2003. Patterson Medical contributed approximately $0.08 per share in fiscal 2004. Liquidity and Capital Resources Pattersons operating cash flow has been the Companys principal source of liquidity in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, supplemented in fiscal 2004 by the issuance of $500 million of debt. Cash generated from operating activities was invested in working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. Operating activities generated cash of $207.3 million in fiscal 2005 compared with $197.7 million in fiscal 2004 and $86.7 million in fiscal 2003. Cash flow from operations was diminished in fiscal 2003 by an increase in the level of equipment finance contracts the Company carried. Under the terms of an agreement with a commercial paper conduit in fiscal 2003, the Company was required to receive one payment from the customer before a contract was eligible for sale to the commercial paper conduit. This requirement in conjunction with increased equipment sales resulted in an increase in the level of accounts receivable in fiscal 2003. This requirement was removed in fiscal 2004. Capital expenditures net of dispositions were $31.5, $19.6 and $11.4 million in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in 2005 reflected spending for a new distribution center that became fully operational in March 2005, the expansion of informational systems and a new building for the printed office products division. The Company expects to invest approximately $25 to 30 million in capital expenditures during fiscal 2006. Uses of these funds include the replacement and upgrading of the distribution capacity in the U.S. and the U.K. and the expansion of information systems. In fiscal 2005, the Company used $72.9 million of cash for acquisitions, including Medco, CAESY and Milburn. In fiscal 2004, the Company used $606.4 million of cash for acquisitions, namely Patterson Medical and ProVet. The acquisition of Patterson Medical was initially debt financed through a $500 million bridge loan. In November 2003, the bridge loan was converted into two permanent debt financing arrangements as more fully described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company did not repurchase any of its common stock in fiscal 2005 or fiscal 2004, but did repurchase 321,299 shares of its common stock for $13.1 million during fiscal 2003. The Company had $245.9 million of cash and short term investments as of April 30, 2005. On June 30, 2005, the Company paid a $100 million exclusivity fee under an agreement that extended an existing relationship with a manufacturer for an additional 10 years. The exclusivity fee will be amortized over the period of the agreement. Management continues to expect funds generated from operations and existing cash and short term investments to be sufficient to meet the Companys working capital needs for the next fiscal year. The Company will continue to obtain liquidity from the sale of its equipment finance contracts. In fiscal 2005, the Company paid down the full $50 million balance outstanding on a revolving credit facility that existed at the end of fiscal 2004. An amount of $200 million is available to the Company under this revolving credit facility until fiscal 2009. Additionally, in April 2005, the Company made a prepayment of $100 million on its floating rate debt and an additional $5 million payment over and above the scheduled amortization on its term loan. Scheduled quarterly amortization on the term loan for the year totaled $20 million. 26 Table of Contents The Companys short term and long term facilities are believed to be adequate as a supplement to internally generated cash flows to fund anticipated expansion plans and strategic initiatives. Future debt prepayments will depend on managements views with respect to interest rates together with the investment needs of the business at the time. The Company sells a significant portion of its installment sale contracts to a commercial paper funded conduit managed by a third party bank, and as a result, commercial paper is indirectly an important source of liquidity for the Company. The Company is allowed to participate in the conduit due to its financial strength. Cash flow could be impaired if the Companys financial strength diminished to a level that precluded the Company from taking part in this facility or other similar facilities. The Companys financing business is described in further detail in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations During fiscal 2004, the Company entered into two new debt financing arrangements, including both bank and private debt with a total capacity of $650 million. The bank portion of the package totals $300 million and is comprised of a $100 million five year, amortizing term loan and a $200 million five year, revolving credit facility. The private debt is a total of $350 million of fixed and floating rate notes with maturities ranging from 3 to 7 years with one year, no call provisions. The Company had two primary objectives in placing this debt: one, to lower its overall cost of capital, and two, to provide significant flexibility in financing the growth of the business. Approximately $200 million of capacity under the bank arrangement remains for future use. A summary of the Companys contractual obligations as of April 30, 2005 follows (in thousands): Payment due by year Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Long Term Debt $ 321,557 $ 20,027 $ 161,530 $ 140,000 Operating Leases 45,619 11,618 17,384 12,439 4,178 Additionally, the Company has a firm purchase commitment of approximately $10 million related to the construction of a new facility in the U.K. The Company anticipates making this expenditure during fiscal 2006. For a more complete description of our contractual obligations, please see Notes 7 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Outlook Over the last ten years, the Company has been able to average double digit revenue and earnings growth through its strategy of emphasizing its value added, full service capabilities, using technology to enhance customer service, continuing to improve operating efficiencies, and growing through internal expansion and acquisitions. The Companys growth strategy will continue to focus on these key elements. Maintaining financial flexibility is also a key component of the Companys future growth. With strong operating cash flow and available credit capacity, the Company is confident that it will be able to financially support its future growth. The strategic initiatives that the Company implemented during fiscal 2005, which have significantly strengthened the Companys operational platform, are also a key ingredient to continuing future growth. Given these factors, the Company considers itself well positioned to continue capitalizing upon the growth opportunities in the dental supply, companion pet veterinary supply and the worldwide rehabilition supply markets. The Company continues to believe that the sustainable, long term growth rate of its North American dental operation is four percentage points in excess of the markets 7% to 9% estimated rate of growth. The Company also believes its Webster and Patterson Medical units can continue to grow faster than the estimated 6% to 7% growth rate of the U.S. companion pet veterinary supply market and the estimated 6% to 8% growth rate of the rehabilition market. Asset Management The following table summarizes the Companys days sales outstanding (DSO) and inventory turnover over the past three fiscal years: 2005 2004 2003 Days sales outstanding 46 46 49 Inventory turnover (1) 7.9 8.2 7.3 (1) The inventory values used in this calculation are the LIFO inventory values for all distributed inventories except for Colwell and Patterson Medical manufactured inventories and all foreign inventories, which are valued using FIFO inventory value. 27 Table of Contents Foreign Operations Foreign sales are derived primarily from operations in Canada and from Patterson Medicals operations in the U.K. and France. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates have not significantly impacted earnings. However, net sales in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 were enhanced by changes in the exchange rate. Without foreign currency effects, net sales would have been $12.6 million, $19.4 million and $2.3 million lower in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Changes in currency exchange rates is a risk accompanying foreign operations, but this risk is not considered material with respect to the net operations of the Companys business. Critical Accounting Policies The Company has adopted various accounting policies to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Management believes that the Companys policies are conservative and its philosophy is to adopt accounting policies which minimize the risk of adverse events having a material impact on recorded assets and liabilities. However, the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments regarding the realization of assets and the settlements of liabilities based on the information available to management at the time. Changes subsequent to the preparation of the financial statements in economic, technological and competitive conditions may materially impact the recorded values of the Companys assets and liabilities. Therefore, the users of the financial statements should read all the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and be aware that conditions currently unknown to management may develop in the future. This may require a material adjustment to a recorded asset or liability to consistently apply the Companys significant accounting principles and policies that are discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The financial performance and condition of the Company may also be materially impacted by transactions and events that the Company has not previously experienced and for which the Company has not been required to establish an accounting policy or adopt a generally accepted accounting principle. Because we are primarily a distributor, we face inventory risk due to obsolescence and customer preference. We assess our inventories continually and value them at the lower of cost or market, and in addition, we relieve inventory cost using a last in, first out convention which results in an inventory carrying value that is well below the replacement cost of the inventory. Our revenue recognition processes involve establishing estimates for bad debts, returns, damaged goods and other allowances. These estimates are based on historical experience and the facts known at the date of the preparation of the financial statements, but future events could cause actual results to vary from our estimates. In addition, we have acquired other businesses in the past and this has resulted in goodwill being recorded on our financial statements. While goodwill is no longer amortized systematically over time due to changes in generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., goodwill is subject to a periodic assessment of its continuing value to the Company. Currently, we believe the recorded value is below the realizable value of this asset. New Accounting Pronouncements Share Based Payment On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R). SFAS 123R is a revision of Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance. SFAS 123R eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method under APB Opinion No. 25 and generally requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments (including employee stock options) based on the grant date fair value of the award. SFAS 123R will be effective for the Company beginning in its first quarter of fiscal 2007, however early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating SFAS 123R to determine the date of adoption, which fair value based model and transitional provision will be followed upon adoption, and the impact it may have on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Inventory Costs In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 151 (SFAS 151), Inventory Costs, which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material in the valuation of inventory. SFAS 151 will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS 151 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 28 Table of Contents Income Taxes In December 2004, the FASB issued Financial Staff Position FAS 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, allowing companies additional time to evaluate the effect of the American Jobs Creation Act on plans for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings. The Company is in the process of evaluating the effects of the repatriation provision; however, the Company does not expect to complete this evaluation until after Congress or the U.S. Treasury Department provides further clarification on key elements of the provision. The Company does not anticipate the repatriation of foreign earnings.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk The Company is exposed to market pricing risk consisting of foreign currency rate fluctuations and changes in interest rates. 29 Table of Contents The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in its operating statement due to transactions denominated primarily in Canadian Dollars, British Pounds and Euros. Although historically the Company has elected not to enter into any hedging contracts, it continually evaluates its foreign currency exchange rate risk and the different mechanisms for use in managing such risk. A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Companys most significant foreign currency exposures would have had an impact of approximately $21.0 million on fiscal 2005 net sales. This amount is not indicative of the hypothetical net earnings impact due to the partially offsetting impact of the currency exchange movements on cost of sales and operating expenses. The Companys operation in the U.K. purchases product sourced in the United States and certain Far Eastern countries that require payment denominated in the U.S. dollar. To assist in controlling the potential volatility on its cost of products sold resulting from changes in currency exchange rates, this operation enters into foreign currency options that fix the maximum rate the operation pays for U.S. dollars. At April 30, 2005, the operation had options to purchase up to $3.5 million U.S. dollars at a rate of 1.72 U.S. dollars to 1.00 British Pound, or better. The Companys earnings are also affected by fluctuations in short term interest rates through the investment of its cash balances, borrowings under LIBOR based debt instruments and the practice of selling fixed rate equipment finance contracts under agreements with both a commercial paper conduit and a group of banks that provide for pricing based on variable interest rates. During fiscal 2004, the Company entered into $650 million of new debt financing agreements that included both fixed and variable interest rate debt instruments. As of April 30, 2005, the Company had approximately $320 million of debt outstanding under these agreements of which $170 million was variable interest rate based debt. The Company views its variable interest rate debt position on a net basis that gives effect to the Companys cash and short term investments balances. To further reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, in fiscal 2004 the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement that fixed an additional $100 million of the variable interest rate debt exposure through November 2005. While hedging activities provide only limited protection against interest rate risk, the interest rate swap agreement was entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing interest rate exposure, not for speculation. An expanded discussion of the interest rate swap is included in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements that are included elsewhere in this document. When considering the exposure under the agreements whereby the Company sells equipment finance contracts to both a commercial paper conduit and a group of banks, the Company has the ability to select pricing based on interest rates ranging from 30 day LIBOR up to twelve month LIBOR. In addition, the portfolio of installment contracts generally turns over in less than 48 months and the Company can adjust the rate it charges on new customer contracts at any time. This provides that the average interest rate in the portfolio generally moves with the interest rate markets and thus would parallel the underlying interest rate movement of the pricing built into the sale agreements. In calculating the gain on the contract sales, the Company uses an interest rate curve that approximates the maturity period of the then outstanding contracts. The Company estimates that if interest rates had been 10% higher during the year, the annual impact would have been to reduce earnings before income tax by approximately $2.3 million. 30 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview The Companys fiscal 2005 financial information is summarized in this Managements Discussion and Analysis, the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the related Notes. The following background is essential to more fully understand the Companys financial information. Patterson operates a distribution business in three complementary markets: dental supply, veterinary supply and rehabilitation supply. Historically the Companys strategy for growth focused on internal growth and the acquisition of smaller distributors and businesses offering related products and services to the dental market. In fiscal 2002, the Company expanded its strategy to take advantage of a parallel growth opportunity in the veterinary supply market by acquiring the assets of J. A. Webster, Inc. The Company added a third component to its business platform in fiscal 2004 when it entered the rehabilitation supply market with the acquisition of AbilityOne Products Corp. (AbilityOne) on September 12, 2003. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for more on this transaction. AbilityOne is now known as Patterson Medical Products, Inc. (Patterson Medical). The historical operating performance of the veterinary supply and rehabilitation supply businesses are somewhat different than the dental supply business. Gross margin percentages in the veterinary business are typically in the low to mid 20s compared to the mid 30s for dental. The operating expense rate is also lower in the veterinary business than in the dental business. Gross margin percentages in the rehabilitation business are in the low to mid 40s while operating expense in relation to sales, including the amortization of intangibles, is higher than dental. There are several important aspects of the Companys business, including: (1) market growth in the various markets it operates; (2) internal growth; (3) growth through acquisition; and (4) continued focus on controlling costs and enhancing efficiency. Management defines 22 Table of Contents internal growth as the increase in net sales from period to period, excluding the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, and the net sales, for a period of twelve months following the transaction date, of businesses that it has acquired. With these factors in mind, management has established certain operating objectives, which include increasing net sales four percentage points faster than the average market growth rate and improving operating margins by 50 basis points annually. The Company did not anticipate achieving its objective related to operating margins in fiscal 2005 because of the substantial amounts of intangible asset amortization from recent acquisitions, including Patterson Medical, and absorbing the costs of the acquisitions throughout the year. The Company does anticipate achieving its objective of a 50 basis point improvement in operating margins in fiscal 2006. The Company made significant progress toward its objective of driving long term, sustainable improvements in sales, profitability and cash flow in fiscal 2005. Net sales in 2005 increased 23.0% from the prior year, including internal growth of 12.1%. There was an estimated impact of 1.7% to fiscal 2005 sales due to an extra, or fifty third week (the Company uses a fifty two, fifty three week convention ending on the last Saturday in April). Also included in the increase in net sales for the year ended April 30 is a favorable foreign currency translation impact of 0.5%, with the remaining sales increase predominately attributed to acquisitions. The Company also achieved a 20 basis point improvement in its operating margin and increased net income by 22.9%. Results for fiscal year 2003 include the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets resulting in the cessation of goodwill amortization. Additional information regarding the adoption of SFAS No. 142 is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. That information is incorporated by reference into this section of this report. Results of Operations The following table summarizes the consolidated results of operations over the past three fiscal years as a percent of sales: 2005 2004 2003 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 64.4 % 64.3 % 65.3 % Gross margin 35.6 % 35.7 % 34.7 % Operating expenses 23.1 % 23.4 % 23.9 % Operating income 12.5 % 12.3 % 10.8 % Interest expense 0.6 % 0.4 % Other income, net 0.2 % 0.3 % 0.4 % Income before taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change 12.1 % 12.2 % 11.2 % Income taxes 4.5 % 4.6 % 4.2 % Income before cumulative effect of accounting change 7.6 % 7.6 % 7.0 % Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 Net Sales. Net sales for the year ended April 30, 2005 totaled $2,421.5 million, a 23.0% increase from $1,969.3 million reported for the previous year. Fiscal 2005 included an extra, or fifty third week as compared to fiscal 2004, which included fifty two weeks. The Companys fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of April each year. The estimated impact of the extra week contributed 1.7% of the fiscal 2005 sales growth. Sales of our largest business unit, dental supply, increased 13.5%. Excluding the impact of the extra week, foreign currency exchange translation related to our Canadian operations, and the acquisition of CAESY, sales grew 11.5% in fiscal 2005. Sales of dental consumable supplies experienced strong growth of 8.9%. After the estimated impact of the extra week, consumables sales rose approximately 7%, which is on the high end of our estimated market growth of 5% to 7%. Sales of equipment and related software within this business unit continued to be a principal sales growth driver, improving by 21.5%. While sales growth was seen across various equipment categories, demand for new technology equipment was particularly robust, with sales of the CEREC&reg; 3D dental restorative system up 39% for the year, while sales of digital radiography systems, including related software and hardware, rose 31%. Sales of other services and products, consisting primarily of parts, technical service, software support and insurance e claims, grew 11.1%. 23 Table of Contents The increase in veterinary supply sales of 38.5% included contributions from the acquisitions of ProVet in late fiscal 2004 and Milburn in October 2004, as well as the impact of an extra week. Two other unique factors affected the comparability of sales between fiscal years 2005 and 2004. First, ProHeart 6, an injectable heartworm medication, was voluntarily recalled by its manufacturer in September 2004. This recall resulted in lost revenues of approximately $6 million in fiscal 2005. Second, a temporary pharmaceutical distribution agreement was in place during fiscal 2004 until the third quarter, at which time the agreement was converted to an agency arrangement, resulting in lower sales. This agency arrangement remained the same for the balance of fiscal 2004 and for all of fiscal 2005. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions, extra week, ProHeart 6 recall and distribution agreement conversion, net sales increased 7.8% in the veterinary supply business. The September 2003 acquisition of Patterson Medical resulted in the creation of the rehabilitation supply business unit which contributed sales of $142.3 million in fiscal 2004. With a full year of operations, as well as the acquisition of Medco, revenues more than doubled to $295.3 million in fiscal 2005. On a pro forma basis, as if the acquisition of Patterson Medical was effective at the beginning of fiscal 2004, and excluding the estimated impact of the extra week, foreign currency translation related to foreign operations, and the Medco acquisition, sales grew by 8.7%. Gross Margin. Gross margin declined 10 basis points in fiscal 2005 to 35.6%. The Company did experience a sequential improvement each quarter after the first in fiscal 2005, including a 50 basis point improvement between the third and fourth quarter. In fiscal 2005, dental supply gross margins increased 20 basis points reflecting favorable product mix, including the newly acquired CAESY product offerings. Gross margin decreases in the other business units offset the improvement in the dental unit. There are continuing pricing pressures within the veterinary supply market that are affecting margins. Additionally, the recent acquisitions of ProVet and Milburn carry lower gross margin than the traditional Webster business. Patterson Medicals gross margin decline is attributable largely to a shift in product mix. Operating Expenses. The consolidated operating expense ratio decreased to 23.1%, down 30 basis points from 23.4% a year ago. The dental ratio improved 40 basis points, reflecting operating leverage on additional sales. The veterinary segment experienced an increase in its operating expense ratio of 1.2 percentage points, as the recent acquisitions, which had higher costs structures than the traditional Webster business, have been assimilated into the segments existing structure. Patterson Medicals operating expense ratio increased 40 basis points. Contributing to the increase in the expense ratio were additional catalog costs, including costs related to the Medco business acquired in May 2004, and additional amortization expense. Consolidated amortization expense in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 was $12.2 million and $7.2 million, respectively. The $5 million increase was due primarily to amortization on certain intangible assets related to the acquisition of Patterson Medical, some of which are being amortized on an accelerated basis due to their nature. Also, a non compete agreement of approximately $0.7 million was written off in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. The Company anticipates depreciation and amortization expense will decrease by $3 to $4 million in fiscal 2006. Operating Income. Operating income increased 24.6% and improved 20 basis points as a percent of sales. A full year of operations from Patterson Medical and improved operating leverage in the dental segment were the primary drivers of the operating margin improvement. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased from $9.6 million to $15.1 million as a result of the mid fiscal 2004 debt financing related to the acquisition of Patterson Medical. The Company paid down substantial amounts of debt during the year. However much of this debt could not be paid until late in the year based on terms of the agreements. Thus, fiscal 2005 interest expense was not significantly affected by the debt retirements. Other Income, net. Other income, net of other expenses, was consistent year over year. Composed primarily of finance interest income in both years, net other income was $6.5 million for fiscal 2005 compared to $6.6 million for fiscal 2004. 24 Table of Contents Income Taxes. The effective income tax rate in fiscal 2005 was 37.4%, a slight decrease from 37.6% in fiscal 2004. The decrease was due to the addition of the foreign operations of Patterson Medical, particularly in the U.K.. The U.K. operations caused the estimated annual effective tax rate to decline since the rates in the U.K. were less than in the United States during the year. Earnings Per Share. Earnings per share increased to $1.32, up $0.24 or 22% from the $1.08 earnings per share reported in fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003 Net Sales. Net sales for the year ended April 24, 2004 totaled $1,969.3 million, an 18.9% increase from $1,657.0 million reported for the previous year. Sales in the dental supply market increased 9.9%. Sales of dental equipment continued to be a principal sales growth driver for the dental supply segment, increasing 17.9% paced by robust demand for such new technology products as the CEREC&reg; 3D dental restorative system and digital radiography. Consumable supplies grew 5.3% due primarily to contributions from an expanded sales force and an increased focus on marketing efforts in this area. Sales of other services and products, consisting primarily of parts, technical service, software support and insurance e claims, grew 10.8%. Canadian dental sales increased 15.8% in fiscal 2004, 1.1% excluding currency gains. Sales of the Webster Veterinary Supply unit increased 13.4% for the year to $210.7 million. Webster sales include the impact of a temporary pharmaceutical distribution agreement that was in place last year but was converted back into an agency arrangement in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, as well as the April 16, 2004 acquisition of ProVet, a companion pet veterinary distributor. On a comparable basis, excluding the revenues from the change in the distribution agreement and the ProVet acquisition, sales in this segment increased 9.1% in fiscal 2004. Rehabilitation supply sales stemming from the Patterson Medical acquisition amounted to $142.3 million. On a pro forma basis, sales increased about 6.0%. Gross Margins. Gross margins increased a full percentage point in fiscal 2004 to 35.7% due primarily to the impact of the Patterson Medical acquisition, which has margins in the mid to low 40s. Dental supply gross margins increased 50 basis points reflecting favorable product mix along with some pricing improvement. Product mix benefited from sales of the higher margin CEREC 3D dental restorative system as well as digital radiography and related software. Offsetting the higher margins discussed above was a decline in veterinary supply margins due to sales under the temporary pharmaceutical distribution agreement, which carried a much lower margin than historical levels for most of the fiscal year. Operating Expenses. Fiscal 2004 included seven and one half months of results from Patterson Medical. Excluding the impact of this acquisition, operating expenses increased 7.3% from prior year levels but declined to 23.2% as a percent of sales, or 70 basis points. This resulted from improved operating leverage in both the dental and veterinary supply segments. The dental segment gained leverage on the operating expense line despite substantial investments in the sales organization, the new technical service system and other corporate objectives. As a percent of sales, the veterinary segment showed a 1.3 percentage point improvement in expenses year over year. Operating expenses as a percent of sales for Patterson Medical were approximately two percentage points higher than the remainder of the business due to the amortization of certain intangible assets resulting from the accounting for the acquisition. Operating Income. Operating income increased 35.5% and improved 150 basis points as a percent of sales. The acquisition of Patterson Medical, increased sales of higher margin dental equipment and improved operating leverage accounted for most of the increase. 25 Table of Contents Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $9.6 million as a result of debt put in place to finance the acquisition of Patterson Medical, including the write off of $1.3 million of origination fees on the bridge loan used to close the acquisition, which was retired during the period. Other Income, net. Other income, net of expenses, was $6.6 million for fiscal 2004 compared to $7.5 million for fiscal 2003. This reduction occurred in finance income and was caused by a decrease in invested funds, due to the use of cash on hand to partially fund the acquisition of Patterson Medical, and lower interest rates on investments. Income Taxes. The effective income tax rate in fiscal 2004 was 37.6%, unchanged from the prior year. While the Company had more foreign income, the tax rate in the foreign jurisdictions did not have a substantial impact on the overall tax rate. Earnings Per Share. Earnings per share increased to $1.08, up $0.23 or 27% from the $0.85 reported in fiscal 2003. Patterson Medical contributed approximately $0.08 per share in fiscal 2004. Liquidity and Capital Resources Pattersons operating cash flow has been the Companys principal source of liquidity in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, supplemented in fiscal 2004 by the issuance of $500 million of debt. Cash generated from operating activities was invested in working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. Operating activities generated cash of $207.3 million in fiscal 2005 compared with $197.7 million in fiscal 2004 and $86.7 million in fiscal 2003. Cash flow from operations was diminished in fiscal 2003 by an increase in the level of equipment finance contracts the Company carried. Under the terms of an agreement with a commercial paper conduit in fiscal 2003, the Company was required to receive one payment from the customer before a contract was eligible for sale to the commercial paper conduit. This requirement in conjunction with increased equipment sales resulted in an increase in the level of accounts receivable in fiscal 2003. This requirement was removed in fiscal 2004. Capital expenditures net of dispositions were $31.5, $19.6 and $11.4 million in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in 2005 reflected spending for a new distribution center that became fully operational in March 2005, the expansion of informational systems and a new building for the printed office products division. The Company expects to invest approximately $25 to 30 million in capital expenditures during fiscal 2006. Uses of these funds include the replacement and upgrading of the distribution capacity in the U.S. and the U.K. and the expansion of information systems. In fiscal 2005, the Company used $72.9 million of cash for acquisitions, including Medco, CAESY and Milburn. In fiscal 2004, the Company used $606.4 million of cash for acquisitions, namely Patterson Medical and ProVet. The acquisition of Patterson Medical was initially debt financed through a $500 million bridge loan. In November 2003, the bridge loan was converted into two permanent debt financing arrangements as more fully described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company did not repurchase any of its common stock in fiscal 2005 or fiscal 2004, but did repurchase 321,299 shares of its common stock for $13.1 million during fiscal 2003. The Company had $245.9 million of cash and short term investments as of April 30, 2005. On June 30, 2005, the Company paid a $100 million exclusivity fee under an agreement that extended an existing relationship with a manufacturer for an additional 10 years. The exclusivity fee will be amortized over the period of the agreement. Management continues to expect funds generated from operations and existing cash and short term investments to be sufficient to meet the Companys working capital needs for the next fiscal year. The Company will continue to obtain liquidity from the sale of its equipment finance contracts. In fiscal 2005, the Company paid down the full $50 million balance outstanding on a revolving credit facility that existed at the end of fiscal 2004. An amount of $200 million is available to the Company under this revolving credit facility until fiscal 2009. Additionally, in April 2005, the Company made a prepayment of $100 million on its floating rate debt and an additional $5 million payment over and above the scheduled amortization on its term loan. Scheduled quarterly amortization on the term loan for the year totaled $20 million. 26 Table of Contents The Companys short term and long term facilities are believed to be adequate as a supplement to internally generated cash flows to fund anticipated expansion plans and strategic initiatives. Future debt prepayments will depend on managements views with respect to interest rates together with the investment needs of the business at the time. The Company sells a significant portion of its installment sale contracts to a commercial paper funded conduit managed by a third party bank, and as a result, commercial paper is indirectly an important source of liquidity for the Company. The Company is allowed to participate in the conduit due to its financial strength. Cash flow could be impaired if the Companys financial strength diminished to a level that precluded the Company from taking part in this facility or other similar facilities. The Companys financing business is described in further detail in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations During fiscal 2004, the Company entered into two new debt financing arrangements, including both bank and private debt with a total capacity of $650 million. The bank portion of the package totals $300 million and is comprised of a $100 million five year, amortizing term loan and a $200 million five year, revolving credit facility. The private debt is a total of $350 million of fixed and floating rate notes with maturities ranging from 3 to 7 years with one year, no call provisions. The Company had two primary objectives in placing this debt: one, to lower its overall cost of capital, and two, to provide significant flexibility in financing the growth of the business. Approximately $200 million of capacity under the bank arrangement remains for future use. A summary of the Companys contractual obligations as of April 30, 2005 follows (in thousands): Payment due by year Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Long Term Debt $ 321,557 $ 20,027 $ 161,530 $ 140,000 Operating Leases 45,619 11,618 17,384 12,439 4,178 Additionally, the Company has a firm purchase commitment of approximately $10 million related to the construction of a new facility in the U.K. The Company anticipates making this expenditure during fiscal 2006. For a more complete description of our contractual obligations, please see Notes 7 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Outlook Over the last ten years, the Company has been able to average double digit revenue and earnings growth through its strategy of emphasizing its value added, full service capabilities, using technology to enhance customer service, continuing to improve operating efficiencies, and growing through internal expansion and acquisitions. The Companys growth strategy will continue to focus on these key elements. Maintaining financial flexibility is also a key component of the Companys future growth. With strong operating cash flow and available credit capacity, the Company is confident that it will be able to financially support its future growth. The strategic initiatives that the Company implemented during fiscal 2005, which have significantly strengthened the Companys operational platform, are also a key ingredient to continuing future growth. Given these factors, the Company considers itself well positioned to continue capitalizing upon the growth opportunities in the dental supply, companion pet veterinary supply and the worldwide rehabilition supply markets. The Company continues to believe that the sustainable, long term growth rate of its North American dental operation is four percentage points in excess of the markets 7% to 9% estimated rate of growth. The Company also believes its Webster and Patterson Medical units can continue to grow faster than the estimated 6% to 7% growth rate of the U.S. companion pet veterinary supply market and the estimated 6% to 8% growth rate of the rehabilition market. Asset Management The following table summarizes the Companys days sales outstanding (DSO) and inventory turnover over the past three fiscal years: 2005 2004 2003 Days sales outstanding 46 46 49 Inventory turnover (1) 7.9 8.2 7.3 (1) The inventory values used in this calculation are the LIFO inventory values for all distributed inventories except for Colwell and Patterson Medical manufactured inventories and all foreign inventories, which are valued using FIFO inventory value. 27 Table of Contents Foreign Operations Foreign sales are derived primarily from operations in Canada and from Patterson Medicals operations in the U.K. and France. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates have not significantly impacted earnings. However, net sales in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 were enhanced by changes in the exchange rate. Without foreign currency effects, net sales would have been $12.6 million, $19.4 million and $2.3 million lower in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Changes in currency exchange rates is a risk accompanying foreign operations, but this risk is not considered material with respect to the net operations of the Companys business. Critical Accounting Policies The Company has adopted various accounting policies to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Management believes that the Companys policies are conservative and its philosophy is to adopt accounting policies which minimize the risk of adverse events having a material impact on recorded assets and liabilities. However, the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments regarding the realization of assets and the settlements of liabilities based on the information available to management at the time. Changes subsequent to the preparation of the financial statements in economic, technological and competitive conditions may materially impact the recorded values of the Companys assets and liabilities. Therefore, the users of the financial statements should read all the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and be aware that conditions currently unknown to management may develop in the future. This may require a material adjustment to a recorded asset or liability to consistently apply the Companys significant accounting principles and policies that are discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The financial performance and condition of the Company may also be materially impacted by transactions and events that the Company has not previously experienced and for which the Company has not been required to establish an accounting policy or adopt a generally accepted accounting principle. Because we are primarily a distributor, we face inventory risk due to obsolescence and customer preference. We assess our inventories continually and value them at the lower of cost or market, and in addition, we relieve inventory cost using a last in, first out convention which results in an inventory carrying value that is well below the replacement cost of the inventory. Our revenue recognition processes involve establishing estimates for bad debts, returns, damaged goods and other allowances. These estimates are based on historical experience and the facts known at the date of the preparation of the financial statements, but future events could cause actual results to vary from our estimates. In addition, we have acquired other businesses in the past and this has resulted in goodwill being recorded on our financial statements. While goodwill is no longer amortized systematically over time due to changes in generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., goodwill is subject to a periodic assessment of its continuing value to the Company. Currently, we believe the recorded value is below the realizable value of this asset. New Accounting Pronouncements Share Based Payment On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R). SFAS 123R is a revision of Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance. SFAS 123R eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method under APB Opinion No. 25 and generally requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments (including employee stock options) based on the grant date fair value of the award. SFAS 123R will be effective for the Company beginning in its first quarter of fiscal 2007, however early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating SFAS 123R to determine the date of adoption, which fair value based model and transitional provision will be followed upon adoption, and the impact it may have on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Inventory Costs In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 151 (SFAS 151), Inventory Costs, which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material in the valuation of inventory. SFAS 151 will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS 151 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 28 Table of Contents Income Taxes In December 2004, the FASB issued Financial Staff Position FAS 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, allowing companies additional time to evaluate the effect of the American Jobs Creation Act on plans for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings. The Company is in the process of evaluating the effects of the repatriation provision; however, the Company does not expect to complete this evaluation until after Congress or the U.S. Treasury Department provides further clarification on key elements of the provision. The Company does not anticipate the repatriation of foreign earnings.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk The Company is exposed to market pricing risk consisting of foreign currency rate fluctuations and changes in interest rates. 29 Table of Contents The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in its operating statement due to transactions denominated primarily in Canadian Dollars, British Pounds and Euros. Although historically the Company has elected not to enter into any hedging contracts, it continually evaluates its foreign currency exchange rate risk and the different mechanisms for use in managing such risk. A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Companys most significant foreign currency exposures would have had an impact of approximately $21.0 million on fiscal 2005 net sales. This amount is not indicative of the hypothetical net earnings impact due to the partially offsetting impact of the currency exchange movements on cost of sales and operating expenses. The Companys operation in the U.K. purchases product sourced in the United States and certain Far Eastern countries that require payment denominated in the U.S. dollar. To assist in controlling the potential volatility on its cost of products sold resulting from changes in currency exchange rates, this operation enters into foreign currency options that fix the maximum rate the operation pays for U.S. dollars. At April 30, 2005, the operation had options to purchase up to $3.5 million U.S. dollars at a rate of 1.72 U.S. dollars to 1.00 British Pound, or better. The Companys earnings are also affected by fluctuations in short term interest rates through the investment of its cash balances, borrowings under LIBOR based debt instruments and the practice of selling fixed rate equipment finance contracts under agreements with both a commercial paper conduit and a group of banks that provide for pricing based on variable interest rates. During fiscal 2004, the Company entered into $650 million of new debt financing agreements that included both fixed and variable interest rate debt instruments. As of April 30, 2005, the Company had approximately $320 million of debt outstanding under these agreements of which $170 million was variable interest rate based debt. The Company views its variable interest rate debt position on a net basis that gives effect to the Companys cash and short term investments balances. To further reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, in fiscal 2004 the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement that fixed an additional $100 million of the variable interest rate debt exposure through November 2005. While hedging activities provide only limited protection against interest rate risk, the interest rate swap agreement was entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing interest rate exposure, not for speculation. An expanded discussion of the interest rate swap is included in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements that are included elsewhere in this document. When considering the exposure under the agreements whereby the Company sells equipment finance contracts to both a commercial paper conduit and a group of banks, the Company has the ability to select pricing based on interest rates ranging from 30 day LIBOR up to twelve month LIBOR. In addition, the portfolio of installment contracts generally turns over in less than 48 months and the Company can adjust the rate it charges on new customer contracts at any time. This provides that the average interest rate in the portfolio generally moves with the interest rate markets and thus would parallel the underlying interest rate movement of the pricing built into the sale agreements. In calculating the gain on the contract sales, the Company uses an interest rate curve that approximates the maturity period of the then outstanding contracts. The Company estimates that if interest rates had been 10% higher during the year, the annual impact would have been to reduce earnings before income tax by approximately $2.3 million. 30 Table of Contents
