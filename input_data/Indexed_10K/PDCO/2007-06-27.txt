Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors that May Affect Future Operating Results, for a discussion of certain factors that could cause the Companys actual operating results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements. General In June 2004, the Company changed its corporate name from Patterson Dental Company to Patterson Companies, Inc. (Patterson or the Company). Patterson retained its existing Nasdaq stock symbol PDCO. The corporate name change was adopted to reflect Pattersons expanding base of business, which now encompasses the veterinary and rehabilitation supply markets, as well as its traditional base of operations in the dental supply market. Pattersons operating units include Patterson Dental, Webster Veterinary and Patterson Medical, formerly known as AbilityOne Products Corp. Patterson is a value added distributor serving three major markets: North American dental supply; U.S. companion pet (dogs, cats and other common household pets) and equine veterinary supply; and the worldwide rehabilitation and non wheelchair assistive products supply market. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to Patterson or the Company include its subsidiaries: Patterson Dental Holdings, Inc., Direct Dental Supply Co., Patterson Dental Canada Inc., Patterson Dental Supply, Inc., Webster Veterinary Supply, Inc., PDC Funding Company, LLC, PDC Funding Company II, LLC, Patterson Technology Center, Inc., Patterson Office Supplies, Inc., Webster Management LP, Intra Corp., Patterson Medical Holdings, Inc., Patterson Medical Supply, Inc., Sammons Preston Canada, Inc., AO Liquidation, Inc., Tumble Forms, Inc., Midland Manufacturing Company, Inc., Patterson Logistics Services, Inc., Accu Bite, Inc., Accu Bite Dental Products Limited Liability Company, Williamston Industrial Center, LLC, Strategic Dental Marketing, Inc., AbilityOne Homecraft Limited, AbilityOne Limited, AbilityOne Kinetec S. A., AOC Vertriebs GmbH, Theraquip, Inc., Metro Medical, Inc., and Dale Surgical Professional Supply, Inc. Patterson began distributing dental supplies in 1877. The modern history of the business dates to May 1985, when the Companys management and certain investors purchased the Company from a subsidiary of The Beatrice Companies, Inc. Patterson became a publicly traded company in October 1992. The Company is a corporation organized under the laws of Minnesota. The Company historically reported under one operating segment, dental supply. In July 2001, the Company purchased the veterinary supply assets of J. A. Webster, Inc., which became a reportable business segment. Then in September 2003, the Company acquired AbilityOne Products Corp., creating a third business segment which serves the rehabilitation supply market. The Companys three reportable segments, dental supply, veterinary supply and rehabilitation supply, are strategic business units that offer similar products and services to different customer bases. Each business is a market leader with a strong competitive position, serves a fragmented market that offers consolidation opportunities and offers relatively low cost consumable supplies, making the Companys value added business proposition highly attractive to customers. Shared Services Initiative To streamline Pattersons cost structure, we continue to consolidate our distribution infrastructure and business systems. With respect to our distribution infrastructure, in late fiscal 2005 we opened a facility in 3 Table of Contents Columbia, SC that replaced the individual dental and veterinary distribution centers that were serving this region. In fiscal 2006, we consolidated separate dental and veterinary facilities in Seattle, WA into a new shared distribution center. In addition, we began stocking certain high volume Patterson Medical inventory at shared distribution facilities in Dinuba, CA, Jacksonville, FL and Fort Worth, TX. During fiscal 2007, we opened a new distribution center in eastern Pennsylvania that replaced nearby, separate dental and veterinary facilities. Patterson Medical moved into this new distribution center and closed its former primary distribution facility in Bolingbrook, IL. We expect to begin the modification of another existing facility that will accommodate products for multiple business units during fiscal 2008. The first shared sales branch office location has been established in northern California and the Company plans to add shared branch facilities between two or three business units in select markets during fiscal 2008. Dental Supply Overview As Pattersons largest business, Patterson Dental is one of the two largest distributors of dental products in North America. The business has operations in the United States and Canada. Patterson Dental, a full service, value added supplier to dentists, dental laboratories, institutions, and other healthcare professionals, provides: consumable products (including x ray film, restorative materials, hand instruments and sterilization products); basic and advanced technology dental equipment; practice management and clinical software; patient education systems; and office forms and stationery. Patterson Dental offers its customers a broad selection of dental products including more than 90,000 stock keeping units (SKUs) of which approximately 4,000 are private label products sold under the Patterson name. Patterson Dental also offers customers a full range of related services including dental equipment installation, maintenance and repair, dental office design and equipment financing. Patterson Dental markets its dental products and services through approximately 1,550 direct sales representatives, 391 of whom are equipment specialists. Patterson Dental has over 125 years of experience providing quality service to dental professionals. Net sales of this segment have increased from $165.8 million in fiscal 1986 to over $2.0 billion in fiscal 2007 and profitability has increased from an operating loss in fiscal 1986 to operating income of $262.4 million in fiscal 2007. Patterson estimates the dental supply market it serves to be approximately $6.4 billion annually and that its share of this market is approximately 32%. The underlying structure of the dental supply market consists of a sizeable geographically dispersed number of fragmented dental practices and is attractive for the Companys role as a value added, full service distributor. According to the American Dental Association, there are over 160,000 dentists practicing in the United States in approximately 135,000 dental practices. In Canada, there are approximately 18,000 licensed dentists according to the Canadian Dental Association. The average general practitioner generated approximately $560,000 in annual revenue in 2003, while the average specialty practitioner produced about $800,000. The Company believes that a dentist uses between 5% and 7% of annual revenue to purchase consumable supplies used in the daily operations of the practice. This translates into between $28,000 and $39,000 of supplies being purchased by the average practice each year. The Company believes the average dental practitioner purchases about 40% of their supplies from their top supplier. Total expenditures for dental services in the United States increased from $31 billion in 1990 to $84 billion in 2006. Domestic dental care expenditures are projected by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to grow 6% annually, reaching $116 billion by the year 2010. The Company believes that the demand for dental services, equipment and supplies will continue to be influenced by the following factors: Demographics. The U.S. population grew from 235 million in 1980 to 297 million in 2005, and is expected to reach 309 million by 2010. The median age of the population is also increasing and the Company believes that older dental patients spend more on a per capita basis for dental services. 4 Table of Contents Dental products and techniques. Technological developments in dental products have contributed to advances in dental techniques and procedures, including cosmetic dentistry and dental implants. Demand for certain dental procedures. Demand is growing for preventive dentistry and specialty services such as periodontic (the treatment of gums), endodontic (root canals), orthodontic (braces), and other dental procedures that enable patients to keep their natural teeth longer and improve their appearance. Increased dental office productivity. The number of dentists per 100,000 persons in the U.S. is forecasted to decline over the next two decades. As a result, the number of patients per dental practice is expected to grow. For this reason dentists are showing an increased willingness to invest in dental equipment and office infrastructure that can strengthen the productivity of their practices. Demand for infection control products. Greater public awareness as well as regulations and guidelines instituted by OSHA, the American Dental Association and state regulatory authorities have resulted in increased use of infection control (asepsis) products such as protective clothing, gloves, facemasks, and sterilization equipment to prevent the spread of communicable diseases such as AIDS, hepatitis and herpes. Coverage by dental plans. An increasing number of dental services are being funded by private dental insurance. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services statistics on expenditures for dental services in the United States indicate that private dental insurance paid approximately 50% of the $84 billion in total expenditures for 2006. Strategy Pattersons objective is to remain a leading national distributor of supplies, equipment and related services in the market while continuing to improve its profitability and enhance its value to customers. To achieve this objective, Patterson has adopted a strategy of emphasizing its value added, full service capabilities, using technology to enhance customer service, continuing to improve operating efficiencies, and growing through internal expansion and acquisitions. Emphasizing Value Added, Full Service Capabilities. Patterson Dental is positioned to meet virtually all of the needs of dental practitioners by providing a full range of consumable supplies, equipment and software, and value added services. The Company believes that its customers value full service and responsive delivery of quality supplies and equipment. Customers also increasingly expect suppliers to be knowledgeable about products and services, and generally a superior sales representative can create a special relationship with the practitioner by providing an informational link to the overall industry. The Companys knowledgeable sales representatives assist customers in the selection and purchase of supplies and equipment. In addition, the high quality sales force allows Patterson to offer broader product lines. Since most dental practices lack a significant degree of back office support, the convenience of our full service capabilities enables dentists to spend more time with patients and, thus, generate additional revenues. Patterson meets its customers requirements by delivering frequent, small quantity orders rapidly and reliably from its strategically located distribution centers. Equipment specialists, technology representatives, and service technicians also support the Companys value added strategy in the dental supply market. Equipment specialists offer consultation on office design, equipment requirements and financing. Technology representatives provide guidance on integrating technology solutions including practice management and clinical software, digital radiography, custom hardware and networking into the dental practice. The Companys experienced service technicians perform equipment installation, maintenance and repair services including services on products not purchased through Patterson. Using Technology to Enhance Customer Service. As part of its commitment to providing superior customer service, the Company offers its customers easy order placement. The Company has offered electronic ordering 5 Table of Contents capability to its dental supply segment since 1987 when it first introduced Remote Order Entry (REMOSM). The Company believes that its computerized order entry systems help to establish relationships with new customers and increase loyalty among existing customers. The remote order entry systems permit customers to place orders from their offices directly to Patterson 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Over the years, the Company has continued to introduce new order entry systems designed to meet the varying needs of its customers. Today the Company offers four systems to the dental supply segment, eMAGINE&reg;, REMOSM, PDXpress&reg; and www.pattersondental.com. Customers, as well as the Companys sales force, use these systems. Over the years, the number of orders transmitted electronically has grown steadily to approximately 65% of Pattersons consumable dental product volume or $750 million in fiscal year 2007. In fiscal 2002, the Company introduced its newest order entry system, eMAGINE&reg;. eMAGINE&reg; has become the standard platform for the sales representative and includes many new features and upgrades including: up to three years of order history for the customers reference, faster searches for products and reports, order tracking, instant information on monthly product specials, descriptions and photographs of popular products and an electronic custom catalog, including a printable version with scannable bar codes. For those dental customers not using eMAGINE&reg;, the Company offers two alternative order entry products. REMOSM gives customers direct and immediate ordering access through a personal computer to a database containing Pattersons complete inventory. PDXpress&reg; is a handheld order entry system that eliminates handwritten order forms by permitting a user to scan a product bar code from an inventory tag system or from Pattersons bar coded catalog. These systems, including eMAGINE&reg;, are provided at no additional charge to customers who maintain certain minimum purchase requirements. The goal of the Companys Internet strategy is to distribute information and service related products over the Internet to enhance customers practices and to increase sales force productivity. The Companys Internet environment includes order entry, access to Patterson Today articles and manufacturers product information. Additionally, Patterson utilizes a tool, InfoSource, to provide real time customer and Company information to the Companys sales force, managers and vendors via the Internet. In addition to enhancing customer service, by offering electronic order entry systems to its customers, the Company enables its sales representatives to spend more time with existing customers and to call on additional customers. The Companys proprietary practice management and clinical software, EagleSoft&reg;, is developed and maintained by the Patterson Technology Center (PTC). The Company believes the PTC differentiates Patterson Dental from the competition by positioning Patterson Dental as the only company providing a single source solution for the high growth area of digital radiography. This technology, which we expect to be installed eventually in most dental offices, has a current market penetration of approximately 30%. Among its many specialized capabilities, the PTC provides system configuration, as well as the seamless integration of all digital operatory components with clinical software, including our EagleSoft&reg; line. This integration creates an electronic patient database that combines the patients front office record with digital information from the clinical x ray, intra oral camera, CEREC and other digital equipment. The PTC also will network the digital x ray system throughout the entire office and provide all required custom computer hardware for the system. In addition, the PTC provides installation and customer training, as well as a call center for troubleshooting customer problems and arranging for local service. Software and digital radiography customers also have access to the support capabilities of the PTC. The PTC provides support for our proprietary products as well as select branded product from our manufacturers. In addition to troubleshooting problems through its customer call center, the PTC designs and configures local area networks and assembles custom hardware. The PTC also develops and supports the Companys order entry systems. Continuing to Improve Operating Efficiencies. Patterson continues to implement programs designed to improve operating efficiencies and allow for continued sales growth over time. These programs include a wide 6 Table of Contents variety of initiatives from investing in management information systems to consolidating distribution centers. Recent initiatives include upgrading the Companys communications architecture, developing a new technical service system, and implementation of the shared services concept. The Company has improved operating efficiencies by converting its communications architecture to faster, higher capacity data lines that combine voice and data transmissions while reducing overall communication costs. The Company has made substantial progress in the development of a new field service management tool for its technical service operations. This new tool will allow the Company to fundamentally change its technical service business processes, improving the Companys ability to coordinate the actions of its service technicians and enhancing customer service while reducing the overall cost of operations. An integral part of the Companys shared services concept is the consolidation and leveraging of distribution centers between the segments of the Company, which began in fiscal 2005. As of April 2007, the dental segment shares six distribution centers with one or both of the other operating units. In addition, the Company has begun to establish shared sales branch office locations between multiple segments, with the first location established in northern California. As a result of these and other efforts, the Company expects to continue to improve its operating leverage and efficiencies going forward. Growing Through Internal Expansion and Acquisitions. The Company intends to continue to grow by opening additional sales offices, hiring established sales representatives, hiring and training college graduates as territory sales representatives, and acquiring other distributors in order to enter new markets and expand its customer base. The Company believes that it is well positioned to take advantage of expected continued consolidation in the dental distribution market. Over the past 19 years the Company has made a number of acquisitions, including the following: Dental distribution acquisitions in the United States In August 1987, Patterson acquired the D.L. Saslow Co., which at the time was the third largest distributor of dental products in the United States. Between 1989 and 2005, Patterson acquired certain assets of 25 smaller dental dealers throughout the United States. During fiscal 2002, the Company acquired Thompson Dental Company of Columbia, SC, a leading value added distributor of dental supplies, equipment and services in the mid Atlantic and southeastern U.S. Thompson ranked among the 10 largest dental distributors in the country. In September 2005, the Company acquired Accu Bite, Inc., a Michigan based dental distributor with approximately 60 field sales representatives. Dental distribution acquisitions in Canada In October 1993, Patterson Dental completed the acquisition of Healthco International, Inc.s Canadian subsidiary, Healthco Canada, Inc. In August 1997, the Company acquired Canadian Dental Supply Ltd., which expanded the Companys market share in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario. In July 2002, the Company acquired Distribution Quebec Dentaire, Inc., augmenting the Companys market share in Quebec. As a combined operation known as Patterson Dental Canada Inc., this subsidiary, which the Company believes is one of the two largest full service dental products distributors in Canada, employs approximately 495 people, 130 of whom are sales representatives. Printed office products acquisitions In October 1996, Patterson acquired the Colwell Systems division of Deluxe Corporation. Colwell Systems, now known as Patterson Office Supplies, produces and sells a variety of printed office products used in medical, dental and veterinary offices, as well as other clinical based settings. Software acquisitions In July 1997, Patterson Dental acquired EagleSoft, Inc., a developer and marketer of Windows&reg; based practice management and clinical software for dental offices. EagleSofts operation, now known as the 7 Table of Contents Patterson Technology Center, is located in Effingham, Illinois. In December 2001, the Company purchased Modern Practice Technologies, a company that provides custom computing solutions to the dental industry. This acquisition helped Patterson to position itself to provide all of the custom hardware and networking required for interfacing the entire dental office. In May 2004, Patterson Dental acquired CAESY Education Systems, Inc., the leading provider of electronic patient education services to dental practices in North America. Headquartered in Vancouver, Washington, CAESY provides dental practices with a range of communications media that educate patients about professional dental care, procedures and treatment alternatives with the goal of influencing patient decisions about dental services and increasing the productivity of the dental professional. Educational materials are communicated through CD/DVD media, computer programs and the dentists web site. These materials can be used within the dental waiting room, at chair side and in the patients home. Products and Services The following table sets forth the sales by principal categories of products and services offered to dental segment customers: 2007 2006 2005 Consumable and printed products 56 % 55 % 54 % Equipment and software 35 36 37 Other (1) 9 9 9 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) Consists of other value added products and services including technical service and software maintenance. Consumable and Printed Products Dental Supplies. Patterson offers a broad product line of consumable dental supplies such as x ray film and solutions; impression materials; restorative materials (composites and alloys); hand instruments; sterilization products; anesthetics; infection control products such as protective clothing, gloves and facemasks; paper, cotton and other disposable products; toothbrushes and a full line of dental accessories including instruments, burs, and diamonds. In addition to representing a wide array of branded products from numerous manufacturers, Patterson also markets its own private label line of dental supplies including anesthetics, instruments, preventive and restorative products, and cotton and paper products. The private label line is used to compliment the branded products where the customer is seeking a lower cost alternative on a product that has become commoditized in the market. Compared to most name brand supplies, the private label line provides lower prices for the Companys customers and higher margins for the Company. Printed Office Products. Patterson Dental provides a variety of printed office products, office filing supplies, and practice management systems to office based healthcare providers including dental, veterinary and medical offices. Products include custom printed products, insurance and billing forms, stationery, envelopes and business cards, labels, file folders, appointment books and other stock office supply products. Products are sold through two channels: The Companys dental and veterinary supply sales force Direct mail catalogs distributed to over 100,000 customers several times a year A staff of telemarketing personnel located in Champaign, Illinois supports both channels. Orders are received by telephone, through the mail or electronically from the dental and veterinary distribution order processing system. 8 Table of Contents Equipment and Software Dental Equipment. Patterson Dental is the largest supplier of dental equipment in the U.S. and Canada. It offers a wide range of dental equipment products including x ray machines, high and low speed handpieces, dental chairs, dental handpiece control units, diagnostic equipment, sterilizers, dental lights and compressors. The Company also distributes newer technology equipment that provides customers with the tools to improve productivity and patient satisfaction. Examples of such innovative and high productivity products include the CEREC&reg; family of products, a chair side restoration system; digital x rays; and inter oral cameras. Software. Patterson develops and markets its own proprietary line of practice management and clinical software for dental professionals. Products include software for scheduling, billing, charting and capture/storage/retrieval of digital images. The Company also sells software products developed by third parties including Sidexis by Sirona and Dimax2 by Planmeca. These value added products are designed to help achieve office productivity improvements, which translate into higher profitability for the customer. Hardware. Patterson Dental offers custom hardware and networking solutions required for integrating the entire dental office. This product offering is available to all of the Companys dental customers. This initiative marked another step in Pattersons overall strategy of providing customers with the convenience and cost effectiveness of a virtually complete range of products and value added services and is one of the newest components of Pattersons single source solution for dental offices. Patient Education Services. The CAESY Education Systems line of products offers patient education products and services. These communications tools are designed to influence patient decisions about services in an efficient, cost effective manner. Other Software Services. The Company offers a variety of services to complement its software products such as service agreements, software training, electronic claims processing and billing statement processing. These services provide value to customers by allowing them to keep software products current, or receive payments more rapidly while obtaining greater productivity. Equipment Installation, Repair and Maintenance. To keep their practices running efficiently, dentists require reliable performance from their equipment. All major equipment sold by Patterson includes installation and Pattersons 90 day labor warranty at no additional charge. Patterson also provides complete repair and maintenance services for all dental equipment, whether or not purchased from Patterson, including 24 hour handpiece repair service. In addition to service technicians who provide installation and repair services on basic dental equipment, the Company has also invested in personnel who specialize in installing and troubleshooting issues with technology solutions such as practice management software, digital imaging products, hardware and networking. The goal of this group, which is comprised of both local service technicians and the Patterson Technology Center, is to help customers integrate newer technology into their dental practices. The Patterson Technology Center helps the customer minimize costly downtime by offering a single point of contact for post sale technology related issues. Dental Office Design. Patterson provides dental office layout and design services through the use of a computer aided design (CAD) program. Equipment specialists can create original or revised dental office designs in a fraction of the time required to produce conventional drawings. Customers purchasing major equipment items receive dental office design services at no additional charge. Equipment Financing. Patterson Dental provides a variety of options to fulfill its customers financing needs. For qualified purchasers of equipment, the Company will arrange financing for the customer through Patterson or a third party. For non equipment related needs, such as for working capital or real estate, customers are referred to a third party organization. This alternative allows the Company to offer its customers convenience 9 Table of Contents while still meeting their diverse financing needs. In fiscal 2007, the Company originated over $314 million of equipment finance contracts. The Company, or its vendor partner, financed approximately 37% of the equipment purchased by customers during fiscal 2007. Since November 1998, Patterson has maintained one or more finance referral agreements with an outside finance company to provide a more extensive selection of finance opportunities to its customers. This might include financing for practice transactions, working capital, leasing, real estate and long term capital. Currently this service is provided by GE Healthcare Financial Services. There are no recourse provisions under this agreement. Patterson receives referral fees under this agreement and GE Healthcare Financial extends credit and services the accounts. Patterson generally does not hold the installment sale contracts initiated on equipment transactions. These contracts are sold to either a commercial paper conduit managed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., or to a group of banks led by U.S. Bank National Association. Patterson created a special purpose entity (SPE), PDC Funding Company, LLC, a wholly owned and fully consolidated subsidiary, and entered into a Receivables Purchase Agreement in order to participate in the commercial paper conduit. The Company transfers installment sale contracts to the SPE. In turn, the SPE sells the contracts to the commercial paper conduit. The limit under this agreement, as amended, is $440 million of contract purchases. There is no recourse to the Company for contracts purchased by the commercial paper conduit, but there is a holdback by the conduit equal to 10% of the principal of these contracts. A second special purpose entity, PDC Funding Company II, LLC, can sell contracts through a Contract Purchase Agreement to a group of banks led by U.S. Bank. The agreement operates similarly to the Receivables Purchase Agreement described above, except that the holdback is equal to 6% of the principal and the capacity is $110 million. Patterson services the customer contracts under both of the preceding arrangements for which it receives a fee that approximates its cost for providing the service. Sales and Marketing During fiscal 2007, Patterson Dental sold products or services to over 120,000 customers in the U.S. and Canada who made one or more purchases during the year. Patterson Dentals customers include dentists, laboratories, institutions and other healthcare professionals. No single customer accounted for more than 1% of sales during fiscal 2007, and Patterson is not dependent on any single customer or geographic group of customers. The Companys sales and marketing efforts are designed to establish and improve customer relationships through personal interaction with its sales representatives and frequent direct marketing contact, which underscores the Companys value added approach. Patterson Dental has over 90 local offices throughout the U.S. and Canada so that it can provide a presence in the market and decision making near the customer. These offices, or branches, are staffed with a complete compliment of Patterson Dental capabilities, including sales, customer service and technical service personnel, as well as a local manager who has broad decision making authority with regard to customer related transactions and issues. The branches are grouped into seven regions in the U.S. and one in Canada. A primary component of Pattersons value added approach is its sales force. Due to the fragmented nature of the dental supply market, Patterson believes that a large sales force is necessary to reach potential customers and to provide full service. Sales representatives provide an informational link to the overall industry; assist practitioners in selecting and purchasing products and help customers efficiently manage their supply inventories. Each sales representative works within an assigned sales territory under the supervision of a location (branch) manager. Sales representatives are all Patterson employees and are generally compensated on a commission basis, with some, less experienced, representatives receiving a base salary and commission. 10 Table of Contents To assist its sales representatives, Patterson Dental publishes a variety of catalogs and fliers containing product and service information. Dental customers receive a full line product catalog containing over 30,000 inventoried items. The catalog includes pictures of products, detailed descriptions and specifications of products and is utilized by practitioners as a reference source. Selected consumable supplies, new products, specially priced items and high demand items such as infection control products are promoted through merchandise fliers printed and distributed bi monthly to the dental supply market. In addition, dental equipment sold by Patterson is featured in Pattersons tri yearly publication, Patterson Today, which also includes articles on dental office design, trends in dental practice, products and services offered by Patterson and information on equipment maintenance. To enhance the total value it brings to its customers, Patterson Dental created a value added benefit program for its preferred customers. The Patterson PlusSM program entitles its best dental customers to priority technical services, automated supply management systems at no charge, a variety of product discounts and reduced rates on financial products, practice management software and technical services. Distribution Patterson Dental believes that responsive delivery of quality supplies and equipment is a key element to providing complete customer satisfaction. Patterson ships dental consumable supplies from 10 strategically located distribution centers in the U.S. and Canada. Orders for consumable dental supplies can be placed by telephone or electronically 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Printed office products are shipped from the Companys manufacturing and distribution facility in Illinois. All orders are routed through Pattersons centralized computer ordering, shipping and inventory management systems, which are linked to each of the Companys strategically located distribution centers. If an item is not available in the distribution center nearest to the customer, the computer system automatically directs shipment of the item from another center. Rapid and accurate order fulfillment is another principal component of the Companys value added approach. Patterson Dental estimates that 98% of its consumable goods orders are shipped to the customer on time, which is generally within 24 hours. In order to assure the availability of Patterson Dentals broad product lines for prompt delivery to customers, Patterson must maintain sufficient inventories at its distribution centers. Purchasing of consumables and standard equipment is centralized and the purchasing department uses a real time perpetual inventory system to manage inventory levels. The Companys inventory consists mostly of consumable supply items. By utilizing its computerized inventory management and ordering systems, the Company is able to accurately predict inventory turns in order to minimize inventory levels for each item. Patterson Dentals more than 90 dental sales offices are generally configured with display areas where the latest dental equipment can be demonstrated. Dental equipment is generally custom ordered and is staged at the Companys sales offices before delivery to dental offices for installation. Sources of Supply Effective purchasing is a key strategy the Company has adopted in order to achieve its objective of continuing to improve profitability. The Company has a program to effectuate electronic data interchange (EDI) with its major vendor partners. In fiscal 2007, the Company processed 70% of its invoices from dental vendors using EDI capabilities. In addition, 60% of Pattersons dental purchase order volume was conducted employing EDI, which represented 65% of dental purchase order dollars placed during the fiscal year. Utilizing EDI allows the Company to improve efficiencies and reduce administrative costs. Patterson Dental obtains products from approximately 1,100 vendors in the dental segment. Patterson has exclusive distribution agreements with several quality dental equipment manufacturers including Sirona Dental Systems, Inc. for CEREC&reg; dental restorative systems and digital x rays. The Company is the only national dealer for A dec equipment, including chairs, units and cabinetry. A dec is the largest manufacturer of dental equipment in the U.S. 11 Table of Contents While the Company makes purchases from many suppliers and there is generally more than one source of supply for most of the categories of products sold by the Company, the concentration of business with key suppliers is considerable. The Companys top ten supply vendors accounted for approximately 41% and 40% of the cost of dental products sold in fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. Of these ten, the top two vendors accounted for 9% and 8%, and 9% and 9% of fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 cost of sales, respectively. Competition The highly competitive U.S. dental products distribution industry consists principally of national, regional and local full service and mail order distributors. The dental supply market is extremely fragmented. In addition to Patterson and one other national, full service firm, Sullivan Schein Dental, a unit of Henry Schein, Inc., there are at least 19 full service distributors that operate on a regional level, and hundreds of small local distributors. Also, some manufacturers sell directly to end users. The Company approaches its markets by emphasizing and delivering a value added model to the practitioner. To differentiate itself from its competition it deploys a strategy of premium customer service, a highly qualified and motivated sales force, experienced service technicians, an extensive breadth and mix of products and services, accurate and timely delivery of product, strategic location of sales offices and distribution centers, and competitive pricing. The Company also experiences competition in Canada in the dental supply market. The principal competitor is a national, full service dental distributor, Henry Schein Ash Arcona, a unit of Henry Schein, Inc. The Company believes it competes in Canada on essentially the same basis as in the United States. Veterinary Supply Overview Webster Veterinary, or Webster, is the leading distributor of veterinary supplies to companion animal (dogs, cats and other common household pets) veterinary clinics in the eastern United States. Management believes Webster is the second largest distributor of companion animal veterinary supplies nationally. In addition, through its fiscal 2005 acquisition of Milburn Distributions, Inc., Webster is the leading national equine distributor in the United States. Webster provides products used for the diagnosis, treatment and or prevention of diseases in companion pets and equine animals. Founded in 1946 and headquartered in Sterling, Massachusetts, Webster has developed a strong brand identity as a value added, full service distributor of a virtually complete range of consumable supplies, equipment, diagnostic supplies, biologicals (vaccines) and pharmaceuticals. Websters product offering, totaling more than 11,000 items, is sold by approximately 175 field sales representatives. In addition to its core business of distributing veterinary products, Webster has a significant agency commission business with a few large pharmaceutical manufacturers. Under the agency relationships, Webster typically earns a commission for soliciting orders through its sales force. In the agency relationship, Webster processes the order to the manufacturer but handles none of the product nor does Webster bill and collect from the customer. The agency commissions that Webster earns range from 3% to 10%, a portion of which is shared with the direct sales personnel. Websters agency commissions accounted for less than 2% of its net sales in fiscal 2007. Net sales by Webster in fiscal 2007 were $399.4 million. Operating income totaled $22.1 million. The Company estimates the market for pharmaceuticals and supplies sold to companion animal and equine veterinarians through distribution is approximately $2.8 billion on an annual basis. Based upon the estimated $2.8 billion market, the Company believes its share of this market is approximately 14%. Similar to the dental supply market, the veterinary supply market is fragmented and geographically diverse. There are approximately 79,000 veterinarians practicing at 27,000 animal health clinics. The vast majority, approximately 67% of veterinarians, work in private animal health clinics specializing in small animals, predominately companion pets. The average private veterinary practice generates approximately $770,000 of annual revenue. These practices 12 Table of Contents purchase between $80,000 and $120,000 of supplies each year, and similar to the dental practitioner, do not maintain a large supply of inventory on hand. The typical veterinary practice purchases approximately 80% of its supplies from its top two suppliers. The average purchase of consumables by the veterinary practice is noticeably higher than that of the dental practitioner due predominately to pharmaceutical products which are administered and dispensed by veterinarians. According to a market study prepared by KPMG LLP for three veterinary professional organizations in 1999, the demand for veterinary services has historically grown significantly faster than growth in the overall economy. Total expenditures for veterinary services in the United States grew at an inflation adjusted real annual rate of 7.2% from 1980 through 1997, and are projected to grow 5% on a real basis annually, through the year 2015. The companion pet segment is the fastest growing area of the overall U.S. veterinary supply market. The Company believes this growth is sustainable due to the following favorable factors: Number of households with companion animals. The number of households with companion animals is steadily expanding which increases the demand for veterinary services. Today, 63% of U.S. households own a companion pet compared with 56% in 1988. Overall, 45% of all households in the U.S. own more than one pet. Veterinary expenditures per household. The amount pet owners are willing to spend caring for their pets is increasing substantially. The American Pet Products Manufacturers Association estimates that pet owners will spend $38.4 billion in 2006 to care for the American pet population, or $555 per household. This is a 125% increase over the $17 billion spent in 1994. Veterinary products and techniques. Many new therapeutic and preventive products are being developed for the companion animal market. Technological developments have resulted in new innovative veterinary products and advances in veterinary services. Strategy Websters objective is to build a leading national position in the companion animal veterinary market through internal expansion and acquisitions, while continuing to improve its profitability and enhance its value to customers. Its key strategies and priorities for accomplishing this are to open new geographic markets, make acquisitions that expand market share, emphasize value added capabilities, consistently improve operating efficiencies and broaden the product offering. Growing Through Internal Expansion and Acquisitions. In April 2004, Webster acquired the assets of ProVet, which was the companion animal veterinary supply division of Lextron, Inc. ProVet was a distributor with locations in Indianapolis, Kansas City, Houston, Denver and Seattle. Management believes this acquisition made Webster the second largest distributor of companion animal veterinary supplies in the U.S. This acquisition added 44 sales representative territories expanding Websters geographic coverage to include the states of Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Colorado, Nevada, Idaho and Oregon. In addition, the acquisition increased market coverage in Washington state and Texas where Webster already had a presence. In October 2004, Webster acquired Milburn Distributions, Inc., the largest distributor specializing in the U.S. equine veterinary supply market. Milburns annualized sales exceed $50 million. The company operates facilities in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Texas and Florida. Most companion animal and large animal veterinary supply distributors have not successfully served the nations equine veterinarians due to the highly specialized nature of this niche market. Milburn has capitalized on this opportunity by focusing exclusively on the unique needs of equine veterinarians. In fiscal 2006, Webster grew through both an acquisition and greenfield expansion. In December 2005, it acquired Intra Corp., one of the nations leading developers of veterinary practice management software that is marketed under the IntraVet brand name. IntraVet has approximately 2,200 software installations nationwide and furthers Websters strategy of establishing a value added business platform similar to that of Patterson Dental. 13 Table of Contents Also in fiscal 2006, Webster developed business through a program of internal start ups, including operations in Ohio, Michigan and California. The expansion into California, which had been Websters largest unserved market, was particularly successful and made a solid contribution to Websters fiscal 2006 and 2007 sales results. Further expansion of Websters geographic marketplace is anticipated in the future. Emphasizing Value Added, Full Service Capabilities. Webster believes that veterinary customers value full service and responsive delivery of product, in addition to competitive prices. Customers also increasingly expect suppliers to be knowledgeable about products and services, and generally a superior sales representative can create a special relationship with the practitioner by providing an informational link to the overall industry. Websters knowledgeable sales representatives assist customers in the selection and purchasing of supplies. Most veterinarians are independent, or small unit based, practitioners who are unable to store and manage large volumes of supplies in their offices. Webster meets its customers requirements by delivering frequent, small quantity orders rapidly and reliably from its strategically located distribution centers. Continuing to Improve Operating Efficiencies. Webster continuously pursues opportunities to lower costs and improve efficiencies. As of April 2007, Webster shares three distribution facilities with one or both of the other operating units. In addition, a customer system that can be used by multiple business segments but maintains the same look and feel of the eMAGINE&reg; system has been fully deployed within the unit. The new system provides customer support staff with integrated customer information on one screen. Broaden the Product Line. Webster continuously seeks to broaden its portfolio of product offerings to maximize the opportunities within its existing customer base. For example, in the past year Websters expansion of its product offerings included the entire companion animal products lines of Bayer Animal Health and Novartis Animal Health, the parasiticides Tri Heart Plus, Iverhart Plus and Iverhart Max, Clavamox&reg; small animal antibiotic, the line of Purina Veterinary Diets&reg;, Continuum feline vaccines, Calicivax feline vaccines, Sogeval dermatolgic products, Reconcile separation anxiety medication for dogs, the SNAP 4DX diagnostic test, the small animal nutraceutical Dasuquin, equine vaccines Prevenile and Prestige IV Foal Shot, Dickies Medical Uniforms and the exclusive products Opticide disinfectant and Caniplas canine plasma. Webster also strives to consistently introduce innovative products. In fiscal 2005, Webster successfully launched its private label initiative to supply veterinary customers with quality consumable goods (white goods, exam gloves, sutures, surgical blades and microscope slides) at value prices. Private label offerings have been expanded since the initial launch and are expected to continue to grow. Management believes that product innovation allows Webster to maintain its competitive position and helps fuel internal growth. Management also believes that its emphasis on new product offerings enables its sales force to remain effective in creating demand among veterinarians. Broadening the product line also includes bringing new, innovative services to the customer to allow them to generate greater revenues and profitability from their practice. As Webster continues to expand and build its equipment business, it has added clinic and hospital design capabilities and technical service personnel to install and repair equipment that is sold by Webster as well as by others. With the fiscal 2006 acquisition of the IntraVet practice management software product, new services and revenue opportunities become possible. In addition, with the growth in the equipment and software business, there is an opportunity for additional financing transactions. Products and Services The following table sets forth the sales by principal categories of products and services offered to veterinary segment customers: 2007 2006 2005 Consumable and printed products 91 % 93 % 94 % Equipment and software 7 5 4 Other 2 2 2 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 14 Table of Contents Consumable and Printed Products Webster offers its customers a broad selection of veterinary supply products including consumable supplies, pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, and biologicals. Consumable supplies distributed by Webster include lab supplies, various types and sizes of paper goods, needles and syringes, gauze and wound dressings, sutures, latex gloves, orthopedic and casting products. Websters pharmaceutical products include anesthetics, antibiotics, injectibles, ointments and nutraceuticals. The diagnostics product category includes on site testing products for heartworm, FIV, FELV and Parvo virus. Biological products are comprised of vaccines and injectibles. Many of the office supply products sold to the dental supply market are also offered to the veterinary supply market. Equipment and Software Webster sells equipment for hospital, laboratory and general surgical use within the veterinary practice. Fiscal 2007 equipment sales increased 69% from fiscal 2006 and accounted for 7% of veterinary segment sales. Webster offers innovative, quality equipment that differentiates Webster from the competition. New equipment offerings in fiscal 2007 included the Fuji FCR XC Digital Radiography System, the VJ DR Digital X ray System, Accent CCD Digital Imaging System, ScanX Duo Dental Digital Imaging System, Acclaim Intraoral Camera, Unico centrifuges, Cardell Max 1 Anesthetic Monitor, MacroView Veterinary Otoscope, Idexx VetLab UA Analyzer and the petMap Blood Pressure unit. About 50% of veterinary equipment orders are drop shipped directly to the customer, of which 15% are custom ordered from the manufacturer. The balance of veterinary equipment is distributed in a fashion similar to consumable supplies. Other Other products and services include commissions on agency sales, equipment repair revenues, software maintenance contract revenue and freight recovery on shipments to customers. Sales and Marketing A primary component of Websters value added approach is its sales force. Due to the fragmented nature of the veterinary supply market, Webster believes that a large sales force is necessary to reach potential customers and to provide full service. Sales representatives provide an informational link to the overall industry, assist practitioners in selecting and purchasing products, and help customers efficiently manage their supply inventories. Each representative works within an assigned sales territory under the supervision of a location (branch) manager. Sales representatives are employees and are generally compensated on a commission basis, with some, less experienced, representatives receiving a base salary and commission. To assist its sales representatives, Webster publishes a catalog, which contains approximately 11,000 SKUs. This catalog includes detailed descriptions and specifications of products and is utilized by practitioners as a reference source. Selected consumable supplies, new products, specially priced items and high demand items are promoted through merchandise fliers printed and distributed monthly. Websters website was built upon the proven technology of the Patterson Dental website and the site allows customers the ability to order items twenty four hours a day, seven days a week. The website also incorporates value added functions that permit customers to check their invoice, payment and credit history, build a shopping list of frequently purchased items and track their order status. Distribution As of April 28, 2007, veterinary products were stocked and shipped out of 12 distribution centers within the Patterson Logistics distribution network. The distribution of veterinary products is complemented by telesales representatives who are responsible for processing approximately 70% of customer orders in this segment. In order to meet the rapid delivery requirements of customers, most consumable products are delivered within 24 hours. Webster estimates that approximately 97% of its consumable orders are delivered to the customer on time. 15 Table of Contents Sources of Supply Webster obtains products from nearly 550 vendors. While Webster makes purchases from many suppliers and there is generally more than one source of supply for most of the categories of products, the concentration of business with key suppliers is considerable. In fiscal 2007 and 2006, Websters top 10 veterinary supply manufacturers comprised 63% and 67%, respectively, and the single largest supplier comprised 19% and 19%, respectively, of the total cost of veterinary supply sales. Competition Within the companion pet market segment, competitors range from small local distributors to large national and regional full service companies, and to a lesser extent, mail order distributors or buying groups. Webster also competes directly with pharmaceutical companies who sell certain products directly to the customer. The Company approaches its markets by emphasizing and delivering a value added model to the practitioner. To differentiate itself from its competition it deploys a strategy of premium customer service, a highly qualified and motivated sales force, an extensive breadth and mix of products and services, accurate and timely delivery of product, strategic location of sales offices and competitive pricing. Rehabilitation Supply Overview Patterson Medical, formerly known as AbilityOne Corporation, is headquartered in Bolingbrook, Illinois and is the worlds leading distributor of rehabilitation medical supplies and non wheelchair assistive products. Patterson Medical believes it offers the most comprehensive range of distributed and self manufactured rehabilitation products to health care professionals globally. Its mission is to provide health care professionals and their patients with access to products that improve peoples lives by helping them to attain their highest achievable level of independence, safety and comfort. Patterson Medical operates as Sammons Preston Rolyan in North America and Homecraft in international markets. Patterson Medical serves as the gateway through which over 30,000 rehabilitation products originating from more than 2,000 suppliers and manufacturers are sold to a diverse customer base with an emphasis on physical therapists (PTs) and occupational therapists (OTs). It offers its customers a one stop shop through what it believes to be the most comprehensive catalog in the industry, the largest direct sales force and the categorys most efficient customer service and distribution operations. Major channels of distribution are acute care hospitals, long term care facilities, rehabilitation clinics, dealers and schools. In addition, Patterson believes Patterson Medicals reputation, global market presence and highly transferable business model will facilitate entry into new markets. Patterson Medical offers a wide range of differentiated, non invasive products and expertise to users and their health care providers, while focusing on niches, worldwide, where its capabilities, reputation and customer partnerships can result in a competitive advantage. Its goal is to become its customers first choice for rehabilitation medical supplies and assistive products in each of its chosen markets. Patterson Medical is highly diversified with no single product, customer or purchasing group representing a significant percentage of total revenue. In addition, given the relatively small average and median order size (approximately $225 and $70, respectively), Patterson Medicals products often do not represent a major expense category for its customers. In March 2002, Patterson Medical completed the acquisition of the Smith & Nephew Rehabilitation (SNR) division of Smith & Nephew plc, and in doing so, acquired the Rolyan, Homecraft and Kinetec brand 16 Table of Contents names. The SNR acquisition added 3,500 additional products, as well as a broad array of other brand names and proprietary products. The acquisition of SNR combined the two leading distributors of rehabilitation medical supplies to create what Patterson believes is the only one stop shop in the industry. Patterson Medical manufactures or has exclusively manufactured for it products representing approximately 25% of its total revenue and purchases products representing the remaining 75%. Approximately 80% of its revenue is in North America. Patterson Medical believes the rehabilitation medical supplies and assistive products industry is approximately $4.6 billion in the U.S. and $6.2 billion worldwide and is expected to grow 6% to 8% over the next several years. Industry growth is driven by strong growth in the physical and occupational therapy markets and favorable demographic trends associated with the aging of the baby boom generation. Patterson Medical does not compete in wheelchairs or scooters, a market estimated to be a combined $2.2 billion worldwide. Therefore, Patterson Medicals addressable market (defined as the collective market for products sold by Patterson Medical) is approximately $4.0 billion worldwide. Patterson Medical believes that it has an industry leading market share of approximately 5% in a highly fragmented rehabilitation and assistive products market. Patterson Medical believes that the demand for rehabilitation products will continue to be influenced by the following factors: Favorable Demographics. Favorable demographic trends such as extended life expectancy, active lifestyles and a general willingness to spend discretionary income on health care and well being, are expected to contribute to increased demand for products distributed by Patterson Medical. Specifically, the aging baby boomer population, together with their increased disposable income and desire for independence, will fuel product purchases to assist with the frailties associated with old age and provide sustained sales growth. The U.S. Census Bureau has projected the 85 and older population in the U.S. to more than triple from four million in 2000 to 14 million by 2040. The 65 to 84 year old population is expected to more than double during the same time period. Current trends indicate that these age groups represent the majority of home and community based health care patients. The aging of the population is a revenue growth driver because approximately 10% of people over the age of 65 and approximately 50% of people over the age of 85 need assistance with everyday activities. Patterson Medical believes it is well positioned to benefit from this trend by providing aids to daily living, namely dressing devices; toileting, dining, bathing aids; and grooming devices, all of which promote greater patient independence, improved patient responsibility and improved responsiveness to treatment. Increasing Number of PTs and OTs, Patterson Medicals Primary User Groups. According to the U.S. Department of Labor Occupational Outlook Handbook, there were approximately 132,000 PTs and 78,000 OTs in the U.S. in 2000. Approximately two thirds of PTs were employed in either hospitals or offices of physical therapists. The remaining one third of PTs was employed in home health agencies, outpatient rehabilitation clinics, physician offices and nursing homes. The majority of OTs works in hospitals, including many in rehabilitation and psychiatric hospitals. The remaining OTs work in outpatient occupational therapy offices and clinics, schools, home health agencies, nursing homes, community mental health centers, adult day care programs, job training services and residential care facilities. The demand for PTs and OTs is expected to remain strong largely driven by the (i) increase in the number of individuals with disabilities or limited function requiring therapy services; (ii) rapidly growing elderly population which is particularly vulnerable to chronic and debilitating conditions that require therapeutic services; (iii) baby boom generation which is entering the prime age for heart attacks and strokes, increasing the demand for cardiac and physical rehabilitation; (iv) advances in medical technology which permit treatment of more disabling conditions; and (v) widespread interest in health promotion. 17 Table of Contents Increasing Frequency of Reconstructive and Implant Surgery. Another important driver of the growth in the PT market is the growing need for rehabilitation products resulting from the increasing frequency of reconstructive implant procedures, including hip and knee replacements. The worldwide reconstructive implant market is currently in excess of $5.0 billion and expected to grow between 7% and 8% annually. This growth trajectory is largely driven by favorable demographics, as patient populations are expanding at both ends of the age spectrum. Among seniors, more active lifestyles and longer life expectancies are responsible for the increasing frequency of reconstructive implants. Younger patients are opting for reconstructive implants over less invasive alternatives due to improved and longer lasting implant technology. Patterson Medical believes it is well positioned to benefit from the growth in reconstructive implants, by providing orthopedic products, namely Continuous Passive Motion machines and splinting, which are critical to post operatory rehabilitation. International Operations Patterson Medicals international operations are based in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and are made up of two divisions: Homecraft in the U.K. and Kinetec in France. The international operations broadly reflect the same business model as used in the North American market. In the U.K., Homecraft operations include sales and marketing, customer service, distribution, purchasing and administration. In France, Kinetec is a self contained manufacturing unit with limited sales and marketing, distribution, administration and purchasing. Homecraft is a leading supplier of aids to daily living (ADL) and rehabilitation products in the U.K., and a significant player in the international markets. Having developed and designed many proprietary products, Homecraft is the prime source for numerous established and market leading ADL brands, including products sold under the Sammons Preston Rolyan brand. The Homecraft catalog offers a broad line of ADL, therapy, rehabilitation and pediatric products containing over 10,000 items. Their catalog is circulated to PTs, OTs, loan equipment stores and private clinics, trade outlets and the general public. Homecrafts central sales and marketing strategy is to provide a one stop shop proposition to hospitals, local government and trade customers throughout the U.K. Customers are reached through a combination of mail order, a 13 person sales force, telemarketing and in market promotional and exhibition activity. Kinetec consists of two operations, the manufacturing and distribution of Continuous Passive Motions machines (CPMs) for sale on a worldwide basis and the sale and distribution of Sammons Preston Rolyan and Homecraft products in France. Products are marketed to customers through product brochures, mailings, tele marketing and a 6 person sales force that covers the French rehabilitation market. Strategy Patterson Medicals objective is to be the customers first choice for rehabilitation medical supplies and non wheelchair assistive products in each of its chosen markets. It intends to grow through internal expansion and acquisitions in both rehabilitation and related products. In the second half of fiscal 2006, a new management team was installed and is responsible for accelerating the units adoption of Pattersons value added strategy. Emphasizing Value Added, Full Service Capabilities. Patterson Medical currently offers their customer a one stop shop for products through their industry leading catalog with over 20,000 items, focused primarily on physical and occupational therapy products. Patterson Medical adds new products each year to its ever expanding catalog and is committed to doing so long term. Consistent with Patterson Medicals current product offering, some of these new products are branded, exclusive or self manufactured. Patterson Medical recognizes that different customer groups have very different economic, product, distribution channel requirements and treatment goals. Patterson Medical proactively attempts to anticipate and flexibly respond to the diverse needs of its customers, while focusing on niches, worldwide, where its 18 Table of Contents capabilities, reputation and customer partnerships can result in a competitive advantage. As such, Patterson Medical foresees an on going evolution of its product offerings to meet the ever increasing demands of its diverse customer segments. Improving Operating Efficiencies. Patterson Medicals proprietary products, which consist of self manufactured products, products manufactured for Patterson Medical and products sold through exclusive distribution arrangements represent approximately 30% of total revenues. During fiscal 2007, Patterson Medical made investments in new sales and marketing programs as a part of its accelerated adoption of Pattersons value added strategy, including the expansion of its sales force and the establishment of a branch office structure. The Company believes these investments will result in additional sales and operating efficiencies in the future. As of April 2007, the unit is distributing products from four shared distribution facilities that distribute products of two or all three Patterson operating units. In addition, the first shared branch office location has been created in Northern California. This branch location includes both dental and rehabilitation segment personnel, while allowing the two units to share in certain common expenses. Growing Through Internal Expansion and Acquisitions. Patterson Medical believes it is well positioned to expand in its core markets. Patterson Medicals market presence, clinical understanding and close customer relationships allow Patterson Medical to anticipate and flexibly respond to the diverse needs of its customers. Patterson Medical believes its market knowledge, strong vendor relationships and manufacturing capabilities will continue to drive the delivery of value added solutions through the continual enrichment of its product mix. Additionally, Patterson Medical believes its broad portfolio of national accounts and commitment to expand its sales force will enhance Patterson Medicals growth and penetration within its current and new customer base. Patterson Medical acquired Homecraft and Kinetec as part of the SNR transaction. Patterson Medical is leveraging this platform to accelerate international expansion, in terms of both product lines and geographic regions. Since the SNR transaction, Patterson Medical has added over 550 pages of new products to the Homecraft catalog. Homecraft and Kinetec brought with them a proven capability to source products at very favorable costs and at high levels of quality from China, which has resulted in meaningful cost savings. Patterson Medicals management team believes its business model is transferable to other countries, and is using Homecraft to cultivate new relationships through an enhanced product array, sales effort, distribution capabilities and catalog expertise. In May 2004, Patterson Medical acquired the assets of Medco Supply Company, Inc., or Medco, from NCH Corporation. With sales of approximately $50 million, Medco is one of the nations leading sports medicine distributors and is based in Buffalo, New York. In addition to its sports medicine business, it sells first aid, safety and medical consumable products to commercial and institutional customers, as well as consumable supplies and equipment to podiatrists. The complete product offering includes approximately 10,000 SKUs that are sold through direct mail catalogs and 15 territory sales people. Medco markets to athletic trainers, schools and school nurses, daycare providers and healthcare professionals including podiatrists, chiropractors and physical therapists. During fiscal 2007, the unit acquired three dealer/distributors which are operating as branch offices. Patterson Medical operates in the highly fragmented rehabilitation medical supplies and non wheelchair assistive products industry. Patterson Medicals competition is generally either locally or regionally focused. Patterson Medical intends to opportunistically pursue expansion opportunities in order to add products, customers and capabilities, which will further differentiate Patterson Medical from its competition. 19 Table of Contents Products and Services The following table sets forth the sales by principal categories offered to rehabilitation segment customers: 2007 2006 2005 Consumable and printed products 72 % 72 % 74 % Equipment 23 23 22 Other 5 5 4 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % Consumable and Printed Products Patterson Medical offers a large selection of supply products that can be categorized as follows: Aids to Daily Living dressing devices, toileting, dining, bathing aids and grooming devices Orthopedic Soft Goods / Splints braces, splints and orthonics for protecting, supporting and positioning Clinical products that assist in the examination and treatment of patients, such as exercise bands, putty, weights balls and mats Mobility walkers, canes and wheelchair accessories such as gloves, trays and carrying bags Pediatric Seating and Positioning rolls, wedges, specialty seating and standers and mobility assistance products for special needs children. This category also includes sensory motor stimulation products such as toys, crafts and devices to assist with balance Modalities products for heating and cooling therapies, electrical stimulation, laser, ultrasound, paraffin, iontophoresis and therapeutic creams and lotions Equipment Rehabilitation equipment consists of exercise, examination, treatment and therapy equipment and furniture. These products include parallel bars, treatment tables, mat platforms, treadmills, stationary bicycles and CPMs. Sales and Marketing Its customers generally know Patterson Medical as Sammons Preston Rolyan in the U.S. and Canada, and Homecraft in the remainder of the world. The Sammons Preston Rolyan and Homecraft business models, which Patterson Medical employs in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., have successfully driven revenue growth and profitability. A core element of Sammons Preston Rolyans strategy is to maintain the most comprehensive single catalog of rehabilitation products and supplies. The catalog, published for over 50 years, is considered the gold standard of the industry and features the most comprehensive product offering with longstanding industry leading positions and recognized brand names. Patterson Medical has an experienced sales force, national account contracts with major customer groups, unmatched customer service within the industry and the proven ability to introduce new products each year, allowing Patterson Medical to compete across the entire spectrum of the rehabilitation medical supplies and non wheelchair assistive products industry. A key priority has been the expansion of the field sales force, which has grown by more than 45 sales representatives since late in fiscal 2006 and now totals more than 170 worldwide. New sales representatives are generally hired from the ranks of physical and occupational therapists, manufacturer representatives and others with extensive industry knowledge. 20 Table of Contents Patterson Medical began developing a branch office structure in fiscal 2007 through a combination of internal start ups and dealer/distributor acquisitions. Similar to a dental branch, these offices have a showroom, commissioned sales staff and service department that provides equipment installation, repair and warranty service for equipment manufacturers. As of April 2007, five branches had been established and this structure will continue to expand in fiscal 2008. Sammons Preston Rolyans national accounts group collaborates with its sales force to meet the changing needs of its expanding account base. The product management group works closely with customers, suppliers and the sales force to evaluate new products for inclusion in Sammons Preston Rolyans product offering. Sammons Preston Rolyan adds approximately 2,500 new products to the catalog each year. Sammons Preston Rolyans U.S. national accounts program is staffed by seasoned professionals who have developed a comprehensive portfolio of contracts. Furthermore, the integrated Sammons Preston Rolyan organization has national contracts with major purchasing groups within each submarket, including hospitals, nursing homes and dealers. For many years, Sammons Preston and SNR had the only national sales forces in the U.S. dedicated to the clinical education and sale of products to institutionally based PTs and OTs. With the acquisition and integration of SNR, Patterson Medicals clinical presence and sales capability have been enhanced with a broader product offering and a more complete range of proprietary brands. The Patterson Medical sales professionals, many of whom are therapists, are located throughout the U.S. and Canada. These sales professionals have utilized the extensive product line and the comprehensive national contracts portfolio to establish direct sales to U.S. hospitals, nursing homes and rehab clinics. Patterson Medical also sells to national healthcare distributors and local dealers. The rehabilitation medical supplies and non wheelchair assistive products that Patterson Medical offers are generally not subject to direct reimbursement pressures from Medicare and Medicaid. Patterson Medical does not engage in third party billing and collection activities, but sells to customers, including dealers, who provide this service. The rehabilitation medical supplies and non wheelchair assistive products industry is highly fragmented. No one manufacturer, distributor or customer represents a significant portion of Patterson Medicals revenue. Distribution Patterson Medicals distribution process centers on its ability to fill small unit size and small dollar amount orders. In the U.S., over 5,000 packages ship daily from six locations. A majority of products are shipped out of an eastern Pennsylvania distribution center that is shared between all three Patterson operating units. Patterson Medical moved into this facility during fiscal 2007, at which time an existing distribution center located in Bolingbrook, IL was closed. Certain high volume product is distributed from other multi segment facilities within the Patterson Logistics distribution network. Approximately 95% of the packages in the U.S. ship via UPS. Patterson Medicals call center operates from 7am 7pm Monday through Friday, processing in excess of 4,000 calls per day. Order entry capability from 7pm 7am from Monday through Friday and weekends exists through an offsite, third party contractor with limited systems access. The combination of in house staff, supplemented with contracted, third party services, provide customers with 24 hours a day, seven days a week ordering capabilities. In addition, fax orders and EDI capabilities support the larger, more technologically advanced customers, including dealers, hospitals and long term care facilities. While Internet ordering capabilities currently exist, customer reception to ordering products via the Internet is currently small, but growing. 21 Table of Contents Sources of Supply Among Patterson Medicals core strengths is its ability to obtain premier products from vendors. Patterson Medical purchases its products from over 2,000 suppliers and manufacturers. Although no single supplier accounted for more than 4% of Patterson Medicals total purchases in fiscal 2007, Patterson Medical frequently is the largest single customer of these manufacturers. Suppliers view the ability to distribute their products through Sammons Preston Rolyan and Homecraft positively due to reputation, longstanding industry leading position, comprehensive catalogs, national account contracts, and sales force presence and distribution capabilities. Patterson Medical continually works at strengthening its supplier relationships through the introduction of supplier programs. Competition Patterson Medical believes it is the only national player to offer, one stop shopping to its customers. Patterson Medicals competition is generally highly fragmented, locally or regionally focused and without the product offering necessary to be a one stop shop. Patterson Medicals national and international scale and purchasing power provide Patterson Medical with a favorable cost position and strong pricing trends relative to its competition.

Patterson Companies, Inc. Trademarks Patterson has registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office the trademarks Patterson&reg;, PDXpress&reg;, EagleSoft&reg; and eMAGINE&reg;. With the addition of Patterson Medical, the Company acquired the marks Sammons, Preston, Roylan, Homecraft and numerous other tradenames and trademarks. The Company believes that the Patterson trademark is well recognized in the dental products industry and by dental professionals, and is therefore a valuable asset of the Company. Employees As of April 28, 2007, the Company had approximately 6,580 employees. Patterson has not experienced a shortage of qualified personnel in the past, and believes that it will be able to attract such employees in the future. None of Pattersons employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements or represented by a union. The Company considers its relations with its employees to be good.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS The following list describes several risk factors that are unique to our company. The risk factors described below should be carefully considered, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K and other documents filed with the SEC. These risk factors are being disclosed based on instructions set forth in Item 503(c) of Regulation S K. 24 Table of Contents We compete in distribution industries that are highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully. Our competitors include numerous manufacturers and distributors. Some of our competitors may have different resources than we do, which could allow them to compete more successfully. Many of our products are available from several resources and our customers tend to have relationships with several different distributors. Competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular products, which we would then be unable to market. Our failure to compete effectively may limit and or reduce our revenues, profitability and cash flow. Acquisitions of businesses could negatively impact our profitability and return on invested capital. As a part of our business strategy, we have acquired businesses in the ordinary course and expect to continue acquiring businesses in the future. These acquisitions can involve a number of risks and challenges, any of which could cause significant operating inefficiencies and adversely affect our growth and profitability. Such risks and challenges include underperformance relative to our expectations and the price paid for the acquisition; unanticipated demands on our management and operational resources; difficulty in integrating personnel, operations and systems; retention of customers of the combined businesses; assumption of contingent liabilities; and acquisition related earnings charges. Our international operations are subject to risks that could adversely affect our operating results. There are a number of risks inherent in foreign operations, which include regulatory, economic and political requirements and changes. Additionally, foreign operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations that could impact our results of operations and financial condition based on the movements of the applicable foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. Dollar. Our future operating results can be affected by our relationships with our sales representatives and vendors and manufacturers of products that we distribute. The inability to attract or retain qualified sales personnel or build or maintain relationships with vendors and manufacturers of products that we distribute may have an adverse effect on our business. We sell products that could be subject to market and technological obsolescence. We carry over 100,000 different product stock keeping units. Some of these products are subject to technological obsolescence that may not be within the control of the Company since we do not manufacture the products. If we were no longer able to sell these products due to customers making decisions not to buy them, we may have to record expense related to the diminution in value of inventories we have in stock that would adversely impact our operating results. Audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non U.S. tax authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities. We are subject to a variety of litigation that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to a variety of litigation incidental to our business, including claims for damages arising out of the use of products we distribute, claims relating to intellectual property matters, and claims involving employment matters. We are also subject to securities litigation. 25 Table of Contents The defense of these lawsuits may divert our managements attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired. Our balance sheet includes goodwill and other intangible assets. Under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, if impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets is determined we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the period of such determination. We are exposed to the risk of an increase in interest rates. Our balance sheet includes variable rate long term debt and certain non current assets that are sensitive to movements in short term interest rates. The variable rates are comprised of LIBOR plus a spread and reset on certain dates, as prescribed by the respective agreements. Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. Item 2. PROPERTIES The Company owns its principal executive offices in St. Paul, Minnesota, and the majority of its distribution and manufacturing facilities. Leases of other distribution, manufacturing and administrative facilities generally are on a long term basis, expiring at various times, with options to renew for additional periods. Most sales offices are leased for varying and usually shorter periods, with or without renewal options. The Company believes its properties are in good operating condition and are suitable for the purposes for which they are being used. Patterson Logistics Services Effective at the beginning of fiscal 2007, the majority of the assets used to distribute product that were previously owned and operated by individual business units were transferred to a wholly owned subsidiary of Patterson Companies, Inc. The new entity, Patterson Logistics Services, Inc. (PLSI) operates the distribution function for the benefit of all three of the sales and marketing business units. As of April 28, 2007, PLSI operates 18 distribution centers totaling approximately 900,000 square feet of distribution space as follows: 2 dental distribution centers located in Indiana and Iowa. 9 veterinary distribution centers. Sales and administrative personnel for the veterinary segment generally share space with PLSI in these distribution facilities, which are located in Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Missouri and Texas. 1 rehabilitation distribution center in New York State. 3 distribution centers located in California, Florida and Texas, which stock and distribute both dental and rehabilitation product. 2 distribution centers which stock and distribute dental and veterinary products, located in South Carolina and Washington state; and, 26 Table of Contents 1 distribution center located in eastern Pennsylvania distributes product for all three of the business units. This location replaced nearby dental and veterinary distribution centers, as well as the primary rehabilitation distribution center in Illinois. Approximately 80% of the of the PLSI distribution center space is owned. Dental Supply In addition to the locations operated by PLSI, Patterson Dental utilizes an owned location in Illinois used to manufacture and ship printed office products. The dental sales operations in Canada are supported by distribution centers located in Quebec and Alberta, Canada. The dental supply segment is headquartered in the Companys principal executive offices. This segment also maintains sales and administrative offices inside the United States at approximately 90 locations in over 40 states and at 10 locations in Canada. Substantially all of these locations are leased. Veterinary Supply Headquartered in Sterling, Massachusetts, Webster Veterinarys sales and administrative personnel generally reside within the PLSI distribution center locations. Rehabilitation Supply Patterson Medical is headquartered in Bolingbrook, Illinois. Distribution of product in North America is generally performed at PLSI operated locations. Domestically, the rehabilitation supply segment maintains manufacturing facilities in Wisconsin, New York and South Carolina. In fiscal 2007, five branch sales offices were established through acquisitions and internal start ups. These branch offices are located in New York, North Carolina, Louisiana, Illinois and California. The California location is shared with branch operations of the dental supply segment. Internationally, this segment has facilities located in the U.K., France and Canada. Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Commencing in August 2005, five purported class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, naming the Company and certain officers and directors and alleging certain violations of the federal securities laws. On August 31, 2005, the Court entered an order consolidating the cases into a single action captioned In Re Patterson Companies, Inc. Securities Litigation docketed as File No. 05cv1757 DSD/NMJ. On September 16, 2005, a derivative lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota captioned Vance Cadd, Derivatively On Behalf of Patterson Companies, Inc. vs. James W. Wiltz, et al., docketed as File No. 05 cv 02155 RHK/AJB. This lawsuit named certain officers and directors of the Company as defendants and alleged breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment. On October 11, 2005, a class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota captioned Tamara Dolliver, On Behalf of Herself and All Others Similarly Situated vs. Patterson Companies, Inc., et al docketed as File No. 05 cv 02383 JNE/SRN. This class action lawsuit was brought on behalf of the participants in the Companys Employee Stock Ownership Plan against the Company and certain officers and directors, and alleged violations of the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The Cadd and Dolliver cases were predicated on essentially the same factual allegations alleged in, and are related cases to, the class action lawsuits consolidated as In Re Patterson Companies, Inc. Securities Litigation. In March 2006, pursuant to the Courts order, lead plaintiffs were selected in In Re Patterson Companies, Inc. Securities Litigation and Amended Complaints were filed in all three cases. On May 30, 2006, the Company 27 Table of Contents filed its Motion to Dismiss all three cases. On March 20, 2007, the Court granted the Companys Motion to Dismiss with prejudice in the Securities and ERISA case, and granted the Motion to Dismiss without prejudice in the Derivative case (the Cadd case). A notice of appeal was timely filed only in the Cadd case. The Company believes that the allegations made in the Cadd case are without merit and it intends to continue to vigorously defend the claim. The Company has also been involved in various product related and employment related legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Some of these proceedings involve product liability claims arising out of the use of dental products manufactured by third parties and distributed by the Company. The Company believes that if any such product liability cases were determined in favor of the claimants, the manufacturers of such products would have primary responsibility for any damages because Patterson is a distributor of finished goods manufactured by third parties. In the event a manufacturer of a defective product is unable to pay a judgment for which the Company may be jointly liable, the Company could have liability for the entire judgment. Since May 1985, the Company has maintained product liability insurance coverage for any potential liability for claims arising out of products sold by the Company. The Company believes that any liabilities which might result from claims relating to events occurring after May 1985, would be adequately covered by such insurance and that any unfavorable results in such cases would not have a material adverse effect on the Companys business or financial condition. With respect to claims relating to events occurring prior to May 1985, the agreement providing for the acquisition of Patterson from The Beatrice Companies, Inc. provides that Beatrice and its successors are obligated to indemnify the Company for losses exceeding a litigation reserve established at the time of the acquisition. To date, the successor to Beatrice has not been asked to indemnify the Company regarding any matters. Although the Company has insurance coverage for product liability claims relating to events occurring after May 1985 and may be entitled to indemnification from third parties under certain circumstances, any additional litigation could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business or financial condition in the future. Item 4.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview The Companys fiscal 2007 financial information is summarized in this Managements Discussion and Analysis, the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the related Notes. The following background is essential to more fully understand the Companys financial information. Patterson operates a distribution business in three complementary markets: dental supply, veterinary supply and rehabilitation supply. Historically the Companys strategy for growth focused on internal growth and the acquisition of smaller distributors and businesses offering related products and services to the dental market. In fiscal 2002, the Company expanded its strategy to take advantage of a parallel growth opportunity in the veterinary supply market by acquiring the assets of J. A. Webster, Inc. on July 9, 2001. The Company added a third component to its business platform in fiscal 2004 when it entered the rehabilitation supply market with the acquisition of AbilityOne Products Corp. (AbilityOne) on September 12, 2003. AbilityOne is now known as Patterson Medical. The historical operating performance of the veterinary supply and rehabilitation supply businesses are somewhat different than the dental supply business. Operating margins of the veterinary business are considerably lower than the dental supply business. While operating expenses run at a lower rate in the veterinary business, its gross margin is substantially lower. Veterinary gross margins have been in the low to mid 20s as compared to dental gross margins in the mid 30s. The rehabilitation business has realized gross margins in the high 30s to low 40s. There are several important aspects of the Companys business, including: (1) market growth in the various markets it operates; (2) internal growth; (3) growth through acquisition; and (4) continued focus on controlling costs and enhancing efficiency, that are useful in analyzing the Company. Management defines internal growth as the increase in net sales from period to period, excluding the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, and excluding the net sales, for a period of twelve months following the transaction date, of businesses that it has acquired. With these factors in mind, management has established certain operating objectives, which include increasing net sales four percentage points faster than the average market growth rate at each business unit and improving operating margins by 50 basis points annually. In response to lower than expected operating results at Patterson Medical, the Company put a new management team into place during the second half of fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2007, the Company committed a portion of its operating leverage improvement to investments in the sales and marketing organization at Patterson Medical, which entailed a significant expansion of the sales force as well as other marketing initiatives. The actions in fiscal 2007 at Patterson Medical were expected to diminish the opportunity to expand operating margins by 50 basis points. In addition, fiscal 2007 operating results include expense of $7.8 million from the adoption of FASB Statement No. 123(R) at the beginning of the year. 32 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table summarizes the consolidated results of operations over the past three fiscal years as a percent of sales: 2007 (a) 2006 2005 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 65.4 % 65.0 % 64.4 % Gross margin 34.6 % 35.0 % 35.6 % Operating expenses 22.6 % 22.6 % 23.1 % Operating income 12.0 % 12.4 % 12.5 % Other income, net 0.3 % 0.2 % 0.2 % Interest expense 0.5 % 0.5 % 0.6 % Income before taxes 11.8 % 12.1 % 12.1 % Income taxes 4.3 % 4.5 % 4.5 % Net income 7.5 % 7.6 % 7.6 % (a) Includes a 30 basis point impact of share based compensation expense from the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) in fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 Net Sales. Net sales for the year ended April 28, 2007 totaled $2,798.4 million, an increase of 7.0% from $2,615.1 million in fiscal 2006. The favorable impact of foreign currency translation on sales growth was 0.5%. Acquisitions contributed approximately one percentage point to sales growth. The Company acquired Accu Bite in September 2005. This business included both a field sales organization similar to our traditional dental sales model, as well as a low margin telesales business. For approximately eight months of fiscal 2006, from the date of acquisition through the end of fiscal year, the dental segment operated Accu Bites telesales business. In early May 2006, the telesales operations were closed for business reasons. In closing the business, as much of the sales volume that could be, was moved into the field organization. However, as the Company expected, much of this sales volume went to dental suppliers who approach the market with a low price model. The closing of the telesales business had a negative impact on consolidated fiscal 2007 sales growth of approximately one percentage point. Sales of our dental supply unit increased 5.0% in fiscal 2007 to $2,064.6 million. Sales of dental consumable supplies grew 5.7%. The Accu Bite telesales negative impact on sales growth of the dental units total sales and sales of consumable supplies was approximately 1.5% and 2.5%, respectively. Equipment sales grew 1.6%, led by basic equipment growth of 6.1%. Largely offsetting the increase in basic equipment growth was a decline in the sales of CEREC&reg; 3D dental restorative systems. Late in the third quarter of fiscal 2007, CERECs manufacturer, Sirona, introduced several important enhancements. First, CERECs software was significantly improved; making it easier to design highly aesthetic and precise restorations, while also greatly streamlining the systems learning curve. In addition, a faster and more robust milling unit was introduced as an option on new installations, as well as an upgrade to all existing CEREC users. The Company believes the news of the impending enhancements to CEREC, which reached the market early in fiscal 2007, as well as the timing of the introduction at the end of the third fiscal quarter, and the process of transitioning to these upgraded features, which was still underway at the end of fiscal 2007, had a negative impact on sales throughout the year. Other dental sales, consisting primarily of technical service parts and labor, software support services and teeth, grew 14.1% in fiscal 2007. 33 Table of Contents Sales at the Webster Veterinary unit grew 15.4% to $399.4 million from $346.1 million. The business has strategically emphasized expansion of its value added platform, including its equipment and software initiatives. Websters core consumables business performed well throughout the year and equipment and software increased 69.6%. Excluding the acquisition impact of Intra Corp, developer and marketer of IntraVet&reg; practice management software, total veterinary sales exceeded prior year sales by 14.2%. Patterson Medical consistently grew sales throughout the year, improving 10.7% over fiscal 2006. Three acquisitions related to the units branch office strategy contributed 3 percentage points of the growth and foreign currency translation added an additional 1.5% of sales improvement. During fiscal 2007 Patterson Medical established five full service branch offices in selected markets through acquisitions and internal start ups. Additional acquisitions and internal start ups are under consideration as the business continues to increase its sales force and add programs and systems to advance their value added offerings. Gross Margin. Consolidated gross margin declined 40 basis points in fiscal 2007 to 34.6%, primarily due to lower margins of Patterson Medical. In addition, the sales growth of Webster Veterinary outpaced both the dental and rehabilitation segments, resulting in a dilutive impact to consolidated gross margin, since Veterinary gross margins are lower than the other two businesses. The Dental segments gross margin improved 20 basis points in fiscal 2007. The closing of the Accu Bite telesales business which operated for eight months in fiscal 2006 and was dilutive to overall dental gross margin during that period, acted to improve Dental gross margins in 2007. The telesales business produced substantially lower gross margins than the traditional dental sales operations. A decline in sales of the high margin CEREC dental restorative systems during fiscal 2007 negatively impacted gross margin. The gross margin of the Veterinary business decreased by 10 basis points over fiscal year 2006. The negative impact on gross margin of lower agency commissions and vendor rebates in fiscal 2007 was mostly offset by the sales growth of equipment and software, which carry higher margins than core consumables. Patterson Medicals gross margin declined 250 basis points due to several factors. Higher freight costs have impacted this business more than the Dental and Veterinary segments due to the nature of the average order size and related package levels. In addition, this segment has fixed price contracts with certain large group customers and price increases from vendors created some margin compression in this customer group. These contracts are renewed periodically, at which time pricing may be renegotiated to address changes in vendor pricing. Many of the contracts were amended in the latter part of fiscal 2007. A third factor in the gross margin decline at Patterson Medical is that the business hired a number of new sales representatives during the past fiscal year who have been given some short term latitude to establish their book of business through discretionary discounting. This latitude will be phased out as these new representatives reach their sales targets. Operating Expenses. The consolidated operating expense ratio remained unchanged from a year ago at 22.6%, however the ratio in fiscal 2007 was negatively impacted by 30 basis points due to $7.8 million of share based compensation expense related to the Companys adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) in fiscal 2007. Excluding the impact of SFAS No. 123(R), the Dental segment experienced a 10 basis point improvement in its operating expense ratio. The Veterinary segment experienced a 60 basis points decrease in its operating expense ratio, due primarily to leverage on sales growth. In addition, during fiscal 2006 the business incurred costs from the initial expense structure of its greenfield expansion into California. Fiscal 2007 was a year of investment for Patterson Medical in sales and marketing personnel and programs, however the business was able to maintain their operating expense ratio due to growth in sales. Operating Income. Operating income was $335.7 million, or 12.0% of net sales. Excluding $7.8 million of expense under SFAS No. 123(R), operating income was 12.3% of net sales, totaling $343.4 million, an increase of 6.3% from $323.0 million in fiscal 2006. 34 Table of Contents Interest Expense. Interest expense was $14.2 million compared to $13.4 million in fiscal 2006. For more than half of fiscal 2006, an interest rate swap on $100 million of variable rate debt effectively fixed interest rate expense on the $100 million at 2.6% until the agreement terminated in November 2005. The average debt balance carried in fiscal 2007 was lower than fiscal 2006; however, the weighted average interest rate on the $100 million of variable rate debt was approximately 6.0% in fiscal 2007, resulting in an overall increase in interest expense. Other Income, net. Other income, net of other expenses, increased to $8.1 million from $7.3 million. Composed primarily of finance interest income in both years, the increase was due primarily to higher interest rates. Income Taxes. The effective income tax rate was 36.8% in fiscal year 2007 compared to 37.4% in the prior year. During fiscal 2007, the Company finalized several years of Canadian income tax returns and the reversal of related tax reserves lowered the effective income tax rate by approximately one percentage point. The impact of SFAS No. 123(R) on our effective tax rate partially offset the finalization of the Canadian tax returns since certain compensation expense under SFAS No. 123(R) is non deductible. Earnings Per Share. Earnings per diluted share of $1.51 represents an increase of $0.08 or 5.6% from the $1.43 earnings per share reported in fiscal 2006. The adoptions of SFAS No. 123(R) in fiscal 2007 lowered earnings per share by $0.05. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 Net Sales. Net sales for the year ended April 29, 2006 totaled $2,615.1 million, an 8.0% increase from $2,421.5 million reported for the previous year. The Company utilizes a fifty two, fifty three week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in April. Due to the Companys fiscal year policy, fiscal 2005 included an additional or fifty third week as compared to fiscal 2006. The Company estimates the additional week in fiscal 2005 had a one to two percentage point adverse impact on the growth rate in fiscal 2006. Sales of our largest business unit, dental supply, increased 7.2%. Excluding the impact of the Accu Bite acquisition and favorable foreign currency exchange translation related to our Canadian operations, sales grew approximately 4% in fiscal 2006. Sales of dental consumable supplies experienced strong growth of 9.5%. Excluding the 4.1 percentage point impact to growth from the Accu Bite acquisition, and considering the additional week in fiscal 2005, consumables growth was on the high end of our of estimated market growth rate of 5% to 7%. Equipment sales growth of 3.7% was below historic norms. In the second half of fiscal 2006, programs were implemented to improve the sluggish sales performance for basic equipment, such as chairs, units, cabinetry and lights, back to more historic growth rates. With respect to new technology equipment, digital radiography continued to see significant practitioner demand and related sales grew 20% compared to fiscal 2005. Sales of the CEREC&reg; 3D dental restorative system were virtually unchanged from fiscal 2005. Sales of other services and products, including parts, technical service, software support and insurance e claims, grew 8.2% in fiscal 2006. Sales at the Webster Veterinary unit grew 18.6% to $346.1 million from $292.0 million. The impact from the October 2004 Milburn and December 2005 IntraVet acquisitions was approximately $24.7 million, or 8.5 percentage points of the growth. Websters sales growth was strong throughout the year and was complimented by several factors. First, the business began its greenfield expansion into the large California market, which represents its most successful greenfield initiative to date. Second, for the past few years, Webster has been 35 Table of Contents laying the groundwork for expanding its position in the equipment market and this growing emphasis resulted in strong results. Equipment sales for the year grew 49% from fiscal 2005. Finally, another source of growth in fiscal 2006 sales were new pharmaceutical distribution agreements, including a canine pain medication previously sold direct by the manufacturer. Patterson Medicals sales growth was only 2.3%. A modest improvement in North American sales was largely offset by a slight decline in sales of the overseas operations. In the second half of fiscal 2006, a new management team was put in place and a range of strategic initiatives were begun. Late in the third quarter, a small, non core portion of the segment was sold which also negatively impacted the growth rate of sales. Gross Margin. Consolidated gross margin declined 60 basis points in fiscal 2006 to 35.0%. Sales from the Webster Veterinary unit made up a larger portion of sales in fiscal 2006 due to its strong sales growth. Because gross margin at the Veterinary unit is lower than both the Dental and Medical units, the units sales growth had a dilutive effect on consolidated gross margin. The Dental units gross margin decrease of nearly 50 basis points was largely due to the acquisition of Accu Bite. Acquired territory sales reps were integrated within existing Patterson branches, however, Accu Bite also had a telesales operation that was not integrated and produced substantially lower gross margins than the traditional dental sales operations. The telesales business was shutdown in early May of 2006, however, it did operate from the September 2005 date of acquisition through the end of fiscal 2006. The gross margin of the Veterinary business was virtually unchanged. A full year of Milburn operations, which carry lower margins than the historical Webster business, were included in fiscal 2006 results compared to approximately six months in fiscal 2005 and negatively impacted the overall gross margin of the unit. However, this impact was largely offset by the sales growth of equipment and software, which carry higher margins than the rest of the units product offerings. Patterson Medicals gross margin fell 100 basis points, largely due to sales mix, including lower sales levels of the overseas operations, which have carried higher gross margins than the North American operations. Operating Expenses. The consolidated operating expense ratio decreased to 22.6%, down 50 basis points from 23.1% in fiscal 2005. The Dental segment experienced a 30 basis point decrease, reflecting operating leverage on additional sales and reduced incentive compensation. This improvement was partially offset by costs associated with the integration of the Accu Bite acquisition. The Veterinary segment also improved its operating expense ratio by 30 basis points, due primarily to operating leverage on improved sales. Costs associated with the initial expense structure of the California greenfield expansion somewhat offset this improvement. The operating expense ratio at Patterson Medical declined by 170 basis points due to lower levels of amortization of intangibles. Consolidated amortization expense in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 was $7.0 million and $12.2 million, respectively. The $5.2 million decrease was due primarily to amortization on certain intangible assets related to the acquisition of Patterson Medical, some of which were being amortized on an accelerated basis due to their period of benefit. Operating Income. Operating income increased 6.9% and decreased 10 basis points as a percent of sales. As discussed above, consolidated gross margins declined 60 basis points, while the consolidated operating expense ratio improved 50 basis points. 36 Table of Contents Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased from $15.1 million to $13.4 million. The average debt balance carried in fiscal 2006 was lower than in fiscal 2005 because the Company paid down substantial amounts of debt near the end of fiscal 2005. However, in November 2005, an interest rate swap on $100 million of variable rate debt terminated. This swap had existed throughout all of fiscal 2005 and under the terms of the agreement, the Company effectively paid a low, fixed rate on the variable rate debt. Due to the termination of the swap agreement and rising interest rates, the Company experienced a higher weighted average interest rate in fiscal 2006 and was not able to recognize significantly lower levels of interest expense as compared to fiscal 2005. Other Income, net. Other income, net of other expenses, was consistent year over year. Composed primarily of finance interest income in both years, net other income was $7.3 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $6.5 million in fiscal 2005 and results primarily from the growth of the business. Income Taxes. The effective income tax rate was 37.4% in both fiscal years 2006 and 2005. The Companys effective tax rate is higher than the statutory federal rate primarily because of state, local and international taxes the Company must pay. Earnings Per Share. Earnings per share increased to $1.43, up $0.11 or 8% from the $1.32 earnings per share reported in fiscal 2005. Liquidity and Capital Resources Pattersons operating cash flow has been the Companys principal source of liquidity in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005. Operating activities generated cash of $243.5 million in fiscal 2007 compared with $164.0 million in fiscal 2006 and $207.3 million in fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2006, the Company did not sell approximately $30 million of short duration finance contracts that were generated as a part of our traditional calendar year end financing programs. These contracts have an average maturity of less than 24 months and will generate interest income at rates approximating what cash would earn, thus the Company elected not to incur the administrative expense of selling these contracts. Had these contracts been sold, cash from operations would have been approximately $200 million. The majority of the principal balance on these contracts has been collected from customers as of fiscal 2007 year end. Capital expenditures were $19.5, $49.2 and $31.5 million in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Fiscal 2006 included several significant projects, including expenditures for shared distribution centers in Kent, WA and eastern Pennsylvania. In addition, 2006 included expenditures for a new distribution facility for the Patterson Medical operations in the U.K. The Company expects to invest approximately $30 million in capital expenditures during fiscal 2008, including the expansion of an existing distribution center to accommodate multiple business units, and the continuing expansion of information systems. Two buildings were sold during fiscal 2007, with proceeds totaling $9.2 million. One building was the former distribution facility for Patterson Medicals U.K. operations and the other was a vacant building acquired in the acquisition of AbilityOne. Cash used for acquisitions totaled $12.7 million in fiscal 2007 and included the acquisition of three dealer/distributors by Patterson Medical as well as earn outs on acquisitions from previous years. The $39.2 million invested in fiscal 2006 included the acquisitions of Accu Bite and IntraCorp. In fiscal 2005, the Company used $72.9 million of cash for acquisitions, including Medco, CAESY and Milburn. A cash payment of $100 million was made to Sirona in fiscal 2006, representing a distribution fee that extends the Companys exclusive North American distribution agreement of Sironas CEREC equipment for a ten year period which begins in October 2007. 37 Table of Contents The Company did not repurchase any of its common stock in fiscal years 2007, 2006 or 2005, but does have authorization from the board of directors to repurchase up to six million shares. This authorization expires September 30, 2009. During fiscal 2007, the Company loaned its ESOP $105 million, which was used by the ESOP to purchase approximately 3.2 million shares of the Companys common stock on the open market. Payments on long term debt were $120 million in fiscal 2007. In addition to $70 million of fixed rate debt that matured during the year and $20 million of scheduled payments on its variable rate bank term loans, the Company paid off the remaining $30 million of the term loans near the end of the fiscal year. An amount of $200 million is available to the Company under this revolving credit facility until November 2008. For fiscal 2008, $50 million of fixed rate private notes loan repayments are scheduled. Management continues to expect funds generated from operations and existing cash and short term investments to be sufficient to meet the Companys working capital needs for the next fiscal year. The Company expects to continue to obtain liquidity from the sale of its equipment finance contracts. The Companys short term and long term debt facilities are believed to be adequate as a supplement to internally generated cash flows to fund anticipated expansion plans and strategic initiatives. The Company sells a significant portion of its installment sale contracts to a commercial paper funded conduit managed by a third party bank, and as a result, commercial paper is indirectly an important source of liquidity for the Company. The Company is allowed to participate in the conduit due to the quality of its finance contracts and its financial strength. Cash flow could be impaired if the Companys financial strength diminished to a level that precluded the Company from taking part in this facility or other similar facilities. The Companys financing business is described in further detail in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Contractual Obligations A summary of the Companys contractual obligations as of April 28, 2007 follows (in thousands): Payment due by year Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Long Term Debt $ 180,024 $ 50,014 $ 130,010 Operating Leases 52,079 12,633 22,396 $ 12,059 $ 4,991 For a more complete description of our contractual obligations, please see Notes 7 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Outlook Over the last ten years, the Company has been able to grow revenue and earnings through its strategy of emphasizing its value added, full service capabilities, using technology to enhance customer service, continuing to improve operating efficiencies, and growing through internal expansion and acquisitions. The Companys growth strategy will continue to focus on these key elements. Maintaining financial flexibility is also a key component of the Companys future growth. With strong operating cash flow and available credit capacity, the Company is confident that it will be able to financially support its future growth. The strategic initiatives that the Company has implemented in the past two years, as well as those that will be implemented in fiscal 2008 and beyond, will strengthen the Companys operational platform and contribute to continuing future growth. Given these factors, the Company considers itself well positioned to capitalize upon the growth opportunities in the dental supply, companion pet veterinary supply and the worldwide rehabilitation supply markets. The Company believes that the sustainable, long term growth rate of its North American dental operation is four percentage points in excess of the markets 7% to 9% estimated rate of growth. The Company also believes its Webster 38 Table of Contents Veterinary and Patterson Medical units can grow faster than the estimated 6% to 7% growth rate of the U.S. companion pet veterinary supply market and the estimated 6% growth rate of the rehabilitation market. Asset Management The following table summarizes the Companys days sales outstanding (DSO) and inventory turnover the past three fiscal years: 2007 2006 2005 Days sales outstanding 44 47 46 Inventory turnover (1) 7.2 7.3 7.9 (1) The inventory values used in this calculation are the LIFO inventory values for all inventories except for manufactured inventories and foreign inventories, which are valued using FIFO inventory methods. Foreign Operations Foreign sales are derived primarily from Patterson Dental and Patterson Medical operations in Canada and from Patterson Medicals operations in the U.K. and France. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates have not significantly impacted earnings. However, net sales in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 were enhanced by changes in the exchange rate. Without foreign currency effects, net sales would have been $12.3 million, $9.3 million and $12.6 million lower in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Changes in currency exchange rates are a risk accompanying foreign operations, but this risk is not considered material with respect to the net operations of the Companys business. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Company has adopted various accounting policies to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Management believes that the Companys policies are conservative and its philosophy is to adopt accounting policies that minimize the risk of adverse events having a material impact on recorded assets and liabilities. However, the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments regarding the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities based on the information available to management at the time. Changes subsequent to the preparation of the financial statements in economic, technological and competitive conditions may materially impact the recorded values of the Companys assets and liabilities. Therefore, the users of the financial statements should read all the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and be aware that conditions currently unknown to management may develop in the future. This may require a material adjustment to a recorded asset or liability to consistently apply the Companys significant accounting principles and policies that are discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The financial performance and condition of the Company may also be materially impacted by transactions and events that the Company has not previously experienced and for which the Company has not been required to establish an accounting policy or adopt a generally accepted accounting principle. Revenue Recognition Our revenue recognition processes involve establishing estimates for returns, damaged goods, rebates and other revenue allowances. These estimates are based on historical experience and the facts known at the date of the preparation of the financial statements, but future events could cause actual results to vary from our estimates. Inventory and Reserves Inventory consists primarily of merchandise held for sale and is stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for all inventories, except for foreign inventories and manufactured inventories, which are valued using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We continually assess the valuation of our inventories and reduce the carrying value of those inventories that are 39 Table of Contents obsolete or in excess of our forecasted usage to estimated realizable value. We estimate the net realizable value of such inventories based on analyses and assumptions including, but not limited to, historical usage, future demand and market requirements. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable net assets of businesses acquired. Other intangible assets include customer lists, a distribution agreement and other amortizable intangible assets. In addition, other intangible assets consist of trademarks and trade names that are unamortized intangible assets. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill for each reporting unit be reviewed for impairment at least annually. The Company has three reporting units at April 28, 2007. The Company tests goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in SFAS No. 142. In the first step, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit, as computed primarily by present value cash flow calculations, to its book carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and the Company would then complete step 2 in order to measure the impairment loss. In step 2, the Company would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets (including unrecognized intangible assets) of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit (as determined in step 1). If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, the Company would recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference. Management also reviews other intangible assets with finite lives for impairment at least annually to determine if any adverse conditions exist that would indicate impairment. If the carrying value of the finite lived intangible assets exceeds the expected undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use and disposition of the asset, the carrying value is written down to fair value in the period identified. Indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually for impairment by calculating the fair value of the assets and comparing with their carrying value. In assessing fair value, management generally utilizes present value cash flow calculations using an expected cash flow approach. During the fourth quarters of fiscal 2007 and 2006, management completed its annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment reviews with no impairments to the carrying values identified. The discount rate and sales growth assumptions are the two most significant assumptions utilized in the Companys calculations of the present value cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units when performing the annual goodwill impairment test and in testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment. The Company utilizes an expected cash flow approach in estimating the fair value of the reporting units, where the discount reflects a risk free rate of interest and utilizes various probability weighted scenarios to estimate future sales. The cash flow model used to derive fair value is most sensitive to the discount rate and sales growth assumptions used. The estimated fair value of the reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets has historically exceeded the carrying value of such reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset by a substantial amount. The Company performs a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate, sales growth and operating margin assumptions. Either the discount rate could be increased by 50% of the discount rate utilized, or the sales growth assumption could be reduced by 20%, and the Companys reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets would continue to have fair values in excess of the carrying values. Share based Compensation The Company accounts for share based payment awards in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). The Company recognizes share based compensation based on certain assumptions including inputs within the Black Scholes Model and estimated forfeitures. These assumptions require subjective judgment and changes in the assumptions can materially affect fair value estimates. Management assesses the assumptions and methodologies used to estimate forfeitures and to calculate estimated fair value of share based compensation on a regular basis. Circumstances may change, and additional data may become available over time, which could result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies and thereby materially impact our fair value 40 Table of Contents determination or estimates of forfeitures. If factors change and the Company employs different assumptions in the application of SFAS No. 123(R), the amount of compensation expense associated with SFAS No. 123(R) may differ significantly from what was recorded in the current period. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FAS No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on future changes, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosures and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We have completed our initial evaluation of the impact of the adoption of FIN 48 and determined that such adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results from operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. FAS 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FAS 157 applies under other previously issued accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements but does not require any new fair value measurements. FAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact of FAS 157 on our consolidated financial statements.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk The Company is exposed to market risk consisting of foreign currency rate fluctuations and changes in interest rates. The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in its operating statement due to transactions denominated primarily in Canadian Dollars, British Pounds and Euros. Although historically the Company has elected not to enter into any hedging contracts, it continually evaluates its foreign currency exchange rate risk and the different mechanisms for use in managing such risk. A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Companys most significant foreign currency exposures would have had an impact of approximately $23.0 million on fiscal 2007 net sales. This amount is not indicative of the hypothetical net earnings impact due to the partially offsetting impact of the currency exchange movements on cost of sales and operating expenses. The Companys earnings are also affected by fluctuations in short term interest rates through the investment of its cash balances, borrowings under LIBOR based debt instruments and the practice of selling fixed rate equipment finance contracts under agreements with both a commercial paper conduit and a group of banks that provide for pricing based on variable interest rates. As of April 28, 2007, the Company had $180 million of long term debt outstanding of which $100 million was variable interest rate based debt. The Company views its variable interest rate debt position on a net basis that gives effect to the Companys cash and short term investments balances. When considering the exposure under the agreements whereby the Company sells equipment finance contracts to both a commercial paper conduit and a group of banks, the Company has the ability to select pricing based on interest rates ranging from 30 day LIBOR up to twelve month LIBOR. In addition, the portfolio of installment contracts generally turns over in less than 48 months and the Company can adjust the rate it charges on new customer contracts at any time. Therefore, in times where the interest rate markets are not rapidly increasing or decreasing, the average interest rate in the portfolio generally moves with the interest rate markets and thus would parallel the underlying interest rate movement of the pricing built into the sale agreements. In calculating the gain on the contract sales, the Company uses an interest rate curve that approximates the maturity period of the then outstanding contracts. If increases in the interest rate markets occur, the average interest rate in our contract portfolio may not increase at the same rate, resulting in a reduction of gain on the contracts sales as compared to the gain that would be realized if the average interest rate in our portfolio were to increase at a more similar rate to the interest rate markets. The Company estimates that if interest rates had been 10% higher during the year, the annual impact would have been to reduce earnings before income tax by approximately $3 million. 42 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview The Companys fiscal 2007 financial information is summarized in this Managements Discussion and Analysis, the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the related Notes. The following background is essential to more fully understand the Companys financial information. Patterson operates a distribution business in three complementary markets: dental supply, veterinary supply and rehabilitation supply. Historically the Companys strategy for growth focused on internal growth and the acquisition of smaller distributors and businesses offering related products and services to the dental market. In fiscal 2002, the Company expanded its strategy to take advantage of a parallel growth opportunity in the veterinary supply market by acquiring the assets of J. A. Webster, Inc. on July 9, 2001. The Company added a third component to its business platform in fiscal 2004 when it entered the rehabilitation supply market with the acquisition of AbilityOne Products Corp. (AbilityOne) on September 12, 2003. AbilityOne is now known as Patterson Medical. The historical operating performance of the veterinary supply and rehabilitation supply businesses are somewhat different than the dental supply business. Operating margins of the veterinary business are considerably lower than the dental supply business. While operating expenses run at a lower rate in the veterinary business, its gross margin is substantially lower. Veterinary gross margins have been in the low to mid 20s as compared to dental gross margins in the mid 30s. The rehabilitation business has realized gross margins in the high 30s to low 40s. There are several important aspects of the Companys business, including: (1) market growth in the various markets it operates; (2) internal growth; (3) growth through acquisition; and (4) continued focus on controlling costs and enhancing efficiency, that are useful in analyzing the Company. Management defines internal growth as the increase in net sales from period to period, excluding the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, and excluding the net sales, for a period of twelve months following the transaction date, of businesses that it has acquired. With these factors in mind, management has established certain operating objectives, which include increasing net sales four percentage points faster than the average market growth rate at each business unit and improving operating margins by 50 basis points annually. In response to lower than expected operating results at Patterson Medical, the Company put a new management team into place during the second half of fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2007, the Company committed a portion of its operating leverage improvement to investments in the sales and marketing organization at Patterson Medical, which entailed a significant expansion of the sales force as well as other marketing initiatives. The actions in fiscal 2007 at Patterson Medical were expected to diminish the opportunity to expand operating margins by 50 basis points. In addition, fiscal 2007 operating results include expense of $7.8 million from the adoption of FASB Statement No. 123(R) at the beginning of the year. 32 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table summarizes the consolidated results of operations over the past three fiscal years as a percent of sales: 2007 (a) 2006 2005 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 65.4 % 65.0 % 64.4 % Gross margin 34.6 % 35.0 % 35.6 % Operating expenses 22.6 % 22.6 % 23.1 % Operating income 12.0 % 12.4 % 12.5 % Other income, net 0.3 % 0.2 % 0.2 % Interest expense 0.5 % 0.5 % 0.6 % Income before taxes 11.8 % 12.1 % 12.1 % Income taxes 4.3 % 4.5 % 4.5 % Net income 7.5 % 7.6 % 7.6 % (a) Includes a 30 basis point impact of share based compensation expense from the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) in fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 Net Sales. Net sales for the year ended April 28, 2007 totaled $2,798.4 million, an increase of 7.0% from $2,615.1 million in fiscal 2006. The favorable impact of foreign currency translation on sales growth was 0.5%. Acquisitions contributed approximately one percentage point to sales growth. The Company acquired Accu Bite in September 2005. This business included both a field sales organization similar to our traditional dental sales model, as well as a low margin telesales business. For approximately eight months of fiscal 2006, from the date of acquisition through the end of fiscal year, the dental segment operated Accu Bites telesales business. In early May 2006, the telesales operations were closed for business reasons. In closing the business, as much of the sales volume that could be, was moved into the field organization. However, as the Company expected, much of this sales volume went to dental suppliers who approach the market with a low price model. The closing of the telesales business had a negative impact on consolidated fiscal 2007 sales growth of approximately one percentage point. Sales of our dental supply unit increased 5.0% in fiscal 2007 to $2,064.6 million. Sales of dental consumable supplies grew 5.7%. The Accu Bite telesales negative impact on sales growth of the dental units total sales and sales of consumable supplies was approximately 1.5% and 2.5%, respectively. Equipment sales grew 1.6%, led by basic equipment growth of 6.1%. Largely offsetting the increase in basic equipment growth was a decline in the sales of CEREC&reg; 3D dental restorative systems. Late in the third quarter of fiscal 2007, CERECs manufacturer, Sirona, introduced several important enhancements. First, CERECs software was significantly improved; making it easier to design highly aesthetic and precise restorations, while also greatly streamlining the systems learning curve. In addition, a faster and more robust milling unit was introduced as an option on new installations, as well as an upgrade to all existing CEREC users. The Company believes the news of the impending enhancements to CEREC, which reached the market early in fiscal 2007, as well as the timing of the introduction at the end of the third fiscal quarter, and the process of transitioning to these upgraded features, which was still underway at the end of fiscal 2007, had a negative impact on sales throughout the year. Other dental sales, consisting primarily of technical service parts and labor, software support services and teeth, grew 14.1% in fiscal 2007. 33 Table of Contents Sales at the Webster Veterinary unit grew 15.4% to $399.4 million from $346.1 million. The business has strategically emphasized expansion of its value added platform, including its equipment and software initiatives. Websters core consumables business performed well throughout the year and equipment and software increased 69.6%. Excluding the acquisition impact of Intra Corp, developer and marketer of IntraVet&reg; practice management software, total veterinary sales exceeded prior year sales by 14.2%. Patterson Medical consistently grew sales throughout the year, improving 10.7% over fiscal 2006. Three acquisitions related to the units branch office strategy contributed 3 percentage points of the growth and foreign currency translation added an additional 1.5% of sales improvement. During fiscal 2007 Patterson Medical established five full service branch offices in selected markets through acquisitions and internal start ups. Additional acquisitions and internal start ups are under consideration as the business continues to increase its sales force and add programs and systems to advance their value added offerings. Gross Margin. Consolidated gross margin declined 40 basis points in fiscal 2007 to 34.6%, primarily due to lower margins of Patterson Medical. In addition, the sales growth of Webster Veterinary outpaced both the dental and rehabilitation segments, resulting in a dilutive impact to consolidated gross margin, since Veterinary gross margins are lower than the other two businesses. The Dental segments gross margin improved 20 basis points in fiscal 2007. The closing of the Accu Bite telesales business which operated for eight months in fiscal 2006 and was dilutive to overall dental gross margin during that period, acted to improve Dental gross margins in 2007. The telesales business produced substantially lower gross margins than the traditional dental sales operations. A decline in sales of the high margin CEREC dental restorative systems during fiscal 2007 negatively impacted gross margin. The gross margin of the Veterinary business decreased by 10 basis points over fiscal year 2006. The negative impact on gross margin of lower agency commissions and vendor rebates in fiscal 2007 was mostly offset by the sales growth of equipment and software, which carry higher margins than core consumables. Patterson Medicals gross margin declined 250 basis points due to several factors. Higher freight costs have impacted this business more than the Dental and Veterinary segments due to the nature of the average order size and related package levels. In addition, this segment has fixed price contracts with certain large group customers and price increases from vendors created some margin compression in this customer group. These contracts are renewed periodically, at which time pricing may be renegotiated to address changes in vendor pricing. Many of the contracts were amended in the latter part of fiscal 2007. A third factor in the gross margin decline at Patterson Medical is that the business hired a number of new sales representatives during the past fiscal year who have been given some short term latitude to establish their book of business through discretionary discounting. This latitude will be phased out as these new representatives reach their sales targets. Operating Expenses. The consolidated operating expense ratio remained unchanged from a year ago at 22.6%, however the ratio in fiscal 2007 was negatively impacted by 30 basis points due to $7.8 million of share based compensation expense related to the Companys adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) in fiscal 2007. Excluding the impact of SFAS No. 123(R), the Dental segment experienced a 10 basis point improvement in its operating expense ratio. The Veterinary segment experienced a 60 basis points decrease in its operating expense ratio, due primarily to leverage on sales growth. In addition, during fiscal 2006 the business incurred costs from the initial expense structure of its greenfield expansion into California. Fiscal 2007 was a year of investment for Patterson Medical in sales and marketing personnel and programs, however the business was able to maintain their operating expense ratio due to growth in sales. Operating Income. Operating income was $335.7 million, or 12.0% of net sales. Excluding $7.8 million of expense under SFAS No. 123(R), operating income was 12.3% of net sales, totaling $343.4 million, an increase of 6.3% from $323.0 million in fiscal 2006. 34 Table of Contents Interest Expense. Interest expense was $14.2 million compared to $13.4 million in fiscal 2006. For more than half of fiscal 2006, an interest rate swap on $100 million of variable rate debt effectively fixed interest rate expense on the $100 million at 2.6% until the agreement terminated in November 2005. The average debt balance carried in fiscal 2007 was lower than fiscal 2006; however, the weighted average interest rate on the $100 million of variable rate debt was approximately 6.0% in fiscal 2007, resulting in an overall increase in interest expense. Other Income, net. Other income, net of other expenses, increased to $8.1 million from $7.3 million. Composed primarily of finance interest income in both years, the increase was due primarily to higher interest rates. Income Taxes. The effective income tax rate was 36.8% in fiscal year 2007 compared to 37.4% in the prior year. During fiscal 2007, the Company finalized several years of Canadian income tax returns and the reversal of related tax reserves lowered the effective income tax rate by approximately one percentage point. The impact of SFAS No. 123(R) on our effective tax rate partially offset the finalization of the Canadian tax returns since certain compensation expense under SFAS No. 123(R) is non deductible. Earnings Per Share. Earnings per diluted share of $1.51 represents an increase of $0.08 or 5.6% from the $1.43 earnings per share reported in fiscal 2006. The adoptions of SFAS No. 123(R) in fiscal 2007 lowered earnings per share by $0.05. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 Net Sales. Net sales for the year ended April 29, 2006 totaled $2,615.1 million, an 8.0% increase from $2,421.5 million reported for the previous year. The Company utilizes a fifty two, fifty three week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in April. Due to the Companys fiscal year policy, fiscal 2005 included an additional or fifty third week as compared to fiscal 2006. The Company estimates the additional week in fiscal 2005 had a one to two percentage point adverse impact on the growth rate in fiscal 2006. Sales of our largest business unit, dental supply, increased 7.2%. Excluding the impact of the Accu Bite acquisition and favorable foreign currency exchange translation related to our Canadian operations, sales grew approximately 4% in fiscal 2006. Sales of dental consumable supplies experienced strong growth of 9.5%. Excluding the 4.1 percentage point impact to growth from the Accu Bite acquisition, and considering the additional week in fiscal 2005, consumables growth was on the high end of our of estimated market growth rate of 5% to 7%. Equipment sales growth of 3.7% was below historic norms. In the second half of fiscal 2006, programs were implemented to improve the sluggish sales performance for basic equipment, such as chairs, units, cabinetry and lights, back to more historic growth rates. With respect to new technology equipment, digital radiography continued to see significant practitioner demand and related sales grew 20% compared to fiscal 2005. Sales of the CEREC&reg; 3D dental restorative system were virtually unchanged from fiscal 2005. Sales of other services and products, including parts, technical service, software support and insurance e claims, grew 8.2% in fiscal 2006. Sales at the Webster Veterinary unit grew 18.6% to $346.1 million from $292.0 million. The impact from the October 2004 Milburn and December 2005 IntraVet acquisitions was approximately $24.7 million, or 8.5 percentage points of the growth. Websters sales growth was strong throughout the year and was complimented by several factors. First, the business began its greenfield expansion into the large California market, which represents its most successful greenfield initiative to date. Second, for the past few years, Webster has been 35 Table of Contents laying the groundwork for expanding its position in the equipment market and this growing emphasis resulted in strong results. Equipment sales for the year grew 49% from fiscal 2005. Finally, another source of growth in fiscal 2006 sales were new pharmaceutical distribution agreements, including a canine pain medication previously sold direct by the manufacturer. Patterson Medicals sales growth was only 2.3%. A modest improvement in North American sales was largely offset by a slight decline in sales of the overseas operations. In the second half of fiscal 2006, a new management team was put in place and a range of strategic initiatives were begun. Late in the third quarter, a small, non core portion of the segment was sold which also negatively impacted the growth rate of sales. Gross Margin. Consolidated gross margin declined 60 basis points in fiscal 2006 to 35.0%. Sales from the Webster Veterinary unit made up a larger portion of sales in fiscal 2006 due to its strong sales growth. Because gross margin at the Veterinary unit is lower than both the Dental and Medical units, the units sales growth had a dilutive effect on consolidated gross margin. The Dental units gross margin decrease of nearly 50 basis points was largely due to the acquisition of Accu Bite. Acquired territory sales reps were integrated within existing Patterson branches, however, Accu Bite also had a telesales operation that was not integrated and produced substantially lower gross margins than the traditional dental sales operations. The telesales business was shutdown in early May of 2006, however, it did operate from the September 2005 date of acquisition through the end of fiscal 2006. The gross margin of the Veterinary business was virtually unchanged. A full year of Milburn operations, which carry lower margins than the historical Webster business, were included in fiscal 2006 results compared to approximately six months in fiscal 2005 and negatively impacted the overall gross margin of the unit. However, this impact was largely offset by the sales growth of equipment and software, which carry higher margins than the rest of the units product offerings. Patterson Medicals gross margin fell 100 basis points, largely due to sales mix, including lower sales levels of the overseas operations, which have carried higher gross margins than the North American operations. Operating Expenses. The consolidated operating expense ratio decreased to 22.6%, down 50 basis points from 23.1% in fiscal 2005. The Dental segment experienced a 30 basis point decrease, reflecting operating leverage on additional sales and reduced incentive compensation. This improvement was partially offset by costs associated with the integration of the Accu Bite acquisition. The Veterinary segment also improved its operating expense ratio by 30 basis points, due primarily to operating leverage on improved sales. Costs associated with the initial expense structure of the California greenfield expansion somewhat offset this improvement. The operating expense ratio at Patterson Medical declined by 170 basis points due to lower levels of amortization of intangibles. Consolidated amortization expense in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 was $7.0 million and $12.2 million, respectively. The $5.2 million decrease was due primarily to amortization on certain intangible assets related to the acquisition of Patterson Medical, some of which were being amortized on an accelerated basis due to their period of benefit. Operating Income. Operating income increased 6.9% and decreased 10 basis points as a percent of sales. As discussed above, consolidated gross margins declined 60 basis points, while the consolidated operating expense ratio improved 50 basis points. 36 Table of Contents Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased from $15.1 million to $13.4 million. The average debt balance carried in fiscal 2006 was lower than in fiscal 2005 because the Company paid down substantial amounts of debt near the end of fiscal 2005. However, in November 2005, an interest rate swap on $100 million of variable rate debt terminated. This swap had existed throughout all of fiscal 2005 and under the terms of the agreement, the Company effectively paid a low, fixed rate on the variable rate debt. Due to the termination of the swap agreement and rising interest rates, the Company experienced a higher weighted average interest rate in fiscal 2006 and was not able to recognize significantly lower levels of interest expense as compared to fiscal 2005. Other Income, net. Other income, net of other expenses, was consistent year over year. Composed primarily of finance interest income in both years, net other income was $7.3 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $6.5 million in fiscal 2005 and results primarily from the growth of the business. Income Taxes. The effective income tax rate was 37.4% in both fiscal years 2006 and 2005. The Companys effective tax rate is higher than the statutory federal rate primarily because of state, local and international taxes the Company must pay. Earnings Per Share. Earnings per share increased to $1.43, up $0.11 or 8% from the $1.32 earnings per share reported in fiscal 2005. Liquidity and Capital Resources Pattersons operating cash flow has been the Companys principal source of liquidity in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005. Operating activities generated cash of $243.5 million in fiscal 2007 compared with $164.0 million in fiscal 2006 and $207.3 million in fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2006, the Company did not sell approximately $30 million of short duration finance contracts that were generated as a part of our traditional calendar year end financing programs. These contracts have an average maturity of less than 24 months and will generate interest income at rates approximating what cash would earn, thus the Company elected not to incur the administrative expense of selling these contracts. Had these contracts been sold, cash from operations would have been approximately $200 million. The majority of the principal balance on these contracts has been collected from customers as of fiscal 2007 year end. Capital expenditures were $19.5, $49.2 and $31.5 million in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Fiscal 2006 included several significant projects, including expenditures for shared distribution centers in Kent, WA and eastern Pennsylvania. In addition, 2006 included expenditures for a new distribution facility for the Patterson Medical operations in the U.K. The Company expects to invest approximately $30 million in capital expenditures during fiscal 2008, including the expansion of an existing distribution center to accommodate multiple business units, and the continuing expansion of information systems. Two buildings were sold during fiscal 2007, with proceeds totaling $9.2 million. One building was the former distribution facility for Patterson Medicals U.K. operations and the other was a vacant building acquired in the acquisition of AbilityOne. Cash used for acquisitions totaled $12.7 million in fiscal 2007 and included the acquisition of three dealer/distributors by Patterson Medical as well as earn outs on acquisitions from previous years. The $39.2 million invested in fiscal 2006 included the acquisitions of Accu Bite and IntraCorp. In fiscal 2005, the Company used $72.9 million of cash for acquisitions, including Medco, CAESY and Milburn. A cash payment of $100 million was made to Sirona in fiscal 2006, representing a distribution fee that extends the Companys exclusive North American distribution agreement of Sironas CEREC equipment for a ten year period which begins in October 2007. 37 Table of Contents The Company did not repurchase any of its common stock in fiscal years 2007, 2006 or 2005, but does have authorization from the board of directors to repurchase up to six million shares. This authorization expires September 30, 2009. During fiscal 2007, the Company loaned its ESOP $105 million, which was used by the ESOP to purchase approximately 3.2 million shares of the Companys common stock on the open market. Payments on long term debt were $120 million in fiscal 2007. In addition to $70 million of fixed rate debt that matured during the year and $20 million of scheduled payments on its variable rate bank term loans, the Company paid off the remaining $30 million of the term loans near the end of the fiscal year. An amount of $200 million is available to the Company under this revolving credit facility until November 2008. For fiscal 2008, $50 million of fixed rate private notes loan repayments are scheduled. Management continues to expect funds generated from operations and existing cash and short term investments to be sufficient to meet the Companys working capital needs for the next fiscal year. The Company expects to continue to obtain liquidity from the sale of its equipment finance contracts. The Companys short term and long term debt facilities are believed to be adequate as a supplement to internally generated cash flows to fund anticipated expansion plans and strategic initiatives. The Company sells a significant portion of its installment sale contracts to a commercial paper funded conduit managed by a third party bank, and as a result, commercial paper is indirectly an important source of liquidity for the Company. The Company is allowed to participate in the conduit due to the quality of its finance contracts and its financial strength. Cash flow could be impaired if the Companys financial strength diminished to a level that precluded the Company from taking part in this facility or other similar facilities. The Companys financing business is described in further detail in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Contractual Obligations A summary of the Companys contractual obligations as of April 28, 2007 follows (in thousands): Payment due by year Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Long Term Debt $ 180,024 $ 50,014 $ 130,010 Operating Leases 52,079 12,633 22,396 $ 12,059 $ 4,991 For a more complete description of our contractual obligations, please see Notes 7 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Outlook Over the last ten years, the Company has been able to grow revenue and earnings through its strategy of emphasizing its value added, full service capabilities, using technology to enhance customer service, continuing to improve operating efficiencies, and growing through internal expansion and acquisitions. The Companys growth strategy will continue to focus on these key elements. Maintaining financial flexibility is also a key component of the Companys future growth. With strong operating cash flow and available credit capacity, the Company is confident that it will be able to financially support its future growth. The strategic initiatives that the Company has implemented in the past two years, as well as those that will be implemented in fiscal 2008 and beyond, will strengthen the Companys operational platform and contribute to continuing future growth. Given these factors, the Company considers itself well positioned to capitalize upon the growth opportunities in the dental supply, companion pet veterinary supply and the worldwide rehabilitation supply markets. The Company believes that the sustainable, long term growth rate of its North American dental operation is four percentage points in excess of the markets 7% to 9% estimated rate of growth. The Company also believes its Webster 38 Table of Contents Veterinary and Patterson Medical units can grow faster than the estimated 6% to 7% growth rate of the U.S. companion pet veterinary supply market and the estimated 6% growth rate of the rehabilitation market. Asset Management The following table summarizes the Companys days sales outstanding (DSO) and inventory turnover the past three fiscal years: 2007 2006 2005 Days sales outstanding 44 47 46 Inventory turnover (1) 7.2 7.3 7.9 (1) The inventory values used in this calculation are the LIFO inventory values for all inventories except for manufactured inventories and foreign inventories, which are valued using FIFO inventory methods. Foreign Operations Foreign sales are derived primarily from Patterson Dental and Patterson Medical operations in Canada and from Patterson Medicals operations in the U.K. and France. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates have not significantly impacted earnings. However, net sales in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 were enhanced by changes in the exchange rate. Without foreign currency effects, net sales would have been $12.3 million, $9.3 million and $12.6 million lower in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Changes in currency exchange rates are a risk accompanying foreign operations, but this risk is not considered material with respect to the net operations of the Companys business. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Company has adopted various accounting policies to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Management believes that the Companys policies are conservative and its philosophy is to adopt accounting policies that minimize the risk of adverse events having a material impact on recorded assets and liabilities. However, the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments regarding the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities based on the information available to management at the time. Changes subsequent to the preparation of the financial statements in economic, technological and competitive conditions may materially impact the recorded values of the Companys assets and liabilities. Therefore, the users of the financial statements should read all the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and be aware that conditions currently unknown to management may develop in the future. This may require a material adjustment to a recorded asset or liability to consistently apply the Companys significant accounting principles and policies that are discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The financial performance and condition of the Company may also be materially impacted by transactions and events that the Company has not previously experienced and for which the Company has not been required to establish an accounting policy or adopt a generally accepted accounting principle. Revenue Recognition Our revenue recognition processes involve establishing estimates for returns, damaged goods, rebates and other revenue allowances. These estimates are based on historical experience and the facts known at the date of the preparation of the financial statements, but future events could cause actual results to vary from our estimates. Inventory and Reserves Inventory consists primarily of merchandise held for sale and is stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for all inventories, except for foreign inventories and manufactured inventories, which are valued using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We continually assess the valuation of our inventories and reduce the carrying value of those inventories that are 39 Table of Contents obsolete or in excess of our forecasted usage to estimated realizable value. We estimate the net realizable value of such inventories based on analyses and assumptions including, but not limited to, historical usage, future demand and market requirements. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable net assets of businesses acquired. Other intangible assets include customer lists, a distribution agreement and other amortizable intangible assets. In addition, other intangible assets consist of trademarks and trade names that are unamortized intangible assets. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill for each reporting unit be reviewed for impairment at least annually. The Company has three reporting units at April 28, 2007. The Company tests goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in SFAS No. 142. In the first step, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit, as computed primarily by present value cash flow calculations, to its book carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and the Company would then complete step 2 in order to measure the impairment loss. In step 2, the Company would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets (including unrecognized intangible assets) of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit (as determined in step 1). If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, the Company would recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference. Management also reviews other intangible assets with finite lives for impairment at least annually to determine if any adverse conditions exist that would indicate impairment. If the carrying value of the finite lived intangible assets exceeds the expected undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use and disposition of the asset, the carrying value is written down to fair value in the period identified. Indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually for impairment by calculating the fair value of the assets and comparing with their carrying value. In assessing fair value, management generally utilizes present value cash flow calculations using an expected cash flow approach. During the fourth quarters of fiscal 2007 and 2006, management completed its annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment reviews with no impairments to the carrying values identified. The discount rate and sales growth assumptions are the two most significant assumptions utilized in the Companys calculations of the present value cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units when performing the annual goodwill impairment test and in testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment. The Company utilizes an expected cash flow approach in estimating the fair value of the reporting units, where the discount reflects a risk free rate of interest and utilizes various probability weighted scenarios to estimate future sales. The cash flow model used to derive fair value is most sensitive to the discount rate and sales growth assumptions used. The estimated fair value of the reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets has historically exceeded the carrying value of such reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset by a substantial amount. The Company performs a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate, sales growth and operating margin assumptions. Either the discount rate could be increased by 50% of the discount rate utilized, or the sales growth assumption could be reduced by 20%, and the Companys reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets would continue to have fair values in excess of the carrying values. Share based Compensation The Company accounts for share based payment awards in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). The Company recognizes share based compensation based on certain assumptions including inputs within the Black Scholes Model and estimated forfeitures. These assumptions require subjective judgment and changes in the assumptions can materially affect fair value estimates. Management assesses the assumptions and methodologies used to estimate forfeitures and to calculate estimated fair value of share based compensation on a regular basis. Circumstances may change, and additional data may become available over time, which could result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies and thereby materially impact our fair value 40 Table of Contents determination or estimates of forfeitures. If factors change and the Company employs different assumptions in the application of SFAS No. 123(R), the amount of compensation expense associated with SFAS No. 123(R) may differ significantly from what was recorded in the current period. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FAS No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on future changes, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosures and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We have completed our initial evaluation of the impact of the adoption of FIN 48 and determined that such adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results from operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. FAS 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FAS 157 applies under other previously issued accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements but does not require any new fair value measurements. FAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact of FAS 157 on our consolidated financial statements.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk The Company is exposed to market risk consisting of foreign currency rate fluctuations and changes in interest rates. The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in its operating statement due to transactions denominated primarily in Canadian Dollars, British Pounds and Euros. Although historically the Company has elected not to enter into any hedging contracts, it continually evaluates its foreign currency exchange rate risk and the different mechanisms for use in managing such risk. A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Companys most significant foreign currency exposures would have had an impact of approximately $23.0 million on fiscal 2007 net sales. This amount is not indicative of the hypothetical net earnings impact due to the partially offsetting impact of the currency exchange movements on cost of sales and operating expenses. The Companys earnings are also affected by fluctuations in short term interest rates through the investment of its cash balances, borrowings under LIBOR based debt instruments and the practice of selling fixed rate equipment finance contracts under agreements with both a commercial paper conduit and a group of banks that provide for pricing based on variable interest rates. As of April 28, 2007, the Company had $180 million of long term debt outstanding of which $100 million was variable interest rate based debt. The Company views its variable interest rate debt position on a net basis that gives effect to the Companys cash and short term investments balances. When considering the exposure under the agreements whereby the Company sells equipment finance contracts to both a commercial paper conduit and a group of banks, the Company has the ability to select pricing based on interest rates ranging from 30 day LIBOR up to twelve month LIBOR. In addition, the portfolio of installment contracts generally turns over in less than 48 months and the Company can adjust the rate it charges on new customer contracts at any time. Therefore, in times where the interest rate markets are not rapidly increasing or decreasing, the average interest rate in the portfolio generally moves with the interest rate markets and thus would parallel the underlying interest rate movement of the pricing built into the sale agreements. In calculating the gain on the contract sales, the Company uses an interest rate curve that approximates the maturity period of the then outstanding contracts. If increases in the interest rate markets occur, the average interest rate in our contract portfolio may not increase at the same rate, resulting in a reduction of gain on the contracts sales as compared to the gain that would be realized if the average interest rate in our portfolio were to increase at a more similar rate to the interest rate markets. The Company estimates that if interest rates had been 10% higher during the year, the annual impact would have been to reduce earnings before income tax by approximately $3 million. 42 Table of Contents
