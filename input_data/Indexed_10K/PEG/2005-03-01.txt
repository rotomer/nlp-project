ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A) This combined MD&A is separately filed by Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (PSEG), Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G), PSEG Power LLC (Power) and PSEG Energy Holdings LLC (Energy Holdings). Information contained herein relating to any individual company is filed by such company on its own behalf. PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings each make representations only as to itself and make no other representations whatsoever as to any other company. OVERVIEW OF 2004 AND FUTURE OUTLOOK PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings Merger Agreement On December 20, 2004, PSEG entered into an agreement and plan of merger (Merger Agreement) with Exelon Corporation (Exelon), a public utility holding company registered under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA) which is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, whereby PSEG will be merged with and into Exelon (Merger). Under the Merger Agreement, each share of PSEG Common Stock will be converted into 1.225 shares of Exelon Common Stock. PSEG and Exelon entered into the Merger Agreement with the expectation that the Merger would result in various benefits, including, among other things, cost savings and operating efficiencies. The Merger Agreement also addresses the key issues of leadership succession at PSEG with John Rowe, Exelons Chief Executive Officer to become Chief Executive Officer of the combined company. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the Merger is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the businesses of Exelon and PSEG are integrated in an efficient and effective manner, as well as general competitive factors in the market place. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues generated by the combined company and diversion of managements time and energy and could have an adverse effect on the combined companys business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. The Merger Agreement has been unanimously approved by both companies boards of directors. Before the Merger may be completed, various approvals or consents must be obtained from shareholders, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and various utility regulatory, antitrust and other authorities in the United States (U.S.) and in foreign jurisdictions. The governmental authorities from which these approvals are required may impose conditions on completion of the merger or require changes to the terms of the Merger. These conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying completion of the Merger or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of the combined company and or the individual registrants following the Merger, any of which might have a material adverse effect on the combined company or the individual registrants following completion of the Merger. PSEG is committed to this proposed business combination, however, pending receipt of the various required approvals, which cannot be assured, PSEG intends to remain positioned with a viable stand alone strategy. On February 4, 2005, PSEG and Exelon filed for approval of the Merger with the FERC, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PPUC). Exelon also filed a notice of the Merger with the Illinois Commerce Commission. Although PSEG and Exelon intend to take steps to reduce any adverse effects, uncertainties relating to the Merger may impair PSEGs and Exelons ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is consummated and for a period of time thereafter due to uncertainty about roles with the future combined company, and could cause customers, suppliers and others that deal with PSEG and Exelon to seek to change existing business relationships. Inability to retain key employees or maintain satisfactory 45 relationships with employees, customers or suppliers could have a material adverse impact on the operations of PSEG, Exelon and the combined company following the Merger. It is anticipated that the regulatory approval process will be completed and the Merger will close within 12 months to 15 months after the announcement of the Merger Agreement in December 2004, subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals which cannot be assured. The Merger would create a combined company serving approximately seven million electric customers and approximately two million gas customers in Illinois, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. PSEG and Exelon expect to incur costs associated with consummating the Merger and integrating the operations of the two companies, as well as approximately $29 million and $41 million in transaction fees for PSEG and Exelon, respectively. Preliminary estimated integration costs associated with the Merger are approximately $700 million over a period of 4 years, with approximately $400 million being incurred in the first year after completion of the Merger and approximately $150 million being incurred in the second year after completion of the Merger. Following the Merger, approximately 50% of the combined companys earnings and cash flow is expected to be produced by the three regulated utilities, PSE&G, Commonwealth Edison Company in northern Illinois and PECO Energy Company in southeastern Pennsylvania, and 50% by the unregulated businesses, primarily from the combined generation of Power and Exelon Generation Company LLC (Exelon Generation). After the Merger, the combined company expects to maintain its proportion of business in regulated operations while reducing the proportion in international operations. The expected strategy of the combined company would be to divest, in an orderly fashion, PSEG Global LLCs (Global) investments that do not meet the strategic objectives of the combined company. The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Exelon and PSEG, and further provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, (1) Exelon may be required to pay PSEG a termination fee of $400 million plus PSEGs transaction expenses up to $40 million and (2) PSEG may be required to pay Exelon a termination fee of $400 million plus Exelons transaction expenses up to $40 million. Among the factors considered by the board of directors of PSEG in connection with its approvals of the Merger Agreement were the benefits as well as the risks that could result from the Merger. PSEG cannot give any assurance that these benefits will be realized within the time periods contemplated or even that they will be realized at all. Concurrent with the Merger Agreement, PSEG Nuclear LLC (Nuclear) entered into an Operating Services Contract (OSC) with Exelon Generation, which commenced on January 17, 2005, relating to the operation of the Salem and Hope Creek nuclear generating stations. The OSC provides that Exelon Generation will provide a chief nuclear officer and other key personnel to oversee daily plant operations at the Hope Creek and Salem nuclear generating stations and to implement the Exelon operating model, which defines practices that Exelon has used to manage its own nuclear performance program. Nuclear will continue as the license holder with exclusive legal authority to operate and maintain the plants, will retain responsibility for management oversight and will have full authority with respect to the marketing of its share of the output from the facilities. Exelon Generation will be entitled to receive reimbursement of its costs in discharging its obligations, an annual operating services fee and incentive fees of up to $12 million annually based on attainment of goals relating to safety, capacity factors of the plants and operation and maintenance expenses. The OSC has a term of two years, subject to earlier termination in certain events upon prior notice, including any termination of the Merger Agreement. In the event of termination, Exelon Generation will continue to provide services under the OSC for a transition period of at least 180 days and up to two years at the election of Nuclear. This period may be further extended by Nuclear for up to an additional 12 months if Nuclear determines that additional time is necessary to complete required activities during the transition period. Prior to the Merger, PSEG and Exelon, and their respective subsidiaries, will continue to operate as separate entities. The discussion contained in the combined MD&A that follows relates solely to the current businesses of PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings and their respective expectations for future financial position, results of operations and cash flows, exclusive of any potential impacts from the Merger. 46 PSEG PSEGs business consists of four reportable segments, which are PSE&G, Power and the two direct subsidiaries of Energy Holdings: Global and PSEG Resources LLC (Resources). The following is a discussion of the markets in which PSEG and its subsidiaries compete, the corporate strategy for the conduct of PSEGs businesses within these markets and significant events that have occurred during 2004 and expectations for 2005 and beyond. PSEG develops a long range growth target by building business plans and financial forecasts for each major business (PSE&G, Power, Global and Resources). These plans and forecasts incorporate detailed estimates of revenues, operating and maintenance expenses, capital expenditures, financing costs and other material factors for each business. Key factors which may influence the performance of each business, such as fuel costs and forward power prices, are also incorporated. Sensitivity analyses are performed on the key variables that drive the businesses financial results in order to understand the impact of these assumptions on PSEGs projections. Once plans are in place, PSEG Management monitors actual results and key variables and updates financial projections to reflect changes in the energy markets, the economy and regional and global conditions. PSEG Management believes this monitoring and forecasting process enables it to alter operating and investment plans as conditions change. PSEG projects earnings from Continuing Operations for 2005 of $3.15 to $3.35 per share. Included in the 2005 earnings projections are improved operations at Powers generating facilities as compared to 2004 and margin improvements through the expiration of existing contracts and the realization of current and anticipated higher market prices. These projected improvements are expected to be partially offset by lower income from Powers Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT) Funds as compared to 2004. PSEG also expects Earnings Per Share in 2005 to be reduced by additional shares outstanding primarily due to the anticipated conversion of participating equity securities in November 2005. PSEG expects operating cash flows beyond 2004 to be sufficient to meet capital needs and dividend requirements and may employ any excess cash to reduce debt, invest in its businesses or increase dividends. On January 18, 2005, PSEG announced an increase in its dividend from $0.55 to $0.56 per share for the first quarter of 2005. This quarterly increase reflects an indicated annual dividend rate of $2.24 per share. Several key factors that will drive PSEGs future success are energy, capacity and fuel prices, performance of Powers generating facilities, PSE&Gs ability to maintain a reasonable rate of return under its regulated rate structure and the stability of international economies for Energy Holdings. Assuming improvements in these factors over the latter part of the planning period, as discussed further below under PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings, PSEG has a target annual earnings per share growth rate of 4% to 6% from 2005 to 2009. PSE&G PSE&G operates as an electric and gas public utility in New Jersey under cost based regulation by the BPU for its distribution operations and by the FERC for its electric transmission and wholesale sales operations. Consequently, the earnings of PSE&G are largely determined by the regulation of its rates by those agencies. In February 2004, the BPU approved the results of New Jerseys third annual basic generation service (BGS) auction process and PSE&G successfully secured contracts to provide the electricity requirements for its customers needs. On October 5, 2004, the BPU approved a 3% increase in PSE&Gs residential gas commodity charge to cover the higher cost of natural gas. The cost of energy supply, for both gas and electricity, is passed through from PSE&G to its customers. In 2005, PSE&G expects Income from Continuing Operations to range from $325 million to $345 million, based on normal weather conditions, expected sales growth, productivity gains and the effects of the 2003 electric base rate case, partially offset by cost increases. In addition, as provided for in a BPU order received in July 2003 in PSE&Gs electric base rate case, PSE&G is amortizing a reserve for excess depreciation which results in an annual $64 million reduction in Depreciation and Amortization expense through December 31, 2005. The BPUs order in this case allows PSE&G to file for a $64 million increase in electric distribution rates effective January 1, 2006, subsequent to the amortization of this reserve. Assuming a fair resolution to upcoming rate matters, expected increases in sales volumes and stable weather patterns, PSE&G expects annual earnings growth of 1% to 2% from 2005 to 2009. The risks from this business generally relate to the treatment of the various rate and other issues by the state and federal regulatory agencies, specifically BPU and FERC. In 2005 and beyond, PSE&Gs success will 47 depend, in part, on its ability to maintain a reasonable rate of return, realize a $64 million electric distribution rate increase in 2006, continue cost containment initiatives, maintain system reliability and safety levels and continue to recover with an adequate return the regulatory assets it has deferred and the investments it plans to make in its electric and gas transmission and distribution system. Since PSE&G earns no margin on the commodity portion of its electric and gas sales through tariff agreements, there is no anticipated commodity price volatility for PSE&G. Power Power is an electric generation and wholesale energy marketing and trading company that is focused on a generation market extending from Maine to the Carolinas and the Atlantic Coast to Indiana (Super Region). Powers principal operating subsidiaries, PSEG Fossil LLC (Fossil), Nuclear and PSEG Energy Resources & Trade LLC (ER&T) are regulated by FERC. Through its subsidiaries, Power seeks to balance its generating capacity, fuel requirements and supply obligations through integrated energy marketing and trading, enhance its ability to produce low cost energy through efficient nuclear operations and pursue modest growth in the Super Region based on market conditions. To reduce volatility in earnings and cash flow, Powers objective is to enter into load serving contracts, firm sales and trading positions sufficient to hedge at least 75% of its anticipated output over an 18 month to 24 month horizon. Power has achieved this objective through a combination of contracts related to the New Jersey BGS auctions, contracts in Pennsylvania and Connecticut and other firm sales and trading positions. Prospectively, Power intends to take advantage of the BGS auctions in New Jersey and other opportunities elsewhere in the market region to continue to meet this objective. In February 2005, the BPU approved the results of the BGS FP and CIEP auctions for New Jersey customers. Each bidder was limited to a third of each EDCs total load. Power will continue to be a direct supplier of New Jersey EDCs under both the BGS FP and CIEP auctions, entering into additional contracts that will begin on June 1, 2005. Power believes that its obligations under these contracts are reasonably balanced by its available supply. A key factor in Powers ability to achieve its objectives is its capability to operate its nuclear and fossil stations at sufficient capacity to avoid the need to purchase higher priced electricity to satisfy its obligations. Overall, 2004 earnings were lower than originally expected primarily due to a series of factors related to its nuclear and fossil operations and recent market pricing and electric transmission congestion which resulted in the purchase of higher priced replacement power. In 2004, the absence of the market transition charge (MTC) revenues at Power that had been collected during the four year transition period under New Jerseys electric utility deregulation provisions that ended August 2003 resulted in a decrease to earnings of approximately $66 million, after tax. Powers results from its nuclear operations have been negatively impacted by unanticipated, extended outages at its Hope Creek and Salem nuclear generation facilities. These outages were the result of necessary repair and maintenance work, which is expected to improve long term operating performance. In addition, Powers fossil operations were adversely impacted by unanticipated outages at its Hudson station and extended outages at its Mercer station. During much of 2004, the price of replacement power to satisfy Powers contracted obligations to serve load and supply power was significantly impacted by higher than expected fuel and transmission congestion costs. Power believes that a large portion of the increased congestion costs were related to the derating of an electric transformer maintained by PSE&G, which is in the PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM) system. This transformer is being replaced, with an expected return to service in June 2005. In addition, Powers Waterford, Ohio and Lawrenceburg, Indiana facilities in the Midwest have experienced very low capacity factors due to oversupply conditions, and therefore have provided only modest revenues. Power cannot predict when these market conditions will improve. On October 24, 2004, Powers Hope Creek nuclear generation facility transitioned to a planned refueling outage following the units shutdown on October 10, 2004 due to a steam pipe failure. Hope Creek completed its refueling outage and returned to service on January 26, 2005. In an unrelated matter in early December 2004, the two Salem nuclear generation units were taken offline due to an oil spill from a tanker in the Delaware River, near the facilities. The units, which draw river water for cooling purposes, were shut down for about two weeks to avoid intake of the spilled oil. Power anticipates that it will make a filing to seek recovery of damages and losses resulting from the oil spill. It is not possible to predict at this time what the results of this claim will be. The longer than planned outage at Hope Creek and an unexpected shutdown of the two Salem nuclear units resulted in additional maintenance and increased replacement power costs and Operation and Maintenance costs. 48 As previously discussed, Power has entered into an OSC with Exelon Generation in an attempt to improve nuclear operations. Power expects Income from Continuing Operations to range from $335 million to $385 million in 2005. The increase, as compared to 2004 earnings, is expected from anticipated improvements in Powers nuclear and fossil operations, anticipated higher margins through the expiration of existing contracts, the realization of current and anticipated higher market prices and additional generation going into service. It is expected that these increases will be partially offset by higher Depreciation expense and lower earnings from Powers NDT Funds. The improvements discussed above are expected to increase Powers earnings in the latter part of the five year planning period. Based on these assumptions, Power expects annual earnings growth in a range of 10% to 14% from 2005 to 2009. Powers future success as an energy provider will depend, in part, on its ability to meet its obligations under its full requirements contracts efficiently and profitably and the efficient operation of its low cost nuclear and coal generation facilities. Powers ability to meet its forecasts are expected to continue to be impacted by low capacity prices due to the oversupply of electric generation capacity and the resulting competition combined with volatile prices and conditions in energy and fuel markets, including increasing commodity and transportation costs. In addition, such factors could impact liquidity in the event that Power is required to post margin related to its commodity contracts. See Note 14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities&mdash;Guaranteed Obligations of the Notes for additional information. Energy Holdings Energy Holdings, through Global, owns and operates electric generation and distribution facilities in international and U.S. markets. The generation plants sell power under long term agreements, as well as on a merchant basis, while the distribution companies are rate regulated enterprises. Through Resources, Energy Holdings invests in energy related financial transactions, including leveraged leases, which are designed to produce predictable earnings and cash flows. During 2004, Energy Holdings generated substantial cash flows from operations and asset sales, as discussed below, which it has used to meet its scheduled debt maturity of $267 million in February 2004, repurchase approximately $41 million of its 2007 debt, reducing its next debt maturity to $309 million, and return $491 million of capital to PSEG. In addition, Energy Holdings and its subsidiaries have $199 million of cash (including cash offshore) and a $115 million receivable from PSEG as of December 31, 2004. For 2005, Energy Holdings expects Income from Continuing Operations to range from $135 million to $155 million. The expected 2005 range exceeds the 2004 Income from Continuing Operations as stronger results from TIE, lower financing costs and the absence of foreign currency losses at Elektrocieplownia Chorzow Sp. Z o.o. (ELCHO) more than offset the loss of earnings from the sale of Meiya Power Company Limited (MPC) and the partial sale of Luz del Sur S.A. (LDS) in 2004. Energy Holdings expects annual earnings growth of 2% to 3% from 2005 to 2009. This expected earnings growth assumes a stable foreign currency environment, combined with expected improvements in earnings from TIE, due to an anticipated recovery in the Texas market, and improved earnings from Globals facilities in Poland. It is expected that these improvements will be offset by future reductions in revenue related to the collection in January 2005 of the final payment related to the withdrawal from Eagle Point Cogeneration Partnership and the expiration of the contract for the Bridgewater, New Hampshire facility in 2007. Global Although Global continues to produce significant earnings and operating cash flow, the returns on its international investment portfolio have not been commensurate with the level of risk associated with international investments in developing energy markets. Such risks include the losses incurred on the abandonment of Globals Argentine investments in 2002, the devaluation of the Brazilian Real and the corresponding decrease in earnings and cash flow from Globals investment in Rio Grande Energia S.A. (RGE), the impact of other foreign currency fluctuations and the failure of certain counterparties to honor contracts with certain of Globals investments. As a result, since 2003, Energy Holdings has refocused its strategy from one of accelerated growth to one that places emphasis on increasing the efficiency and returns of its existing assets and seeks to opportunistically monetize investments that may no longer have a strategic fit. As part of this process, in 2004, Global completed (1) the sale of its investment in Carthage Power Company (CPC), a generating facility in Rades, Tunisia, for proceeds of $43 million; (2) the sale of a portion of its shares in LDS, a power distribution company in Peru, for proceeds of approximately $31 million; (3) the 49 acquisition of all of TECO Energy Inc.s (TECO) interests in TIE, which owns two power generation facilities in Texas, for less than $1 million, bringing Globals ownership interest to 100%; and (4) the sale of its 50% equity interest in MPC for approximately $236 million, of which $100 million was paid in cash and the balance of approximately $136 million is in the form of a note due on March 31, 2005. In January 2005, a $38 million principal payment of this note was received. In addition, as part of this change in strategy, Global continues to limit its capital spending, while focusing on operations and improved performance of existing businesses. In 2005, the capital requirements of Globals consolidated subsidiaries will primarily be financed from internally generated cash flow within the projects and from local sources on a non recourse basis or limited discretionary investments by Energy Holdings. Globals success will depend, in part, upon its ability to mitigate risks of its international strategy. The economic and political conditions in certain countries where Global has investments present risks that may be different or more significant than those found in the U.S. including: renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts, changes in law or tax policy, interruption of business, nationalization, expropriation, war and other factors. Operations in foreign countries also present risks associated with currency exchange and convertibility, inflation and repatriation of earnings. In some countries in which Global has interests, economic and monetary conditions and other factors could affect its ability to convert its cash distributions to U.S. Dollars or other freely convertible currencies. Furthermore, the central bank of any such country may have the authority to suspend, restrict or otherwise impose conditions on foreign exchange transactions or to limit distributions to foreign investors. Although Global generally seeks to structure power purchase contracts and other project revenue agreements to provide for payments to be made in, or indexed to, U.S. Dollars or a currency freely convertible into U.S. Dollars, its ability to do so in all cases may be limited. Resources Resources continues to focus on maintaining its current investment portfolio and does not expect to make any new investments. Resources objective is to produce predictable cash flows, earnings and related tax benefits while monitoring credit concerns with respect to certain lessees in its portfolio. Resources ability to realize tax benefits associated with its leveraged lease investments is dependent upon operating gains generated by its affiliates. In April 2004, Resources terminated its lease with Edison Mission Energy (EME) in the Collins generating facility, strengthening the credit quality of Resources remaining exposure with EME, resulting in a weighted average rating of the lessees in Resources lease portfolio of A /A3. As a result of sales during 2004, Resources investment in leveraged buyout funds has been reduced from approximately $75 million as of December 31, 2003 to approximately $27 million as of December 31, 2004. Resources earnings and cash flows are expected to decrease in the future as the investment portfolio matures. Resources faces risks with regard to the creditworthiness of its counterparties, specifically certain lessees that collectively comprise a substantial portion of Resources investment portfolio as discussed further below. Resources also faces risks related to potential changes in the current tax treatment of its investments in leveraged leases. The manifestation of either of these risks could cause a materially adverse effect on Resources strategy and its forecasted results of operations, financial position and net cash flows. Resources has credit risk related to its investments in leveraged leases, totaling $1.2 billion, net of deferred taxes of $1.6 billion, as of December 31, 2004. These investments are largely concentrated in the energy industry and have some exposure to the airline industry. As of December 31, 2004, 69% of counterparties in the lease portfolio were rated investment grade by both Standard & Poors (S&P) and Moodys. For further discussion of these leveraged leases, see Item 7A. Qualitative and Quantitative Discussion of Market Risk&mdash;Credit Risk&mdash;Resources. 50 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings Net Income for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $726 million or $3.05 per share of common stock, diluted, based on approximately 238 million average shares outstanding. Net Income for the year ended December 31, 2003 was approximately $1.2 billion or $5.07 per share of common stock, diluted, based on approximately 229 million average shares outstanding. Included in 2003s Net Income was a $370 million after tax Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle related to the adoption in 2003 of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS 143). See Note 3. Asset Retirement Obligations of the Notes. For the year ended December 31, 2002, Net Income was $235 million or $1.13 per share of common stock, diluted, including certain after tax charges of $538 million or $2.57 per share. The charges related to the abandoned Argentine investments and losses from operations of those assets, discontinued operations of PSEG Energy Technologies Inc. (Energy Technologies) and Tanir Bavi Power Company Private Ltd. (Tanir Bavi), a generating facility in India, and goodwill impairment charges.

Extraordinary Item of the Notes. (G) Relates to the adoption of SFAS 143 in 2003 and the adoption of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142) in 2002. See Note 2. Recent Accounting Standards and Note 3. Asset Retirement Obligations of the Notes. The $131 million, or $0.69 per share, decrease in Income from Continuing Operations for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, was primarily due to lower earnings at Power due to decreased load being served under the fixed price BGS contracts, higher Operation and Maintenance costs primarily incurred for work performed during a longer than planned refueling outage at the Hope Creek nuclear unit, the loss of MTC revenues, which ceased effective August 1, 2003 at the end of the transition period and higher replacement power and congestion costs in 2004. Also contributing to the decrease were currency fluctuations at Global and lower earnings at Resources, primarily resulting from the termination of the Collins lease. These decreases were partially offset by improved earnings at PSE&G primarily relating to increased electric base rates. Also contributing to the change in Net Income was Energy Holdings Income from Discontinued Operations of $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to its Loss from Discontinued Operations of $44 million, after tax, for the same period in 2003. The $447 million increase in Income from Continuing Operations for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002, was primarily due to higher earnings from Energy Holdings due to the absence of the $368 million after tax losses at Energy Holdings Argentine investments recorded in 2002. In addition, PSE&G improved earnings due to increased electric base rates, seasonality differences in pricing that are a component of those rates, favorable weather effects and lower interest costs. In addition, Power had slightly higher earnings primarily related to the benefits resulting from the operation of the two generating facilities in Connecticut that were acquired in December 2002, higher margins driven by an increase in volume as a result of the BGS contracts that went into effect in August 2002 and realized gains in its NDT portfolio, partially offset by the effects of storm related weather and higher Operation and Maintenance expense. Also contributing to Energy Holdings increase in earnings were improved results from Global. The growth in Income from Continuing Operations did not result in higher per share amounts due to dilution caused mainly by the PSEG Common Stock issuance in the fourth quarter of 2003. Included in PSEGs 2003 Net Income was an after tax benefit of $370 million related to the adoption of SFAS 143 during the first quarter of 2003. This benefit was due mainly to the required remeasurement of Powers nuclear decommissioning obligations. Conversely, in 2002, PSEG adopted SFAS 142 and incurred an after tax charge of $121 million related to goodwill impairments at certain of Energy Holdings investments. Also contributing to the changes in Net Income was a decrease in Energy Holdings Loss from Discontinued Operations, including Loss on Disposal of $5 million, after tax, for the year ended December 31, 2003, as 52 compared to the same period in 2002, and an $18 million, after tax, extraordinary charge recorded at PSE&G in the second quarter of 2003 related to the outcome of its electric base rate case, discussed above in PSE&Gs Overview of 2004 and Future Outlook. PSEG For the Years Ended December 31, 2004 vs 2003 2003 vs 2002 2004 2003 2002 Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % (Millions) (Millions) Operating Revenues $ 10,996 $ 11,139 $ 8,220 $ (143 ) (1 ) $ 2,919 36 Energy Costs $ 6,057 $ 6,391 $ 3,710 $ (334 ) (5 ) $ 2,681 72 Operation and Maintenance $ 2,260 $ 2,120 $ 1,899 $ 140 7 $ 221 12 Depreciation and Amortization $ 719 $ 527 $ 565 $ 192 36 $ (38 ) (7 ) Income from Equity Method Investments $ 126 $ 114 $ 119 $ 12 11 $ (5 ) (4 ) Other Income $ 176 $ 178 $ 39 $ (2 ) (1 ) $ 139 356 Other Deductions $ (93 ) $ (101 ) $ (80 ) $ (8 ) (8 ) $ 21 26 Interest Expense $ (859 ) $ (836 ) $ (819 ) $ 23 3 $ 17 2 Income Tax Expense $ (446 ) $ (464 ) $ (254 ) $ (18 ) (4 ) $ 210 83 PSEGs results of operations are primarily comprised of the results of operations of its operating subsidiaries, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings, excluding changes related to intercompany transactions, which are eliminated in consolidation and certain financing costs at the parent company. For additional information on intercompany transactions, see Note 23. Related Party Transactions of the Notes. For a discussion of the causes for the variances at PSEG in the table above, see the discussions for PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings that follow. PSE&G For the Years Ended December 31, 2004 vs 2003 2003 vs 2002 2004 2003 2002 Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % (Millions) (Millions) Operating Revenues $ 6,972 $ 6,740 $ 5,919 $ 232 3 $ 821 14 Energy Costs $ 4,284 $ 4,421 $ 3,684 $ (137 ) (3 ) $ 737 20 Operation and Maintenance $ 1,083 $ 1,050 $ 982 $ 33 3 $ 68 7 Depreciation and Amortization $ 523 $ 372 $ 409 $ 151 41 $ (37 ) (9 ) Other Income $ 12 $ 6 $ 15 $ 6 100 $ (9 ) (60 ) Other Deductions $ (1 ) $ (1 ) $ (2 ) $ &mdash; &mdash; $ (1 ) (50 ) Interest Expense $ (362 ) $ (390 ) $ (406 ) $ (28 ) (7 ) $ (16 ) (4 ) Income Tax Expense $ (246 ) $ (129 ) $ (115 ) $ 117 91 $ 14 12 Operating Revenues PSE&G has three sources of revenue: commodity revenues from the sales of energy to customers and in the PJM spot market; delivery revenues from the transmission and distribution of energy through its system; and other operating revenues from the provision of various services. Commodity PSE&G makes no margin on commodity sales as the costs are passed through to customers. The difference between costs and the amount provided by customers in revenues is deferred and collected from or returned to customers in future periods. Total commodity volumes and revenues are subject to market forces. Gas commodity prices fluctuate monthly for commercial and industrial customers and annually through the BGSS tariff for residential customers. In addition, for residential gas customers, PSE&G has the ability to adjust rates upward two additional times and downward at any time, if warranted, between annual Basic Gas Supply Service (BGSS) proceedings. 53 Gas commodity revenues decreased $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, due primarily to lower sales volumes of 20%, offset by higher BGSS prices. Approximately 80% of the volume decline was due to lower sales to cogenerators and the balance was weather related. Electric commodity prices are set at the annual BGS auction. Electric commodity revenues increased $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, primarily due to $249 million in increased prices offset by $233 million in lower volumes of 12% caused by migration of large customers to third party suppliers. Gas commodity revenues increased $660 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002, due primarily to higher sales volumes of 9% and higher BGSS prices. Electric commodity revenues increased $80 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002, primarily due to $217 million in increased prices offset by $137 million in lower volumes of 7% caused by migration of large customers to third party suppliers. Delivery Electric delivery revenues increased $222 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003. The net effect of full year base rate increases in August 2003, combined with other annual rate adjustments in January 2004, increased revenues by $180 million. The balance of the increase was driven by higher sales volumes of 3%. Less than one percent of the sales increase was weather related. Gas delivery revenues decreased $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, primarily due to a 4% decline in residential sales due to weather. Heating degree days were 5% lower in 2004. Gas delivery revenues increased $97 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002, due to higher sales volumes of 14%, primarily due to weather. Heating degree days were 21% higher in 2003. Operating Expenses Energy Costs The $137 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, was comprised of decreases of $96 million in electric costs and $41 million in gas costs. The electric decrease was caused by $262 million in lower BGS volumes due to customer migration to third party suppliers offset by $166 million in higher prices for BGS and Non Utility Generation (NUG) purchases. The gas decrease was caused by a $388 million or 20% decrease in sales volumes due primarily to lower sales to cogenerators offset by a $347 million or 26% increase in gas prices. The $737 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002, was comprised of increases of $658 million in gas costs and $79 million in electric costs. The gas increase was caused by a $527 million or 26% increase in gas prices and $131 million or 9% increase in sales volumes. The electric increase was caused by $249 million in higher prices for BGS and NUG purchases, partially offset by $170 million in lower costs due to lower BGS volumes as the result of customer migration and lower NUG volumes. Operation and Maintenance The $33 million increase for 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, was due primarily to increased Demand Side Management (DSM) amortization of $20 million, increased consumer education expenses of $24 million, an $18 million reduction in real estate tax expense in 2003 and $10 million related to a regulatory asset reserve reversal in 2003. DSM costs are deferred when incurred and amortized to expense when recovered in revenues. Offsetting the increases were decreased labor and fringe benefits of $7 million, due to lower pension costs as a result of improved fund performance, a $22 million reduction in Societal Benefits Charges (SBC) expenses and $10 million in lower shared services costs due to reduced technology spending. The $68 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002, was due primarily to higher labor and fringe benefit costs of $48 million, due to higher wage and incentive program costs, higher pension costs and increased weather and storm related expenses due to Hurricane 54 Isabel and the extreme winter weather. Also contributing to the increase were higher bad debt expense of $10 million due to high winter gas sales and higher DSM costs of approximately $38 million related to the increased sales, discussed above. Partially offsetting these increases were a reduction in real estate tax expense of $18 million and the reversal of a $10 million reserve against a regulatory asset that is now being recovered. Depreciation and Amortization The $151 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, was due primarily to a $132 million reduction in amortization of an excess electric distribution depreciation reserve regulatory liability, a $30 million increase in the amortization of various regulatory assets and a $10 million increase due to increased plant in service. These increases were offset by a $16 million decrease from the use of a lower book depreciation rate for electric distribution property, which took effect in August 2003 following the conclusion of the electric base rate case, and a $6 million decrease due to plant assets transferred to an affiliate in 2003. The $37 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002, was due primarily to a $52 million increase in amortization of an excess electric distribution depreciation reserve regulatory liability and a $11 million decrease from the use of a lower book depreciation rate for electric distribution property starting in August 2003 due to the rate case referred to above. These decreases were offset by increases of $13 million due to increased plant in service and $9 million due to amortization of regulatory assets related to securitization. Other Income The $6 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, was due primarily to $11 million of equity return adjustments to regulatory assets in 2003, $4 million of interest income related to an affiliate loan and other Investment Income of $3 million offset by decreased gains on excess property sales of $12 million. The $9 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002, was due primarily to equity return adjustments to regulatory assets of $11 million offset by $2 million in increased gains on the disposal of various electric transmission properties. Interest Expense The $28 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, was due primarily to lower interest on long term debt of $37 million as a result of lower interest rates and lower levels of long term debt outstanding, partially offset by $11 million in increased interest on affiliated loans. The $16 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002, was due primarily to lower interest on long term debt of $23 million due to various maturities and redemptions of approximately $250 million. These decreases were partially offset by increased short term interest expense of $2 million due to higher short term debt balances outstanding due to increased working capital needs and $6 million in increased carrying charges related to certain regulatory assets. Income Taxes The $117 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, was primarily due to higher pre tax income combined with lower tax benefits primarily attributable to the excess depreciation reserve adjustment in 2003. The $14 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002, was due to higher pre tax income, offset by tax benefits recorded in 2003 attributable to the actual filing of the 2002 tax return. Extraordinary Item As discussed previously, included in the Electric Base Rate Case decision issued by the BPU was a refund related to revenues collected through the SBC for nuclear decommissioning. Because this amount 55 reflects the final accounting for PSEGs generation related business pursuant to the four year transition plan mandated by the Final Order, the adjustment has been recorded as an $18 million, after tax, Extraordinary Item as required under Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations&mdash;Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions (APB 30) and SFAS No. 101, Regulated Enterprises&mdash;Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 71. Power For the Year Ended December 31, 2004 vs 2003 2003 vs 2002 2004 2003 2002 Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % (Millions) (Millions) Operating Revenues $ 5,173 $ 5,613 $ 3,640 $ (440 ) (8 ) $ 1,973 54 Energy Costs $ 3,558 $ 3,754 $ 1,856 $ (196 ) (5 ) $ 1,898 102 Operation and Maintenance $ 967 $ 914 $ 773 $ 53 6 $ 141 18 Depreciation and Amortization $ 121 $ 102 $ 108 $ 19 19 $ (6 ) (6 ) Other Income $ 166 $ 149 $ 1 $ 17 11 $ 148 n/a Other Deductions $ (57 ) $ (78 ) $ (1 ) $ (21 ) (27 ) $ 77 n/a Interest Expense $ (142 ) $ (114 ) $ (122 ) $ 28 25 $ (8 ) (7 ) Income Tax Expense $ (186 ) $ (326 ) $ (313 ) $ (140 ) (43 ) $ 13 4 Operating Revenues Operating Revenues decreased by $440 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, due to decreases of $485 million in generation revenues and $5 million in trading revenues offset by an increase of $50 million in gas supply revenues. Operating Revenues increased by $2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002, due to increases of $646 million in generation revenues, $1.3 billion in gas supply revenues and $12 million in trading revenues. Generation Generation revenues decreased by $485 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, primarily due to $1.1 billion in lower revenues due to decreased load being served under the fixed priced BGS contracts, which was partially offset by $869 million of higher revenues from new contracts and higher sales into the various power pools. Additionally, the loss of MTC and NDT revenues, which amounted to $111 million and $17 million, respectively, comprised part of the decrease. Also contributing to the decrease was the adoption of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03 11, Reporting Realized Gains and Losses on Derivative Instruments That Are Subject to FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and Not Held for Trading Purposes as defined in EITF Issue No. 02 3, Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities (EITF 03 11), which requires gains and losses (realized and unrealized) on all derivative instruments within the scope of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133) to be shown net when recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, whether or not settled physically, if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes as defined in EITF 02 3, which became effective on a prospective basis for transactions occurring after September 30, 2003. Since prior periods were not restated, the effect of adopting EITF 03 11 reduced Powers Operating Revenues by approximately $174 million, with an equal reduction in Energy Costs, as compared to the same period in 2003. Generation revenues increased by $646 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002, primarily due to increased BGS related revenues of $293 million from third party wholesale electric suppliers which commenced on August 1, 2002 and $153 million in increased revenues from two generation facilities in Connecticut acquired in 2002 and the Waterford, Ohio plant, which became operational in August 2003. Also contributing to the increase were increased MTC revenues of $13 million, 56 increased capacity sales of $41 million and $167 million of higher revenues from new contracts and higher sales into the various power pools. Gas Supply Gas supply revenues increased by $50 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, primarily due to higher gas prices under the BGSS contract partially offset by decreased sales volumes mainly due to demand by PSE&G. Gas supply revenues increased by $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002, primarily due to 2003 being the first full year of the BGSS contract with PSE&G compared to a partial year in 2002 since the contract commenced in May 2002. Gas revenues for the first four months of 2003 totaled $1.1 billion. Also contributing to the increase in gas revenues were higher sales volumes and higher gas prices. Operating Expenses Energy Costs Energy Costs represent the cost of generation, which includes fuel purchases for generation as well as purchased energy in the market, and gas purchases to meet Powers obligation under its BGSS contract with PSE&G. Energy Costs decreased approximately $196 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, primarily due to a $216 million decrease in purchased power due to decreased load being served under the BGS contracts, which was offset by increased replacement power costs due to outages and higher purchased power for new contracts and a $12 million increase in gas supply costs due to higher gas prices. For additional information related to the outages at Power facilities, see the MD&A&mdash;Overview of 2004 and Future Outlook&mdash;Power. Also contributing to the decrease for the year was a reduction of approximately $174 million related to the adoption of EITF 03 11, as discussed above. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher fuel costs for generation of approximately $159 million, primarily related to higher gas prices and higher usage, including an increase of approximately $20 million related to the settlement for nuclear waste storage costs for Peach Bottom. For additional information regarding the settlement, see Note 14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities&mdash;Nuclear Fuel Disposal of the Notes. Energy Costs increased approximately $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002, primarily due to a $1.3 billion increase in gas costs due to the effect of a full year under the BGSS contract combined with higher gas sales volumes and prices and higher gas, oil and coal costs for generation. The increase in Energy Costs was also due to increased energy purchases on the spot market, as well as bilateral energy purchases, of approximately $413 million. Also, Power incurred an increase of approximately $116 million in network transmission expenses given that there were no payments for the first seven months in 2002. In addition, charges associated with fuel and energy purchases to satisfy wholesale power agreements related to its Connecticut generating facilities totaled approximately $80 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Operation and Maintenance Operation and Maintenance expense increased $53 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, due to increased costs of $85 million related to the outages at Hope Creek, Salem and Mercer. For additional information related to the outages at Power facilities, see the MD&A&mdash;Overview of 2004 and Future Outlook&mdash;Power. Also contributing to the increase was $10 million of higher operation and maintenance costs related to the Waterford and Lawrenceburg facilities offset by $12 million related to the settlement for nuclear waste storage costs for Peach Bottom, $10 million in lower real estate taxes and other items. Additional offsets include the absence of reorganization costs of $9 million and the lower write down costs related to obsolete materials and supplies of $8 million. For additional information regarding the settlement, see Note 14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities&mdash;Nuclear Fuel Disposal of the Notes. Operation and Maintenance expense increased $141 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002, due to costs of generating facilities in Connecticut acquired in December 2002 of $56 million, accretion expense of $24 million associated with the nuclear decommissioning 57 liabilities and higher nuclear refueling outage costs of $24 million. Also contributing to the increase was higher pension expense of $20 million, higher reorganization costs of $9 million and higher write down costs related to obsolete materials and supplies of $8 million. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and Amortization expense increased $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, primarily due to the Waterford facility being placed into service in August 2003 and the Lawrenceburg facility being placed into service in June 2004. Depreciation and Amortization expense decreased $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002. The net decrease was comprised of lower depreciation costs of approximately $30 million due to the absence of decommissioning charges, which are no longer recorded as a result of the implementation of SFAS 143, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization primarily related to generating facilities in Connecticut acquired in December 2002 and a higher asset base. Other Income Other Income increased $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, due primarily to increased realized gains and income related to the NDT Funds. Other Income increased $148 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002, due primarily to the recording of realized gains and income on the NDT Funds. Other Deductions Other Deductions decreased by $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, primarily due to $28 million in lower realized losses and expenses related to the NDT Funds partially offset by a $7 million write off of unamortized issuance costs related to the extinguishment of project financing related to Powers Waterford and Lawrenceburg facilities. Other Deductions increased by $77 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002, due primarily to the recording of realized losses on the NDT Funds. Interest Expense Interest Expense increased by $28 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, including $17 million of increased interest primarily due to higher interest rates on new long term debt financing that replaced project level non recourse debt. Also contributing to the increase was interest of $7 million related to the early settlement of an interest rate swap related to the extinguishment of project financing related to the Waterford and Lawrenceburg facilities and higher interest of $4 million related to an affiliate loan. Interest Expense decreased by $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002. Capitalized interest relating to various construction projects reduced interest expense by approximately $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002. Power incurred additional interest charges of $20 million due primarily to the new long term financing of $600 million in June 2002, this increase was partially offset by lower interest expense on variable rate debt and other lower charges of approximately $15 million. Income Taxes Income taxes decreased by $140 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, due primarily to lower pre tax income. Income taxes increased by $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002, due primarily to higher pre tax income. Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle For the year ended December 31, 2003, Power recorded an after tax benefit in the amount of $370 million due to the required remeasurement of Powers nuclear and fossil decommissioning obligations under 58 SFAS 143, which was adopted on January 1, 2003. See Note 3. Asset Retirement Obligations of the Notes for additional information. Energy Holdings For the Years Ended December 31, 2004 vs 2003 2003 vs 2002 2004 2003 2002 Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % (Millions) (Millions) Operating Revenues $ 1,027 $ 725 $ 609 $ 302 42 $ 116 19 Energy Costs $ 388 $ 155 $ 118 $ 233 150 $ 37 31 Operation and Maintenance $ 239 $ 176 $ 168 $ 63 36 $ 8 5 Write down of Project Investments $ &mdash; $ &mdash; $ 511 $ &mdash; &mdash; $ (511 ) (100 ) Depreciation and Amortization $ 57 $ 44 $ 28 $ 13 30 $ 16 57 Income from Equity Method Investments $ 126 $ 114 $ 119 $ 12 11 $ (5 ) (4 ) Other Income $ 4 $ 20 $ 26 $ (16 ) (80 ) $ (6 ) (23 ) Other Deductions $ (33 ) $ (5 ) $ (77 ) $ 28 560 $ (72 ) (94 ) Interest Expense $ (255 ) $ (218 ) $ (217 ) $ 37 17 $ 1 &mdash; Income Tax (Expense) Benefit $ (48 ) $ (59 ) $ 144 $ (11 ) (19 ) $ 203 141 The variances in Operating Revenues, Energy Costs, Operation and Maintenance expense, Depreciation and Amortization expense and Income from Equity Method Investments were primarily attributed to Globals acquisition of the remaining interests in TIE, thus consolidating the entity effective July 1, 2004, as compared to 2003 when Globals ownership was accounted for under the equity method of accounting. For additional information, see Note 4. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions and Acquisitions of the Notes. The increases were also due to ELCHO placing a new generation facility in Poland in service in November 2003, a generation facility in Oman owned by Dhofar Power Company S.A.O.C. (Dhofar Power) beginning commercial operation in May 2003 and increases in ownership of Electrowina Skawina S.A (Skawina) in Poland in 2003 and 2004. The variances are also related to favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher energy sales volumes at Sociedad Austral de Electricidad S.A. (SAESA) and a change for GWF Energy LLC (GWF Energy), which owns three generation facilities in California, which was accounted for under the equity method of accounting in 2004, due to a change in ownership interest, as compared to the first nine months of 2003 and the fourth quarter of 2002 when GWF Energy was consolidated. Operating Revenues The increase of $302 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, was due to higher revenues at Global of $355 million, including a $247 million increase related to the consolidation of TIE, a $62 million increase from ELCHO, a $35 million increase from SAESA, a $25 million increase from Dhofar Power and a $35 million gain on the sale of MPC, partially offset by a decrease of $53 million related to GWF Energy, which was not consolidated in 2004. Offsetting the increases at Global were lower revenues at Resources of $51 million, primarily due to a loss of $31 million related to the recalculation of certain leverage leases, a loss of $11 million due to the termination of the lease investment in the Collins generating facility and normal amortization of existing leases of $10 million offset by a realized gain of $2 million related to investments in leases, partnerships and securities. See Note 10. Long Term Investments of the Notes for additional information. The increase of $116 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002, was due to higher revenues at Global of $124 million, including a $47 million increase from Skawina, a $38 million increase from Dhofar Power, a $28 million increase from GWF Energy, which was consolidated for nine months in 2003 compared to three months in 2002, and a $19 million increase from SAESA, offset by the absence of $19 million in revenue from Empresa Distribuidora de Electricidad de Entre Rios S.A. (EDEERSA), in Argentina, which was abandoned in 2003. Offsetting the increases at Global were lower revenues at Resources of $10 million, primarily related to a $45 million net decrease in leveraged lease income and a $6 million decrease in realized income due to the termination of two leveraged leases in December 2002. Partially offsetting these decreases was the absence of an other than temporary impairment of non publicly traded equity securities held within the leveraged buyout funds of $42 million that was recorded in 2002. 59 Energy Costs The increase of $233 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, was primarily due to a $192 million increase related to the consolidation of TIE and increases of $22 million, $12 million and $5 million from SAESA, ELCHO and Dhofar Power, respectively, offset by a decrease of $3 million from GWF Energy. The increase of $37 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002, was primarily due to an increase of $21 million, $14 million, and $13 million from Skawina, SAESA and Dhofar Power, respectively, offset by a decrease of $7 million and $5 million from EDEERSA and Electroandes S.A. (Electroandes), respectively. Operation and Maintenance The increase of $63 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, was primarily due to a $30 million increase related to the consolidation of TIE and increases of $12 million, $9 million, and $2 million from ELCHO, SAESA and Dhofar Power, respectively, offset by a decrease of $8 million from GWF Energy. The increase is also due to higher operating expenses of $9 million at PSEG Energy Technologies Asset Management Company L.L.C. primarily due to higher legal expenses and final asset sale settlements and $7 million at Global primarily due to the 2003 reversal of contingencies related to the Argentine write down. The increase of $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002, was primarily due to increases of $19 million, $7 million, $6 million and $6 million from Skawina, Dhofar Power, GWF Energy and Electroandes, respectively, offset by decreased operation and maintenance expenses at Global of $28 million related to the abandonment of Globals Argentine investments combined with lower labor and administrative costs. Write down of Project Investments The decrease of $511 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002, was primarily due to Globals write down of investments in 2002, primarily in Argentina. See Note 6. Asset Impairments of the Notes. Depreciation and Amortization The increase of $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, was primarily due to a $9 million increase related to the consolidation of TIE and increases of $7 million, $5 million and $2 million from ELCHO, Dhofar Power and SAESA, respectively, offset by a decrease of $11 million from GWF Energy. The increase of $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002, was primarily due to increases of $8 million from both Dhofar Power and GWF Energy. Income from Equity Method Investments The increase of $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, was primarily driven by an $8 million increase related to the sale of a portion of Globals investment in LDS, an $11 million increase related to MPC due to additional projects going into operation, and a $4 million increase related to GWF Energy, offset by an $11 million decrease related to the consolidation of TIE commencing July 1, 2004. The decrease of $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002, was primarily due to lower equity method income in 2003 of $17 million at GWF Energy, which was recorded as a consolidated company for the first three quarters in 2003, as well as decreased earnings at Chilquinta Energia S.A. (Chilquinta) of $4 million. Partially offsetting this decrease were improved earnings at TIE of $14 million related to power purchase agreements (PPAs) entered into in early 2003 and improved market conditions in Texas. 60 Other Income The decrease of $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, was primarily due to the absence in 2004 of foreign currency transaction gains of $16 million for RGE and SAESA that occurred in 2003. The decrease of $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002, was primarily due to the absence of favorable changes in fair value mainly relating to foreign exchange contracts held by Energy Holdings. Other Deductions The increase of $28 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, was primarily due to foreign currency transaction losses of $26 million and a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $3 million in 2004, offset by a $5 million favorable change in derivative fair value related to Global. The $26 million in foreign currency transaction losses was almost entirely due to the impact of the weakening U.S. Dollar relative to the Polish Zloty on Globals investment in ELCHO. At the inception of this investment, it was determined that ELCHO is a U.S. Dollar functional currency as a portion of the long term PPA with the Polish government is indexed to the U.S. Dollar to support the portion of ELCHOs financing that is U.S. Dollar denominated. Since ELCHO has a U.S. Dollar functional currency, all monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in U.S. Dollars are marked at period end exchange rates with changes in values recorded as gains or losses in earnings. ELCHO has significant monetary liabilities in local currency, namely Polish Zloty debt used to partially finance the construction of the plant. As a result of the strengthening of the Polish Zloty against the U.S. Dollar in 2004, there were material losses recorded on the Polish Zloty debt to reflect the greater amount of U.S. Dollars required to pay the local debt. However, the accounting model does not capture the increase in value of Polish Zlotys that will be received under the long term PPA with the Polish government as the contract is not recorded on the balance sheet. As a result, the financial statements only reflect the losses on the Polish Zloty debt which, economically, have been more than offset by the increase in the value of the Polish Zlotys that will be received under the PPA. The decrease of $72 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002, was largely due to a $77 million foreign currency transaction loss during 2002, which primarily related to Globals Argentine investments. Interest Expense The increase of $37 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, was due to a $13 million increase related to the consolidation of TIE commencing on July 1, 2004, a $29 million increase related to ELCHO since interest was no longer capitalized as the plant became operational in the fourth quarter of 2003, and an increase in non recourse debt at the project level with higher interest rates, offset in part by the repayment of lower interest rate debt at Energy Holdings during 2003 and 2004. Income Taxes The decrease of $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, was primarily due to lower pre tax income and the impact of changes in certain lease forecast assumptions. In the fourth quarter of 2004, Resources revised several of its lease runs and recorded additional benefits of state tax losses generated by certain of its leases. These additional benefits resulted from changes in Resources forecast of state taxable income and tax liability over the relevant lease terms. This forecast was embedded in the lease reruns and led to an income tax benefit of $43 million in 2004 to reflect the cumulative benefit of this adjustment. This benefit was largely offset by the tax impact associated with a $31 million decrease in leveraged lease revenue. Future earnings will also increase by a modest amount as a result of this forecasted benefit. If Resources affiliates taxable earnings decreased significantly, resulting in the inability of Resources to record the benefits related to its taxable losses, it could lead to an adverse material impact to Resources results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Note 17. Income Taxes of the Notes for additional information. The increase of $203 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002, was primarily attributed to increased pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2003, as 61 compared to pre tax losses in the same period in 2002. The pre tax losses in 2002 resulted from the write off of $511 million, primarily related to investments in Argentina. See Note 6. Asset Impairments of the Notes. Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, including Gain (Loss) on Disposal, net of tax Carthage Power Company (CPC) In May 2004, Global completed the sale of its interest in CPC for approximately $43 million in cash and recognized a gain on disposal of $5 million after tax. Loss from Discontinued Operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $24 million including a $23 million estimated loss on disposal for the write down of CPC to its fair value less cost to sell. The operating results of CPC for the year ended December 31, 2002 yielded after tax income of approximately $1 million. See Note 4. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions and Acquisitions of the Notes for additional information. Energy Technologies In September 2003, Energy Holdings completed the sale of the remaining companies of Energy Technologies subsequent to recognizing a loss of $9 million, after tax, in the first quarter of 2003. Loss from Discontinued Operations for years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 were $11 million and $41 million, respectively, including the initial write down in 2002. See Note 4. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions and Acquisitions of the Notes for additional information. Tanir Bavi In the fourth quarter of 2002, Global sold its 74% interest in Tanir Bavi, a 220 MW generating facility in India. Global reduced the carrying value of Tanir Bavi to the contracted sales price of $45 million and recorded a loss on disposal of $14 million after tax for the year ended December 31, 2002. The operating results of Tanir Bavi for the year ended December 31, 2002 yielded after tax income of $5 million. See Note 4. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions and Acquisitions of the Notes. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle In 2002, Energy Holdings finalized the evaluation of the effect of adopting SFAS 142 on its recorded amount of goodwill. Under this standard, Energy Holdings was required to complete an impairment analysis of its recorded goodwill and record any resulting impairment. The total amount of goodwill impairments was $121 million, net of tax of $66 million and was comprised of $36 million (after tax) at EDEERSA, $35 million (after tax) at RGE, $32 million (after tax) at Energy Technologies and $18 million (after tax) at Tanir Bavi. All of the goodwill on these companies, other than RGE, was fully impaired. In accordance with SFAS 142, this impairment charge was recorded as of January 1, 2002 as a component of the Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle and is reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2002. See Note 9. Goodwill and Other Intangibles of the Notes. Other To supplement the Consolidated Financial Statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP), PSEG and Energy Holdings use the non GAAP measure of Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT). PSEGs and Energy Holdings Management each reviews EBIT internally to evaluate performance and manage operations and believes that the inclusion of this non GAAP financial measure provides consistent and comparable measures to help shareholders understand current and future operating results. PSEG and Energy Holdings urge shareholders to carefully review the GAAP financial information included as part of this Annual Report. 62 Global The following table summarizes Globals capital at risk, net contributions to EBIT and non recourse interest in the following regions as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 and for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.

(C) Non recourse interest is Interest Expense on debt that is non recourse to Global. (D) The differences in EBIT and Capital at Risk for Asia Pacific and Income Taxes are primarily due to the sale of MPC which closed on December 31, 2004. The 2004 Capital at Risk does not include the $136 million promissory note received from the sale of MPC. See Note 4. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions and Acquisitions of the Notes. (E) Foreign currency exchange losses at ELCHO were $28 million, $2 million, and $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following discussion of liquidity and capital resources is on a consolidated basis for PSEG, noting the uses and contributions of PSEGs three direct operating subsidiaries, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings. Financing Methodology PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings Capital requirements for PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings are met through liquidity provided by internally generated cash flow and external financings. Although earnings growth has moderated, PSEG expects to be able to fund existing commitments, reduce debt and meet dividend requirements using internally generated cash. PSEG, Power and Energy Holdings from time to time make equity contributions or otherwise provide credit support to their respective direct and indirect subsidiaries to provide for part of their capital and cash requirements, generally relating to long term investments. PSEG does not intend to contribute additional equity to Energy Holdings. At times, PSEG utilizes intercompany dividends and intercompany loans (except however, that PSE&G may not, without prior BPU approval, make loans to its parent or to affiliates) to satisfy various subsidiary or 63 parental needs and efficiently manage short term cash. Any excess funds are invested in short term liquid investments. External funding to meet PSEGs and PSE&Gs needs and a majority portion of the requirements of Power and Energy Holdings consist of corporate finance transactions. The debt incurred is the direct obligation of those respective entities. Some of the proceeds of these debt transactions are used by the respective obligor to make equity investments in its subsidiaries. As discussed below, depending on the particular company, external financing may consist of public and private capital market debt and equity transactions, bank revolving credit and term loans, commercial paper and or project financings. Some of these transactions involve special purpose entities (SPEs), formed in accordance with applicable tax and legal requirements in order to achieve specified financial advantages, such as favorable legal liability treatment. PSEG consolidates SPEs, as applicable, in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) (FIN 46). See Note 2. Recent Accounting Standards of the Notes. The availability and cost of external capital is affected by each entitys performance, as well as by the performance of their respective subsidiaries and affiliates. This could include the degree of structural separation between PSEG and its subsidiaries and the potential impact of affiliate ratings on consolidated and unconsolidated credit quality. Additionally, compliance with applicable financial covenants will depend upon future financial position, earnings and net cash flows, as to which no assurances can be given. Over the next several years, PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings may be required to extinguish or refinance maturing debt and, to the extent there is not sufficient internally generated funds, may incur additional debt and or provide equity to fund investment activities. Any inability to obtain required additional external capital or to extend or replace maturing debt and or existing agreements at current levels and reasonable interest rates may adversely affect PSEGs, PSE&Gs, Powers and Energy Holdings respective financial condition, results of operations and net cash flows. From time to time, PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings may repurchase portions of their respective debt securities using funds from operations, asset sales, commercial paper, debt issuances, equity issuances and other sources of funding and may make exchanges of new securities, including common stock, for outstanding securities. Such repurchases may be at variable prices below, at or above prevailing market prices and may be conducted by way of privately negotiated transactions, open market purchases, tender or exchange offers or other means. PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings may utilize brokers or dealers or effect such repurchases directly. Any such repurchases may be commenced or discontinued at any time without notice. It is expected that pursuant to the Merger Agreement, PSEG and Power will be consolidated into the combined company and all debt outstanding at PSEG and Power will be assumed by the new entities. Under the current plan, PSE&Gs and Energy Holdings securities will continue to be outstanding. Energy Holdings A portion of the financing for Globals projects and investments is normally provided by non recourse project financing transactions. These consist of loans from banks and other lenders that are typically secured by project assets and cash flows. Non recourse transactions generally impose no material obligation on the parent level investor to repay any debt incurred by the project borrower. The consequences of permitting a project level default include loss of any invested equity by the parent. However, in some cases, certain obligations relating to the investment being financed, including additional equity commitments, may be guaranteed by Global and or Energy Holdings for their respective subsidiaries. PSEG does not provide guarantees or credit support to Energy Holdings or its subsidiaries. Operating Cash Flows PSEG For the year ended December 31, 2004, PSEGs operating cash flow increased by approximately $117 million from $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, as compared to the same period in 2003, due to net increases from its subsidiaries as discussed below. 64 For the year ended December 31, 2003, PSEGs operating cash flow increased by approximately $258 million from $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion, as compared to the same period in 2002, due to net increases from its subsidiaries as discussed below. PSE&G PSE&Gs operating cash flow increased approximately $95 million from $704 million to $695 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003 primarily due to higher Net Income related to the increase in electric base rates, additional regulatory recoveries and lower benefit plan contributions. PSE&Gs operating cash flow decreased approximately $223 million from $832 million to $609 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to same period in 2002. The 2002 operating cash flow was abnormally high primarily due to the sale of the gas inventory totaling approximately $415 million in 2002, $183 million of which related to PSE&Gs sale of the gas supply business to Power. Working capital needs also increased during 2003 due to changes in the over/under collected balances of PSE&Gs energy clauses and increased Accounts Receivable balances resulting from higher billings. Power Powers operating cash flow decreased approximately $127 million from $624 million to $497 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003 due to a decrease in Income from Continuing Operations of $166 million, primarily due to lower sales volumes and higher replacement power and maintenance costs combined with the loss of MTC revenues which ended August 1, 2003 offset by activity in the NDT Funds. Powers operating cash flow increased approximately $207 million from $417 million to $624 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002. The 2002 operating cash flow was abnormally low, due to the purchase of gas contracts from PSE&G in May 2002 for approximately $183 million and gas storage volume requirements, including higher gas prices, to meet its BGSS and generation requirements in 2002. However, higher gas prices in 2003 led to higher working capital requirements for fuels. Energy Holdings Energy Holdings operating cash flow increased approximately $115 million from $294 million to $409 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, due primarily to a tax payment made in 2003 related to two terminated leveraged lease transactions in 2002 and sales of certain investments in the KKR leveraged buyout fund in 2004. Energy Holdings operating cash flow increased approximately $186 million from $108 million to $294 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002. This increase is primarily related to increased earnings and realization of deferred tax assets, partially offset by a $115 million tax payment in the first quarter of 2003 related to two leveraged lease transactions at Resources with affiliates of TXU Europe that were terminated in the fourth quarter of 2002 and other miscellaneous items. Also, Global received a $137 million return of capital from its investment in GWF Energy that is reflected in financing activities rather than operating cash flows, as that project had been consolidated at that time. PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings The cash flow measure PSEG uses to manage the business is operating cash flows. PSEG also uses cash available to pay down recourse debt (i.e., excess cash) as a metric. Cash available to pay down recourse debt is calculated by taking PSEGs operating cash flows, less investing activities and net dividends and adjusted for items such as securitization bond principal repayments, offshore cash activity and the impact of consolidation accounting at Energy Holdings. In 2004, PSEG had cash available to pay down recourse debt exceeding $100 million, which was substantially supported by the monetization of assets and lease terminations by Energy Holdings with approximately $300 million in net proceeds. In the future, PSEG expects operating cash flows to be sufficient to fund the majority of future capital requirements and dividend payments. PSEG expects that cash available to pay down recourse debt will increase substantially in the latter part of its business plan cycle as capital expenditures are expected to decrease materially after 2005 when the current construction program at Power is completed. 65 Common Stock Dividends Dividend payments on common stock for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $2.20 per share and totaled approximately $522 million. Dividend payments on common stock for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $2.16 per share and totaled approximately $493 million. Future dividends declared will be dependent upon PSEGs future earnings, cash flows, financial requirements, alternative investment opportunities and other factors. On January 18, 2005, PSEG announced an increase in its dividend from $0.55 to $0.56 per share for the first quarter of 2005. This quarterly increase reflects an indicated annual dividend rate of $2.24 per share. Short Term Liquidity PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings As of December 31, 2004, PSEG and its subsidiaries had a total of approximately $2.7 billion of committed credit facilities with approximately $1.9 billion of available liquidity under these facilities. In addition, PSEG and PSE&G have access to certain uncommitted credit facilities. PSEG had no loans outstanding and PSE&G had $15 million outstanding under these uncommitted facilities as of December 31, 2004. Each of the facilities is restricted to availability and use to the specific companies as listed below. Company Expiration Date Total Facility Primary Purpose Usage as of 12/31/2004 Available Liquidity as of 12/31/2004 (Millions) PSEG: 4 year Credit Facility April 2008 $ 450 CP Support/ Funding/Letters of Credit $ &mdash; $ 450 5 year Credit Facility March 2005 $ 280 CP Support $ 280 $ &mdash; 3 year Credit Facility December 2005 $ 350 CP Support/ Funding/Letters of Credit $ 153 $ 197 Uncommitted Bilateral Agreement N/A N/A Funding $ &mdash; N/A Bilateral Term Loan April 2005 $ 75 Funding $ 75 $ &mdash; Bilateral Revolver April 2005 $ 25 Funding $ 25 $ &mdash; PSE&G: 5 year Credit Facility June 2009 $ 600 CP Support/ Funding/Letters of Credit $ 90 $ 510 Uncommitted Bilateral Agreement N/A N/A Funding $ 15 N/A PSEG and Power: 3 year Credit Facility(A) April 2007 $ 600 CP Support/ Funding/Letters of Credit $ 17 (B) $ 583 Power: 3 year Credit Facility August 2005 $ 25 Funding/Letters of Credit $ &mdash; $ 25 Bilateral Credit Facility March 2010 $ 100 Funding/Letters of Credit $ 90 (B) $ 10 Energy Holdings: 3 year Credit Facility(C) October 2006 $ 200 Funding/Letters of Credit $ 31 (B) $ 169 (A) PSEG/Power co borrower facility. (B) These amounts relate to letters of credit outstanding. (C) Energy Holdings/Global/Resources joint and several co borrowed facility. 66 PSEG As noted above, S&P downgraded PSEGs commercial paper rating on July 30, 2004. This has limited PSEGs ability to access the commercial paper market; however, PSEG believes it has sufficient liquidity to fund its short term cash needs. PSEG expects to renew its $280 million and $350 million credit facilities which expire in 2005. PSE&G In June 2004, PSE&G entered into a $600 million five year credit facility. This facility replaced the expiring $200 million 364 day credit facility and the $200 million three year credit facility that was to expire in June 2005. As noted above, S&P downgraded PSE&Gs commercial paper rating on July 30, 2004. This has limited PSE&Gs ability to access the commercial paper market; however, PSE&G believes it has sufficient liquidity to fund its short term cash needs. Power In October 2004, Power entered into a $100 million bilateral credit facility that expires in March 2010. This facility is available to Power for both letters of credit and funding. As of December 31, 2004, in addition to amounts outstanding under Powers credit facilities shown in the above table, Power had borrowed approximately $98 million from PSEG. Power expects to renew its $25 million credit facility which expires in August 2005. As noted above, S&P placed Power on negative outlook on July 30, 2004. Power believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet any required posting of collateral resulting from a downgrade. See Note 14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of the Notes for further information. Energy Holdings As of December 31, 2004, Energy Holdings had loaned $115 million of excess cash to PSEG. In addition, Energy Holdings and its subsidiaries had $199 million in cash, including $139 million invested offshore, as of December 31, 2004. External Financings PSEG In September 2004, PSEG issued and sold $200 million of its 4.66% Series A Senior Notes due 2009 in a private placement. The proceeds were used to reduce short term debt. In 2002, PSEG began issuing shares of its common stock under its Dividend Reinvestment Program and Employee Stock Purchase Plan, rather than purchasing shares on the open market. For the year ended December 31, 2004, PSEG issued approximately 1.9 million shares for approximately $83 million pursuant to these plans. PSE&G In August 2004, PSE&G issued $104 million of its First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds, Pollution Control Series AC due 2031, $88 million of its First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds, Pollution Control Series AD due 2030 and $93 million of its First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds, Pollution Control Series AE due 2029. The proceeds were used to refund $104 million of PSE&Gs First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds, Pollution Control Series Q due 2031 and $88 million of PSE&Gs First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds, Pollution Control Series R due 2030 in August 2004 as well as $93 million of PSE&Gs First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds, Pollution Control Series S due 2029 in October 2004. In August 2004, PSE&G issued $250 million of its Secured Medium Term Notes Series D due 2014. The proceeds were used to redeem the remaining outstanding $254 million of PSE&Gs First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds, 7% Series SS due 2024 in September 2004. 67 In June 2004, PSE&G issued $175 million two year floating rate First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds. The interest is set quarterly at LIBOR plus 0.125%. The proceeds were primarily used to redeem $159 million of 7.375% Series TT First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds due 2014 in June 2004. In May 2004, $286 million of PSE&Gs 6.50% Series PP First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds matured. In addition, PSE&G paid common stock dividends totaling approximately $100 million to PSEG in 2004. In December 2004, September 2004, June 2004 and March 2004, PSE&G Transition Funding LLC (Transition Funding) repaid approximately $39 million, $37 million, $30 million and $32 million, respectively, of its transition bonds. Power In October 2004, PSEG contributed approximately $300 million of equity to Power. In March 2004, Power issued $250 million of 3.75% Senior Notes due April 2009 and $250 million of 5.00% Senior Notes due April 2014. The net proceeds of $488 million, together with other available cash, were used to fund the repayment of $800 million of project finance debt to certain of Powers subsidiaries. Energy Holdings During 2004, Energy Holdings made cash distributions to PSEG totaling $491 million in the form of preference unit redemptions, preference unit distributions, ordinary unit distributions and return of capital contributed. In February 2005, Energy Holdings returned an additional $100 million of capital to PSEG in the form of an ordinary unit distribution. During the second quarter of 2004, Energy Holdings repurchased approximately $41 million of its 7.75% Senior Notes due April 2007 at a premium of $3 million, reducing the aggregate amount of that security outstanding to $309 million. In February 2004, Energy Holdings repaid $267 million of its 9.125% Senior Notes at maturity. During 2004, Skawina and SAESA issued a total of approximately $15 million of non recourse project debt. Debt Covenants PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings PSEGs, PSE&Gs, Powers and Energy Holdings respective credit agreements generally contain customary provisions under which the lenders could refuse to advance loans in the event of a material adverse change in the borrowers business or financial condition. As explained in detail below, some of these credit agreements also contain maximum debt to equity ratios, minimum cash flow tests and other restrictive covenants and conditions to borrowing. Compliance with applicable financial covenants will depend upon the respective future financial position, level of earnings and cash flows of PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings, as to which no assurances can be given. The ratios presented below are for the benefit of the investors of the related securities to which the covenants apply. They are not intended as a financial performance or liquidity measure. The debt underlying the preferred securities of PSEG, which is presented in Long Term Debt in accordance with FIN 46, is not included as debt when calculating these ratios, as provided for in the various credit agreements. PSEG Financial covenants contained in PSEGs credit facilities include a ratio of debt (excluding non recourse project financings, securitization debt and debt underlying preferred securities and including commercial paper and loans, certain letters of credit and similar instruments) to total capitalization (including preferred securities outstanding) covenant. This covenant requires that at the end of any quarterly financial period, such ratio not be more than 70.0%. As of December 31, 2004, PSEGs ratio of debt to capitalization (as defined above) was 57.5%. PSEG expects to continue to meet the financial covenants. 68 PSE&G Financial covenants contained in PSE&Gs credit facilities include a ratio of long term debt (excluding securitization debt and long term debt maturing within one year) to total capitalization covenant. This covenant requires that at the end of any quarterly financial period, such ratio will not be more than 65.0%. As of December 31, 2004, PSE&Gs ratio of long term debt to total capitalization (as defined above) was 51.4%. In addition, under its First and Refunding Mortgage (Mortgage), PSE&G may issue new First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds against previous additions and improvements, provided that its ratio of earnings to fixed charges calculated in accordance with its Mortgage is at least 2 to 1, and or against retired Mortgage Bonds. As of December 31, 2004, PSE&Gs Mortgage coverage ratio was 5.41 to 1 and the Mortgage would permit up to approximately $1.6 billion aggregate principal amount of new Mortgage Bonds to be issued against previous additions and improvements. PSEG and Power Financial covenants contained in the PSEG/Power joint and several credit facility include a ratio of debt to total capitalization for each specific borrower. Where PSEG is the borrower, the covenant described above in PSEG is applicable. Where Power is the borrower, a debt (excluding non recourse project financings and including loans, certain letters of credit and similar instruments) to total capitalization, adjusted for the $986 million Basis Adjustment (see Consolidated Balance Sheets), covenant applies. This covenant requires that at the end of any quarterly financial period, such ratio will not exceed 65.0%. As of December 31, 2004, Powers ratio of debt to capitalization (as defined above) was 46.8%. Energy Holdings In April 2003, Energy Holdings issued $350 million of Senior Notes which contain financial covenants that include debt incurrence tests consisting of a debt service coverage test and a ratio of consolidated recourse indebtedness to recourse capitalization test, which covenants require that Energy Holdings will not incur additional consolidated recourse indebtedness, other than certain permitted indebtedness, unless, on a pro forma basis, giving effect to the incurrence of the additional consolidated recourse indebtedness: (i) the debt service coverage ratio would be at least 2 to 1 and (ii) the ratio of consolidated recourse indebtedness to recourse capitalization would not exceed 0.60 to 1. Certain permitted indebtedness, such as permitted refinancings and borrowings, are excluded from the requirements under this test. The provisions of the Senior Notes also restrict Energy Holdings from selling assets with a net book value greater than 10% of its assets in any four consecutive quarters, unless the proceeds are used to reduce debt of Energy Holdings or its subsidiaries or are retained by Energy Holdings. Energy Holdings entered into a $200 million three year bank revolving credit agreement in October 2003 with a covenant requiring the ratio of Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) to fixed charges to be greater than 1.75. As of December 31, 2004, Energy Holdings coverage of this covenant was 2.51. Additionally, Energy Holdings must maintain a ratio of net debt to EBITDA of less than 5.25. As of December 31, 2004, Energy Holdings ratio under this covenant was 4.29. Energy Holdings is a co borrower under this facility with Global and Resources, which are joint and several obligors. The terms of the agreement include a pledge of Energy Holdings membership interest in Global, restrictions on the use of proceeds related to material sales of assets and the satisfaction of certain financial covenants. Cash proceeds from asset sales in excess of 5% of total assets of Energy Holdings during any 12 month period must be used to repay any outstanding amounts under the credit agreement. Cash proceeds during any 12 month period in excess of 10% must be retained by Energy Holdings or used to repay the debt of Energy Holdings, Global or Resources. Cross Default Provisions PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings The PSEG credit agreements contain default provisions under which a default by it, PSE&G or Power in an aggregate amount of $50 million or greater would result in the potential acceleration of payment under those agreements. 69 PSEGs bank credit agreements and note purchase agreements (collectively, Credit Agreements) related to its private placement of debt contain cross default provisions under which certain payment defaults by PSE&G or Power, certain bankruptcy events relating to PSE&G or Power, the failure by PSE&G or Power to satisfy certain final judgments or the occurrence of certain events of default under the financing agreements of PSE&G or Power, would each constitute an event of default under the PSEG Credit Agreements. It is also an event of default under the PSEG Credit Agreements if PSE&G or Power ceases to be wholly owned by PSEG. PSEG removed Energy Holdings from all cross default provisions effective with the cancellation of Energy Holdings $495 million revolving credit agreement in September 2003. In October 2003, Energy Holdings entered into a three year bank revolving credit agreement in the amount of approximately $200 million that does not include PSEG level covenants other than the maintenance of ownership of at least 80% of the capital stock of Energy Holdings by PSEG or its successor. PSE&G PSE&Gs Mortgage has no cross defaults. The PSE&G Medium Term Note Indenture has a cross default to the PSE&G Mortgage. The credit agreements have cross defaults under which a default by PSE&G in the aggregate of $50 million or greater would result in an event of default and the potential acceleration of payment under the credit agreements. Power The Power Senior Debt Indenture contains a default provision under which a default by it, Nuclear, Fossil or ER&T in an aggregate amount of $50 million or greater would result in an event of default and the potential acceleration of payment under the indenture. There are no cross defaults within Powers indenture from PSEG, Energy Holdings or PSE&G. Energy Holdings Energy Holdings Credit Agreement and Senior Note Indenture contain default provisions under which a default by it, Resources or Global in an aggregate amount of $25 million or greater would result in an event of default and the potential acceleration of payment under that agreement or the Indenture. Ratings Triggers PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings The debt indentures and credit agreements of PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings do not contain any material ratings triggers that would cause an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a ratings downgrade. However, in the event of a downgrade, any one or more of the affected companies may be subject to increased interest costs on certain bank debt and certain collateral requirements. PSE&G In accordance with the BPU approved requirements under the BGS contracts that PSE&G enters into with suppliers, PSE&G is required to maintain an investment grade credit rating. If PSE&G were to lose its investment grade rating, PSE&G would be required to file with the BPU a plan to assure continued payment for the BGS requirements of its customers. PSE&G is the servicer for the bonds issued by Transition Funding. If PSE&G were to lose its investment grade rating, PSE&G would be required to remit collected cash daily to the bond trustee. Currently, cash is remitted monthly. Power In connection with the management and optimization of Powers asset portfolio, ER&T maintains underlying agreements that require Power, as its guarantor under performance guarantees, to satisfy certain creditworthiness standards. In the event of a deterioration of Powers credit rating to below an investment grade rating, many of these agreements allow the counterparty to demand that ER&T provide performance 70 assurance, generally in the form of a letter of credit or cash. As of December 31, 2004, if Power were to lose its investment grade rating and assuming all counterparties to agreements in which ER&T is out of the money were contractually entitled to demand, and demanded, performance assurance, ER&T could be required to post collateral in an amount equal to approximately $701 million. Providing this credit support would increase Powers costs of doing business and could restrict the ability of ER&T to manage and optimize Powers asset portfolio. See Note 14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of the Notes. Energy Holdings In 2003, Energy Holdings and Global posted $44 million of letters of credit for certain of their equity commitments as a result of Energy Holdings ratings falling below investment grade. Under existing agreements, no further letters of credit will need to be posted should there be a future downgrade. Credit Ratings PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings The current ratings of securities of PSEG and its subsidiaries are shown below and reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. Any downward revision or withdrawal may adversely affect the market price of PSEGs, PSE&Gs, Powers and Energy Holdings securities and serve to increase those companies cost of capital and limit their access to capital. All ratings have a stable outlook unless otherwise noted. (N) denotes a negative outlook, (P) denotes a positive outlook and (WD) denotes a credit watch developing indicating that ratings could be raised or lowered. There is no assurance that the ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be revised by the rating agencies, if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant. Each rating given by an agency should be evaluated independently of the other agencies ratings. The ratings should not be construed as an indication to buy, hold or sell any security.

On April 12, 2004, Fitch downgraded Energy Holdings Senior Notes rating to BB from BBB&ndash;, with a negative outlook. On July 30, 2004, S&P placed the Corporate Credit Ratings of PSEG, PSE&G and Power on negative outlook. S&P also downgraded PSEGs and PSE&Gs respective commercial paper ratings from A2 to A3. On August 6, 2004, Moodys placed Power on a negative outlook. On September 10, 2004, Fitch downgraded PSEGs Preferred Securities to BBB&ndash; from BBB with a stable outlook and placed an F2 rating on PSEGs commercial paper program. Fitch also downgraded Powers 71 Senior Notes to BBB from BBB+. In addition, Fitch reaffirmed its A rating on PSE&Gs Mortgage Bonds. However, Fitch downgraded PSE&Gs commercial paper program to F2 from F1. On December 20, 2004, in conjunction with the announcement of the Merger Agreement between PSEG and Exelon, all of the rating agencies reviewed their ratings and took the following actions: &bull; Moodys affirmed the ratings for PSEG, Power and Energy Holdings. Moodys revised its outlook to stable from negative for PSEG and Power. The outlook for PSE&G remained stable and the outlook for Energy Holdings remained negative. &bull; S&P placed its BBB Corporate Credit Rating for PSEG, Power and PSE&G on Credit Watch with developing implications. S&P indicated that, if not for the Merger, the corporate credit ratings assigned to PSEG and its subsidiaries, other than Energy Holdings, would have been lowered to BBB&ndash; with a negative outlook. S&P lowered its outlook for Energy Holdings to negative. &bull; Fitch affirmed its ratings for PSEG, Power, PSE&G and Energy Holdings. Fitch revised the outlook for PSEG and Power to positive from stable. The outlook for PSE&G remained stable and Energy Holdings remained negative. Other Comprehensive Loss (Income) PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings For the year ended December 31, 2004, PSEG, Power and Energy Holdings had Other Comprehensive Loss (Income) of $76 million, $135 million and $(62) million, respectively, due primarily to net unrealized losses on derivatives accounted for as hedges in accordance with SFAS 133, unrealized gains and losses in the NDT Funds at Power and foreign currency translation adjustments at Energy Holdings. 72 CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS Forecasted Expenditures PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings It is expected that the majority of each subsidiarys capital requirements over the next five years will come from internally generated funds. Projected construction and investment expenditures, excluding nuclear fuel purchases, for PSEGs subsidiaries for the next five years are presented in the table below. These amounts are subject to change, based on various factors, including the possible change in strategy of the combined company following the Merger. 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 (Millions) PSE&G: Facility Support $ 44 $ 36 $ 36 $ 44 $ 40 Environmental/Regulatory 32 51 22 21 20 Facility Replacement 183 187 184 189 198 System Reinforcement 125 122 100 92 101 New Business 147 151 156 158 162 Total PSE&G 531 547 498 504 521 Power: Non Recurring (new MW and Environmental) 315 178 145 109 30 Maintenance 134 146 114 84 99 Total Power 449 324 259 193 129 Energy Holdings 120 60 40 20 30 Other 15 20 15 15 14 Total PSEG $ 1,115 $ 951 $ 812 $ 732 $ 694 PSE&G In 2004, PSE&G made approximately $428 million of capital expenditures, primarily for reliability of transmission and distribution systems. The $428 million does not include approximately $32 million spent on cost of removal. PSE&G projections for future capital expenditures include additions to its transmission and distribution systems to meet expected growth and to manage reliability and cost of removal expenditures. The current projections do not include investments required as a result of PJMs approval of the Regional Transmission Expansion Plan (RTEP) in December 2004. As project scope and cost estimates develop, PSE&G will modify its current projections to include these required investments. Power In 2004, Power made approximately $618 million of capital expenditures (excluding $107 million for nuclear fuel), primarily related to the Bethlehem, New York (Albany) site, the Linden station in New Jersey and various other projects at Nuclear and Fossil. In 2004, Power increased the scope of outages at the Salem and Hope Creek nuclear generating facilities to make equipment modifications. Powers ongoing capital expenditure program for its share of the Salem, Hope Creek and Peach Bottom facilities includes approximately $669 million (including interest capitalized during construction) for 2005 through 2009 to improve operations and complete power uprates. The forecasted capital expenditures do not include potential expenditures for environmental control equipment at Powers Keystone, Conemaugh and Hudson Stations. Energy Holdings Energy Holdings capital needs in 2005 will be limited to fulfilling existing contractual and potential contingent commitments. The balance of the forecasted expenditures relates to capital requirements of consolidated subsidiaries, which will primarily be financed from internally generated cash flow within the projects and from local sources on a non recourse basis or limited discretionary investments by Energy 73 Holdings. Such capital requirements include organic growth in SAESAs service territory, the Electroandes expansion project, the majority of which is expected to be completed in 2005, and other capital improvements at Globals consolidated subsidiaries. In 2004, Energy Holdings incurred approximately $86 million of capital expenditures, primarily related to capital projects at SAESA, Dhofar Power and Skawina. Disclosures about Long Term Maturities, Contractual and Commercial Obligations and Certain Investments The following table reflects PSEGs and its subsidiaries contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments in the respective periods in which they are due. In addition, the table summarizes anticipated recourse and non recourse debt maturities for the years shown. The table below does not reflect debt maturities of Energy Holdings non consolidated investments. If those obligations were not able to be refinanced by the project, Energy Holdings may elect to make additional contributions in these investments. For additional information, see Note 12.

OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Power Power issues guarantees in conjunction with certain of its energy trading activities. See Note 14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of the Notes for further discussion. PSEG and Energy Holdings Global has certain investments that are accounted for under the equity method in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, amounts recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for such investments represent Globals equity investment, which is increased for Globals pro rata share of earnings less any dividend distribution from such investments. The companies in which Global invests, that are accounted for under the equity method have an aggregate $1.3 billion of debt on their combined, consolidated financial statements. PSEGs pro rata share of such debt is $563 million. This debt is non recourse to PSEG, Energy Holdings and Global. PSEG is generally not required to support the debt service obligations of these companies. However, default with respect to this non recourse debt could result in a loss of invested equity. Resources has investments in leveraged leases that are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases. Leveraged lease investments generally involve three parties: an owner/lessor, a creditor and a lessee. In a typical leveraged lease financing, the lessor purchases an asset to be leased. The purchase price is typically financed 80% with debt provided by the creditor and the balance comes from equity funds provided by the lessor. The creditor provides long term financing to the transaction, and is secured by the property subject to the lease. Such long term financing is non recourse to the lessor. As such, in the event of default, the leased asset, and in some cases the lessee, secure the loan. As a lessor, Resources has ownership rights to the property and rents the property to the lessees for use in their business operation. As of December 31, 2004, Resources equity investment in leased assets was approximately $1.3 billion, net of deferred taxes of approximately $1.6 billion. For additional information, see Note 10. Long Term Investments of the Notes. In the event that collectibility of the minimum lease payments to be received by the lessor is no longer reasonably assured, the accounting treatment for some of the leases may change. In such cases, Resources may deem that a lessee has a high probability of defaulting on the lease obligation. Should Resources ever directly assume a debt obligation, the fair value of the underlying asset and the associated debt would be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets instead of the net equity investment in the lease. Energy Holdings has guaranteed certain obligations of its subsidiaries or affiliates related to certain projects. See Note 14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of the Notes for additional information. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings Under GAAP, many accounting standards require the use of estimates, variable inputs and assumptions (collectively referred to as estimates) that are subjective in nature. Because of this, differences between the actual measure realized versus the estimate can have a material impact on results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The managements of PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings have each determined that the following estimates are considered critical to the application of rules that relate to their respective businesses. 75 Accounting for Pensions PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings account for pensions under SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS 87). Pension costs under SFAS 87 are calculated using various economic and demographic assumptions. Economic assumptions include the discount rate and the long term rate of return on trust assets. Demographic assumptions include projections of future mortality rates, pay increases and retirement patterns. In 2004, PSEG and its subsidiaries recorded pension expense of $102 million, compared to $147 million in 2003 and $89 million in 2002. Additionally, in 2004, PSEG and its respective subsidiaries contributed cash of approximately $96 million, compared to cash contributions of $211 million in 2003 and $240 million in 2002. PSEGs discount rate assumption, which is determined annually, is based on the rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits. The discount rate used to calculate pension obligations is determined as of December 31 each year, PSEGs SFAS 87 measurement date. The discount rate used to determine year end obligations is also used to develop the following years net periodic pension cost. The discount rates used in PSEGs 2003 and 2004 net periodic pension costs were 6.75% and 6.25%, respectively. PSEGs 2005 net periodic pension cost was developed using a discount rate of 6.00%. PSEGs expected rate of return on plan assets reflects current asset allocations, historical long term investment performance and an estimate of future long term returns by asset class using input from PSEGs actuary and investment advisors, as well as long term inflation assumptions. For 2003 and 2004, PSEG assumed a rate of return of 9.0% and 8.75%, respectively, on PSEGs pension plan assets. For 2005, PSEG will continue the rate of return assumption of 8.75%. Based on the above assumptions, PSEG has estimated net period pension costs of approximately $110 million and contributions of up to $100 million in 2005. As part of the business planning process, PSEG has modeled its future costs assuming an 8.75% rate of return and the return to a 6.25% discount rate for 2006 and beyond. Based on these assumptions, PSEG has estimated net period pension costs of approximately $80 million in 2006 and $70 million in 2007. Actual future pension expense and funding levels will depend on future investment performance, changes in discount rates, market conditions, funding levels relative to PSEGs pension benefit obligation (PBO) and accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) and various other factors related to the populations participating in PSEGs pension plans. The following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in certain actuarial assumptions. The effects of the assumption changes shown below solely reflect the impact of that specific assumption. Actuarial Assumption Current Change/ (Decrease) As of December 31, 2004 Impact on Pension Benefit Obligation Increase to Pension Expense in 2005 (Millions) Discount Rate 6.00% (1% ) $ 526 $ 54 Rate of Return on Plan Assets 8.75% (1% ) $ &mdash; $ 29 Accounting for Deferred Taxes PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings provide for income taxes based on the liability method required by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, as well as net operating loss and credit carryforwards. PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings evaluate the need for a valuation allowance against their respective deferred tax assets based on the likelihood of expected future taxable income. PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings do not believe a valuation allowance is necessary; however, if the expected level of future taxable income changes or certain tax planning strategies become unavailable, PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings would record a valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period the valuation allowance is deemed necessary. Resources and Globals ability to realize their deferred tax assets are dependent on PSEGs subsidiaries ability to generate ordinary income and capital gains. 76 Accounting for Long Lived Assets SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144), a standard related to testing long lived assets for impairment, was adopted on January 1, 2002. Testing under SFAS 144 consists of an undiscounted cash flow analysis to determine if an impairment existed, and, if an impairment existed, a discounted cash flow test would be performed to quantify it. This new standard is broader in that it includes discontinued operations as part of its scope. This test requires the same judgment to be employed by management in building assumptions related to future earnings of individual assets or an investment as is required in determining potential impairments of goodwill as discussed below. These tests are required whenever events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Examples of potential events which could require an impairment test are when power prices become depressed for a prolonged period in a market, when a foreign currency significantly devalues or when an investment generates negative operating cash flows. Any potential impairment of investments under these circumstances is recorded as a component of operating expenses. PSE&G Unbilled Revenues Electric and gas revenues are recorded based on services rendered to customers during each accounting period. PSE&G records unbilled revenues for the estimated amount customers will be billed for services rendered from the time meters were last read to the end of the respective accounting period. Unbilled usage is calculated in two steps. The initial step is to apply a base usage per day to the number of unbilled days in the period. The second step estimates seasonal loads based upon the time of year and the variance of actual degree days and temperature humidity index hours of the unbilled period from expected norms. The resulting usage is priced at current rate levels and recorded as revenue. A calculation of the associated energy cost for the unbilled usage is recorded as well. Each month the prior months unbilled amounts are reversed and the current months amounts are accrued. Using benchmarks other than those used in this calculation could have a material effect on the amounts accrued in a reporting period. The resulting revenue and expense reflect the service rendered in the calendar month. PSE&G and Energy Holdings SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (SFAS 71) PSE&G and certain of Globals investments prepare their respective Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 71, which differs in certain respects from the application of GAAP by non regulated businesses. In general, SFAS 71 recognizes that accounting for rate regulated enterprises should reflect the economic effects of regulation. As a result, a regulated utility is required to defer the recognition of costs (a regulatory asset) or recognize obligations (a regulatory liability) if it is probable that, through the rate making process, there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in future rates. Accordingly, PSE&G and Global have deferred certain costs, which will be amortized over various future periods. To the extent that collection of such costs or payment of liabilities is no longer probable as a result of changes in regulation and or PSE&Gs and Globals competitive position, the associated regulatory asset or liability is charged or credited to income. See Note 7. Regulatory Matters of the Notes for additional information related to these and other regulatory issues. Power NDT Funds Power accounts for the assets in the NDT Fund under SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities (SFAS 115). The assets in the NDT Fund are classified as available for sale securities and are marked to market with unrealized gains and losses recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). Realized gains, losses and dividend and interest income are recorded on Powers and PSEGs Statements of Operations under Other Income and Other Deductions. Unrealized losses that are deemed to be Other Than Temporarily Impaired, as defined under SFAS 115, and related interpretive guidance, are charged against earnings rather than OCI. Factors, such as the length of time and extent to which the fair value is below carrying value, the potential for impairments of securities 77 when the issuer or industry is experiencing significant financial difficulties and Powers intent and ability to continue to hold securities, are used as indicators of the prospects of the securities to recover their value. Power and Energy Holdings Accounting for Goodwill SFAS 142 requires an entity to evaluate its goodwill for impairment at least annually or when indications of impairment exist. An impairment may exist when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Accounting estimates related to goodwill fair value are highly susceptible to change from period to period because they require management to make cash flow assumptions about future sales, operating costs, economic conditions and discount rates over an indefinite life. The impact of recognizing an impairment could have a material impact on financial position and results of operations. Power and Energy Holdings perform annual goodwill impairment tests and continuously monitor the business environment in which they operate for any impairment issues that may arise. As indicated above, certain assumptions are used to arrive at a fair value for goodwill testing. Such assumptions are consistently employed and include, but are not limited to, free cash flow projections, interest rates, tariff adjustments, economic conditions prevalent in the geographic regions in which Power and Energy Holdings do business, local spot market prices for energy, foreign exchange rates and the credit worthiness of customers. If an adverse event were to occur, such an event could materially change the assumptions used to value goodwill and could result in impairments of goodwill. PSEG and Energy Holdings Permanent Reinvestment Strategy As allowed under APB No. 23, Accounting for Income Taxes&mdash;Special Areas and SFAS 109, management has maintained a permanent reinvestment strategy as it relates to Globals international investments. If management were to change that strategy, a deferred tax expense and deferred tax liability would be recorded to reflect the expected taxes that would need to be paid on Globals offshore earnings. As of December 31, 2004, the undistributed foreign earnings were approximately $256 million. The determination of the amount of unrecognized U.S. Federal deferred tax liability for unrealized earnings is not practicable. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Jobs Act), as discussed further in Note 2. Recent Accounting Standards of the Notes, provides a one year window to repatriate earnings from foreign investments and claim a special 85% dividends received tax deduction on such distributions. The range of undistributed earnings that PSEG could consider for possible repatriation under the Jobs Act is between $0 and $256 million, which would result in additional income tax expense between $0 and $15 million. On January 13, 2005, the IRS published Notice 2005 10, which discusses some of the rules that pertain to this deduction. Whether PSEG will ultimately take advantage of this provision, all or in part, depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to evaluating the impact of Notice 2005 10 and any future authoritative guidance. Management has made no change in its current intention to indefinitely reinvest accumulated earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. PSEG and Energy Holdings are currently evaluating the impacts of the entire Jobs Act, which could have a material impact on their financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Foreign Currency Translation Energy Holdings financial statements are prepared using the U.S. Dollar as the reporting currency. In accordance with SFAS No. 52 Foreign Currency Translation, for foreign operations whose functional currency is deemed to be the local (foreign) currency, asset and liability accounts are translated into U.S. Dollars at current exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Translation gains and losses (net of applicable deferred taxes) are not included in determining Net Income but are reported in OCI. Gains and losses on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the results of operations as incurred. The determination of an entitys functional currency requires managements judgment. It is based on an assessment of the primary currency in which transactions in the local environment are conducted, and whether the local currency can be relied upon as a stable currency in which to conduct business. As economic 78 and business conditions change, Energy Holdings is required to reassess the economic environment and determine the appropriate functional currency. The impact of foreign currency accounting could have a material adverse impact on Energy Holdings financial condition, results of operation and net cash flows. ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings The market risk inherent in PSEGs, PSE&Gs, Powers and Energy Holdings market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity security prices and interest rates as discussed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Notes). It is the policy of each entity to use derivatives to manage risk consistent with its respective business plans and prudent practices. PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings have a Risk Management Committee (RMC) comprised of executive officers who utilize an independent risk oversight function to ensure compliance with corporate policies and prudent risk management practices. Additionally, PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings are exposed to counterparty credit losses in the event of non performance or non payment. PSEG has a credit management process, which is used to assess, monitor and mitigate counterparty exposure for PSEG and its subsidiaries. In the event of non performance or non payment by a major counterparty, there may be a material adverse impact on PSEG and its subsidiaries financial condition, results of operations or net cash flows. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk Energy Holdings Global is exposed to foreign currency risk and other foreign operations risk that arise from investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. A key component of this risk is that some of its foreign subsidiaries and affiliates utilize currencies other than the consolidated reporting currency, the U.S. Dollar. Additionally, certain of Globals foreign subsidiaries and affiliates have entered into monetary obligations and maintain receipts/receivables in U.S. Dollars or currencies other than their own functional currencies. Primarily, Global is exposed to changes in the U.S. Dollar to Brazilian Real, Euro, Polish Zloty, Peruvian Nuevo Sol and the Chilean Peso exchange rates. With respect to the foreign currency risk associated with the Brazilian Real, there has been significant devaluation since the initial acquisition of Globals investment in Rio Grande Energia S.A. (RGE), which has resulted in reduced U.S. Dollar earnings and cash flows relative to initial projections. However, there have been material improvements in a number of currencies during 2003 and 2004 due to the weakness of the U.S. Dollar, that have offset some of the loss incurred because of the devaluation of the Brazilian Real. Whenever possible, these subsidiaries and affiliates have attempted to limit potential foreign exchange exposure by entering into revenue contracts that adjust to changes in foreign exchange rates. Global also uses foreign currency forward, swap and option agreements, wherever possible, to manage risk related to certain foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2004, the devaluing Brazilian Real has resulted in a cumulative $240 million loss of value which is recorded as a $215 million after tax charge to Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) related to Globals equity method investments in RGE. An additional devaluation in the December 31, 2004 Brazilian Real to U.S. Dollar exchange rate of 10% would result in a $16 million change in the value of the investment in RGE and corresponding impact to OCI. If the December 31, 2004 Brazilian Real to U.S. Dollar exchange rate were to appreciate by 10%, it would result in a $20 million after tax increase in the value of the investment in RGE. Additionally, Global has approximately $65 million of Euro denominated receivables related to Globals equity method investments in Prisma which is subject to fluctuations in the U.S. Dollar to Euro exchange rate. If the December 31, 2004 Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate were to increase by 10%, Global would record approximately $7 million of foreign currency transaction losses. If the December 31, 2004 Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate were to decrease by 10%, Global would record approximately $6 million of foreign currency transaction gains. In January 2005, Energy Holdings entered into an option to sell U.S. Dollars and buy Polish Zlotys with a notional amount equivalent to the amount of its Polish Zloty bank debt at ELCHO, a U.S. Dollar 79 functional currency entity. As a result, if the U.S. Dollar weakens relative to the Polish Zloty, the accounting losses generated by the mark to market on the Polish Zloty debt would be significantly reduced by the options increases in value. To the extent the U.S. Dollar strengthens relative to the Polish Zloty, gains would be recorded on the Polish Zloty debt (and other monetary liabilities), and the option would expire with no value. Global has various other foreign currency exposures related to translation adjustments. A devaluation of 10% in such foreign currencies would result in an aggregate after tax charge to OCI of $76 million. Commodity Contracts PSEG and Power The availability and price of energy commodities are subject to fluctuations from factors such as weather, environmental policies, changes in supply and demand, state and federal regulatory policies, market rules and other events. To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, Power enters into supply contracts and derivative contracts, including forwards, futures, swaps and options with approved counterparties, to hedge its anticipated supply and demand differential. These contracts, in conjunction with demand obligations help optimize the value of owned electric generation capacity. Normal Operations and Hedging Activities Power enters into physical contracts, as well as financial contracts, including forwards, futures, swaps and options designed to reduce risk associated with volatile commodity prices. Commodity price risk is associated with market price movements resulting from market generation demand, changes in fuel costs and various other factors. Powers derivative contracts are accounted for under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133), its amendments and related guidance. Changes in the fair value of qualifying cash flow hedge transactions are recorded in OCI, and gains and losses are recognized in earnings when the underlying transaction occurs. Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that do not meet hedge criteria under SFAS 133 and the ineffective portion of hedge contracts are recognized in earnings currently. Additionally, changes in the fair value attributable to fair value hedges are similarly recognized in earnings. Most non trading contracts qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exemption under SFAS 133 and or SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 149) for contracts entered into or modified and hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. Trading Power maintains a strategy of entering into trading positions to optimize the value of its portfolio of generation assets, gas supply contracts and its electric and gas supply obligations. Power engages in physical and financial transactions in the electricity wholesale markets and executes an overall risk management strategy to mitigate the effects of adverse movements in the fuel and electricity markets. In addition, Power has non asset based trading activities. These contracts also involve financial transactions including swaps, options and futures. These activities are marked to market in accordance with SFAS 133, its amendments and related guidance, with gains and losses recognized in earnings. Value at Risk (VaR) Models Power Power uses VaR models to assess the market risk of its commodity businesses. The portfolio VaR model for Power includes its owned generation and physical contracts, as well as fixed price sales requirements, load requirements and financial derivative instruments. VaR represents the potential gains or losses, under normal market conditions, for instruments or portfolios due to changes in market factors, for a specified time period and confidence level. Power estimates VaR across its commodity businesses. 80 Power manages its exposure at the portfolio level. Its portfolio consists of owned generation, load serving contracts (both gas and electric), fuel supply contracts and energy derivatives designed to manage the risk around the differential between generation and load. While Power manages its risk at the portfolio level, it also monitors separately the risk of its trading activities and other non trading activities that receive mark to market accounting treatment. Non trading VAR includes derivatives that are economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting. The VaR models used by Power are variance/covariance models adjusted for the delta of positions with a 95% one tailed confidence level and a one day holding period for the mark to market trading and non trading activities and a 95% one tailed confidence level with a one week holding period for the portfolio VaR. The models assume no new positions throughout the holding periods, whereas Power actively manages its portfolio. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, trading VaR was approximately $2 million. For the Year Ended December 31, 2004 Trading VaR Non Trading MTM VaR (Millions) 95% Confidence Level, One Day Holding Period, One Tailed: Period End $ 2 $ 18 Average for the Period $ 2 $ 13 High $ 6 $ 31 Low $ 1 $ 1 99% Confidence Level, One Day Holding Period, Two Tailed: Period End $ 4 $ 28 Average for the Period $ 4 $ 20 High $ 9 $ 49 Low $ 1 $ 2 Interest Rates PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings are subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. It is the policy of PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings to manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floating rate debt, interest rate swaps and interest rate lock agreements. PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings manage their respective interest rate exposures by maintaining a targeted ratio of fixed and floating rate debt. As of December 31, 2004, a hypothetical 10% change in market interest rates would result in a $1 million, $3 million and $1 million change in annual interest costs related to debt at PSEG, PSE&G and Energy Holdings, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2004, a hypothetical 10% change in market interest rates would result in a $9 million, $153 million, $122 million and $38 million change in the fair value of the debt of PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings, respectively. Debt and Equity Securities PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings PSEG has approximately $2.9 billion invested in its pension plans. Although fluctuations in market prices of securities within this portfolio do not directly affect PSEGs earnings in the current period, changes in the value of these investments could affect PSEGs future contributions to these plans, its financial position if its accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) under its pension plans exceeds the fair value of its pension funds and future earnings as PSEG could be required to adjust pension expense and its assumed rate of return. Power Powers NDT Funds are comprised of both fixed income and equity securities totaling $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2004. The fair value of equity securities is determined independently each month by the Trustee. As of December 31, 2004, the portfolio was comprised of approximately $678 million of equity securities and approximately $408 million in fixed income securities. The fair market value of the NDT assets will fluctuate primarily depending upon the performance of equity markets. As of December 31, 2004, a 81 hypothetical 10% change in the equity market would impact the value of the equity securities in the NDT Funds by approximately $68 million. Power uses duration to measure the interest rate sensitivity of the fixed income portfolio. Duration is a summary statistic of the effective average maturity of the fixed income portfolio. The benchmark for the fixed income component of the NDT Funds is the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which currently has a duration of 4.34 years and a yield of 4.38%. The portfolios value will appreciate or depreciate by the duration with a 1% change in interest rates. As of December 31, 2004, a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates would result in a decline in the market value for the fixed income portfolio of approximately $16 million. Energy Holdings Resources has investments in equity securities and limited partnerships. Resources carries its investments in equity securities at their fair value as of the reporting date. Consequently, the carrying value of these investments is affected by changes in the fair value of the underlying securities. Fair value is determined by adjusting the market value of the securities for liquidity and market volatility factors, where appropriate. As of December 31, 2004, Resources had investments in leveraged buyout funds of approximately $27 million, all of which are public securities with available market prices. The potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% change in quoted market prices of the publicly traded investments would amount to $3 million as of December 31, 2004. Credit Risk PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings Credit risk relates to the risk of loss that PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings would incur as a result of non performance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings have established credit policies that they believe significantly minimize credit risk. These policies include an evaluation of potential counterparties financial condition (including credit rating), collateral requirements under certain circumstances and the use of standardized agreements, which may allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty. PSE&G Basic Generation Service (BGS) suppliers expose PSE&G to credit losses in the event of non performance or non payment upon a default of the BGS supplier. Credit requirements are governed under the Board of Public Utilities (BPU) approved BGS contracts. Power Counterparties expose Powers trading operation to credit losses in the event of non performance or non payment. Power has a credit management process, which is used to assess, monitor and mitigate counterparty exposure for Power and its subsidiaries. Powers counterparty credit limits are based on a scoring model that considers a variety of factors, including leverage, liquidity, profitability, credit ratings and risk management capabilities. Powers trading operations have entered into payment netting agreements or enabling agreements that allow for payment netting with the majority of its large counterparties, which reduce Powers exposure to counterparty risk by providing the offset of amounts payable to the counterparty against amounts receivable from the counterparty. In the event of non performance or non payment by a major counterparty, there may be a material adverse impact on Powers and its subsidiaries financial condition, results of operations or net cash flows. As of December 31, 2004, over 88% of the credit exposure (mark to market plus net receivables and payables, less cash collateral) for Powers trading operations was with investment grade counterparties. The majority of the credit exposure with non investment grade counterparties was with certain companies that supply fuel (primarily coal) to Power. Therefore, this exposure relates to the risk of a counterparty performing under its obligations rather than payment risk. As of December 31, 2004, Powers trading operations had over 184 active counterparties. As a result of the 2003 New Jersey BGS auction, Powers trading operation contracted to provide energy to the direct suppliers of New Jersey electric utilities, including PSE&G, commencing August 1, 2003. In 82 February 2004, the BPU approved the results of the 2004 BGS auction for New Jersey customers. Power is a direct supplier of New Jersey Electric Distribution Companies (EDCs) entering into seasonally adjusted fixed price contracts for 12 month and 36 month periods that began on June 1, 2004. The revenue from the majority of the suppliers is paid directly to Power from the utilities that those suppliers serve. These bilateral contracts are subject to credit risk. A material portion of credit risk relates to the ability of suppliers to meet their payment obligations for the power delivered under each contract. Any failure to collect these payments under the contracts could have a material impact on Powers results of operations, cash flows and financial position. The payment risk that is associated with potential nonpayment by any New Jersey EDC making direct payment under the BGS contracts is lower than the risk under standard bilateral contracts, since the EDCs are rate regulated entities. Energy Holdings Global Global has credit risk with respect to its counterparties to power purchase agreements (PPAs) and other parties. For further discussion, see MD&A&mdash;Future Outlook&mdash;Energy Holdings. Resources Resources has credit risk related to its investments in leveraged leases, totaling $1.2 billion, which is net of deferred taxes of $1.6 billion, as of December 31, 2004. These investments are largely concentrated in the energy industry and have some exposure to the airline industry. As of December 31, 2004, 69% of counterparties in the lease portfolio were rated investment grade by both S&P and Moodys. Resources is the lessor of various aircraft to several domestic airlines including United Airlines (UAL), Delta Airlines (Delta) and Northwest Airlines (Northwest). Resources leases a Boeing B767 aircraft to UAL. In December 2002, UAL filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. UAL has stated that it intends to retain and use its B767 aircraft. UAL has an additional debt obligation of $48 million associated with this aircraft which is non recourse to Resources. Resources will work constructively with UAL to keep the leveraged lease in place. The gross invested balance of this investment as of December 31, 2004 was $21 million. In the fourth quarter of 2004, Resources entered into agreements with Delta and Northwest to extend the term of both of these leases. As part of Deltas financial restructuring, Delta entered into a broad settlement with certain lessors and other financial stakeholders. Through this settlement, Resources agreed to extend Deltas lease on the airplane for three years with a 25% reduction in rental payments. Resources also received shares of Delta stock through the transaction and retained its rights in the event Delta declares bankruptcy. Separately, Resources extended the lease on one of the airplanes to Northwest for two years. Each of these lessees are current on its required rental payments. The gross investment balances in Delta and Northwest as of December 31, 2004 was $5 million and $32 million, respectively. Delta is rated CC by S&P and Caa3 by Moodys. Northwest is rated B by S&P and Caa2 by Moodys. Resources is the lessor of domestic generating facilities in several U.S. energy markets. As a result of rating agency actions due to concerns over forward energy prices, the credit of some of the lessees was downgraded. Specifically, the lessees in the following transactions were downgraded below investment grade during 2002 by these rating agencies. Resources investment in such transactions was approximately $301 million, net of deferred taxes of $398 million as of December 31, 2004. Resources leases a generation facility to Reliant Energy Mid Atlantic Power Holdings LLC (REMA), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Reliant Resources Incorporated (RRI). The leased assets are the Keystone, Conemaugh and Shawville generating facilities located in the PJM West market in Pennsylvania. REMA is capitalized with over $1 billion of equity from RRI and has no debt obligations senior to the lease obligations. REMA was upgraded to ratings of B+ by S&P and B1 by Moodys during 2004. As the lessor/equity participant in the lease, Resources is protected with significant lease covenants that restrict the flow of dividends from REMA to its parent, and by over collateralization of REMA with non leased assets, transfer of which is restricted by the financing documents. Restrictive covenants include historical and forward cash flow coverage tests that prohibit discretionary capital expenditures and dividend payments to the parent/lessee if stated minimum coverages are not met, and similar cash flow restrictions if ratings are not maintained at stated levels. The covenants are designed to maintain cash reserves in the transaction entity for the benefit of the non recourse lenders and the lessor/equity participants in the event of a market downturn 83 or degradation in operating performance of the leased assets. Resources investment in the REMA transaction was $107 million, net of deferred taxes of $149 million as of December 31, 2004. Resources is the lessor/equity participant to the lease of the Powerton and Joliet power generating facilities operated by the lessee, Midwest Generation LLC (Midwest), an indirect subsidiary of Edison Mission Energy (EME). EME is the guarantor for the lease obligations. As of December 31, 2004, Resources lease investment in the Powerton and Joliet facilities was $57 million, net of taxes of $134 million. With ongoing credit problems and maturing debt during 2003, EMEs corporate credit rating was lowered to B by S&P on credit watch with negative implications in October 2003. EME successfully refinanced its debt in December 2003 through a complex plan which included new debt and bridge financing to be followed by significant offshore asset sales in 2004. In August 2004, EMEs credit rating outlook improved to B with positive implications. Resources is the lessor of the Danskammer generation facility in New York to Dynegy Danskammer LLC (Danskammer) and the Roseton generation facility to Dynegy Roseton LLC (Roseton). Both Danskammer and Roseton are indirect subsidiaries of Dynegy Holdings Inc. (DHI). The lease obligations are guaranteed by DHI which is currently rated B by S&P and Caa2 by Moodys. Resources investment in Danskammer and Roseton was $116 million, net of deferred taxes of $91 million as of December 31, 2004. Resources is a lessor/equity participant in a lease to the Midland Cogeneration Venture, LP (MCV) of a 1,500 MW natural gas fired cogeneration facility located in Midland, Michigan. The principal partners in the limited partnership, which leases the asset, are indirect subsidiaries of CMS Energy Corporation (CMS Energy) and El Paso Energy Corporation (El Paso). S&Ps rating of the stand alone credit quality of the facility is BB reflecting both CMS Energys and El Pasos credit deterioration, high fuel gas prices and a mismatch between coal based energy rates and the price of natural gas fuel supply. To meet these challenges, MCV actively manages and hedges its fuel purchases and has accumulated substantial cash reserves for bondholder protection. Additionally, the partnership has negotiated and received the Michigan Public Service Commissions approval for an operating agreement with Consumers Power to allow the facility to dispatch in a more economic manner, mitigating the fuel risk. Resources closely monitors this credit situation. The facility has been in commercial operation since 1990, successfully paying down a significant portion of its debt to date. Resources net investment in MCV was $21 million, net of deferred taxes of $24 million as of December 31, 2004. In the event of a default, Energy Holdings would exercise its rights and attempt to seek recovery of its investment. The results of such efforts may not be known for a period of time. A bankruptcy of a lessor and failure to recover adequate value could lead to a foreclosure of the lease. Under a worst case scenario, if a foreclosure were to occur, Resources would record a pre tax write off up to its gross investment, including deferred taxes, in these facilities. The investment balance increases as earnings are recognized and decreases as rental payments are received by the lessor. Also, in the event of a potential foreclosure, the net tax benefits generated by Resources portfolio of investments could be materially reduced in the period in which gains associated with the potential forgiveness of debt at these projects occurs. The amount and timing of any potential reduction in net tax benefits is dependent upon a number of factors including, but not limited to, the time of a potential foreclosure, the amount of lease debt outstanding, any cash trapped at the projects and negotiations during such potential foreclosure process. The potential loss of earnings, impairment and or tax payments could have a material impact to PSEGs and Energy Holdings financial position, results of operations and net cash flows. As of December 31, 2004, lease payments on these facilities were current and Resources determined that the collectibility of the minimum lease payments under its leveraged lease investments is still reasonably probable and therefore continues to account for these investments as leveraged leases. Other Supplemental Information Regarding Market Risk Power The following presentation of the activities of Power is included to address the recommended disclosures by the energy industrys Committee of Chief Risk Officers. For additional information, see Note 13. Risk Management of the Notes. The following table describes the drivers of Powers energy trading and marketing activities and Operating Revenues included in its Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 84 2004. Normal operations and hedging activities represent the marketing of electricity available from Powers owned or contracted generation sold into the wholesale market. As the information in this table highlights, mark to market activities represent a small portion of the total Operating Revenues for Power. Activities accounted for under the accrual method, including normal purchases and sales, account for the majority of the revenue. The mark to market activities reported here are those relating to changes in fair value due to external movement in prices. Operating Revenues For the Year Ended December 31, 2004 Normal Operations and Hedging(A) Trading Total (Millions) Mark to Market Activities: Unrealized Mark to Market Gains (Losses) Changes in Fair Value of Open Positions $ 36 $ 58 $ 94 Origination Unrealized Gain at Inception &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; Changes in Valuation Techniques and Assumptions &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; Realization at Settlement of Contracts (29 ) (58 ) (87 ) Total Change in Unrealized Fair Value 7 &mdash; 7 Realized Net Settlement of Transactions Subject to Mark to Market 29 58 87 Broker Fees and Other Related Expenses &mdash; (11 ) (11 ) Net Mark to Market Gains 36 47 83 Accrual Activities: Accrual Activities&mdash;Revenue, Including Hedge Reclassifications 5,090 &mdash; 5,090 Total Operating Revenues $ 5,126 $ 47 $ 5,173 (A) Includes derivative contracts that Power enters into to hedge anticipated exposures related to its owned and contracted generation supply, all asset backed transactions (ABT) and hedging activities, but excludes owned and contracted generation assets. The following table indicates Powers energy trading assets and liabilities, as well as Powers hedging activity related to ABTs and derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133, its amendments and related guidance. This table presents amounts segregated by portfolio which are then netted for those counterparties with whom Power has the right to set off and therefore, are not necessarily indicative of amounts presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets since balances with many counterparties are subject to offset and are shown net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets regardless of the portfolio in which they are included. 85 Energy Contract Net Assets/Liabilities As of December 31, 2004 Normal Operations and Hedging Trading Total (Millions) Mark to Market Energy Assets Current Assets $ 24 $ 144 $ 168 Noncurrent Assets 19 13 32 Total Mark to Market Energy Assets $ 43 $ 157 $ 200 Mark to Market Energy Liabilities Current Liabilities $ (161 ) $ (129 ) $ (290 ) Noncurrent Liabilities (122 ) (18 ) (140 ) Total Mark to Market Current Liabilities $ (283 ) $ (147 ) $ (430 ) Total Mark to Market Energy Contract Net (Liabilities) Assets $ (240 ) $ 10 $ (230 ) The following table presents the maturity of net fair value of mark to market energy trading contracts.

For contracts where no quoted market exists, modeling techniques were employed using assumptions reflective of current market rates, yield curves and forward prices as applicable to interpolate certain prices. The effect of using such modeling techniques is not material to Powers financial results. PSEG, Power and Energy Holdings The following table identifies losses on cash flow hedges that are currently in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, a separate component of equity. Power uses forward sale and purchase contracts, swaps and firm transmission rights (FTRs) contracts to hedge forecasted energy sales from its generation stations and its contracted supply obligations. Power also enters into swaps, options and futures transactions to hedge the price of fuel to meet its fuel purchase requirements for generation. PSEG, Power and Energy Holdings are subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. PSEGs policy is to manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and interest rate derivatives. The table also provides an estimate of the losses that are expected to be reclassified out of OCI and into earnings over the next twelve months. 86 Cash Flow Hedges Included in OCI As of December 31, 2004 Accumulated OCI Portion Expected to be Reclassified in next 12 months (Millions) Cash Flow Hedges Included in OCI Commodities $ (148 ) $ (81 ) Interest Rates (64 ) (28 ) Foreign Currency &mdash; &mdash; Net Cash Flow Hedge Loss Included in OCI $ (212 ) $ (109 ) Power Credit Risk The following table provides information on Powers credit exposure, net of collateral, as of December 31, 2004. Credit exposure is defined as any positive results of netting accounts receivable/accounts payable and the forward value on open positions. It further delineates that exposure by the credit rating of the counterparties and provides guidance on the concentration of credit risk to individual counterparties and an indication of the maturity of a companys credit risk by credit rating of the counterparties.
