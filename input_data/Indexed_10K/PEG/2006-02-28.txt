ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A) This combined MD&A is separately filed by Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (PSEG), Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G), PSEG Power LLC (Power) and PSEG Energy Holdings L.L.C. (Energy Holdings). Information contained herein relating to any individual company is filed by such company on its own behalf. PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings each make representations only as to itself and make no other representations whatsoever as to any other company. PENDING MERGER PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings On December 20, 2004, PSEG entered into an agreement and plan of merger (Merger Agreement) with Exelon Corporation (Exelon), a public utility holding company headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, whereby PSEG and its subsidiaries will be merged with and into Exelon (Merger). Under the Merger Agreement, each share of PSEG Common Stock will be converted into 1.225 shares of Exelon Common Stock. The Merger Agreement has been unanimously approved by both companies Boards of Directors. On July 19, 2005, shareholders of PSEG voted to approve the Merger, and on July 22, 2005, shareholders of Exelon voted to approve the issuance of common shares to PSEG shareholders to effect the Merger. Completion of the Merger is subject to approval by a number of governmental authorities. As described below, PSEG and Exelon have obtained all regulatory approvals from the principal agencies involved except the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU). On June 30, 2005, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) voted to approve the Merger. FERC determined that Exelons and PSEGs proposed divestitures and other commitments in their original and supplemental filings with FERC, together with their answers to intervenors questions, met the public interest standard of the Federal Power Act. Exelon and PSEG have committed to divest 4,000 megawatts (MW) of intermediate and peaking generation facilities located primarily in eastern PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM), and to virtually divest 2,600 MW of nuclear capacity by effectively transferring control of the output through sales to third parties. A number of parties filed requests for rehearing, which FERC denied on December 15, 2005. Several parties, including the BPU and the New Jersey RatePayer Advocate have filed notices to appeal FERCs Order. During 2005, regulatory approvals or clearances related to the Merger were also obtained from the Connecticut Siting Council (CSC) regarding the transfer of PSEG Power Connecticut LLCs Certificate of Environmental Compatibility and Public Need to Exelon Generation Connecticut LLC, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) under the Industrial Site Recovery Act, the New York Public Service Commission (NYPSC), FERC with respect to the transfer of the hydro license for Yards Creek Generating Station, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, the Public Utility Commission of Texas and Brazils Agencia Nacional de Energia El&eacute;trica. On January 27, 2006, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PAPUC) approved the Merger, principally adopting a settlement by PECO Energy Company (PECO), an Exelon public utility subsidiary serving areas in Southeastern Pennsylvania, and PSE&G with a number of the parties to the proceeding representing consumer, business, environmental and low income interests. Pursuant to the settlement, if the Merger is consummated, PECO will provide $120 million over four years in rate discounts for customers and cap its rates through the end of 2010. The settlement also provides substantial funding for alternative energy and environmental projects, economic development, and expanded outreach and assistance for low income customers. PECO also made commitments for enhanced customer and service reliability and pledges for charitable donations and maintenance of its current headquarters at current staff levels in Philadelphia until the end of 2010. On February 8, 2006, PUHCA was repealed, obviating approval by the SEC under that statute. The NRC proceeding is essentially complete, and an order is pending. PSEG and Exelon presently expect to complete their responses to the current information requests of the DOJ under the HSR Act in the first quarter of 2006. Once the DOJ has evaluated the information submitted by PSEG, Exelon and others, PSEG and Exelon expect to discuss any suggestions or remedies proposed by the DOJ. 53 In New Jersey, the BPU issued an order requiring Exelon and PSEG to prove that positive benefits flow to PSE&Gs customers and the State as a result of the Merger, and that, at a minimum, there be no adverse impact to competition, employees or reliability due to the Merger. The procedural schedule for the BPUs regulatory approval process in New Jersey includes opportunities for settlement discussions with the consumer advocacy groups and other interested parties during the course of the proceedings. In late November 2005, the BPU concluded five public hearings at which representatives from business, environmental coalitions, non profit organizations and consumer groups offered opinions about the Merger. Representatives of the four unions representing workers at PSEG testified in support the Merger upon reaching an agreement with PSEG and Exelon that there will be no layoffs of union workers in New Jersey through the remaining five years of the unions six year contracts. The hearings related to the BPU review of the Merger, commenced on January 4, 2006 and are currently ongoing at the New Jersey Office of Administrative Law. The schedule most recently approved by the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) provides for the hearings to be completed around the end of March 2006, to enable the PJM Market Monitor the opportunity to complete his analysis of the adequacy of the proposal by PSEG and Exelon to mitigate market power of the new company through the sale of 4,000 MW of fossil generation and the virtual divestiture of 2,600 MW of nuclear. No assurances can be given that such analysis will be completed or, if completed, will be acceptable to either PSEG or Exelon. During the hearings, other parties have proposed additional divestiture and have opposed the use of virtual divestiture to address market power issues. During the hearings, PSEG and Exelon have also committed to provide rate credits to PSE&Gs customers of $120 million over 3 or 4 years, to maintain PSE&Gs capital expenditure program and to implement certain governance procedures. Settlement discussions began in December 2005 and are expected to resume after the hearings conclude. No assurances can be given as to whether any such discussions will result in settlements. No firm dates have been set for the ALJs initial decision and final order from the BPU. Commonwealth Edison Co. (ComEd), a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon providing retail electric service in Illinois, is involved in regulatory proceedings in Illinois pertaining to the restructuring of the Illinois electric markets, which began in 1997. Since that time, the rates of ComEd have been reduced and capped, and ComEd transferred or sold its generation assets to third parties or to its affiliate, Exelon Generation LLC (Exelon Generation). Currently, the rate freeze for ComEd and contractual power supply obligations of Exelon Generation to ComEd expire December 31, 2006. In January 2006, the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) approved, with certain modifications, a proposal by ComEd to procure power commencing January 1, 2007 through an auction designed to reflect market rates. Various parties to the proceeding, including the Illinois Attorney General and the Citizens Utility Board have requested the ICC to reconsider its decision, and have indicated they will file appeals to the courts if the ICC ruling is not modified so as to disapprove the ComEd proposal. In addition, legislation has been introduced in the Illinois General Assembly to continue ComEds rate freeze for an additional three years. ComEd has indicated that it believes that enactment of such legislation would violate Federal law and the U.S. Constitution. Nevertheless, ComEd has indicated that it cannot predict the outcome of these regulatory proceedings and legislative actions and that a rate freeze extension or other significant constraint on its ability to recover its power supply costs would have materially adverse financial and operating effects and would likely cause ComEd to resort to protection of the bankruptcy courts to continue as a going concern. The regulatory and political developments in Illinois could also have an effect on the timing or closing conditions of the Merger. Exelon and PSEG presently expect to complete all of the regulatory reviews and close the Merger in the third quarter of 2006. Closing may occur earlier if a settlement is reached and accepted by the BPU. The Merger Agreement provides that if the Merger is not consummated by June 20, 2006, either party may terminate the Merger Agreement. Although Exelon and PSEG believe that the expectations as to timing for the closing of the Merger described above are reasonable, no assurances can be given as to the timing of the receipt of any remaining regulatory approvals, that all required approvals will be received, or that conditions in future regulatory orders will be acceptable to the parties or not have materially adverse conditions. PSEG is committed to maintaining a viable stand alone business strategy in the event the Merger does not close. Management believes PSEG will continue to operate successfully; however, inability to close the Merger could have an impact on PSEGs and Powers credit ratings and could impact the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings. 54 OVERVIEW OF 2005 AND FUTURE OUTLOOK PSEG PSEGs business consists of four reportable segments, which are PSE&G, Power and the two direct subsidiaries of Energy Holdings: PSEG Global L.L.C (Global) and PSEG Resources L.L.C. (Resources). The following is a discussion of the markets in which PSEG and its subsidiaries compete, the corporate strategy for the conduct of PSEGs businesses within these markets and significant events that have occurred during 2005 and expectations for 2006 and beyond. PSEG develops a long range growth target by building business plans and financial forecasts for each major business (PSE&G, Power, Global and Resources). These plans and forecasts incorporate detailed estimates of revenues, operating and maintenance expenses, capital expenditures, financing costs and other material factors for each business. Key factors that may influence the performance of each business, such as fuel costs and forward power prices, are also incorporated. Sensitivity analyses are performed on the key variables that drive the businesses financial results in order to understand the impact of these assumptions on PSEGs projections. Once plans are in place, PSEG management monitors actual results and key variables and updates financial projections to reflect changes in the energy markets, the economy and regional and global conditions. PSEG management believes this monitoring and forecasting process enables it to alter operating and investment plans as conditions change. For 2006, PSEG expects Income from Continuing Operations to range from $3.45 to $3.75 per share, excluding Merger related costs. The increase as compared to 2005 earnings is primarily due to anticipated higher earnings at Power, offset by modest reductions at PSE&G and Energy Holdings. The projected increase at Power is due to anticipated higher margins through the expiration of existing contracts and the realization of current and anticipated higher market prices, partially offset by increases in depreciation and interest expense associated with the new Linden plant expected to be placed into service in mid 2006 and a full year of operations for the Bethlehem Energy Center which commenced commercial operations in July 2005, increased Operation and Maintenance costs and lower earnings from the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT) Funds. The decrease at PSE&G is primarily due to the planning assumption of normal weather during 2006. The reduction at Energy Holdings is primarily due to the absence of the gain from the sale of Seminole Generation Station Unit 2 (Seminole). Also assumed in the earnings projections for 2006 are continued improved nuclear and fossil operations, a positive and timely outcome to the financial review by the BPU for PSE&G (discussed below) and continued strong contributions from Globals operations in Texas and South America. The earnings range for 2006 excludes the expected gain on the sale of Globals two generating facilities in Poland, Elektrocieplownia Chorzow Sp. Z o.o. (Elcho) and Elektrownia Skawina SA (Skawina), which will be reflected in Discontinued Operations, as well as any potential finance costs associated with use of the proceeds. The guidance range also does not contemplate the potential earnings fluctuations that could occur due to mark to market (MTM) accounting being applied to certain of Powers and Energy Holdings operations pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended and interpreted (SFAS 133). See Note 11. Risk Management of the Notes for additional information. In addition, PSEG anticipates earnings per share growth to be in excess of 10% per year for 2007 and 2008, which assumes continued improved operations at Power and reasonable outcomes in PSE&Gs regulatory proceedings. PSEG expects operating cash flows beyond 2005 to be sufficient to meet capital needs and dividend requirements and may employ any excess cash to reduce debt, invest in its businesses, increase dividends or, in the longer term, repurchase shares. On January 17, 2006, PSEG announced an increase in its quarterly dividend from $0.56 to $0.57 per share for the first quarter of 2006. This increase reflects an indicated annual dividend rate of $2.28 per share. Several key factors that will drive PSEGs future success are energy, capacity and fuel prices, performance of Powers generating facilities, PSE&Gs ability to maintain a reasonable rate of return under its regulated rate structure and the stability of international economies for Energy Holdings. PSE&G PSE&G operates as an electric and gas public utility in New Jersey under cost based regulation by the BPU for its distribution operations and by FERC for its electric transmission and wholesale sales operations. 55 Consequently, the earnings of PSE&G are largely determined by the regulation of its rates by those agencies. In February 2006, the BPU approved the results of New Jerseys annual Basic Generation Service (BGS) Fixed Price (FP) and BGS Commercial and Industrial Energy Price (CIEP) auctions and PSE&G successfully secured contracts to provide the electricity requirements for the majority of its customers needs. On September 30, 2005, PSE&G filed a petition with the BPU seeking an overall 3.78% increase in its gas base rates to appropriately recover the cost of gas delivery and to be effective June 30, 2006. Approximately $55 million of the $133 million request is for an increase in book depreciation rates. The balance of the request will cover increased plant investment, higher operating expenses and provide an 11% return on equity. PSE&Gs current gas base rates have been in effect since January 2002. The current schedule provides for a decision on the gas base rate case from the BPU in September 2006, with new rates effective October 1, 2006. PSE&G cannot predict the timing and amount of any rate relief. On August 19, 2005, the BPU approved PSE&Gs request for an increase in its Basic Gas Supply Service (BGSS) commodity charge to its residential gas customers of approximately $163 million (excluding sales and use taxes (SUT)) in annual revenues effective September 1, 2005 or approximately 10.2% for the class average residential heating customer. On December 15, 2005, the BPU approved PSE&Gs request for an additional increase of approximately $204 million (excluding SUT) or approximately 15.6% for the class average residential heating customer which became effective immediately. The December 15, 2005 BGSS increase was intended to eliminate any large underrecovery and is expected to produce a zero deferred balance at September 30, 2006 based on the conditions at the time of the filing and is also intended to be in lieu of the 5% increases on December 1, 2005 and February 1, 2006. In 2006, PSE&G expects Income from Continuing Operations to range from $315 million to $335 million, which is slightly lower than results for 2005, primarily due to the planning assumption of normal weather conditions for 2006. Also included in PSE&Gs projections is a positive and timely outcome, which cannot be assured, to the financial review at the BPU for approximately $64 million. As part of the settlement of PSE&Gs electric base rate case in 2004, a $64 million annual depreciation credit was established. This credit expired on December 31, 2005. As part of the settlement, PSE&G was required to make a financial filing with the BPU in November 2005 to support a corresponding increase in rates to offset the loss of the depreciation credit. The BPU issued an order on February 7, 2006 and found that insufficient information had been provided to support the rate increase at the time. The order permits PSE&G to file, no later than June 15, 2006, actual data through March 31, 2006. The BPU will determine, based on the additional information, if the rate increase is warranted. The impact of not receiving this increase reduces PSE&Gs earnings and cash flows by more than $5 million (pre tax) per month. The timing and amount of an increase cannot be predicted with certainty. The risks from this business generally relate to the treatment of the various rate and other issues by the state and federal regulatory agencies, specifically the BPU and FERC. In 2006 and beyond, PSE&Gs success will depend, in part, on its ability to maintain a reasonable rate of return, including a reasonable outcome to its current Gas Base Rate Case and the ability to realize the approximate $64 million electric distribution rate increase per year beginning in 2006, continue cost containment initiatives, maintain system reliability and safety levels and continue to recover with an adequate return the regulatory assets it has deferred and the investments it plans to make in its electric and gas transmission and distribution system. Since PSE&G earns no margin on the commodity portion of its electric and gas sales through tariff agreements, there is no anticipated commodity price volatility for PSE&G. Power Power is an electric generation and wholesale energy marketing and trading company that is focused on a generation market extending from Maine to the Carolinas and the Atlantic Coast to Indiana. Powers principal operating subsidiaries, PSEG Fossil LLC (Fossil), PSEG Nuclear LLC (Nuclear) and PSEG Energy Resources & Trade LLC (ER&T) are regulated by FERC. Through its subsidiaries, Power seeks to balance its generating capacity, fuel requirements and supply obligations through integrated energy marketing and trading, enhance its ability to produce low cost energy through efficient nuclear operations and pursue modest growth based on market conditions. Changes in the operation of Powers generating facilities, fuel and capacity prices, expected contract prices, capacity factors or other assumptions could materially affect its 56 ability to meet earnings targets and or liquidity requirements. In addition to the electric generation business described above, Powers revenues include gas supply sales under the BGSS contract with PSE&G. As a merchant generator, Powers profit is derived from selling under contract or on the spot market a range of diverse products such as energy, capacity, emissions credits, congestion credits, and a series of energy related products that the system operator uses to optimize the operation of the energy grid, known as ancillary services. Accordingly, commodity prices, such as electricity, gas, coal and emissions, as well as the availability of Powers diverse fleet of generation units to produce these products, when necessary, have a considerable effect on Powers profitability. Recently, the price of many of these products has increased dramatically. These price increases have been accompanied by increases in volatility as well. The prices at which transactions are entered into for future delivery of these products, as evidenced through the market for forward contracts at points such as PJM West, have escalated but the volatility in the market will also increase the risk to Powers results as the market changes are likely to impact the value of the uncontracted portion of Powers portfolio. Broad market price increases such as these are expected to have a positive effect on Powers results. Historically, Powers nuclear and coal fired facilities have produced over 50% and 25% of Powers production, respectively. With the vast majority of its power sourced from lower cost units, the rise in electric prices driven by dramatic increases in gas prices is anticipated to yield higher near term margins for Power. In the near term, Power anticipates recognizing these higher margins, especially on the portion of its output that was more recently contracted or sold on the spot market. Over a longer term horizon, if these higher prices are sustained at prices reflective of what the current forward markets indicate, it would yield a more attractive environment for Power to contract the sale of its anticipated output, allowing for potentially sustained higher profitability. Power believes that recent events in PJM, New York and the New England Power Pool (NEPOOL) have created the potential for incremental value to be received from the capacity markets for its units. These include existing and anticipated Reliability Must Run (RMR) contracts to provide generation unit owners with fixed reliability payments to enable their continued availability and potential changes in the nature of capacity markets which would provide generators with differentiated capacity payments based upon the location and operating characteristics of their respective facilities. During 2005, the rising commodity price environment resulted in increased liquidity requirements for Powers energy sales contracts entered into in the normal course of business. In response to such changes in the business environment, PSEG and Power obtained additional sources of liquidity. In addition, Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (OCL) increased as contracts that qualify for hedge accounting were marked to market. Power seeks to mitigate volatility in its results by contracting in advance for a significant portion of its anticipated electric output and fuel needs. Power believes this contracting strategy increases stability of earnings and cash flow. By keeping some portion of its output uncontracted, Power is able to retain some exposure to market changes as well as provide some protection in the event of unexpected generation outages. Power seeks to sell a portion of its anticipated nuclear and coal fired generation over a multi year forward horizon, normally over a period of approximately two to four years. In 2005, these units produced over 85% of Powers generation, and given their historic low operating cost, an even higher percentage of the companys margin. As of February 15, 2006, Power has contracted for over 95% of its anticipated 2006 nuclear and coal fired generation, with 85% to 95% contracted for 2007 and 65% to 80% contracted for 2008, with a relatively small amount contracted beyond 2008. Power has also entered into contracts for the future delivery of nuclear fuel and coal to support its contracted sales discussed above. As of February 15, 2006, Power had contracted for 100% of its anticipated nuclear fuel needs through 2008, and approximately 75% of its average anticipated coal needs, including transportation, through 2008. These estimates are subject to change based upon the level of operation, and in particular for coal, are subject to market demands and pricing. By contrast, Power takes a more opportunistic approach in hedging its anticipated natural gas fired generation. The generation from these units is less predictable, as these units are generally dispatched only when aggregate market demand has exceeded the supply provided by low cost units. The natural gas fired units generally provide a lower contribution to the margin of Power than either the nuclear or coal units. 57 Power will generally purchase natural gas as gas fired generation is required to supply forward sale commitments. In a changing market environment, this hedging strategy may cause Powers realized prices to be materially different than current market prices. At the present time, a significant portion of Powers existing contractual obligations, entered into during lower priced periods, resulted in lower margins than would have been the case if no or little hedging activity had been conducted. Alternatively, in a falling price environment, this hedging strategy will tend to create margins in excess of those implied by the then current market. Concurrent with the signing of the Merger Agreement, Power entered into an Operating Services Contract (OSC) with Exelon Generation. Under the terms of the OSC, since January 17, 2005, Exelon Generation has provided management personnel and its proprietary management systems under a fee arrangement to Power to operate the Salem and Hope Creek nuclear generating facilities. The OSC has a term of two years, subject to earlier termination in certain events upon prior notice, including any termination of the Merger Agreement. In the event of termination, Exelon Generation is required to continue to provide services under the OSC for a transition period of at least 180 days and up to two years at the election of Nuclear. This period may be further extended by Nuclear for up to an additional 12 months if Nuclear determines that additional time is necessary to complete required activities during the transition period. On July 18, 2005, Powers new Bethlehem Energy Center (BEC), a 750 MW, natural gas fired combined cycle power generation plant near Albany, New York, began commercial operations, replacing a 376 MW oil fired facility at the same site. On September 28, 2005, Power completed the sale of its electric generation facility located in Waterford, Ohio (Waterford) to a subsidiary of American Electric Power Company, Inc. The sale price for the facility and inventory was $220 million. The proceeds, together with anticipated reduction in tax liability, were approximately $320 million, which will be used to retire debt at Power. See Note 4. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions and Acquisitions of the Notes for further discussion. In 2006, Power expects Income from Continuing Operations to range from $475 million to $525 million, reflecting continued improvements in the operating performance of its nuclear and fossil stations, strong energy markets and increased contracting opportunities. These increases will be partially offset by increases in depreciation and interest expense associated with the new Linden plant expected to be placed into service in mid 2006 and a full year for the Bethlehem Energy Center, increased Operation and Maintenance costs and lower earnings from the NDT Funds. The guidance range does not contemplate the potential earnings fluctuations that could occur due to MTM accounting being applied to Powers operations pursuant to SFAS 133. See Note 11. Risk Management of the Notes for additional information. A key factor in Powers ability to achieve its objectives is its capability to operate its nuclear and fossil stations at sufficient capacity factors to limit the need to purchase higher priced electricity to satisfy its obligations. Powers ability to benefit from any future increases in market prices will depend, to a large extent, on efficient power plant operations, especially for its low cost nuclear and coal fired facilities. While these increases may have a potentially significant, beneficial impact on margins, they could also raise any replacement power costs that Power may incur in the event of unanticipated outages, and could also further increase liquidity requirements as a result of contract obligations. For additional information on liquidity requirements, see Liquidity and Capital Resources. In addition, forward prices are constantly changing and therefore there is no assurance that Power will be able to contract its output at attractive prices. Energy Holdings Energy Holdings operations are principally conducted through its subsidiaries Global, which has invested in international, rate regulated distribution companies and domestic and international merchant generation companies, and Resources, which primarily invests in energy related leveraged leases. Energy Holdings earnings significantly exceeded its earnings guidance range in 2005 and previous years results. The increase was driven by strong results in Globals generation projects in Texas and its South American distribution businesses and a gain on the sale of Resources leveraged lease investment in Seminole. Also, Energy Holdings contributed over $400 million in cash distributions to PSEG while calling all $309 million of its 7.75% 2007 Senior Notes. In 2004, Energy Holdings contributed $475 million to PSEG and redeemed over $300 million of debt. Energy Holdings strong cash flow in 2005 was largely due to dividends from its investments, the repatriation of approximately $240 million of cash from its foreign investments under the 58 American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Jobs Act), the collection of the note receivable from the 2004 sale of MPC and the sale of Resources investment in Seminole. For 2006, Energy Holdings expects Income from Continuing Operations to range from $155 million to $175 million. The expected 2006 range is less than the 2005 Income from Continuing Operations primarily due to a $43 million after tax gain recognized in 2005 from the sale of Seminole. The earnings range for 2006 excludes the expected gain on the sale of Globals two generating facilities in Poland, Elcho and Skawina, which will be reflected in Discontinued Operations, as well as any potential finance costs associated with use of the proceeds. The guidance range also does not contemplate the potential earnings fluctuations that could occur due to MTM accounting being applied to Globals operations in Texas as the energy and gas contracts, which are backed by the physical capacity of the plant and sold in the normal course of business, must be marked to market pursuant to SFAS 133. See Note 11. Risk Management of the Notes for additional information related to this contract. Global Although Global continues to produce significant earnings and operating cash flow, the returns on several of the investments in its international portfolio have not been commensurate with the level of risk associated with international investments in developing energy markets. As a result, since 2003, Energy Holdings has refocused its strategy from one of growth to one that places emphasis on increasing the efficiency and returns of its existing assets. Accordingly, Global continues to limit its capital spending, while focusing on operations and improved performance of existing businesses and is seeking to opportunistically monetize investments that may no longer have a strategic fit. On January 31, 2006, Energy Holdings entered into an agreement with CEZ a.s., the former Czech national utility company and the largest electric power company in central and eastern Europe, to sell Globals interest in two coal fired plants in Poland, Elcho and Skawina. The sale is expected to close in the second quarter of 2006. Net proceeds from the sale are subject to various purchase price adjustments, foreign currency fluctuations and contingencies and are currently expected to be approximately $300 million after taxes and transaction costs, which is in excess of the book value of the facilities as of December 31, 2005. In April 2005, Global sold a 35% interest in Dhofar Power Company S.A.O.C. (Dhofar Power), reducing its ownership interest from 81% to 46%, through a public offering on the Omani stock exchange for net proceeds of approximately $25 million. The capital requirements of Globals consolidated subsidiaries are primarily financed from internally generated cash flow within the projects and from local sources on a basis that is non recourse to Global or limited discretionary investments by Energy Holdings. Under the provisions of the Jobs Act and the currently released IRS regulations, Global had a one year window to repatriate earnings from its foreign investments and claim a special one time 85% dividends received tax deduction on such distributions. In 2005, PSEG executed a total of three Domestic Reinvestment Plans under which approximately $242 million was repatriated, of which $177 million was eligible for the reduced tax rate pursuant to the Jobs Act. The tax expense associated with such repatriation totaled approximately $11 million. Other than amounts remitted under the Jobs Act, Global has made no change in its current intention to indefinitely reinvest accumulated earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. Globals success will depend, in part, upon its ability to mitigate risks of its international strategy. The economic and political conditions in certain countries where Global has investments present risks that may be different or more significant than those found in the U.S. including: renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts, changes in law or tax policy, interruption of business, nationalization, expropriation, war and other factors. Operations in foreign countries also present risks associated with currency exchange and convertibility, inflation and repatriation of earnings. In some countries in which Global has interests, economic and monetary conditions and other factors could affect its ability to convert its cash distributions to U.S. Dollars or other freely convertible currencies. Furthermore, the central bank of any such country may have the authority to suspend, restrict or otherwise impose conditions on foreign exchange transactions or to limit distributions to foreign investors. Resources Resources primarily has invested in energy related leveraged leases. Resources is focused on maintaining its current investment portfolio and does not expect to make any new investments. Resources ability to realize tax benefits associated with its leveraged lease investments is dependent upon taxable income 59 generated by its affiliates. Resources earnings and cash flows are expected to decrease in the future as the investment portfolio matures. Resources faces risks with regard to the creditworthiness of its counterparties, specifically certain lessees that collectively comprise a substantial portion of Resources investment portfolio as discussed further below. Resources also faces risks related to potential changes in the current accounting and tax treatment of certain investments in leveraged leases. The manifestation of either of these risks could cause a materially adverse effect on Resources strategy and its forecasted results of operations, financial position and net cash flows. In January 2005, Resources and Global sold their interests in three Solar Electric Generating Systems (SEGS) projects for proceeds of approximately $7 million. Also in January 2005, Resources also received proceeds of approximately $17 million from the KKR Funds sale of its investment in KinderCare Learning Centers, Inc. In June 2005, Resources wrote off its entire investment of approximately $15 million, net of tax, in an aircraft lease to United Airlines (UAL) upon termination of the lease and repossession of the aircraft by the lenders in a bankruptcy proceeding with UAL. In December 2005, Resources sold its interest in Seminole in Palatka, Florida, to Seminole Electric Cooperative Inc. for $286 million. Seminole is a 659 MW coal fired facility. It is one of two units at the Seminole plant. The sale resulted in a $43 million after tax gain. Net proceeds of $235 million together with other funds were used to redeem Energy Holdings $309 million outstanding 7.75% Senior Notes due in 2007. As of December 31, 2005, Resources has a remaining net investment in four leased aircraft of approximately $32 million. On September 14, 2005, Delta Airlines (Delta) and Northwest Airlines (Northwest), the lessees for Resources four remaining aircraft, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. This had no material effect on Energy Holdings as it continues to believe that it will be able to recover the recorded amount of its investments in these aircraft as of December 31, 2005. In 2004 and 2005, Resources successfully restructured the leases and converted the Delta and Northwest leases from leveraged leases to operating leases. Energy Holdings expects to recover its investment through cash flows from the operating leases. During 2005, the IRS proposed to disallow certain deductions associated with some of the leveraged leases which have been designated by the IRS as listed transactions. In addition, a proposal by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) concerning leveraged leases would require a lessor to perform a recalculation of a leveraged lease when there is a change in the timing of the realization of tax benefits generated by the lease. If implemented in its present form, the impact of this proposal could be material. For additional information, see Note 12.

Recent Accounting Standards and Note 3. Asset Retirement Obligations of the Notes. (F) Earnings Per Share of any segment dose not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities allocated to any one segment but rather represents a direct interest in PSEGs assets and liabilities as a whole. The $88 million, or $0.28 per share, increase in Income from Continuing Operations for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the same period in 2004, was primarily due to higher earnings at Power. Powers increase reflected higher pricing and increased sales in the various power pools and new wholesale contracts and reduced Operation and Maintenance costs associated with the outage at Hope Creek in 2004. Marked improvement in Powers nuclear operations provided additional low cost energy to satisfy Powers contractual obligations and to sell into the market at higher prices. The increases at Power were partially offset by interest and depreciation costs related to facilities in Albany, New York, which commenced operation in August 2005 and Lawrenceburg, Indiana, which commenced operation in June 2004. Energy Holdings also contributed to the increase with higher earnings due to improved operations at Texas Independent Energy, L.P. (TIE) and in South America and an after tax gain of $43 million from the sale of Resources leveraged lease investment in Seminole in December 2005. At PSE&G, higher margins, due to favorable weather conditions, and reduced interest expense were substantially offset by higher Operation and Maintenance costs. These increases were partially offset by after tax Merger related costs of approximately $32 million at PSEG, PSE&G and Power in 2005 and approximately $4 million at PSEG in 2004. The $85 million, or $0.51 per share, decrease in Income from Continuing Operations for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, was primarily due to lower earnings at Power due to decreased load being served under the fixed price BGS contracts, higher Operation and Maintenance costs primarily incurred for work performed during a longer than planned refueling outage at the Hope Creek nuclear unit, the loss of Market Transition Charge (MTC) revenues, which ceased effective August 1, 2003 at the end of the transition period and higher replacement power and congestion costs in 2004. Also contributing to the decrease were currency fluctuations at Global and lower earnings at Resources, primarily resulting from the termination of the Collins lease. These decreases were partially offset by improved earnings at PSE&G, primarily relating to increased electric base rates. Changes in Net Income were also attributable to Loss from Discontinued Operations due to Powers sale of Waterford in 2005 and Energy Holdings sale of its majority interests in Elcho and Skawina on January 31, 2006 and its sales of CPC in 2004 and Energy Technologies in 2003. Power reported Losses from Discontinued Operations of $198 million (including a loss of $178 million on disposal of Waterford), $34 million and $9 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Energy Holdings reported Income from Discontinued Operations of $18 million in 2005 and Losses from Discontinued Operations of $10 million in 2004 and $38 million in 2003. 62 PSEG For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 vs 2004 2004 vs 2003 2005 2004 2003 Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % (Millions) (Millions) Operating Revenues $ 12,430 $ 10,800 $ 11,006 $ 1,630 15 $ (206 ) (2 ) Energy Costs $ 7,273 $ 5,987 $ 6,335 $ 1,286 21 $ (348 ) (5 ) Operation and Maintenance $ 2,314 $ 2,179 $ 2,064 $ 135 6 $ 115 6 Depreciation and Amortization $ 748 $ 693 $ 516 $ 55 8 $ 177 34 Income from Equity Method Investments $ 131 $ 126 $ 114 $ 5 4 $ 12 11 Other Income $ 221 $ 180 $ 184 $ 41 23 $ (4 ) $ (2 ) Other Deductions $ (87 ) $ (69 ) $ (100 ) $ 18 26 $ (31 ) (31 ) Interest Expense $ (816 ) $ (798 ) $ (825 ) $ 18 2 $ (27 ) (3 ) Income Tax Expense $ (541 ) $ (467 ) $ (469 ) $ 74 16 $ (2 ) &mdash; Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, including Gain (Loss) on Disposal, net of tax $ (180 ) $ (44 ) $ (47 ) $ 136 N/A $ (3 ) (6 ) Extraordinary Item, net of tax $ &mdash; $ &mdash; $ (18 ) $ &mdash; &mdash; $ (18 ) (100 ) Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle, net of tax $ (17 ) $ &mdash; $ 370 $ 17 100 $ (370 ) (100 ) PSEGs results of operations are primarily comprised of the results of operations of its operating subsidiaries, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings, excluding changes related to intercompany transactions, which are eliminated in consolidation. It also includes certain financing costs at the parent company. For additional information on intercompany transactions, see Note 21. Related Party Transactions of the Notes. For a discussion of the causes for the variances at PSEG in the table above, see the discussions for PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings that follow. PSE&G For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 vs 2004 2004 vs 2003 2005 2004 2003 Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % (Millions) (Millions) Operating Revenues $ 7,728 $ 6,972 $ 6,740 $ 756 11 $ 232 3 Energy Costs $ 4,970 $ 4,284 $ 4,421 $ 686 16 $ (137 ) (3 ) Operation and Maintenance $ 1,151 $ 1,083 $ 1,050 $ 68 6 $ 33 3 Depreciation and Amortization $ 553 $ 523 $ 372 $ 30 6 $ 151 41 Other Income $ 15 $ 12 $ 6 $ 3 25 $ 6 100 Other Deductions $ (3 ) $ (1 ) $ (1 ) $ 2 N/A $ &mdash; &mdash; Interest Expense $ (342 ) $ (362 ) $ (390 ) $ (20 ) (6 ) $ (28 ) (7 ) Income Tax Expense $ (235 ) $ (246 ) $ (129 ) $ (11 ) (4 ) $ 117 91 Operating Revenues PSE&G has three sources of revenue: commodity revenues from the sales of energy to customers and in the PJM spot market; delivery revenues from the transmission and distribution of energy through its system; and other operating revenues from the provision of various services. Operating Revenues increased $756 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the same period in 2004, due to increases of $667 million in commodity revenues, $82 million in delivery revenues and $7 million in other operating revenues. Operating Revenues increased $232 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, due to increases of $13 million in commodity revenues, $198 million in delivery revenues and $21 million in other operating revenues. 63 Commodity PSE&G makes no margin on commodity sales as the costs are passed through to customers. The difference between costs and the amount paid by customers in revenues is deferred and collected from or returned to customers in future periods. Total commodity volumes and revenues are subject to market forces. Gas commodity prices fluctuate monthly for commercial and industrial customers and annually through the BGSS tariff for residential customers. In addition, for residential gas customers, PSE&G has the ability to adjust rates upward two additional times and downward at any time, if warranted, between annual BGSS proceedings. Commodity revenues increased $667 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the same period in 2004, due to increases of $305 million in electric commodity revenues, $235 million primarily due to higher BGS and Non Utility Generation (NUG) prices and $70 million in higher volumes due to weather. Also contributing to the increase was $362 million in increased gas commodity revenues, $392 million primarily due to higher BGSS prices, offset by a $42 million decrease due to the expiration of the Third Party Shopping Incentive on July 1, 2005. There is a corresponding $42 million increase in delivery revenues, described below. Also contributing to the increase is $12 million in higher volumes, primarily due to increased cogeneration operations. Commodity revenues increased $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003. This was due to increases of $16 million in electric commodity revenues, $249 million from higher BGS prices offset by $233 million in lower volumes due to the migration of large customers to third party suppliers. This was offset by $3 million in decreased gas commodity revenues, $249 million primarily due to higher BGSS prices, offset by $252 million in lower volumes, primarily due to decreased cogeneration operations. Delivery The $82 million increase in delivery revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the same period in 2004, was due to increases of $75 million in electric revenues and $7 million in gas revenues. The $75 million in electric revenues was primarily due to higher volumes of $68 million due to weather and $7 million due to increased distribution prices. The $7 million in increased gas revenues was due to the expiration of the Third Party Shopping Incentive Fund on July 1, 2005, resulting in an increase of $42 million in delivery revenues with a corresponding offset in commodity revenues, described above, and a $12 million increase in Societal Benefits Clause (SBC) revenues (offset in Operation and Maintenance Costs below). This was offset by $9 million in lower volume and demand revenues due to weather and $37 million due to the expiration of the Gas Cost Underrecovery Adjustment (GCUA) clause in January 2005. The $198 million increase in delivery revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, was due to increases of $222 million in electric revenues offset by decreases of $24 million in gas revenues. The $222 million in electric revenues was primarily due to $180 million in increased prices due to the effect of full year base rate increases in August 2003 and other rate adjustments in January 2004 and increased volumes of $42 million. The $24 million in decreased gas revenues was primarily due to $18 million in lower volumes due to weather and $5 million due to lower prices. Operating Expenses Energy Costs The $686 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the same period in 2004, was comprised of increases of $319 million in electric costs and $367 million in gas costs. The increase in electric costs was caused by a $264 million or 8% increase due to higher prices for BGS and NUG purchases and a $67 million increase due to higher BGS volumes, partially offset by a decrease of $12 million due to lower NUG volumes. The increased gas costs were due to a $315 million or 17% increase in gas prices and an $89 million increase in sales volumes due primarily to higher sales to cogenerators. These were offset by a $37 million decrease due to the expiration of the GCUA clause in January 2005. The $137 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, was comprised of decreases of $96 million in electric costs and $41 million in gas costs. The electric decrease was caused by $262 million in lower BGS volumes due to customer migration to third party suppliers offset by $166 million or 6% in higher prices for BGS and NUG purchases. The gas decrease was 64 caused by a $388 million or 20% decrease in sales volumes due primarily to lower sales to cogenerators offset by a $347 million or 26% increase in gas prices. Operation and Maintenance The $68 million increase for 2005, as compared to the same period in 2004, was due to increased SBC expenses of $27 million ($15 million electric, $12 million gas); $23 million in labor and fringe benefits; $6 million for increased injuries and damages reserves; $4 million for merger related expenses; $3 million for higher regulatory commission expenses; $2 million for higher bad debt expenses and $2 million for the purchase of Net Operating Losses. SBC costs are deferred when incurred and amortized to expense when recovered in revenues. The $33 million increase for 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, was due primarily to increased Demand Side Management (DSM) amortization of $20 million, increased consumer education expenses of $24 million, an $18 million reduction in real estate tax expense in 2003 and $10 million related to a regulatory asset reserve reversal in 2003. DSM costs are deferred when incurred and amortized to expense when recovered in revenues. Offsetting the increases were decreased labor and fringe benefits of $7 million, due to lower pension costs as a result of improved fund performance, a $22 million reduction in SBC expenses and $10 million in lower shared services costs due to reduced technology spending. Depreciation and Amortization The $30 million increase the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the same period in 2004, was due primarily to a $33 million increase in the amortization of securitized regulatory assets, a $4 million increase due to additional plant in service and a $4 million increase in the amortization of the Remediation Adjustment Clause (RAC). These were offset by an $8 million decrease in software amortization and a $3 million increase in excess depreciation reserve amortization. The $151 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, was due primarily to a $132 million reduction in amortization of an excess electric distribution depreciation reserve regulatory liability, a $30 million increase in the amortization of various regulatory assets and a $10 million increase due to increased plant in service. These increases were offset by a $16 million decrease from the use of a lower book depreciation rate for electric distribution property, which took effect in August 2003 following the conclusion of the electric base rate case, and a $6 million decrease due to plant assets transferred to an affiliate in 2003. Other Income The $3 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the same period in 2004, was due primarily to increases of $3 million due to the sale of land and $1 million of interest income offset by $1 million in lower realized gains on investments. The $6 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, was due primarily to $11 million of equity return adjustments to regulatory assets in 2003, $4 million of interest income related to an affiliate loan and other Investment Income of $3 million offset by decreased gains on excess property sales of $12 million. Interest Expense The $20 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the same period in 2004, was primarily due to decreases of $22 million due to lower average interest rates and lower amounts of long term debt outstanding, primarily offset by $5 million in higher short term debt balances outstanding and higher interest rates. The $28 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, was due primarily to lower interest on long term debt of $37 million as a result of lower interest rates and lower levels of long term debt outstanding, partially offset by $11 million in increased interest on affiliated loans. 65 Income Taxes The $11 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the same period in 2004, was primarily due to decreases of $4 million in prior period adjustments, $3 million in various flow through benefits and $3 million in lower pre tax income. The $117 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, was primarily due to higher pre tax income combined with lower tax benefits primarily attributable to the excess depreciation reserve adjustment in 2003. Power For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 vs 2004 2004 vs 2003 2005 2004 2003 Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % (Millions) (Millions) Operating Revenues $ 6,059 $ 5,168 $ 5,608 $ 891 17 $ (440 ) (8 ) Energy Costs $ 4,286 $ 3,554 $ 3,750 $ 732 21 $ (196 ) (5 ) Operation and Maintenance $ 949 $ 954 $ 911 $ (5 ) (1 ) $ 43 5 Depreciation and Amortization $ 131 $ 108 $ 97 $ 23 21 $ 11 11 Other Income $ 186 $ 167 $ 150 $ 19 11 $ 17 11 Other Deductions $ (43 ) $ (55 ) $ (78 ) $ (12 ) (22 ) $ (23 ) (29 ) Interest Expense $ (131 ) $ (113 ) $ (107 ) $ 18 16 $ 6 6 Income Tax Expense $ (299 ) $ (209 ) $ (332 ) $ 90 43 $ (123 ) (37 ) Loss from Discontinued Operations, including Loss on Disposal, net of tax $ (198 ) $ (34 ) $ (9 ) $ 164 N/A $ 25 N/A Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle, net of tax $ (16 ) $ &mdash; $ 370 $ 16 100 $ (370 ) (100 ) Operating Revenues Operating Revenues increased $891 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the same period in 2004, due to increases of $573 million in generation revenues and $368 million in gas supply revenues partly offset by a decrease of $50 million in trading revenues. Operating Revenues decreased by $440 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, due to decreases of $485 million in generation revenues and $6 million in trading revenues offset by an increase of $51 million in gas supply revenues. Generation Generation revenues increased $573 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the same period in 2004, primarily due to higher revenues of approximately $256 million from higher pricing and increased sales in the various power pools supported by improved nuclear capacity, partially offset by reduced load being served under the fixed priced BGS contracts. Also contributing to the increase were increases of approximately $103 million from new wholesale contracts, approximately $74 million from operations in New York, largely due to the commencement of BECs operations in July 2005, partially offset by operations of the Albany Steam Station which was operational in 2004 and retired in February 2005, approximately $65 million from Reliability Must Run (RMR) revenues which Power began receiving in 2005 for certain of its generating facilities and approximately $75 million from increased ancillary services and operating reserves. Generation revenues decreased $485 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, primarily due to $1.1 billion in lower revenues due to decreased load being served under the fixed priced BGS contracts, which was partially offset by $869 million of higher revenues from new contracts and higher sales into the various power pools. Additionally, the loss of MTC and NDT revenues, which amounted to $111 million and $17 million, respectively, comprised part of the decrease. Also contributing to the decrease in 2004 from 2003 was the adoption of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03 11, Reporting Realized Gains and Losses on Derivative Instruments That Are Subject to FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and Not Held 66 for Trading Purposes as defined in EITF Issue No. 02 3, Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities (EITF 03 11), which requires gains and losses (realized and unrealized) on all derivative instruments within the scope of SFAS 133 to be shown net when recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, whether or not settled physically, if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes as defined in EITF 02 3, which became effective on a prospective basis for transactions occurring after September 30, 2003. Since prior periods were not restated in 2004, the effect of adopting EITF 03 11 reduced Powers Operating Revenues by approximately $174 million, with an equal reduction in Energy Costs, as compared to the same period in 2003. Gas Supply Gas supply revenues increased $368 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the same period in 2004, principally due to higher prices under the BGSS contract for gas and pipeline capacity partially offset by lower demand largely resulting from a warmer winter heating season in 2005. Gas supply revenues increased by $51 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, primarily due to higher gas prices under the BGSS contract partially offset by decreased sales volumes mainly due to lower demand by PSE&G. Trading The $50 million decrease in trading revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the same period in 2004, resulted principally from reductions in realized gains related to emission credits. The $6 million decrease in trading revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, was primarily due to market conditions. Operating Expenses Energy Costs Energy Costs represent the cost of generation, which includes fuel purchases for generation as well as purchased energy in the market, and gas purchases to meet Powers obligation under its BGSS contract with PSE&G. Energy Costs increased approximately $732 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the same period in 2004, primarily due to increased generation costs, reflecting higher fossil fuel prices and higher prices on increased volume of purchased power for new contracts and higher prices for gas purchased to satisfy Powers BGSS obligations. Energy Costs decreased approximately $196 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, primarily due to a $213 million decrease in purchased power due to decreased load being served under the BGS contracts, which was offset by increased replacement power costs due to outages and higher purchased power for new contracts and a $12 million increase in gas supply costs due to higher gas prices. Also contributing to the decrease for the year was a reduction of approximately $174 million related to the adoption of EITF 03 11, as discussed above. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher fuel costs for generation of approximately $159 million, primarily related to higher gas prices and higher usage, including an increase of approximately $20 million related to the settlement for nuclear waste storage costs for Peach Bottom. For additional information regarding the settlement, see Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities&mdash;Nuclear Fuel Disposal of the Notes. Operation and Maintenance Operation and Maintenance expense decreased $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the same period in 2004, primarily due to a decrease of $36 million in equipment repair costs related to outages at the nuclear facilities as well as $9 million of lower real estate taxes, $5 million of lower transmission fees in the power pools and an $8 million settlement of co owner billings in 2004 related to Powers jointly owned facilities. The decreases were substantially offset by an increase of $11 million in pension, postretirement and other employee benefits, a $16 million increase attributable to repairs for outages at the fossil generation plants, a $14 million restructuring charge recorded in 2005 related to 67 Nuclears workforce realignment plan and a $12 million U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) settlement in 2004. Operation and Maintenance expense increased $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, due to increased costs of $85 million related to the outages at Hope Creek, Salem and Mercer. This was offset by $12 million related to the settlement for nuclear waste storage costs for Peach Bottom and $10 million in lower real estate taxes and other items. Additional offsets include the absence of reorganization costs of $9 million and the lower write down costs related to obsolete materials and supplies of $8 million. For additional information regarding the settlement, see Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities&mdash;Nuclear Fuel Disposal of the Notes. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and Amortization expense increased $23 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the same period in 2004, primarily due to the BEC facility being placed into service in July 2005 and a higher depreciable asset base in 2005 at Nuclear. The increase is also due to the Lawrenceburg facility being placed into service in June 2004. Depreciation and Amortization expense increased $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, primarily due to the Lawrenceburg facility. Other Income Other Income increased $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the same period in 2004, primarily due to increased realized gains and income related to the NDT Funds and a $5 million gain from the sale in September 2005 of four gas turbine generators located in Burlington, New Jersey. Other Income increased $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, due primarily to increased realized gains and income related to the NDT Funds. Other Deductions Other Deductions decreased $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the same period in 2004, primarily due to decreased realized losses of $8 million related to the NDT Funds and a write off of $5 million of unamortized issuance costs in the first quarter of 2004 related to the extinguishment of non recourse financing of the Lawrenceburg facility. Other Deductions decreased $23 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, primarily due to $28 million in lower realized losses and expenses related to the NDT Funds, partially offset by a $5 million write off of unamortized issuance costs related to the extinguishment non recourse financing of the Lawrenceburg facility. Interest Expense Interest Expense increased $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the same period in 2004, due primarily to $23 million of lower capitalized interest costs in 2005 related to commencement of operations of the Lawrenceburg and BEC facilities in June 2004 and July 2005, respectively, partially offset by an overall decrease of $8 million due to the extinguishment of project debt and issuance of new long term debt at more favorable pricing in March 2004. Interest Expense increased $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, due primarily to $4 million related to an affiliate loan and additional interest on increased levels of long term debt outstanding. Income Taxes Income taxes increased $90 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the same period in 2004, primarily due to an increase of $63 million in taxes on pre tax income, the recording in 2005 of $15 million of taxes for the NDT Funds and the reversal in 2004 of $16 million of contingency reserves and other prior period adjustments. 68 Income taxes decreased $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, due primarily to lower pre tax income and the aforementioned $16 million reversal of contingency reserves and other prior period adjustments. Loss from Discontinued Operations, including Loss on Disposal, net of tax On May 27, 2005, Power reached an agreement to sell its Waterford generation facility for approximately $220 million and recognized an estimated loss on disposal of $177 million, net of tax, for the initial write down of its carrying amount of Waterford to its fair value less cost to sell. On September 28, 2005, Power completed the sale of Waterford and recognized an additional loss of $1 million. The proceeds, together with anticipated reduction in tax liability, were approximately $320 million, which will be used to retire debt at Power. Powers Losses from Discontinued Operations of Waterford, not including the Loss of Disposal, were $20 million, $34 million and $9 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. See Note 4. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions and Acquisitions of the Notes for additional information. Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle For the year ended December 31, 2005, Power recorded an after tax loss in the amount of $16 million due to the required recording of a liability for the fair value of asset retirement costs primarily related to its generation plants under FIN 47 which was adopted in December, 2005. See Note 3. Asset Retirement Obligations of the Notes for additional information. For the year ended December 31, 2003, Power recorded an after tax benefit in the amount of $370 million due to the required remeasurement of Powers nuclear and fossil decommissioning obligations under SFAS 143, which was adopted on January 1, 2003. See Note 3. Asset Retirement Obligations of the Notes for additional information. Energy Holdings For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 vs 2004 2004 vs 2003 2005 2004 2003 Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) % (Millions) (Millions) Operating Revenues $ 1,302 $ 836 $ 597 $ 466 56 $ 239 40 Energy Costs $ 675 $ 322 $ 103 $ 353 N/A $ 219 N/A Operation and Maintenance $ 215 $ 171 $ 124 $ 44 26 $ 47 38 Depreciation and Amortization $ 46 $ 44 $ 38 $ 2 5 $ 6 16 Income from Equity Method Investments $ 131 $ 126 $ 114 $ 5 4 $ 12 11 Other Income $ 10 $ 7 $ 26 $ 3 43 $ (19 ) (73 ) Other Deductions $ (25 ) $ (10 ) $ (9 ) $ 15 N/A $ 1 11 Interest Expense $ (213 ) $ (223 ) $ (214 ) $ (10 ) (4 ) $ 9 4 Income Tax Expense $ (69 ) $ (46 ) $ (58 ) $ 23 50 $ (12 ) (21 ) Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, including Gain (Loss) on Disposal $ 18 $ (10 ) $ (38 ) $ 28 N/A $ (28 ) (74 ) The variances in Operating Revenues, Energy Costs, Operation and Maintenance, Depreciation and Amortization and Income from Equity Method Investments were primarily attributed to Globals acquisition of the remaining interests in TIE, thus consolidating the entity effective July 1, 2004, increased revenues at TIE in the second half of 2005 compared to same period in 2004 due to a stronger market and stronger spark spread (the difference between the market price of electricity and the cost of natural gas fuel) and Globals sale of a 35% interest in Dhofar Power Company S.A.O.C. (Dhofar Power) through a public offering on the Omani Stock Exchange in April 2005, reducing its ownership interest to 46% and thus accounting for the investment under the equity method of accounting following the sale. The variances are also related to favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher energy sales volumes at Sociedad Austral de Electricidad S.A. (SAESA) and a change for GWF Energy LLC (GWF Energy), which owns three generation facilities in California, which was accounted for under the equity method of accounting in 2004, due to a change in ownership interest, as compared to the first nine months of 2003 when GWF Energy was 69 consolidated. For additional information, see Note 4. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions and Acquisitions of the Notes. Operating Revenues The increase of $466 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the same period in 2004, was due to higher revenues at Global of $406 million, including a $279 million increase related to the consolidation of TIE commencing July 1, 2004 and $136 million due to higher revenues at TIE in the second half of 2005 and a $62 million increase related to SAESA due to higher energy sales volumes offset by a $43 million decrease related to the deconsolidation of Dhofar Power and the absence of a $35 million gain on the sale of MPC in 2004. Also contributing to the increase were higher revenues at Resources of $60 million primarily due to a $71 million pre tax gain recognized in 2005 for the sale of its interest in Seminole offset by the absence of an $11 million pre tax charge recorded due to the termination of the lease investment in the Collins generating facility in 2004. The increase of $239 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, was due to higher revenues at Global of $290 million, including a $247 million increase related to the consolidation of TIE, a $35 million increase from SAESA, a $25 million increase from Dhofar Power and a $35 million gain on the sale of MPC, partially offset by a decrease of $53 million related to GWF Energy, which was not consolidated in 2004. Offsetting the increases at Global were lower revenues at Resources of $51 million, primarily due to a loss of $31 million related to the recalculation of certain leverage leases, a loss of $11 million due to the termination of the lease investment in the Collins generating facility and normal amortization of existing leases of $10 million offset by a realized gain of $2 million related to investments in leases, partnerships and securities. See Note 8. Long Term Investments of the Notes for additional information. Energy Costs The increase of $353 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the same period in 2004, was primarily due to a $219 million increase related to the consolidation of TIE commencing July 1, 2004, a $99 million increase in energy costs at TIE in the second half of 2005 and a $44 million increase related to SAESA due to significant increases in energy costs, offset by a $13 million decrease related to the deconsolidation of Dhofar Power. The increase of $219 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, was primarily due to a $192 million increase related to the consolidation of TIE and increases of $22 million and $5 million from SAESA and Dhofar Power, respectively, offset by a decrease of $3 million from GWF Energy. Operation and Maintenance The increase of $44 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the same period in 2004, was primarily due to a $41 million increase related to the consolidation of TIE commencing July 1, 2004 and a $14 million increase related to SAESA offset by a $6 million decrease related to the deconsolidation of Dhofar Power and a $7 million decrease in energy costs at TIE in the second half of 2005. The increase of $47 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, was primarily due to a $30 million increase related to the consolidation of TIE and increases of $9 million and $2 million from SAESA and Dhofar Power, respectively, offset by a decrease of $8 million from GWF Energy. The increase is also due to higher operating expenses of $9 million at PSEG Energy Technologies Asset Management Company L.L.C. primarily due to higher legal expenses and final asset sale settlements and $5 million at Global primarily due to the 2003 reversal of contingencies related to the Argentine write down. Depreciation and Amortization The increase of $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the same period in 2004, was primarily due to an $8 million increase related to the consolidation of TIE commencing July 1, 2004 and a $2 million increase related to Resources due to the conversion of the Delta and Northwest leases from 70 leveraged lease to operating lease offset by a $9 million decrease related to the deconsolidation of Dhofar Power. The increase of $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, was primarily due to a $9 million increase related to the consolidation of TIE and increases of $5 million and $2 million from Dhofar Power and SAESA, respectively, offset by a decrease of $11 million from GWF Energy. Income from Equity Method Investments The increase of $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the same period in 2004, was primarily due to a $20 million increase due to stronger results in South America (RGE and Chilquinta) offset by an $11 million decrease related to the loss of earnings associated with the sale of Globals equity interest in MPC in December 2004 and a $3 million decrease related to Globals investment in Prisma. The increase of $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, was primarily driven by an $8 million increase related to the sale of a portion of Globals investment in Luz del Sur (LDS), an $11 million increase related to MPC due to additional projects going into operation, and a $4 million increase related to GWF Energy, offset by an $11 million decrease related to the consolidation of TIE commencing July 1, 2004. Other Income The increase of $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the same period in 2004, was primarily due to interest income from PSEG related to intercompany loans. The decrease of $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, was primarily due to the absence in 2004 of foreign currency transaction gains of $15 million for RGE and SAESA that occurred in 2003. Other Deductions The $15 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the same period in 2004, was primarily due to a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $7 million and foreign currency transaction losses of $9 million primarily on notes receivables from Prisma. Interest Expense The $10 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2005, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2004, was primarily due an $11 million decrease related to the deconsolidation of Dhofar Power and an $8 million decrease related to Resources due to a reduction in intercompany interest charges offset by a $9 million increase related to the consolidation of TIE commencing on July 1, 2004. The increase of $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, was due to a $13 million increase related to the consolidation of TIE commencing on July 1, 2004, and an increase in non recourse debt at the project level with higher interest rates, offset in part by the repayment of lower interest rate debt at Energy Holdings during 2003 and 2004. Income Taxes The $23 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the same period in 2004, was primarily due to the recording of $11 million of U.S. tax associated with repatriation of funds under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, an increase in the mix of domestic earnings for Global due to improved results at TIE, taxes recognized of $28 million from the sale of Seminole, and additional benefits resulting from revisions to Resources lease runs performed in the fourth quarter of 2005. For further information on lease runs, see below. The decrease of $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, was primarily due to lower pre tax income and the impact of changes in certain lease forecast assumptions. In the fourth quarter of 2004, Resources revised several of its lease runs and recorded additional benefits of state tax losses generated by certain of its leases. These additional benefits resulted from changes 71 in Resources forecast of state taxable income and tax liability over the relevant lease terms. This forecast was embedded in the lease reruns and led to an income tax benefit of $43 million in 2004 to reflect the cumulative benefit of this adjustment. This benefit was largely offset by the tax impact associated with a $31 million decrease in leveraged lease revenue. Future earnings will also increase by a modest amount as a result of this forecasted benefit. If Resources affiliates taxable earnings decreased significantly, resulting in the inability of Resources to record the benefits related to its taxable losses, it could lead to an adverse material impact to Resources results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Note 15. Income Taxes of the Notes for additional information. Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, including Gain (Loss) on Disposal, net of tax Elcho and Skawina In January 2006, Energy Holdings entered into an agreement to sell its interest in two coal fired plants in Poland, Elcho and Skawina. Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations related to Elcho and Skawina for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $18 million, $(15) million and $6 million, respectively. See Note 4. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions and Acquisitions of the Notes for additional information. CPC In May 2004, Global completed the sale of its interest in CPC for approximately $43 million in cash and recognized a gain on disposal of $5 million after tax. Loss from Discontinued Operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $24 million including a $23 million estimated loss on disposal for the write down of CPC to its fair value less cost to sell. See Note 4. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions and Acquisitions of the Notes for additional information. Energy Technologies In September 2003, Energy Holdings completed the sale of the remaining companies of Energy Technologies subsequent to recognizing a loss of $9 million, after tax, in the first quarter of 2003. Loss from Discontinued Operations for year ended December 31, 2003 was $11 million. See Note 4. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions and Acquisitions of the Notes for additional information. Other To supplement the Consolidated Financial Statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP), PSEG and Energy Holdings use the non GAAP measure of Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT). PSEGs and Energy Holdings Management each reviews EBIT internally to evaluate performance and manage operations and believes that the inclusion of this non GAAP financial measure provides consistent and comparable measures to help shareholders understand current and future operating results. PSEG and Energy Holdings urge shareholders to carefully review the GAAP financial information included as part of this Annual Report. 72 Global The following table summarizes Globals Capital at Risk, net contributions to EBIT and Non Recourse Interest in the following regions as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 and for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

(B) For investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting, includes Globals share of net earnings, including Interest Expense and Income Taxes. (C) Non Recourse Interest is Interest Expense on debt that is non recourse to Global. (D) The Total Capital at Risk includes amounts relating to Elcho and Skawina as the sale has not been completed and therefore there is still Capital at Risk in Poland. EBIT and Non Recourse Interest exclude amounts relating to Elcho and Skawina. EBIT was $56 million, $18 million and $15 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Non Recourse Interest was $36 million, $33 million and $5 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. See Note 4. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions and Acquisitions of the Notes. (E) The differences in EBIT for Asia Pacific and Income Taxes are primarily due to the sale of MPC, which closed on December 31, 2004, partially offset by higher taxes for repatriation. See Note 4. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions and Acquisitions of the Notes. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following discussion of liquidity and capital resources is on a consolidated basis for PSEG, noting the uses and contributions of PSEGs three direct operating subsidiaries, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings. Financing Methodology PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings Capital requirements for PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings are met through liquidity provided by internally generated cash flow and external financings. PSEG expects to be able to fund existing commitments, reduce debt and meet dividend requirements using internally generated cash. PSEG, Power and Energy Holdings from time to time make equity contributions or otherwise provide credit support to their respective direct and indirect subsidiaries to provide for part of their capital and cash requirements, 73 generally relating to long term investments. PSEG does not intend to contribute additional equity to Energy Holdings. At times, PSEG utilizes intercompany dividends and intercompany loans (except however, that PSE&G may not, without prior BPU approval, make loans to its parent or its affiliates) to satisfy various subsidiary or parental needs and efficiently manage short term cash. Any excess funds are invested in short term liquid investments. External funding to meet PSEGs, PSE&Gs and Powers needs and a majority portion of the requirements of Energy Holdings consist of corporate finance transactions. The debt incurred is the direct obligation of those respective entities. Some of the proceeds of these debt transactions may be used by the respective obligor to make equity investments in its subsidiaries. As discussed below, depending on the particular company, external financing may consist of public and private capital market debt and equity transactions, bank revolving credit and term loans, commercial paper and or project financings. Some of these transactions involve special purpose entities (SPEs), formed in accordance with applicable tax and legal requirements in order to achieve specified financial advantages, such as favorable legal liability treatment. PSEG consolidates SPEs, as applicable, in accordance with FIN No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) (FIN 46). See Note 2. Recent Accounting Standards of the Notes. The availability and cost of external capital is affected by each entitys performance, as well as by the performance of their respective subsidiaries and affiliates. This could include the degree of structural separation between PSEG and its subsidiaries and the potential impact of affiliate ratings on consolidated and unconsolidated credit quality. Additionally, compliance with applicable financial covenants will depend upon future financial position, earnings and net cash flows, as to which no assurances can be given. Over the next several years, PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings may be required to extinguish or refinance maturing debt and, to the extent there is not sufficient internally generated funds, may incur additional debt and or provide equity to fund investment activities. Any inability to obtain required additional external capital or to extend or replace maturing debt and or existing agreements at current levels and reasonable interest rates may adversely affect PSEGs, PSE&Gs, Powers and Energy Holdings respective financial condition, results of operations and net cash flows. From time to time, PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings may repurchase portions of their respective debt securities using funds from operations, asset sales, commercial paper, debt issuances, equity issuances and other sources of funding and may make exchanges of new securities, including common stock, for outstanding securities. Such repurchases may be at variable prices below, at or above prevailing market prices and may be conducted by way of privately negotiated transactions, open market purchases, tender or exchange offers or other means. PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings may utilize brokers or dealers or effect such repurchases directly. Any such repurchases may be commenced or discontinued at any time without notice. It is expected that, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, PSEG will be consolidated into Exelon and Power into Exelon Generation and all debt outstanding at PSEG and Power will be assumed by the respective new entities. PSE&G and Energy Holdings expect their respective securities will continue to remain outstanding. Energy Holdings A portion of the financing for Globals investments is normally provided by non recourse financing transactions. These consist of loans from banks and other lenders that are typically secured by project assets and cash flows. Non recourse transactions generally impose no material obligation on the parent level investor to repay any debt incurred by the project borrower. The consequences of permitting a project level default include the potential for loss of any invested equity by the parent. However, in some cases, certain obligations relating to the investment being financed, including additional equity commitments, may be guaranteed by Global and or Energy Holdings for their respective subsidiaries. PSEG does not provide guarantees or credit support to Energy Holdings or its subsidiaries. 74 Operating Cash Flows PSEG For the year ended December 31, 2005, PSEGs operating cash flow decreased by approximately $666 million from $1.6 billion to $940 million, as compared to the same period in 2004, primarily due to net decreases at Power for its working capital requirements, discussed below. For the year ended December 31, 2004, PSEGs operating cash flow increased by approximately $112 million from $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, as compared to the same period in 2003, due to net increases from its subsidiaries as discussed below. PSE&G PSE&Gs operating cash flow decreased approximately $7 million from $696 million to $689 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the same period in 2004. PSE&Gs operating cash flow increased approximately $92 million from $604 million to $696 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003 primarily due to higher Net Income related to the increase in electric base rates, additional regulatory recoveries and lower benefit plan contributions. Power Powers operating cash flow decreased approximately $371 million from $507 million to $136 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the same period in 2004 primarily due to increased margin requirements and an increase in fuel inventory because of significantly increased commodity prices. Powers operating cash flow decreased approximately $129 million from $636 million to $507 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003 due to a decrease in Income from Continuing Operations of $166 million, primarily due to lower sales volumes and higher replacement power and maintenance costs combined with the loss of MTC revenues which ended August 1, 2003 offset by activity in the NDT Funds. Energy Holdings Energy Holdings operating cash flow decreased approximately $160 million from $403 million to $243 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the same period in 2004, due primarily to a decrease in Resources cash flows, which was driven by the timing of receipt of tax benefits, and the monetization of the remaining receivables of PSEG Energy Technologies Asset Management Company LLC (PETAMC) in 2004. Energy Holdings operating cash flow increased approximately $114 million from $289 million to $403 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, due primarily to a tax payment made in 2003 related to two terminated leveraged lease transactions in 2002 and sales of certain investments in the KKR leveraged buyout fund in 2004. PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings For the year ended December 31, 2005, PSEGs cash from operations, excluding changes in working capital, was approximately $1.6 billion, which was generally consistent with the prior year. Higher commodity prices are expected to provide meaningful growth for Power, but result in increased working capital requirements in the form of cash collateral postings and fuel purchases. In the near term, these factors were the primary contributor to increased working capital requirements of more than $500 million at Power during 2005. Despite the increased working capital requirements, total excess cash available to pay down recourse debt was approximately $150 million in 2005. Excess cash flow available to pay down recourse debt consists of PSEGs operating cash flows, less investing activities and net dividends and adjusted for items such as securitization financings, securitization bond principal repayments, offshore cash activity and the impact of consolidation accounting at Energy Holdings. In 2005, excess cash available to pay down recourse debt was substantially supported by asset sales and lease terminations by Energy Holdings of approximately $400 million, repatriated pre 2005 offshore cash 75 balances of approximately $140 million, asset sales by Power of approximately $325 million and BGS securitization financing of $103 million. In the future, PSEG expects operating cash flows to be sufficient to fund the majority of capital requirements, dividend payments, reduce debt, and, long term, repurchase common stock. PSEG expects that cash generation will increase substantially during the business plan cycle as Powers net cash flows are expected to increase materially. Common Stock Dividends Dividend payments on common stock for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $2.24 per share and totaled approximately $541 million. Dividend payments on common stock for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $2.20 per share and totaled approximately $522 million. Future dividends declared will be dependent upon PSEGs future earnings, cash flows, financial requirements, alternative investment opportunities and other factors. On January 17, 2006, PSEG announced an increase in its dividend from $0.56 to $0.57 per share for the first quarter of 2006. This quarterly increase reflects an indicated annual dividend rate of $2.28 per share. Short Term Liquidity PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings As of December 31, 2005, PSEG and its subsidiaries had a total of approximately $3.7 billion of committed credit facilities with approximately $2.5 billion of available liquidity under these facilities. In addition, PSEG and PSE&G have access to certain uncommitted credit facilities. Neither company had any loans outstanding under these uncommitted facilities as of December 31, 2005. 76 Each of the facilities is restricted to availability and use to the specific companies as listed below. Company Expiration Date Total Facility Primary Purpose Usage as of December 31, 2005 Available Liquidity as of December 31, 2005 (Millions) PSEG: 4 year Credit Facility April 2008 $ 450 CP Support/ Funding/Letters of Credit $ &mdash; $ 450 5 year Credit Facility May 2010 $ 650 CP Support/ Funding/Letters of Credit $ &mdash; $ 650 Bilateral Term Loan(D) May 2006 $ 100 Funding $ 100 $ &mdash; Uncommitted Bilateral Agreement N/A N/A Funding $ &mdash; N/A PSE&G: 5 year Credit Facility June 2009 $ 600 CP Support/ Funding/Letters of Credit $ &mdash; $ 600 Uncommitted Bilateral Agreement N/A N/A Funding $ &mdash; N/A PSEG and Power:(A) 3 year Credit Facility April 2007 $ 600 CP Support/ Funding/Letters of Credit $ 262 (B) $ 338 Bilateral Credit Facility (D) April 2006 $ 100 Funding/Letters of Credit $ 100 (B) $ &mdash; Bilateral Credit Facility(D) June 2006 $ 100 Funding/Letters of Credit $ &mdash; $ 100 Bilateral Credit Facility(D) June 2006 $ 150 Funding/Letters of Credit $ 150 (B) $ &mdash; Bilateral Credit Facility(D) July 2006 $ 150 Funding/Letters of Credit $ &mdash; $ 150 Bilateral Credit Facility(D) July 2006 $ 100 Funding/Letters of Credit $ 100 (B) $ &mdash; Bilateral Credit Facility(D) Sept 2006 $ 100 Funding/Letters of Credit $ 100 (B) $ &mdash; Bilateral Credit Facility(D) Dec 2006 $ 50 Funding/Letters of Credit $ &mdash; $ 50 Bilateral Credit Facility(D) Dec 2006 $ 275 Letters of Credit $ 200 (B) $ 75 Power: Bilateral Credit Facility March 2010 $ 100 Funding/Letters of Credit $ 63 (B) $ 37 Energy Holdings: 5 year Credit Facility(C) June 2010 $ 150 Funding/Letters of Credit $ 58 (B) $ 92 (A) PSEG/Power co borrower facilities. (B) These amounts relate to letters of credit outstanding. (C) Energy Holdings/Global/Resources joint and several co borrowed facility. (D) Established during the fourth quarter of 2005. 77 PSEG and PSE&G PSEG and PSE&G believe they have sufficient liquidity to fund their respective short term cash needs. Power As of December 31, 2005, Power had borrowed $202 million from PSEG in the form of an intercompany loan. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the increase in commodity prices reduced available liquidity as market prices exceeded the prices of Powers contracts. In the next few years this is expected to improve Powers earnings and cash flows as it enters into new contracts at these higher prices. However, Power was required to post additional margin for sales contracts entered into in the normal course of business. Should commodity prices continue to rise, additional margin calls may be necessary relative to existing power sales contracts. As these contract obligations are fulfilled, liquidity requirements are reduced. During the fourth quarter of 2005, PSEG and Power established an additional $1.125 billion in bilateral credit agreements with various maturities (see table above). With the addition of these committed credit facilities, Power believes that it has sufficient liquidity to fund its short term cash needs. In addition, ER&T maintains agreements that require Power, as its guarantor under performance guarantees, to satisfy certain creditworthiness standards. Many of these agreements allow the counterparty to demand that ER&T provide additional performance assurance, generally in the form of a letter of credit or cash, in the event of a downgrade of Powers credit rating to below investment grade. While Power believes that a downgrade to below investment grade is unlikely, management believes that Power could meet collateral requirements with current credit facilities, including the new credit agreements listed above, and its ability to access additional sources of liquidity through bank lending and or capital market transactions. See Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of the Notes for further information. Energy Holdings As of December 31, 2005, Energy Holdings had loaned $409 million of excess cash to PSEG. In addition, Energy Holdings and its subsidiaries had $68 million in cash. See Note 2. Recent Accounting Standards of the Notes regarding repatriation of certain portions of these funds in October and December 2005. External Financings PSEG For the year ended December 31, 2005, PSEG issued approximately 1.2 million shares of its common stock under its Dividend Reinvestment Program and Employee Stock Purchase Plan for approximately $72 million. On August 8, 2005, the 6.25% trust preferred securities that were issued in November 2002 in connection with PSEGs Participating Units (PEPS) were remarketed. The PEPS consisted of a forward purchase contract for PSEG Common Stock and a trust preferred security. The remarketing reset the coupon on the trust preferred security to 5.381%, which will mature in November 2007. On November 16, 2005, PEPS investors used the proceeds from the remarketing for settling the forward purchase contract. Upon settlement, PSEG received cash proceeds of approximately $460 million and issued approximately 11.4 million shares of common stock. In September 2005, PSEG issued $375 million of floating rate senior unsecured debt due in 2008, callable at par after one year. The proceeds were used to redeem PSEGs subordinated debt underlying $225 million of Enterprise Capital Trust I, 7.44% Series A and $150 million of Enterprise Capital Trust III, 7.25% Series C Preferred Securities in October 2005. On December 30, 2005, PSEG called at par the subordinated debt underlying $150 million of Enterprise Capital Trust II, Floating Rate Securities, Series B to be redeemed on February 27, 2006 using short term debt. 78 PSE&G In September 2005, PSE&G Transition Funding II LLC (Transition Funding II) issued approximately $103 million of its Transition Bonds, Series 2005 1, in four classes. Proceeds were used to purchase from PSE&G the rights to collect a transition bond charge from electric customers pursuant to a BPU order. PSE&G used those proceeds to reduce short term debt. In July 2005, PSE&G issued $250 million of its 5.25% Secured Medium Term Notes Series D due 2035. The proceeds were used to redeem $125 million of PSE&Gs First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds, 9.125% Series BB due July 2005 and to reduce short term debt. For the year ended December 31, 2005, PSE&G Transition Funding LLC (Transition Funding) repaid approximately $146 million of its transition bonds. Energy Holdings During 2005, Energy Holdings made cash distributions to PSEG totaling $412 million, including a $100 million return of capital in February 2005, a $184 million preference unit redemption in May 2005, a $125 million dividend in December 2005 and $3 million of preference unit distributions. In December 2005, Energy Holdings called for redemption in January 2006, all of its $309 million outstanding 7.75% Senior Notes due 2007. The notes were redeemed in January 2006 at the make whole price specified in the indenture utilizing proceeds from the sale of its interest in Seminole together with other funds. Energy Holdings had non recourse debt outstanding at TIE at December 31, 2005 of $202 million and $210 million related to Guadalupe and Odessa, respectively, each with an all in interest rate of 6.31% through the first quarter of 2006. In October 2004, the maturity of the Guadalupe debt was extended to December 31, 2009 and a similar extension was executed relative to the Odessa debt on February 17, 2006. Interest on each of the Guadalupe debt and the Odessa debt is based on a spread (currently 1.75%) above Libor. In April 2006, 80% of the scheduled outstanding principal of the Guadalupe debt will become subject to swaps that convert floating rate LIBOR to a weighted average fixed rate of 4.518%. Debt Covenants PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings PSEGs, PSE&Gs, Powers and Energy Holdings respective credit agreements generally contain customary provisions under which the lenders could refuse to advance loans in the event of a material adverse change in the borrowers business or financial condition. As explained in more detail below, these credit agreements may also contain maximum debt to equity ratios, minimum cash flow tests and other restrictive covenants and conditions to borrowing. Compliance with applicable financial covenants will depend upon the respective future financial position, level of earnings and cash flows of PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings, as to which no assurances can be given. The ratios presented below are for the benefit of the investors of the related securities to which the covenants apply. They are not intended as a financial performance or liquidity measure. The debt underlying the preferred securities of PSEG, which is presented in Long Term Debt in accordance with FIN 46 is not included as debt when calculating these ratios, as provided for in the various credit agreements. As discussed previously, the rise in commodity prices has increased margin requirements and has resulted in increased OCL, which reduces total equity. This has resulted in increases to the debt to capitalization ratios at PSEG and Power. PSEG Financial covenants contained in PSEGs credit facilities include a ratio of debt (excluding non recourse project financings, securitization debt and debt underlying preferred securities and including commercial paper and loans, certain letters of credit and similar instruments) to total capitalization (including preferred securities outstanding) covenant. This covenant requires that at the end of any quarterly financial period, such ratio not be more than 70.0%. As of December 31, 2005, PSEGs ratio of debt to capitalization (as defined above) was 59.9%. 79 PSE&G Financial covenants contained in PSE&Gs credit facilities include a ratio of long term debt (excluding securitization debt and long term debt maturing within one year) to total capitalization covenant. This covenant requires that at the end of any quarterly financial period, such ratio will not be more than 65.0%. As of December 31, 2005, PSE&Gs ratio of long term debt to total capitalization (as defined above) was 47.9%. In addition, under its First and Refunding Mortgage (Mortgage), PSE&G may issue new First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds against previous additions and improvements, provided that its ratio of earnings to fixed charges calculated in accordance with its Mortgage is at least 2 to 1, and or against retired Mortgage Bonds. As of December 31, 2005, PSE&Gs Mortgage coverage ratio was 4.8 to 1 and the Mortgage would permit up to approximately $1.7 billion aggregate principal amount of new Mortgage Bonds to be issued against previous additions and improvements. PSEG and Power Financial covenants contained in the PSEG/Power joint and several credit facility include a ratio of debt to total capitalization for each specific borrower. This facility has a 70% debt to total capitalization covenant for PSEG (calculated as set forth above) and a 65% debt to total capitalization covenant for Power. The Power ratio is calculated as debt (including loans, certain letters of credit and similar instruments) to total capitalization, adjusted for the $986 million Basis Adjustment (see Consolidated Balance Sheets). This covenant requires that at the end of any quarterly financial period, such ratio will not exceed 65.0%. As of December 31, 2005, Powers ratio of debt to capitalization (as defined above) was 53.3%. Energy Holdings Energy Holdings entered into a $150 million five year bank revolving credit agreement in June 2005 with a covenant requiring the ratio of Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) to fixed charges to be greater than or equal to 1.75. This bank revolving credit agreement replaced a $200 million three year bank revolving credit agreement that was entered into in October 2003. As of December 31, 2005, Energy Holdings coverage of this covenant was 3.03. Additionally, Energy Holdings must maintain a ratio of net debt to EBITDA of less than 5.25. As of December 31, 2005, Energy Holdings ratio under this covenant was 3.09. Energy Holdings is a co borrower under this facility with Global and Resources, which are joint and several obligors. The terms of the agreement include a pledge of Energy Holdings membership interest in Global, restrictions on the use of proceeds related to material sales of assets and the satisfaction of certain financial covenants. Net cash proceeds from asset sales in excess of 5% of total assets of Energy Holdings during any 12 month period must be used to repay any outstanding amounts under the credit agreement. Net cash proceeds from asset sales during any 12 month period in excess of 10% of total assets must be retained by Energy Holdings or used to repay the debt of Energy Holdings, Global or Resources. Cross Default Provisions PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings The PSEG credit agreements contain default provisions under which a default by it, PSE&G or Power in an aggregate amount of $50 million or greater would result in the potential acceleration of payment under those agreements. PSEG has removed Energy Holdings from all cross default provisions. PSEGs bank credit agreements and note purchase agreements (collectively, Credit Agreements) related to its private placement of debt contain cross default provisions under which certain payment defaults by PSE&G or Power, certain bankruptcy events relating to PSE&G or Power, the failure by PSE&G or Power to satisfy certain final judgments or the occurrence of certain events of default under the financing agreements of PSE&G or Power, would each constitute an event of default under the PSEG Credit Agreements. It is also an event of default under the PSEG Credit Agreements if PSE&G or Power ceases to be wholly owned by PSEG. 80 PSE&G PSE&Gs Mortgage has no cross defaults. The PSE&G Medium Term Note Indenture has a cross default to the PSE&G Mortgage. The credit agreements have cross defaults under which a default by PSE&G in the aggregate of $50 million or greater would result in an event of default and the potential acceleration of payment under the credit agreements. Power The Power Senior Debt Indenture contains a default provision under which a default by Power, Nuclear, Fossil or ER&T in an aggregate amount of $50 million or greater would result in an event of default and the potential acceleration of payment under the indenture. There are no cross defaults within Powers indenture from PSEG, Energy Holdings or PSE&G. Energy Holdings Energy Holdings Credit Agreement and Senior Note Indenture contain default provisions under which a default by it, Resources or Global in an aggregate amount of $25 million or greater would result in an event of default and the potential acceleration of payment under that agreement or the Indenture. Ratings Triggers PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings The debt indentures and credit agreements of PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings do not contain any material ratings triggers that would cause an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a ratings downgrade. However, in the event of a downgrade, any one or more of the affected companies may be subject to increased interest costs on certain bank debt and certain collateral requirements. PSE&G In accordance with the BPU approved requirements under the BGS contracts that PSE&G enters into with suppliers, PSE&G is required to maintain an investment grade credit rating. If PSE&G were to lose its investment grade rating, PSE&G would be required to file with the BPU a plan to assure continued payment for the BGS requirements of its customers. PSE&G is the servicer for the bonds issued by Transition Funding. If PSE&G were to lose its investment grade rating, PSE&G would be required to remit collected cash daily to the bond trustee. Currently, cash is remitted monthly. Power In connection with the management and optimization of Powers asset portfolio, ER&T maintains underlying agreements that require Power, as its guarantor under performance guarantees, to satisfy certain creditworthiness standards. In the event of a deterioration of Powers credit rating to below an investment grade rating, many of these agreements allow the counterparty to demand that ER&T provide performance assurance, generally in the form of a letter of credit or cash. As of December 31, 2005, if Power were to lose its investment grade rating and assuming all counterparties to agreements in which ER&T is out of the money were contractually entitled to demand, and demanded, performance assurance, ER&T could be required to post collateral in an amount equal to approximately $916 million. Providing this credit support would increase Powers costs of doing business and could restrict the ability of ER&T to manage and optimize Powers asset portfolio. See Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of the Notes. Credit Ratings PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings The current ratings of securities of PSEG and its subsidiaries are shown below and reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. Any downward revision or withdrawal may adversely affect the market price of PSEGs, PSE&Gs, Powers and Energy Holdings securities and serve to materially increase those companies 81 cost of capital and limit their access to capital. All ratings have a stable outlook unless otherwise noted. (N) denotes a negative outlook, (P) denotes a positive outlook and (WD) denotes a credit watch developing indicating that ratings could be raised or lowered. There is no assurance that the ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be revised by the rating agencies, if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant. Each rating given by an agency should be evaluated independently of the other agencies ratings. The ratings should not be construed as an indication to buy, hold or sell any security.

On December 20, 2004, in conjunction with the announcement of the Merger Agreement between PSEG and Exelon, all of the rating agencies reviewed their ratings and took the following actions: &bull; Moodys affirmed the ratings for PSEG, Power and Energy Holdings. Moodys revised its outlook to stable from negative for PSEG and Power. The outlook for PSE&G remained stable and the outlook for Energy Holdings remained negative. &bull; S&P placed its BBB Corporate Credit Rating for PSEG, Power and PSE&G on Credit Watch with developing implications. S&P indicated that, if not for the Merger, the corporate credit ratings assigned to PSEG and its subsidiaries, other than Energy Holdings, would have been lowered to BBB&ndash;with a negative outlook. S&P lowered its outlook for Energy Holdings to negative. &bull; Fitch affirmed its ratings for PSEG, Power, PSE&G and Energy Holdings. Fitch revised the outlook for PSEG and Power to positive from stable. The outlook for PSE&G remained stable and Energy Holdings remained negative. OCL PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings For the year ended December 31, 2005, PSEG, Power and Energy Holdings had Other Comprehensive Loss/(Income) of $337 million, $438 million and $(99) million, respectively, due primarily to net unrealized losses on derivatives accounted for as hedges in accordance with SFAS 133, unrealized gains and losses in the NDT Funds at Power and foreign currency translation adjustments at Energy Holdings. During the year ended December 31, 2005, Powers OCL has increased from $49 million to $487 million. The primary cause was an increase of approximately $410 million related to the change in market value, net of taxes, of energy and related contracts that qualify for hedge accounting that were entered into by Power in the normal course of business. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the increase in gas and electric prices has resulted in unrealized losses on many of those contracts, which are recorded in OCL as a reduction to equity. 82 CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings It is expected that the majority of each subsidiarys capital requirements over the next five years will come from internally generated funds. Projected construction and investment expenditures, excluding nuclear fuel purchases, for PSEGs subsidiaries for the next five years are presented in the table below. These amounts are subject to change, based on various factors, including the possible change in strategy of the combined company following the Merger. 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 (Millions) PSE&G: Facility Support $ 22 $ 17 $ 17 $ 11 $ 12 Environmental/Regulatory 46 28 25 26 26 Facility Replacement 197 195 207 221 203 System Reinforcement 165 170 146 139 145 New Business 156 155 161 168 172 Total PSE&G 586 565 556 565 558 Power: Non Recurring 247 283 209 147 145 Recurring 109 131 72 108 113 Total Power 356 414 281 255 258 Energy Holdings 53 28 21 19 22 Other 21 18 14 15 16 Total PSEG $ 1,016 $ 1,025 $ 872 $ 854 $ 854 PSE&G In 2005, PSE&G made approximately $498 million of capital expenditures, primarily for reliability of transmission and distribution systems. The $498 million does not include approximately $30 million spent on cost of removal. PSE&G projections for future capital expenditures include additions to its transmission and distribution systems to meet expected growth and to manage reliability and cost of removal expenditures. The current projections do not include investments required as a result of PJMs approval of the Regional Transmission Expansion Plan (RTEP) in December 2005. As project scope and cost estimates develop, PSE&G will modify its current projections to include these required investments. Power In 2005, Power made approximately $401 million of capital expenditures (excluding $75 million for nuclear fuel), primarily related to the BEC, the Linden station in New Jersey and various other projects at Nuclear and Fossil. The projections above do not include the costs, if any, for pollution control modifications for the Hudson unit or cost associated with cooling towers for Salem, if required. See Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities for additional information relating to such costs. Energy Holdings In 2005, Energy Holdings incurred approximately $38 million of capital expenditures, primarily related to capital projects at SAESA, Skawina and Dhofar Power. Energy Holdings capital needs in 2006 will be limited to fulfilling existing contractual and potential contingent commitments. The balance of the forecasted expenditures relates to capital requirements of consolidated subsidiaries, which will primarily be financed from internally generated cash flow within the projects and from local sources on a non recourse basis or limited discretionary investments by Energy Holdings. Such capital requirements include organic growth in SAESAs service territory, the Electroandes expansion project and other capital improvements at Globals consolidated subsidiaries. Construction on the Electroandes expansion project is expected to begin in the first half of 2006 with expected completion in 2007 at a total cost of $30 million. The project is expected to be financed by Electroandes with cash and non recourse debt. 83 Disclosures about Long Term Maturities, Contractual and Commercial Obligations and Certain Investments The following table reflects PSEGs and its subsidiaries contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments in the respective periods in which they are due. In addition, the table summarizes anticipated recourse and non recourse debt maturities for the years shown. The table below does not reflect debt maturities of Energy Holdings non consolidated investments. If those obligations were not able to be refinanced by the project, Energy Holdings may elect to make additional contributions in these investments. For additional information, see Note 10.

See Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of the Notes for further discussion. PSEG and Energy Holdings Global has certain investments that are accounted for under the equity method in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, amounts recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for such investments represent Globals equity investment, which is increased for Globals pro rata share of earnings less any dividend distribution from such investments. The companies in which Global invests that are accounted for under the equity method have an aggregate $1.3 billion of debt on their combined, consolidated financial statements. PSEGs pro rata share of such debt is $577 million. This debt is non recourse to PSEG, Energy Holdings and Global. PSEG is generally not required to support the debt service obligations of these companies. However, default with respect to this non recourse debt could result in a loss of invested equity. Resources has investments in leveraged leases that are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases. Leveraged lease investments generally involve three parties: an owner/lessor, a creditor and a lessee. In a typical leveraged lease financing, the lessor purchases an asset to be leased. The purchase price is typically financed 80% with debt provided by the creditor and the balance comes from equity funds provided by the lessor. The creditor provides long term financing to the transaction secured by the property subject to the lease. Such long term financing is non recourse to the lessor and is not presented on Energy Holdings Consolidated Balance Sheets. In the event of default, the leased asset, and in some cases the lessee, secure the loan. As a lessor, Resources has ownership rights to the property and rents the property to the lessees for use in their business operation. As of December 31, 2005, Resources equity investment in leased assets was approximately $987 million, net of deferred taxes of approximately $1.7 billion. For additional information, see Note 8. Long Term Investments of the Notes. In the event that collectibility of the minimum lease payments to be received by the lessor is no longer reasonably assured, the accounting treatment for some of the leases may change. In such cases, Resources may deem that a lessee has a high probability of defaulting on the lease obligation, and would reclassify the lease from a leveraged lease to an operating lease. Should Resources ever directly assume a debt obligation, the fair value of the underlying asset and the associated debt would be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets instead of the net equity investment in the lease. Energy Holdings has guaranteed certain obligations of its subsidiaries or affiliates related to certain projects. See Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of the Notes for additional information. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings Under GAAP, many accounting standards require the use of estimates, variable inputs and assumptions (collectively referred to as estimates) that are subjective in nature. Because of this, differences between the actual measure realized versus the estimate can have a material impact on results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The managements of PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings have each determined that the following estimates are considered critical to the application of rules that relate to their respective businesses. Accounting for Pensions PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings account for pensions under SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS 87). Pension costs under SFAS 87 are calculated using various economic and demographic assumptions. Economic assumptions include the discount rate and the long term rate of return on trust assets. Demographic assumptions include projections of future mortality rates, pay increases and retirement patterns. In 2005, PSEG and its subsidiaries recorded pension expense of $109 million, compared to $102 million in 2004 and $147 million in 2003. Additionally, in 2005, PSEG and its respective subsidiaries contributed cash of approximately $155 million, compared to cash contributions of $96 million in 2004 and $211 million in 2003. 85 PSEGs discount rate assumption, which is determined annually, is based on the rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits. The discount rate used to calculate pension obligations is determined as of December 31 each year, PSEGs SFAS 87 measurement date. The discount rate used to determine year end obligations is also used to develop the following years net periodic pension cost. The discount rates used in PSEGs 2004 and 2005 net periodic pension costs were 6.25% and 6.00%, respectively. PSEGs 2006 net periodic pension cost was developed using a discount rate of 5.75%. PSEGs expected rate of return on plan assets reflects current asset allocations, historical long term investment performance and an estimate of future long term returns by asset class using input from PSEGs actuary and investment advisors, as well as long term inflation assumptions. For 2004 and 2005, PSEG assumed a rate of return of 8.75% on PSEGs pension plan assets. For 2006, PSEG will continue the rate of return assumption of 8.75%. Based on the above assumptions, PSEG has estimated net period pension costs of approximately $93 million and contributions of up to approximately $100 million in 2006. As part of the business planning process, PSEG has modeled its future costs assuming an 8.75% rate of return and a 5.75% discount rate for 2007 and beyond. Actual future pension expense and funding levels will depend on future investment performance, changes in discount rates, market conditions, funding levels relative to PSEGs projected benefit obligation and accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) and various other factors related to the populations participating in PSEGs pension plans. The following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in certain actuarial assumptions. The effects of the assumption changes shown below solely reflect the impact of that specific assumption. Actuarial Assumption Current Change/ (Decrease) As of December 31, 2005 Impact on Pension Benefit Obligation Increase to Pension Expense in 2006 (Millions) Discount Rate 5.75% (1% ) $ 560 $ 54 Rate of Return on Plan Assets 8.75% (1% ) $ &mdash; $ 31 Accounting for Deferred Taxes PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings provide for income taxes based on the liability method required by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, as well as net operating loss and credit carryforwards. PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings evaluate the need for a valuation allowance against their respective deferred tax assets based on the likelihood of expected future taxable income. PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings do not believe a valuation allowance is necessary; however, if the expected level of future taxable income changes or certain tax planning strategies become unavailable, PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings would record a valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period the valuation allowance is deemed necessary. Resources and Globals ability to realize their deferred tax assets are dependent on PSEGs subsidiaries ability to generate ordinary income and capital gains. Hedge and MTM Accounting SFAS 133 requires an entity to recognize the fair value of derivative instruments held as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. SFAS 133 applies to all derivative instruments held by PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings. The fair value of most derivative instruments is determined by reference to quoted market prices, listed contracts, or quotations from brokers. Some of these derivative contracts are long term and rely on forward price quotations over the entire duration of the derivative contracts. In the absence of the pricing sources listed above, for a small number of contracts, PSEG and its subsidiary companies utilize mathematical models that rely on historical data to develop forward pricing information in the determination of fair value. Because the determination of fair value using such models is subject to significant assumptions and estimates, PSEG and its subsidiary companies developed reserve 86 policies that are consistently applied to model generated results to determine reasonable estimates of value to record in the financial statements. PSEG and its subsidiaries have entered into various derivative instruments in order to hedge exposure to commodity price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. Many such instruments have been designated as cash flow hedges. For a cash flow hedge, the change in the value of a derivative instrument is measured against the offsetting change in the value of the underlying contract or business condition the derivative instrument is intended to hedge. This is known as the measure of derivative effectiveness. In accordance with SFAS 133, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is reported in OCL, net of tax, or as a Regulatory Asset (Liability). Amounts in OCL are ultimately recognized in earnings when the related hedged forecasted transaction occurs. During periods of extreme price volatility, there will be significant changes in the value recorded in OCL. The changes in the fair value of the ineffective portions of derivative instrument designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in earnings. For Power and Holdings wholesale energy businesses, many of the forward sale, forward purchase and other option contracts are derivative instruments that hedge commodity price risk, but for which the businesses are not able to apply the hedge accounting guidance in SFAS 133. The changes in value of such derivative contracts are marked to market through earnings as commodity prices fluctuate. As a result, the earnings of PSEG, Power and Holdings may experience significant fluctuations depending on the volatility of commodity prices. For Powers energy trading activities, all changes in the fair value of energy trading derivative contracts are recorded in earnings.

PSE&G Unbilled Revenues Electric and gas revenues are recorded based on services rendered to customers during each accounting period. PSE&G records unbilled revenues for the estimated amount customers will be billed for services rendered from the time meters were last read to the end of the respective accounting period. Unbilled usage is calculated in two steps. The initial step is to apply a base usage per day to the number of unbilled days in the period. The second step estimates seasonal loads based upon the time of year and the variance of actual degree days and temperature humidity index hours of the unbilled period from expected norms. The resulting usage is priced at current rate levels and recorded as revenue. A calculation of the associated energy cost for the unbilled usage is recorded as well. Each month the prior months unbilled amounts are reversed and the current months amounts are accrued. Using benchmarks other than those used in this calculation could have a material effect on the amounts accrued in a reporting period. The resulting revenue and expense reflect the service rendered in the calendar month. PSE&G and Energy Holdings SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (SFAS 71) PSE&G and certain of Globals investments prepare their respective Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 71, which differs in certain respects from the application of GAAP by non regulated businesses. In general, SFAS 71 recognizes that accounting for rate regulated enterprises should reflect the economic effects of regulation. As a result, a regulated utility is required to defer the recognition of costs (a regulatory asset) or recognize obligations (a regulatory liability) if it is probable that, through the rate making process, there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in future rates. Accordingly, PSE&G and Global have deferred certain costs, which will be amortized over various future periods. To the extent that collection of such costs or payment of liabilities is no longer probable as a result of changes in regulation and or PSE&Gs and Globals competitive position, the associated regulatory asset or liability is charged or credited to income. See Note 5. Regulatory Matters of the Notes for additional information related to these and other regulatory issues. 87 Power NDT Funds Power accounts for the assets in the NDT Funds under SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities (SFAS 115). The assets in the NDT Funds are classified as available for sale securities and are marked to market with unrealized gains and losses recorded in OCL. Realized gains, losses and dividend and interest income are recorded on Powers and PSEGs Statements of Operations under Other Income and Other Deductions. Unrealized losses that are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired, as defined under SFAS 115, and related interpretive guidance, are charged against earnings rather than OCL. Factors, such as the length of time and extent to which the fair value is below carrying value, the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer or industry is experiencing significant financial difficulties and Powers intent and ability to continue to hold securities, are used as indicators of the prospects of the securities to recover their value. Power and Energy Holdings Accounting for Goodwill SFAS 142 requires an entity to evaluate its goodwill for impairment at least annually or when indications of impairment exist. An impairment may exist when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Accounting estimates related to goodwill fair value are highly susceptible to change from period to period because they require management to make cash flow assumptions about future sales, operating costs, economic conditions and discount rates over an indefinite life. The impact of recognizing an impairment could have a material impact on financial position and results of operations. Power and Energy Holdings perform annual goodwill impairment tests and continuously monitor the business environment in which they operate for any impairment issues that may arise. As indicated above, certain assumptions are used to arrive at a fair value for goodwill testing. Such assumptions are consistently employed and include, but are not limited to, free cash flow projections, interest rates, tariff adjustments, economic conditions prevalent in the geographic regions in which Power and Energy Holdings do business, local spot market prices for energy, foreign exchange rates and the credit worthiness of customers. If an adverse event were to occur, such an event could materially change the assumptions used to value goodwill and could result in impairments of goodwill. PSEG and Energy Holdings Foreign Currency Translation Energy Holdings financial statements are prepared using the U.S. Dollar as the reporting currency. In accordance with SFAS No. 52 Foreign Currency Translation, for foreign operations whose functional currency is deemed to be the local (foreign) currency, asset and liability accounts are translated into U.S. Dollars at current exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Translation gains and losses (net of applicable deferred taxes) are not included in determining Net Income but are reported in OCL. Gains and losses on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the results of operations as incurred. The determination of an entitys functional currency requires managements judgment. It is based on an assessment of the primary currency in which transactions in the local environment are conducted, and whether the local currency can be relied upon as a stable currency in which to conduct business. As economic and business conditions change, Energy Holdings is required to reassess the economic environment and determine the appropriate functional currency. The impact of foreign currency accounting could have a material adverse impact on Energy Holdings financial condition, results of operation and net cash flows. 88 ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings The market risk inherent in PSEGs, PSE&Gs, Powers and Energy Holdings market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity security prices and interest rates as discussed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Notes). It is the policy of each entity to use derivatives to manage risk consistent with its respective business plans and prudent practices. PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings have a Risk Management Committee (RMC) comprised of executive officers who utilize an independent risk oversight function to ensure compliance with corporate policies and prudent risk management practices. Additionally, PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings are exposed to counterparty credit losses in the event of non performance or non payment. PSEG has a credit management process, which is used to assess, monitor and mitigate counterparty exposure for PSEG and its subsidiaries. In the event of non performance or non payment by a major counterparty, there may be a material adverse impact on PSEG and its subsidiaries financial condition, results of operations or net cash flows. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk Energy Holdings Global is exposed to foreign currency risk and other foreign operations risk that arise from investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. A key component of this risk is that some of its foreign subsidiaries and affiliates utilize currencies other than the consolidated reporting currency, the U.S. Dollar. Additionally, certain of Globals foreign subsidiaries and affiliates have entered into monetary obligations and maintain receipts/receivables in U.S. Dollars or currencies other than their own functional currencies. Primarily, Global is exposed to changes in the U.S. Dollar to Brazilian Real, Euro, Peruvian Nuevo Sol and the Chilean Peso exchange rates. With respect to the foreign currency risk associated with the Brazilian Real, there has been significant devaluation since the initial acquisition of Globals investment in Rio Grande Energia S.A. (RGE), which has resulted in reduced U.S. Dollar earnings and cash flows relative to initial projections. However, there have been material improvements in a number of currencies during 2003, 2004, and 2005 against the U.S. Dollar, that have offset most of the loss incurred because of the devaluation of the Brazilian Real. Whenever possible, these subsidiaries and affiliates have attempted to limit potential foreign exchange exposure by entering into revenue contracts that adjust to changes in foreign exchange rates. Global also uses foreign currency forward, swap and option agreements, wherever possible, to manage risk related to certain foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2005, the devaluation of the Brazilian Real had resulted in a cumulative $216 million loss of value which is recorded as a $191 million after tax charge to OCL related to Globals equity method investments in RGE. An additional devaluation in the December 31, 2005 Brazilian Real to U.S. Dollar exchange rate of 10% would result in a $20 million change in the value of the investment in RGE and corresponding impact to OCL. If the December 31, 2005 Brazilian Real to U.S. Dollar exchange rate were to appreciate by 10%, it would result in a $24 million after tax increase in the value of the investment in RGE. Additionally, Global has approximately $60 million of Euro denominated receivables related to Globals equity method investments in Prisma which is subject to fluctuations in the U.S. Dollar to Euro exchange rate. If the December 31, 2005 Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate were to increase by 10%, Global would record approximately $7 million of foreign currency transaction losses. If the December 31, 2005 Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate were to decrease by 10%, Global would record approximately $5 million of foreign currency transaction gains. Global has various other foreign currency exposures related to translation adjustments. A devaluation of 10% in such foreign currencies would result in an aggregate after tax charge to OCL of $86 million. As of December 31, 2005, Energy Holdings net loss in OCL from currency fluctuations was approximately $20 million. 89 Commodity Contracts PSEG and Power The availability and price of energy commodities are subject to fluctuations from factors such as weather, environmental policies, changes in supply and demand, state and federal regulatory policies, market rules and other events. To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, Power enters into supply contracts and derivative contracts, including forwards, futures, swaps and options with approved counterparties. These contracts, in conjunction with demand obligations help reduce risk and optimize the value of owned electric generation capacity. Normal Operations and Hedging Activities Power enters into physical contracts, as well as financial contracts, including forwards, futures, swaps and options designed to reduce risk associated with volatile commodity prices. Commodity price risk is associated with market price movements resulting from market generation demand, changes in fuel costs and various other factors. Under SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of qualifying cash flow hedge transactions are recorded in OCL, and gains and losses are recognized in earnings when the underlying transaction occurs. Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that do not meet hedge criteria under SFAS 133 and the ineffective portion of hedge contracts are recognized in earnings currently. Additionally, changes in the fair value attributable to fair value hedges are similarly recognized in earnings. Many non trading contracts qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exemption under SFAS 133 and are accounted for upon settlement. Trading Power maintains a strategy of entering into trading positions to optimize the value of its portfolio of generation assets, gas supply contracts and its electric and gas supply obligations. Power engages in physical and financial transactions in the electricity wholesale markets and executes an overall risk management strategy to mitigate the effects of adverse movements in the fuel and electricity markets. In addition, Power has non asset based trading activities, which have significantly decreased. These contracts also involve financial transactions including swaps, options and futures. These activities are marked to market in accordance with SFAS 133 with gains and losses recognized in earnings. Value at Risk (VaR) Models Power Power uses VaR models to assess the market risk of its commodity businesses. The portfolio VaR model for Power includes its owned generation and physical contracts, as well as fixed price sales requirements, load requirements and financial derivative instruments. VaR represents the potential gains or losses, under normal market conditions, for instruments or portfolios due to changes in market factors, for a specified time period and confidence level. Power estimates VaR across its commodity businesses. Power manages its exposure at the portfolio level. Its portfolio consists of owned generation, load serving contracts (both gas and electric), fuel supply contracts and energy derivatives designed to manage the risk around generation and load. While Power manages its risk at the portfolio level, it also monitors separately the risk of its trading activities and its hedges. Non trading MTM VaR consists of MTM derivatives that are economic hedges, some of which qualify for hedge accounting. The MTM derivatives that are not hedges are included in the trading VaR. The VaR models used by Power are variance/covariance models adjusted for the delta of positions with a 95% one tailed confidence level and a one day holding period for the MTM trading and non trading activities and a 95% one tailed confidence level with a one week holding period for the portfolio VaR. The models assume no new positions throughout the holding periods, whereas Power actively manages its portfolio. 90 As of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, trading VaR was approximately $1 million and $2 million, respectively. For the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Trading VaR Non Trading MTM VaR (Millions) 95% Confidence Level, One Day Holding Period, One Tailed: Period End $ 1 $ 50 Average for the Period $ &mdash; $ 58 High $ 1 $ 84 Low $ &mdash; $ 44 99% Confidence Level, One Day Holding Period, Two Tailed: Period End $ 1 $ 78 Average for the Period $ 1 $ 91 High $ 2 $ 132 Low $ &mdash; $ 69 Interest Rates PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings are subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. It is the policy of PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings to manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floating rate debt, interest rate swaps and interest rate lock agreements. PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings manage their respective interest rate exposures by maintaining a targeted ratio of fixed and floating rate debt. As of December 31, 2005, a hypothetical 10% change in market interest rates would result in a $2 million, $4 million, $3 million and $1 million change in annual interest costs related to debt at PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2005, a hypothetical 10% change in market interest rates would result in a $6 million, $97 million, $114 million and $35 million change in the fair value of the debt of PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings, respectively. Debt and Equity Securities PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings PSEG has approximately $3.1 billion invested in its pension plans. Although fluctuations in market prices of securities within this portfolio do not directly affect PSEGs earnings in the current period, changes in the value of these investments could affect PSEGs future contributions to these plans, its financial position if its ABO under its pension plans exceeds the fair value of its pension funds and future earnings as PSEG could be required to adjust pension expense and its assumed rate of return. Power Powers NDT Funds are comprised of both fixed income and equity securities totaling $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2005. The fair value of equity securities is determined independently each month by the Trustee. As of December 31, 2005, the portfolio was comprised of approximately $682 million of equity securities and approximately $451 million in fixed income securities. The fair market value of the assets in the NDT Funds will fluctuate primarily depending upon the performance of equity markets. As of December 31, 2005, a hypothetical 10% change in the equity market would impact the value of the equity securities in the NDT Funds by approximately $68 million. Power uses duration to measure the interest rate sensitivity of the fixed income portfolio. Duration is a summary statistic of the effective average maturity of the fixed income portfolio. The benchmark for the fixed income component of the NDT Funds is the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which currently has a duration of 4.57 years and a yield of 5.08%. The portfolios value will appreciate or depreciate by the duration with a 1% change in interest rates. As of December 31, 2005, a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates would result in a decline in the market value for the fixed income portfolio of approximately $21 million. 91 Credit Risk PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings Credit risk relates to the risk of loss that PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings would incur as a result of non performance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings have established credit policies that they believe significantly minimize credit risk. These policies include an evaluation of potential counterparties financial condition (including credit rating), collateral requirements under certain circumstances and the use of standardized agreements, which may allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty. PSE&G BGS suppliers expose PSE&G to credit losses in the event of non performance or non payment upon a default of the BGS supplier. Credit requirements are governed under BPU approved BGS contracts. Power Counterparties expose Powers trading operation to credit losses in the event of non performance or non payment. Power has a credit management process, which is used to assess, monitor and mitigate counterparty exposure for Power and its subsidiaries. Powers counterparty credit limits are based on a scoring model that considers a variety of factors, including leverage, liquidity, profitability, credit ratings and risk management capabilities. Powers trading operations have entered into payment netting agreements or enabling agreements that allow for payment netting with the majority of its large counterparties, which reduce Powers exposure to counterparty risk by providing the offset of amounts payable to the counterparty against amounts receivable from the counterparty. In the event of non performance or non payment by a major counterparty, there may be a material adverse impact on Powers and its subsidiaries financial condition, results of operations or net cash flows. As of December 31, 2005, over 90% of the credit exposure (MTM plus net receivables and payables, less cash collateral) for Powers trading operations was with investment grade counterparties. The majority of the credit exposure with non investment grade counterparties was with certain companies that supply fuel (primarily coal) to Power. Therefore, this exposure relates to the risk of a counterparty performing under its obligations rather than payment risk. As of December 31, 2005, Powers trading operations had over 150 active counterparties. In February 2006, the BPU approved the results of the BGS auctions for New Jersey customers. Power will continue to be a direct supplier of New Jersey EDCs. Power believes that its obligations under these contracts are reasonably balanced by its available supply. Energy Holdings Global Global has credit risk with respect to its counterparties to power purchase agreements (PPAs) and other parties. Resources As of December 31, 2005, Resources has a remaining net investment in four leased aircraft of approximately $32 million. On September 14, 2005, Delta Airlines (Delta) and Northwest Airlines (Northwest), the lessees for Resources four remaining aircraft, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. This had no material effect on Energy Holdings as it continues to believe that it will be able to recover the recorded amount of its investments in these aircraft as of December 31, 2005. In 2004 and 2005, Resources successfully restructured the leases and converted the Delta and Northwest leases from leveraged leases to operating leases. Energy Holdings expects to recover its investment through cash flows from the operating leases. Resources has credit risk related to its investments in leveraged leases, totaling $987 million, which is net of deferred taxes of $1.7 billion, as of December 31, 2005. These investments are largely concentrated in the energy industry. As of December 31, 2005, 67% of counterparties in the lease portfolio were rated investment grade by both S&P and Moodys. 92 Resources is the lessor of domestic generating facilities in several U.S. energy markets. As a result of rating agency actions due to concerns over forward energy prices, the credit of some of the lessees was downgraded. Specifically, the lessees in the following transactions were downgraded below investment grade during 2002 by these rating agencies. Resources investment in such transactions was approximately $286 million, net of deferred taxes of $454 million as of December 31, 2005. Resources is the lessor of a generation facility to Reliant Energy Mid Atlantic Power Holdings LLC (REMA), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Reliant Resources Incorporated (RRI). The leased assets are the Keystone, Conemaugh and Shawville generating facilities located in the PJM West market in Pennsylvania. REMA is capitalized with over $1 billion of equity from RRI and has no debt obligations senior to the lease obligations. REMA is rated B+ by S&P and B1 by Moodys. As the lessor/equity participant in the lease, Resources is protected with significant lease covenants that restrict the flow of dividends from REMA to its parent, and by over collateralization of REMA with non leased assets, transfer of which is restricted by the financing documents. Restrictive covenants include historical and forward cash flow coverage tests that prohibit discretionary capital expenditures and dividend payments to the parent/lessee if stated minimum coverages are not met and similar cash flow restrictions if ratings are not maintained at stated levels. The covenants are designed to maintain cash reserves in the transaction entity for the benefit of the non recourse lenders and the lessor/equity participants in the event of a market downturn or degradation in operating performance of the leased assets. Resources investment in the REMA transaction was $98 million, net of deferred taxes of $173 million as of December 31, 2005. Resources is the lessor to the lease of the Powerton and Joliet power generating facilities operated by the lessee, Midwest Generation LLC (Midwest), an indirect subsidiary of Edison Mission Energy (EME). EME is the guarantor for the lease obligations. As of December 31, 2005, Resources lease investment in the Powerton and Joliet facilities was $51 million, net of taxes of $147 million. EMEs credit rating outlook is B with positive implications. Resources is the lessor of the Danskammer generation facility in New York to Dynegy Danskammer LLC (Danskammer) and the Roseton generation facility to Dynegy Roseton LLC (Roseton). Both Danskammer and Roseton are indirect subsidiaries of Dynegy Holdings Inc. (DHI). The lease obligations are guaranteed by DHI which is currently rated B by S&P and Caa2 by Moodys. Resources investment in Danskammer and Roseton was $112 million, net of deferred taxes of $112 million as of December 31, 2005. Resources is a lessor in a lease to the Midland Cogeneration Venture, LP (MCV) of a 1,500 MW natural gas fired cogeneration facility located in Midland, Michigan. The principal partners in the limited partnership, which leases the asset, are indirect subsidiaries of CMS Energy Corporation (CMS Energy) and El Paso Energy Corporation (El Paso). S&Ps rating of the stand alone credit quality of the facility is BB reflecting both CMS Energys and El Pasos credit deterioration, high fuel gas prices and a mismatch between coal based energy rates and the price of natural gas fuel supply. To meet these challenges, MCV actively manages and hedges its fuel purchases and has accumulated substantial cash reserves for bondholder protection. Additionally, the partnership has negotiated and received the Michigan Public Service Commissions approval for an operating agreement with Consumers Power to allow the facility to dispatch in a more economic manner, mitigating the fuel risk. Resources closely monitors this credit situation. The facility has been in commercial operation since 1990, successfully paying down a significant portion of its debt to date. Resources net investment in MCV was $25 million, net of deferred taxes of $22 million as of December 31, 2005. In any lease transaction, in the event of a default, Energy Holdings would exercise its rights and attempt to seek recovery of its investment. The results of such efforts may not be known for a period of time. A bankruptcy of a lessee and failure to recover adequate value could lead to a foreclosure of the lease. Under a worst case scenario, if a foreclosure were to occur, Resources would record a pre tax write off up to its gross investment, including deferred taxes, in these facilities. The investment balance increases as earnings are recognized and decreases as rental payments are received by the lessor. Also, in the event of a potential foreclosure, the net tax benefits generated by Resources portfolio of investments could be materially reduced in the period in which gains associated with the potential forgiveness of debt at these projects occurs. The amount and timing of any potential reduction in net tax benefits is dependent upon a number of factors including, but not limited to, the time of a potential foreclosure, the amount of lease debt outstanding, any cash trapped at the projects and negotiations during such potential foreclosure process. The potential loss of earnings, impairment and or tax payments could have a material impact to PSEGs and Energy Holdings financial position, results of operations and net cash flows. 93 As of December 31, 2005, lease payments on these facilities were current and Resources determined that the collectibility of the minimum lease payments under its leveraged lease investments is still reasonably probable and therefore continues to account for these investments as leveraged leases. Other Supplemental Information Regarding Market Risk Power The following table describes the drivers of Powers energy trading and marketing activities and Operating Revenues included in its Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2005. Normal operations and hedging activities represent the marketing of electricity available from Powers owned or contracted generation sold into the wholesale market. As the information in this table highlights, MTM activities represent a small portion of the total Operating Revenues for Power. Activities accounted for under the accrual method, including normal purchases and sales, account for the majority of the revenue. The MTM activities reported here are those relating to changes in fair value due to external movement in prices. For additional information, see Note 11. Risk Management of the Notes. Operating Revenues For the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Normal Operations and Hedging(A) Trading Total (Millions) MTM Activities: Unrealized MTM Gains (Losses) Changes in Fair Value of Open Positions $ 61 $ 3 $ 64 Origination Unrealized Gain at Inception &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; Changes in Valuation Techniques and Assumptions &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; Realization at Settlement of Contracts (75 ) (6 ) (81 ) Total Change in Unrealized Fair Value (14 ) (3 ) (17 ) Realized Net Settlement of Transactions Subject to MTM 75 6 81 Broker Fees and Other Related Expenses &mdash; (7 ) (7 ) Net MTM Gains 61 (4 ) 57 Accrual Activities: Accrual Activities&mdash;Revenue, Including Hedge Reclassifications 6,002 &mdash; 6,002 Total Operating Revenues $ 6,063 $ (4 ) $ 6,059 (A) Includes derivative contracts that Power enters into to hedge anticipated exposures related to its owned and contracted generation supply, all asset backed transactions (ABT) and hedging activities, but excludes owned and contracted generation assets. The following table indicates Powers energy trading assets and liabilities, as well as Powers hedging activity related to ABTs and derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133. This table presents amounts segregated by portfolio which are then netted for those counterparties with whom Power has the right to set off and therefore, are not necessarily indicative of amounts presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets since balances with many counterparties are subject to offset and are shown net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets regardless of the portfolio in which they are included. 94 Energy Contract Net Assets/Liabilities As of December 31, 2005 Normal Operations and Hedging Trading Total (Millions) MTM Energy Assets Current Assets $ 269 $ 149 $ 418 Noncurrent Assets 28 13 41 Total MTM Energy Assets $ 297 $ 162 $ 459 MTM Energy Liabilities Current Liabilities $ (502 ) $ (143 ) $ (645 ) Noncurrent Liabilities (598 ) (17 ) (615 ) Total MTM Energy Liabilities $ (1,100 ) $ (160 ) $ (1,260 ) Total MTM Energy Contract Net (Liabilities) Assets $ (803 ) $ 2 $ (801 ) The following table presents the maturity of net fair value of MTM energy trading contracts.

For contracts where no quoted market exists, modeling techniques were employed using assumptions reflective of current market rates, yield curves and forward prices as applicable to interpolate certain prices. The effect of using such modeling techniques is not material to Powers financial results. PSEG, Power and Energy Holdings The following table identifies losses on cash flow hedges that are currently in OCL, a separate component of equity. Power uses forward sale and purchase contracts, swaps and firm transmission rights contracts to hedge forecasted energy sales from its generation stations and its contracted supply obligations. Power also enters into swaps, options and futures transactions to hedge the price of fuel to meet its fuel purchase requirements for generation. PSEG, Power and Energy Holdings are subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. PSEGs policy is to manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and interest rate derivatives. The table also provides an estimate of the losses, net of taxes, that are expected to be reclassified out of OCL and into earnings over the next twelve months. Cash Flow Hedges Included in OCL As of December 31, 2005 Accumulated OCL Portion Expected to be Reclassified in next 12 months (Millions) Commodities $ (558 ) $ (218 ) Interest Rates (68 ) (17 ) Foreign Currency &mdash; &mdash; Net Cash Flow Hedge Loss Included in OCL $ (626 ) $ (235 ) 95 Power Credit Risk The following table provides information on Powers credit exposure, net of collateral, as of December 31, 2005. Credit exposure is defined as any positive results of netting accounts receivable/accounts payable and the forward value on open positions. It further delineates that exposure by the credit rating of the counterparties and provides guidance on the concentration of credit risk to individual counterparties and an indication of the maturity of a companys credit risk by credit rating of the counterparties.
