ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A) This combined MD&A is separately filed by Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (PSEG), Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G), PSEG Power LLC (Power) and PSEG Energy Holdings L.L.C. (Energy Holdings). Information contained herein relating to any individual company is filed by such company on its own behalf. PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings each make representations only as to itself and make no other representations whatsoever as to any other company. OVERVIEW OF 2006 AND FUTURE OUTLOOK PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings PSEGs business consists of four reportable segments, which are PSE&G, Power and the two direct subsidiaries of Energy Holdings: PSEG Global L.L.C. (Global) and PSEG Resources L.L.C. (Resources). The following discussion relates to the markets in which PSEGs subsidiaries compete, the corporate strategy for the conduct of PSEGs businesses within these markets and significant events that have occurred during 2006 and expectations for 2007 for PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings, as well as the key factors that will drive the future performance of these businesses. Termination of Merger Agreement On December 20, 2004, PSEG entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) with Exelon Corporation (Exelon) providing for a merger of PSEG with and into Exelon (Merger). On September 14, 2006, PSEG received from Exelon a formal notice terminating the Merger under the provisions of the Merger Agreement. PSE&G PSE&G operates as an electric and gas public utility in New Jersey under cost based regulation by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) for its distribution operations and by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for its electric transmission and wholesale sales operations. Consequently, the earnings of PSE&G are largely determined by the regulation of its rates by those agencies. In February 2007, the BPU approved the results of New Jerseys annual Basic Generation Service (BGS) Fixed Price (FP) and BGS Commercial and Industrial Energy Price (CIEP) auctions and PSE&G successfully secured contracts to provide the electricity requirements for the majority of its customers needs. Overview of 2006 During 2006 PSE&G: reached a settlement agreement in the Gas Base Rate Case with the BPU Staff, New Jersey Public Ratepayer Advocate (RPA) and other intervening parties which was approved by the BPU on November 9, 2006 and provides for an annual increase in gas revenues of $40 million, an adjustment to lower book depreciation expense for PSE&G by approximately $26 million annually and the amortization of accumulated cost of removal that will further reduce depreciation and amortization expense by $13 million annually for five years. reached a settlement agreement in the Electric Distribution Financial Review with the BPU Staff, RPA and other intervening parties concerning the excess depreciation rate credit which was approved by the BPU on November 9, 2006 and authorizes a reduction in the credit to $22 million, resulting in additional revenue to PSE&G of approximately $47 million annually based on current sales volumes. Future Outlook PSE&G believes that the decisions in November 2006 for both gas and electric base rates positions it to earn reasonable returns on investment in the future. The full year impact of these decisions combined with an anticipated return to more normal weather conditions is expected to improve PSE&Gs margins for 2007 and beyond. 54 The risks to PSE&Gs business generally relate to the treatment of the various rate and other issues by the state and federal regulatory agencies, specifically the BPU and FERC. PSE&Gs success will depend, in part, on its ability to attain a reasonable rate of return, continue cost containment initiatives, maintain system reliability and safety levels and continued recovery, with an adequate return, of the regulatory assets it has deferred and the investments it plans to make in its electric and gas transmission and distribution system. Since PSE&G earns no margin on the commodity portion of its electric and gas sales through tariff agreements, there is no anticipated commodity price volatility for PSE&G. Power Power is an electric generation and wholesale energy marketing and trading company that is focused on a generation market in the Northeast and Mid Atlantic U.S. Powers principal operating subsidiaries, PSEG Fossil LLC (Fossil), PSEG Nuclear LLC (Nuclear) and PSEG Energy Resources & Trade LLC (ER&T) are regulated by FERC. Through its subsidiaries, Power seeks to balance its generation production, fuel requirements and supply obligations through integrated energy marketing and trading, enhance its ability to produce low cost energy through efficient nuclear and coal operations and pursue modest growth based on market conditions. Changes in the operation of Powers generating facilities, fuel and capacity prices, expected contract prices, capacity factors or other assumptions could materially affect its ability to meet earnings targets and or liquidity requirements. In addition to the electric generation business described above, Powers revenues include gas supply sales under the Basic Gas Supply Service (BGSS) contract with PSE&G. As a merchant generator, Powers profit is derived from selling under contract or on the spot market a range of diverse products such as energy, capacity, emissions credits, congestion credits, and a series of energy related products that the system operator uses to optimize the operation of the energy grid, known as ancillary services. Accordingly, the prices of commodities, such as electricity, gas, coal and emissions, as well as the availability of Powers diverse fleet of generation units to produce these products, can have a material effect on Powers profitability. In recent years, the prices at which transactions are entered into for future delivery of these products, as evidenced through the market for forward contracts at points such as PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM) West, have escalated considerably over historical prices. Broad market price increases such as these are expected to have a positive effect on Powers results. Historically, Powers nuclear and coal fired facilities have produced over 50% and 25% of Powers production, respectively. With the vast majority of its power sourced from lower cost units, the rise in electric prices is anticipated to yield higher near term margins for Power. Power anticipates recognizing these higher near term margins, especially on the portion of its output that was more recently contracted or sold on the spot market. Over a longer term horizon, if these higher prices are sustained at prices reflective of what the current forward markets indicate, it would yield an attractive environment for Power to contract the sale of its anticipated output, allowing for potentially sustained higher profitability than recognized in prior years. These escalated prices also increase the cost of replacement power, thereby placing incremental risk on the operations of the generating units to produce these products. Power seeks to mitigate volatility in its results by contracting in advance for a significant portion of its anticipated electric output and fuel needs. Power believes this contracting strategy increases stability of earnings and cash flow. By keeping some portion of its output uncontracted, Power is able to retain some exposure to market changes as well as provide some protection in the event of unexpected generation outages. Power seeks to sell a portion of its anticipated low cost nuclear and coal fired generation over a multi year forward horizon, normally over a period of approximately two to four years. As of February 14, 2007, Power has contracted for approximately 100% of its anticipated 2007 nuclear and coal fired generation, with 90% to 100% contracted for 2008 and 35% to 50% contracted for 2009, with a modest amount contracted beyond 2009. Power has also entered into contracts for the future delivery of nuclear fuel and coal to support its contracted sales discussed above. As of February 1, 2007, Power had contracted for 100% of its anticipated nuclear uranium fuel needs through 2011, and approximately 70% of its average anticipated coal needs, including transportation, through 2009. These estimates are subject to change based upon the level of operation, and in particular for coal, are subject to market demands and pricing. By contrast, Power takes a more opportunistic approach in hedging its anticipated natural gas fired generation. The generation from these units is less predictable, as these units are generally dispatched only 55 when aggregate market demand has exceeded the supply provided by lower cost units. The natural gas fired units generally provide a lower contribution to the margin of Power than either the nuclear or coal units. Power will generally purchase natural gas as gas fired generation is required to supply forward sale commitments. In a changing market environment, this hedging strategy may cause Powers realized prices to be materially different than current market prices. At the present time, some of Powers existing contractual obligations, entered into during lower priced periods, are anticipated to result in lower margins than would have been the case if no or little hedging activity had been conducted. Alternatively, in a falling price environment, this hedging strategy will tend to create margins in excess of those implied by the then current market. Overview of 2006 During 2006, FERC issued certain orders related to market design that have changed the nature of capacity payments in the New England Power Pool (NEPOOL) and are scheduled to change the nature of payments in PJM. In PJM, the Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) will provide generators with differentiated capacity payments based upon the location of their respective facilities. Similarly, the Forward Capacity Market (FCM) settlement in NEPOOL provides for locational capacity payments. FERC has approved the market changes in each of these markets, with the anticipated start date for RPM set for June 1, 2007 and FCM transition period having begun on December 1, 2006. Power currently receives fixed Reliability Must Run (RMR) payments in PJM and NEPOOL for certain of its facilities which are provided to ensure the continued availability of those facilities. Also during 2006 Power: commenced commercial operations of its 1,186 MW, natural gas fired combined cycle power generation plant in Linden, New Jersey; reached an agreement with the EPA and NJDEP that will allow the continued operation of the Hudson facility and extends for four years the deadline for installing environmental controls beyond the previous December 31, 2006 deadline; announced its plans to resume direct management of the Salem and Hope Creek facilities before the expiration of the Operating Service Contract with Exelon Generation and to have the senior management team at those facilities to become employees of Power effective January 1, 2007; and entered into an agreement to sell its Lawrenceburg Energy Center, a 1,080 MW gas fired combined cycle electric generating plant in Lawrenceburg, Indiana. Future Outlook Power expects margin improvements in 2007 as higher prices for its nuclear and coal output are realized due to the rolling nature of its forward hedge positions and the expiration of its contract in Connecticut. The sale of Lawrenceburg and anticipated improvements in margins on serving the BGSS contract are also expected to benefit future results. In addition, Power believes that the redesign in capacity markets, discussed above, could lead to changes in the value of the majority of its generating capacity and result in incremental margin of $100 million to $150 million in 2007, with higher increases in future years as the full year impact is realized and existing capacity contracts expire. A key factor in Powers ability to achieve its objectives is its capability to operate its nuclear and fossil stations at sufficient capacity factors to limit the need to purchase higher priced electricity to satisfy its obligations. Powers ability to achieve its objectives will also depend on the implementation of reasonable capacity markets. Power must also be able to effectively manage its construction projects and continue to economically operate its generation facilities under increasingly stringent environmental requirements. In addition, with an increase in competition and market complexity and constantly changing forward prices, there is no assurance that Power will be able to contract its output at attractive prices. While these increases may have a potentially significant beneficial impact on margins, they could also raise any replacement power costs that Power may incur in the event of unanticipated outages, and could also further increase liquidity requirements as a result of contract obligations. Power could also be impacted by the lack of consistent rules in markets outside of PJM, including rate regulated utility ownership of generation and other regulatory 56 actions favoring non competitive markets. For additional information on liquidity requirements, see Liquidity and Capital Resources. Energy Holdings Energy Holdings operations are principally conducted through its subsidiaries Global, which has invested in international, rate regulated distribution companies and domestic and international generation companies, and Resources, which primarily invests in energy related leveraged leases. Global Global has reduced its international risk by opportunistically monetizing investments that no longer had a strategic fit. During the past three years, Global has reduced its overall investments from $2.6 billion to $1.9 billion, driven by sales of over $1 billion of investments in China, Brazil, Poland, India, Africa and the Middle East. See Note 4. Discontinued Operations, Acquisitions, Dispositions and Impairments of the Notes, for a discussion of these sales. The decrease in Globals portfolio size due to the above sales was partially offset by strong earnings from its Texas merchant generation business and its electric distribution companies in Chile and Peru. Approximately 65% of Globals remaining investments are in Chile and Peru with another 27% in the United States. Other modest sized investments in Italy, India and Venezuela comprise the remaining 8% of Globals portfolio. As a result of the investment sales, approximately 50% of Globals future earnings is expected to be derived from its domestic generation business, of which over half is from its 2,000 MW gas fired combined cycle merchant generation business in Texas with the balance from its 12 fully contracted generating facilities in which Globals ownership percentage equates to nearly 400 MW. The other 50% of Globals earnings is expected to be essentially from three rate regulated electric distribution businesses in Chile and Peru which serve approximately two million customers and a 183 MW hydro generation facility in Peru. The regulatory environment in both Chile and Peru has generally been constructive since Global acquired these investments. Chile maintains an investment grade rating and Perus rating, although non investment grade, has improved. Energy Holdings continues to review Globals portfolio, with a focus on its international investments. As part of this review, Energy Holdings considers the returns of its remaining investments against alternative investments across the PSEG companies, while considering the strategic fit and relative risks of these businesses. Energy Holdings is also considering the impact of any potential sales of its investments on its targeted credit metrics and debt service requirements and at present, Global anticipates that it will take into consideration an appropriate balance of the use of proceeds from any sales with returns of equity to PSEG and debt repayments. Resources Resources primarily has invested in energy related leveraged leases. Resources is focused on maintaining its current investment portfolio and does not expect to make any new investments. Overview of 2006 During 2006, Energy Holdings had over $600 million of proceeds from the sales of Globals investments in two generating stations in Poland, the sale of its interest in RGE, a distribution company in Brazil and from its sale of its remaining 46% interest in Dhofar Power. Energy Holdings used this cash as well as funds on hand at December 31, 2005 and cash from operations to return $520 million of capital to PSEG, redeem all $309 million of its 7.75% 2007 Senior Notes in January 2006 and redeem $300 million of its 8.625% 2008 Senior Notes in October 2006. Future Outlook Energy Holdings expects decreased margins at Global in 2007 primarily relating to the absence of mark to market gains, a slight reduction in spark spreads and anticipated maintenance outages at Texas Independent Energy L.P. (TIE)s plants. Also contributing to the expected decrease are higher taxes, the impact of adopting FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB 57 Statement 109 (FIN 48) and related standards and lower earnings due to asset sales partly offset by the impact of early adoption of FAS 157. As discussed above, Globals earnings are primarily derived from its investments in the United States, Chile and Peru. As such, Globals success will depend on continued strong energy markets in Texas and the economic and efficient operation of its electric distribution companies in Chile and Peru, including its ability to achieve reasonable rates and meeting expected growth in usage. The success of Globals foreign investments will also depend on stable political, regulatory and economic policies, including foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, particularly for Chile and Peru. Resources ability to realize tax benefits associated with its leveraged lease investments is dependent upon taxable income generated by its affiliates. Resources earnings and cash flows are expected to decrease in the future as the investment portfolio matures. Resources faces risks with regard to the creditworthiness of its counterparties; the weighted average credit rating of its lessees at December 31, 2006 was A/A3. Certain lessees ratings are below investment grade. The lease structures have various credit enhancement mechanisms. Resources monitors the credit rating of the lessees very closely, calling letters of credit and taking other measures when appropriate. Energy Holdings also faces risks related to the tax treatment of uncertain tax positions which will be impacted by new accounting guidance under FIN 48 and FASB Staff Position No. FAS 13 2, Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction, both of which are effective as of January 1, 2007. Based on its evaluation of this new guidance, Energy Holdings estimates that it will record a reduction to Retained Earnings of approximately $190 million to $215 million, effective January 1, 2007. In addition, this new guidance will have an impact on Energy Holdings future revenues and earnings, including an anticipated earnings reduction of $25 million to $35 million in 2007, as compared to 2006, which represents the majority of the anticipated impact on PSEG. See Note 2. Recent Accounting Standards of the Notes for further discussion. 58 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings Net Income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $739 million or $2.93 per share of common stock, diluted, based on approximately 252 million average shares outstanding.

The year over year changes in PSEGs Net Income primarily relates to changes in Net Income for PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings, discussed below. Also included in PSEGs results for each of the periods were financing costs at the parent level and Merger and Merger related costs. For the year ended December 31, 2006, PSEGs after tax costs were $77 million, a decrease $18 million as compared to 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2005, PSEGs after tax costs were $95 million, an increase of $26 million as compared to 2004. The primary reason for these changes was the change in after tax Merger and Merger related costs which amounted to $8 million, $32 million and $4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

It also includes certain financing costs at the parent company. For additional information on intercompany transactions, see Note 21. Related Party Transactions of the Notes. For a discussion of the causes for the variances at PSEG in the table above, see the discussions for PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings that follow. PSE&G For the year ended December 31, 2006, PSE&G had Net Income of $265 million, a decrease of $83 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. This decrease was primarily due to delayed decisions in its electric and gas base rate cases combined with the decline in electric and gas delivery volumes. Gas delivery volumes dropped 10% in 2006 as compared with 2005 and electric delivery volumes were down 3%. The weather was the primary cause of these declines with a drop of 16% in the number of degree days impacting gas. Gas commodity prices were extremely high early in 2006, which also contributed 60 to a decline in weather normalized sales. THI hours were normal in 2006 but 18% less than 2005 negatively impacting electric sales. For the year ended December 31, 2005, PSE&G had Net Income of $348 million, a $2 million increase as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. This slight increase resulted primarily from higher margins, due to favorable weather conditions, and reduced interest expense being substantially offset by higher Operation and Maintenance costs. The year over year detail for these variances for these periods are discussed in more detail below: For the YearsEnded December 31, 2006 vs 2005 2005 vs 2004 2006 2005 2004 Increase(Decrease) % Increase(Decrease) % (Millions) (Millions) Operating Revenues $ 7,569 $ 7,514 $ 6,810 $ 55 1 $ 704 10 Energy Costs $ 4,884 $ 4,756 $ 4,122 $ 128 3 $ 634 15 Operation and Maintenance $ 1,160 $ 1,151 $ 1,083 $ 9 1 $ 68 6 Depreciation and Amortization $ 620 $ 553 $ 523 $ 67 12 $ 30 6 Other Income and Deductions $ 22 $ 12 $ 11 $ 10 83 $ 1 9 Interest Expense $ (346 ) $ (342 ) $ (362 ) $ 4 1 $ (20 ) (6 ) Income Tax Expense $ (183 ) $ (235 ) $ (246 ) $ (52 ) (22 ) $ (11 ) (4 ) Operating Revenues PSE&G has three sources of revenue: commodity revenues from the sales of energy to customers and in the PJM spot market; delivery revenues from the transmission and distribution of energy through its system; and other operating revenues from the provision of various services. PSE&G makes no margin on gas commodity sales as the costs are passed through to customers. The difference between the gas costs paid under the requirements contract for residential customers and the revenues received from residential customers is deferred and collected from or returned to customers in future periods. Gas commodity prices fluctuate monthly for commercial and industrial customers and annually through the BGSS tariff for residential customers. In addition, for residential gas customers, PSE&G has the ability to adjust rates upward two additional times and downward at any time, if warranted, between annual BGSS proceedings. PSE&G makes no margin on electric commodity sales as the costs are passed through to customers. PSE&G secures its electric commodity through the annual BGS auction. Electric commodity supply prices are set based on the results of these auctions for residential and smaller industrial and commercial customers, and are translated into seasonally adjusted fixed rates. Electric supply for larger industrial and commercial customers is provided at a rate principally based on the hourly PJM real time energy price. Customers may obtain their electric supply through either the BGS default electric supply service or through competitive third party electric suppliers, and the majority of the customers subject to hourly pricing are currently receiving electric supply from third party suppliers. Any differences between amounts paid by PSE&G to BGS suppliers for electric commodity, and the amounts of electric commodity revenue collected from customers is deferred and collected or returned to customers in subsequent months. The $55 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005 was due to increases of $78 million in commodity revenues and $3 million in other operating revenues offset by a decrease of $26 million in delivery revenues. The $704 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004 was due to increases of $624 million in commodity revenues, $74 million in delivery revenues and $6 million in other operating revenues. Commodity The $78 million increase in commodity revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was due to an increase in electric commodity revenues of $213 million offset by a decrease of $135 million in gas commodity revenues. The increase in electric revenues was primarily due to $299 million in higher BGS revenues (higher auction prices of $346 million offset by reduced sales of $47 million) offset by $85 million in lower Non Utility Generation (NUG) revenues (lower prices of $82 million and by $3 million 61 for lower volumes). The decrease in gas revenues was primarily due to $317 million in lower volumes due to weather and $58 million due to the expiration of the Third Party Shopping Incentive Clause in July 2005. There is a corresponding $58 million increase in delivery revenues. These were offset by $240 million in higher BGSS prices. The $624 million increase in commodity revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was due to increases in electric and gas revenues of $313 million and $311 million, respectively. The increase in electric revenues was primarily due to $216 million in higher BGS revenues (higher auction prices of $148 million and increased sales of $68 million) and $97 million in higher NUG revenues (higher prices of $98 million offset by $1 million for lower volumes). The increase in gas revenues was primarily due to $291 million in higher BGSS prices and $62 million in higher volumes due to weather offset by the decrease of $42 million due to the expiration of the Third Party Shopping Incentive Clause in July 2005. There is a corresponding $42 million increase in delivery revenues. Delivery The $26 million decrease in delivery revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was due to a $27 million decrease in gas and a $1 million increase in electric revenues. The gas decrease was due to $101 million in lower volumes primarily due to weather offset by $74 million in increased prices, $58 million of which was due to the expiration of the Third Party Shopping Incentive Clause in July 2005, described above in commodity revenues, $8 million due to rate relief effective November 9, 2006 and $8 million due to the Societal Benefits Clause (SBC) November 1, 2006 rate increase. The electric increase was due primarily to $13 million in higher securitization tariff rates and $8 million from a rate increase effective November 9, 2006, offset by $20 million in lower volumes due to weather. The $74 million increase in delivery revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was due to increases in electric and gas revenues of $67 million and $7 million, respectively. The electric increase was due primarily to $55 million in higher volumes due to weather and $12 million in higher rates. The gas increase was due to the expiration of the Third Party Shopping Incentive in July 2005, resulting in an increase of $42 million in delivery revenues with a corresponding offset in commodity revenues, described above, and a $12 million increase in SBC revenues (offset in Operation and Maintenance Costs below). This was offset by $9 million in lower volume and demand revenues due to weather and $37 million due to the expiration of the Gas Cost Underrecovery Adjustment (GCUA) clause in January 2005. Operating Expenses Energy Costs The $128 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was comprised of an increase of $211 million in electric costs offset by a decrease of $83 million in gas costs. The increase in electric costs was caused by $255 million or 16% in higher prices for BGS and NUG purchases offset by $47 million in lower BGS volumes due to weather. The decrease in gas costs was caused by a $362 million or 17% decrease in sales volumes due primarily to weather and $8 million due to the expiration of the GCUA clause in January 2005, offset by $287 million or 11% in higher prices. The $634 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was comprised of increases of $319 million in electric costs and $315 million in gas costs. The increase in electric costs was caused by a $264 million or 8% increase due to higher prices for BGS and NUG purchases and a $67 million increase due to higher BGS volumes, partially offset by a decrease of $12 million due to lower NUG volumes. The increased gas costs were due to a $271 million or 16% increase in gas prices and an $81 million increase in sales volumes due primarily to higher sales to cogenerators. These were offset by a $37 million decrease due to the expiration of the GCUA clause in January 2005. Operation and Maintenance The $9 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was due primarily to $9 million in increased labor and fringe benefits due to increased wages and Other Postretirement Benefits (OPEB) costs and $7 million in increased bad debt expense. These increases were offset by decreases of $3 million in injuries and damage claims and $2 million in write offs and $2 million in Net Operating Loss (NOL) purchases. 62 The $68 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was due to increased SBC expenses of $27 million ($15 million electric, $12 million gas); $23 million in labor and fringe benefits; $6 million for increased injuries and damages reserves; $4 million for Merger related expenses; $3 million for higher regulatory commission expenses; $2 million for higher bad debt expenses and $2 million for the purchase of NOL. SBC costs are deferred when incurred and amortized to expense when recovered in revenues. Depreciation and Amortization The $67 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was comprised of increases of $70 million from the expiration of an excess depreciation credit, $6 million due to amortization of regulatory assets and $3 million due to additional plant in service. These increases were offset by decreases of $5 million due to revised plant depreciation and cost of removal rates, $3 million due to software amortization and $3 million due to the amortization of the Remediation Adjustment Clause (RAC). The $30 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was due primarily to a $33 million increase in the amortization of securitized regulatory assets, a $4 million increase due to additional plant in service and a $4 million increase in the amortization of the RAC. These were offset by an $8 million decrease in software amortization and a $3 million increase in excess depreciation reserve amortization. Other Income and Deductions The $10 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to an $8 million income tax gross up on contributions in aid of construction (CIAC) in 2006. CIAC are taxable and PSE&G recognizes the gross up as income when collected. Also included are increases of $1 million of short term interest income and $1 million in gains on the sale of excess property. Interest Expense The $20 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was primarily due to decreases of $22 million due to lower average interest rates and lower amounts of long term debt outstanding, primarily offset by $5 million in higher short term debt balances outstanding and higher interest rates. Income Taxes The $52 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to $55 million in lower pre tax income offset by $3 million in various flow through adjustments. The $11 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was primarily due to decreases of $4 million in prior period adjustments, $3 million in various flow through benefits and $3 million in lower pre tax income. Power For the year ended December 31, 2006, Power had Net Income of $276 million, an increase of $84 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase primarily resulted from higher BGS contract prices and higher sales volumes in the various power pools, supported by improved nuclear operations and the commencement of commercial operations at Linden in May 2006 and at the Bethlehem Energy Center (BEC) in July 2005 and lower generation costs due to lower pool prices and lower demand under the BGS contract. Power also had lower non trading mark to market losses, which were approximately $1 million, after tax, in 2006 as compared to $8 million, after tax, in 2005. Powers increased earnings were partially offset by reduced margins on BGSS, as market prices for natural gas declined from historically high price levels experienced in the second half of 2005 while the cost of gas in inventory was reasonably stable, and lower demand in 2006 due to a warmer winter heating system and customer conservation. Powers earnings were also offset by a $44 million write down of four gas engine turbines which are planned for sale in 2007, a $30 million after tax decrease in Income from the NDT Funds and higher Operation and 63 Maintenance Costs, Depreciation and Amortization and Interest Expense related to operation of the Linden and BEC facilities. For the year ended December 31, 2005, Power had Net Income of $192 million, a decrease of $116 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. The primary reason for the decrease was the $178 million Loss on Disposal of Waterford and the $16 million Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle recorded in 2005. Powers Income from Continuing Operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $434 million, an increase of $67 million as compared to 2004. This increase reflected higher pricing and increased sales in the various power pools and new wholesale contracts and reduced Operation and Maintenance costs associated with the outage at Hope Creek in 2004. Marked improvement in Powers nuclear operations provided additional low cost energy to satisfy Powers contractual obligations and to sell into the market at higher prices. The increases at Power were partially offset by interest and depreciation costs related to facilities in Albany, New York, which commenced operation in July 2005 and Lawrenceburg, Indiana, which commenced operation in June 2004. The year over year detail for these variances for these periods are discussed in more detail below: For the YearsEnded December 31, 2006 vs 2005 2005 vs 2004 2006 2005 2004 Increase(Decrease) % Increase(Decrease) % (Millions) (Millions) Operating Revenues $ 6,057 $ 6,027 $ 5,166 $ 30 $ 861 17 Energy Costs $ 3,955 $ 4,266 $ 3,553 $ (311 ) (7 ) $ 713 20 Operation and Maintenance $ 958 $ 939 $ 948 $ 19 2 $ (9 ) (1 ) Write Down of Assets $ 44 $ $ $ 44 N/A $ N/A Depreciation and Amortization $ 140 $ 114 $ 98 $ 26 23 $ 16 16 Other Income and Deductions $ 66 $ 144 $ 117 $ (78 ) (54 ) $ 27 23 Interest Expense $ (148 ) $ (100 ) $ (90 ) $ 48 48 $ 10 11 Income Tax Expense $ (363 ) $ (318 ) $ (227 ) $ 45 14 $ 91 40 Loss from Discontinued Operations, including Loss on Disposal, net of tax $ (239 ) $ (226 ) $ (59 ) $ 13 6 $ 167 N/A Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle, net of tax $ $ (16 ) $ $ 16 N/A $ (16 ) N/A Operating Revenues The $30 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to 2005 was due to increases of $239 million in generation revenues and $27 million in trading revenues, which were partially offset by a decrease of $236 million in gas supply revenues. The $861 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was due to increases of $543 million in generation revenues and $368 million in gas supply revenues, which were partially offset by a decrease of $50 million in trading revenues. Generation The $239 million increase in generation revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to an increase of $238 million from higher sales volumes in the various power pools, supported by improved nuclear operations and the commencement of the commercial operations of Linden in May 2006 and BEC in July 2005, partially offset by lower pool prices. Also contributing to the increase was $92 million of higher BGS contract revenues due to higher contract prices which were partly offset by a reduction in load being served under the fixed price BGS contracts and termination of BGS hourly contracts in May 2006. The increases were partially offset by a decrease of $58 million due to certain wholesale contracts ending in 2005 and early 2006 and $33 million of unrealized losses on asset backed electric forward contracts. The $543 million increase in generation revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was primarily due to higher revenues of $226 million from higher pricing and increased sales in the various power pools supported by improved nuclear capacity, partially offset by reduced load being served under the fixed priced BGS contracts. Also contributing to the increase were increases of $103 million from new wholesale contracts, $74 million from operations in New York, largely due to the commencement of 64 BECs operations, $65 million from RMR revenues, which Power began receiving in 2005 for certain of its generating facilities, and $75 million from increased ancillary services and operating reserves. Gas Supply The $236 million decrease in gas supply revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to decreases of $334 million due to lower demand under the BGSS contract in 2006 due to a warmer winter heating season and improved customer conservation in 2006 and a $94 million in decreased prices and gas volumes and pipeline capacity sold to other gas distributors. The decreases were partially offset by an increase of $188 million due to higher prices under the BGSS contract. The $368 million increase in gas supply revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was principally due to higher prices under the BGSS contract for gas and pipeline capacity partially offset by lower demand, largely resulting from a warmer winter heating season in 2005 as compared to 2004. Trading The $27 million increase in trading revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was principally due to higher realized gains related to emissions credits. The $50 million decrease in trading revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, resulted principally from reductions in realized gains related to emission credits. Operating Expenses Energy Costs Energy Costs represent the cost of generation, which includes fuel purchases for generation as well as purchased energy in the market, and gas purchases to meet Powers obligation under its BGSS contract with PSE&G. The $311 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to decreases of $267 million from lower pool prices and lower demand under the BGS contract, $144 million from a reduced volume of gas purchased to satisfy Powers BGSS obligations, somewhat offset by higher gas prices related to inventory for the 2005/2006 winter heating season, and $58 million due to favorable pricing of fuel related asset backed transactions in 2006. These decreases were partially offset by $80 million of losses realized on gas hedges in 2006, an increase of $42 million in fuel costs and an increase of $35 million in transmission fees. The increase in fuel costs was largely due to higher volumes of gas purchased to meet increased production by the gas fired plants, including Linden and BEC, and higher oil prices, partially offset by lower gas prices during 2006 and a lower volume of oil purchases due to reduced running times of certain of the oil fired plants in 2006. The $713 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was primarily due to increased generation costs, reflecting higher fossil fuel prices and higher prices on an increased volume of purchased power for new contracts and higher prices for gas purchased to satisfy Powers BGSS obligations. Operation and Maintenance The $19 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was principally due to higher maintenance costs of $60 million related to certain of the fossil plants and scheduled outages at the nuclear units. These increases were partially offset by the absence of a $14 million restructuring charge recorded in 2005 related to Nuclears workforce realignment plan, a decrease of $10 million in payroll and benefits due to a reduction in employees and a decrease of $14 million in fees paid to Services for information technology and various administrative services. The $9 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was primarily due to a decrease of $36 million in equipment repair costs related to outages at the nuclear facilities, $9 million of lower real estate taxes, $5 million of lower transmission fees in the power pools, $4 million of lower expenses related to reduced trading activities in 2005 and an $8 million settlement of co owner billings in 2004 related to Powers jointly owned facilities. The decreases were substantially offset by an increase of $11 million in pension, postretirement and other employee benefits, a $16 million increase attributable to repairs for 65 outages at the fossil generation plants, the aforementioned $14 million restructuring charge and a $12 million settlement with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) in 2004. Write Down of Assets The $44 million write down of assets recorded in 2006 related to four turbines for which Power has no immediate use and intends to sell. For additional information, see Note 4. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions, Acquisitions and Impairments of the Notes. Depreciation and Amortization The $26 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to the Linden and BEC plants being placed into service in May 2006 and July 2005, respectively. The $16 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was primarily due to the BEC facility being placed into service and a higher depreciable asset base in 2005 at Nuclear. Other Income and Deductions The $78 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to decreased net realized income of $29 million and increased realized losses of $19 million related to the NDT Funds. Also contributing to the decrease were charges recorded in 2006 of $14 million for an other than temporary impairment of certain NDT Fund securities and $14 million for penalties related to negotiations concerning environmental concerns and an alternate pollution reduction plan for Powers Hudson unit. The $27 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2004, was primarily due to increased realized gains and income of $13 million related to the NDT Funds, lower realized losses of $8 million in 2005 on NDT Funds and a $5 million gain from the sale in September 2005 of four gas turbine generators located in Burlington, New Jersey. Interest Expense The $48 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was due primarily to lower capitalized interest costs in 2006 related to commencement of operations of the Linden and BEC facilities. The $10 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was due primarily to $8 million of lower capitalized interest costs in 2005 related to commencement of operations of BEC. Income Taxes The $45 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to higher pre tax income. The $91 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was primarily due to an increase of $63 million in taxes on pre tax income, the recording in 2005 of $15 million of taxes for the NDT Funds and the reversal in 2004 of $16 million of contingency reserves and other prior period adjustments. Loss from Discontinued Operations, including Loss on Disposal, net of tax On December 29, 2006, Power entered into an agreement to sell its Lawrenceburg generation facility for approximately $325 million and recognized an estimated loss on disposal of $208 million, net of tax, in December 2006, for the initial write down of its carrying amount of Lawrenceburg to its fair value less cost to sell. The transaction is anticipated to close in the second quarter of 2007. Losses from Discontinued Operations of Lawrenceburg, not including the estimated Loss of Disposal, were $31 million, $28 million and $25 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. On May 27, 2005, Power reached an agreement to sell its Waterford generation facility for approximately $220 million and recognized an estimated loss on disposal of $177 million, net of tax, for the initial write down of its carrying amount of Waterford to its fair value less cost to sell. On September 28, 66 2005, Power completed the sale of Waterford and recognized an additional loss of $1 million. Losses from Discontinued Operations of Waterford, not including the Loss of Disposal, were $20 million and $34 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. See Note 4. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions, Acquisitions and Impairments of the Notes for additional information. Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle For the year ended December 31, 2005, Power recorded an after tax loss in the amount of $16 million due to the required recording of a liability for the fair value of asset retirement costs primarily related to its generation plants under FIN 47, which was adopted in December 2005. See Note 3. Asset Retirement Obligations of the Notes for additional information. Energy Holdings For the year ended December 31, 2006, Energy Holdings had Net Income of $275 million, an increase of $58 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Included in Energy Holdings Net Income for 2006 was a $178 million after tax loss on the sale of RGE, which was more than offset by the $226 million after tax gain on disposal of Elcho and Skawina. Strong operations combined with approximately $29 million of after tax mark to market gains on forward gas contracts in 2006 as compared to $3 million of after tax mark to market losses in 2005 at TIE and higher sales volumes at Sociedad Austral de Electricidad S.A. (SAESA) also contributed to the increase. The increases were partially offset by the absence of an after tax gain of $43 million from the sale of Resources leveraged lease investment in Generation Station Unit 2 (Seminole) in December 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2005, Energy Holdings had Net Income of $217 million, an increase of $76 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. This increase was primarily due to higher earnings due to improved operations at TIE and in South America and the aforementioned gain on the sale of Seminole in December 2005. The year over year detail for these variances for these periods are discussed in more detail below: For the YearsEnded December 31, 2006 vs 2005 2005 vs 2004 2006 2005 2004 Increase(Decrease) % Increase(Decrease) % (Millions) (Millions) Operating Revenues $ 1,357 $ 1,302 $ 836 $ 55 4 $ 466 56 Energy Costs $ 739 $ 675 $ 322 $ 64 9 $ 353 N/A Operation and Maintenance $ 208 $ 215 $ 171 $ (7 ) (3 ) $ 44 26 Write Down of Assets $ 274 $ $ $ 274 N/A $ N/A Depreciation and Amortization $ 52 $ 46 $ 44 $ 6 13 $ 2 5 Income from Equity Method Investments $ 120 $ 124 $ 119 $ (4 ) (3 ) $ 5 4 Other Income and Deductions $ 11 $ (8 ) $ 3 $ 19 N/A $ (11 ) N/A Interest Expense $ (203 ) $ (213 ) $ (223 ) $ (10 ) (5 ) $ (10 ) (4 ) Income Tax Benefit (Expense) $ 39 $ (69 ) $ (45 ) $ 108 N/A $ 24 53 Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, including Gain (Loss) on Disposal $ 226 $ 18 $ (10 ) $ 208 N/A $ 28 N/A The classification of the results of Globals investments on Energy Holdings Consolidated Financial Statements is dependent upon Globals ownership percentage in the underlying investment which determines whether the investment is consolidated into Energy Holdings Consolidated Financial Statements or if it is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Global owns 100% of TIE, SAESA and Electroandes S.A. (Electroandes) and 85% of Prisma 2000 S.p.A. (Prisma). As a result, the revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities of those investments are reflected on Energy Holdings Consolidated Financial Statements. Globals investments in Chilquinta Energia (Chilquinta), Luz del Sur S.A.A. (LDS), GWF, Kalaeloa Partners L.P. ( Kalaeloa) and several other smaller investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Therefore, Energy Holdings only records its share of the net income from these projects as Income from Equity Method Investments on its Consolidated Statements of Operations. 67 The variances in Operating Revenues, Energy Costs, Operation and Maintenance, Depreciation and Amortization and Income from Equity Method Investments were primarily attributed to Globals increased revenues at TIE in 2006, as compared to same period in 2005, primarily due to unrealized gains on forward contracts and a stronger market and stronger spark spread (the difference between the market price of electricity and the cost of natural gas fuel), the consolidation of Prisma in May 2006, which generated $32 million of revenue, and Globals sale of a 35% interest in Dhofar Power Company S.A.O.C. (Dhofar Power) through a public offering on the Omani Stock Exchange in April 2005 and sale of its remaining interest of 46% in November 2006, receiving net proceeds after tax of approximately $31 million, the approximate book value of the investment. The variances are also related to favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher energy sales volumes at SAESA. Operating Revenues The increase of $55 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was due to higher revenues at Global of $128 million, which was primarily related to a $79 million increase at TIE due to higher unrealized gains on forward contracts which were slightly offset by a reduction in gas sales. Also contributing to the increase at Global was a $78 million increase at SAESA in Chile due to higher energy sales volumes as well as tariff increases and favorable foreign currency exchange rates, a $24 million increase due to the consolidation of Prisma and $10 million of increased revenue from Electroandes due to volume and price increases. These increases were partly offset by a $37 million decrease due to the absence of a gain from withdrawal from the Eagle Point Cogeneration Partnership in the prior year and the absence of $20 million of revenue due to the deconsolidation of Dhofar Power. Offsetting the increases at Global were lower revenues at Resources of $73 million primarily due to the absence of a $71 million pre tax gain from the sale of Resources interest in Seminole Generation in December 2005 coupled with the absence of $20 million of leveraged lease income in 2006 due to the Seminole sale, partially offset by a $21 million write off of a leveraged lease investment with United Airlines in 2005. The increase of $466 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was due to higher revenues at Global of $406 million, including a $279 million increase related to the consolidation of TIE commencing July 1, 2004 and $136 million due to higher revenues at TIE in the second half of 2005 and a $62 million increase related to SAESA due to higher energy sales volumes offset by a $43 million decrease related to the deconsolidation of Dhofar Power and the absence of a $35 million gain on the sale of Meiya Power Company Limited (MPC) in 2004. Also contributing to the increase were higher revenues at Resources of $60 million primarily due to the $71 million pre tax gain recognized in 2005 from the sale of its interest in Seminole offset by the absence of an $11 million pre tax charge recorded due to the termination of the lease investment in the Collins generating facility in 2004. Energy Costs The increase of $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to a $59 million increase at SAESA due to increased volume and higher spot prices for energy and an $8 million increase due to the consolidation of Prisma in May 2006, partially offset by a $5 million decrease related to the deconsolidation of Dhofar Power. The increase of $353 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was primarily due to a $219 million increase related to the consolidation of TIE commencing July 1, 2004, a $99 million increase in energy costs at TIE in the second half of 2005 and a $44 million increase related to SAESA due to significant increases in Energy Costs, offset by a $13 million decrease related to the deconsolidation of Dhofar Power. Operation and Maintenance The decrease of $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to a reduction of $9 million at Resources mainly due to a reduction of operating lease expense. The decrease is also due to a $4 million reduction in administrative expenses related to lower corporate assessments, wages and benefits, and legal and consulting expense. These decreases are offset by an $8 million increase at Global due to a $17 million increase related to the operations of SAESA, $5 million increase due to the consolidation of Prisma partially offset by a $9 million decrease at TIE and a $4 million decrease from the deconsolidation of Dhofar Power. 68 The increase of $44 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was primarily due to a $41 million increase related to the consolidation of TIE commencing July 1, 2004 and a $14 million increase related to SAESA offset by a $6 million decrease related to the deconsolidation of Dhofar Power and a $7 million decrease in energy costs at TIE in the second half of 2005. Write Down of Assets The $274 million write down of assets is primarily related to a $263 million pre tax loss on Globals sale of its 32% indirect ownership interest in RGE, $4 million pre tax loss related to the sale of Globals interest in Magellan Capital Holdings Corporation (MCHC), and a $7 million pre tax loss on the impairment of Globals generation projects in Venezuela. See Note 4. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions, Acquisitions and Impairments of the Notes. Depreciation and Amortization The increase of $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to a $3 million increase at Resources and a $3 million increase at Global due to a $4 million increase related to the consolidation of Prisma and an increase of $3 million at SAESA, offset by a $4 million decrease resulting from the deconsolidation of Dhofar Power. The increase of $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was primarily due to an $8 million increase related to the consolidation of TIE commencing July 1, 2004 and a $2 million increase related to Resources due to the conversion of the Delta and Northwest leases from leveraged leases to operating leases, offset by a $9 million decrease related to the deconsolidation of Dhofar Power. Income from Equity Method Investments The decrease of $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily driven by the absence of $12 million of earnings due to the sale of RGE in 2006 partially offset by the absence of foreign currency losses in 2005 from Prisma of $8 million. The increase of $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was primarily due to a $20 million increase due to stronger results in South America (RGE and Chilquinta) offset by an $11 million decrease related to the loss of earnings associated with the sale of Globals equity interest in MPC in December 2004 and a $3 million decrease related to Globals investment in Prisma. Other Income and Deductions The increase of $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to an increase in interest and dividend income of approximately $10 million and lower losses in foreign currency transactions due to favorable currency fluctuations mainly for Prisma operations in Italy. The decrease of $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was primarily due to a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $7 million and foreign currency transaction losses of $9 million primarily on notes receivables from Prisma, partially offset by interest income from PSEG related to inter company loans. Interest Expense The decrease of $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was mainly due to a decrease in Energy Holdings debt outstanding and a net decrease of $2 million resulting from the consolidation of Prisma and the deconsolidation of Dhofar Power. The $10 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2005, respectively, as compared to 2004, was primarily due an $11 million decrease related to the deconsolidation of Dhofar Power in May 2005 and an $8 million decrease related to Resources due to a reduction in intercompany interest charges offset by a $9 million increase related to the consolidation of TIE commencing on July 1, 2004. 69 Income Taxes The decrease of $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily attributable to a tax benefit resulting from Globals sale of its 32% indirect ownership interest in RGE and sale of SAESAs 50% interest in Empresa de Energia Rio Negro S.A. (Argentine utility operation). The $24 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was primarily due to the recording of $11 million of U.S. tax associated with repatriation of funds under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Jobs Act), an increase in the mix of domestic earnings for Global due to improved results at TIE, taxes recognized of $28 million from the sale of Seminole and additional benefits resulting from revisions to Resources lease runs performed in the fourth quarter of 2005. For further information on lease runs, see below in Resources forecast of state taxable income and tax liability over the relevant lease terms. This forecast was embedded in the lease reruns and led to an income tax benefit of $43 million in 2004 to reflect the cumulative benefit of this adjustment. This benefit was largely offset by the tax impact associated with a $31 million decrease in leveraged lease revenue. Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, including Gain (Loss) on Disposal, net of tax Elcho and Skawina In 2006, Global sold its interest in two coal fired plants in Poland, Elcho and Skawina. Proceeds, net of transaction costs, were $476 million, resulting in a gain of $227 million net of tax expense of $142 million. Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations related to Elcho and Skawina for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $227 million, $18 million and $(10) million, respectively. See Note 4. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions, Acquisitions and Impairments of the Notes for additional information. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following discussion of liquidity and capital resources is on a consolidated basis for PSEG, noting the uses and contributions of PSEGs three direct operating subsidiaries, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings. Financing Methodology PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings Capital requirements for PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings are met through liquidity provided by internally generated cash flow and external financings. PSEG expects to be able to fund existing commitments, reduce debt and meet dividend requirements using internally generated cash. PSEG, Power and Energy Holdings from time to time make equity contributions or otherwise provide credit support to their respective direct and indirect subsidiaries to provide for part of their capital and cash requirements, generally relating to long term investments. PSEG does not intend to contribute additional equity to Energy Holdings. At times, PSEG utilizes intercompany dividends and intercompany loans (except however, that PSE&G may not, without prior BPU approval, and Fossil, Nuclear and ER&T may not without prior FERC approval make loans to their affiliates) to satisfy various subsidiary or parental needs and efficiently manage short term cash. Any excess funds are invested in short term liquid investments. External funding to meet PSEGs, PSE&Gs and Powers needs and a majority portion of the requirements of Energy Holdings consist of corporate finance transactions. The debt incurred is the direct obligation of those respective entities. Some of the proceeds of these debt transactions may be used by the respective obligor to make equity investments in its subsidiaries. As discussed below, depending on the particular company, external financing may consist of public and private capital market debt and equity transactions, bank revolving credit and term loans, commercial paper and or project financings. Some of these transactions involve special purpose entities (SPEs), formed in accordance with applicable tax and legal requirements in order to achieve specified financial advantages, such as favorable legal liability treatment. PSEG consolidates SPEs, as applicable, in accordance with FIN No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) (FIN 46). See Note 2. Recent Accounting Standards of the Notes. 70 The availability and cost of external capital is affected by each entitys performance, as well as by the performance of their respective subsidiaries and affiliates. This could include the degree of structural separation between PSEG and its subsidiaries and the potential impact of affiliate ratings on consolidated and unconsolidated credit quality. Additionally, compliance with applicable financial covenants will depend upon future financial position, earnings and net cash flows, as to which no assurances can be given. Over the next several years, PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings may be required to extinguish or refinance maturing debt and, to the extent there is not sufficient internally generated funds, may incur additional debt and or provide equity to fund investment activities. Any inability to obtain required additional external capital or to extend or replace maturing debt and or existing agreements at current levels and reasonable interest rates may adversely affect PSEGs, PSE&Gs, Powers and Energy Holdings respective financial condition, results of operations and net cash flows. From time to time, PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings may repurchase portions of their respective debt securities using funds from operations, asset sales, commercial paper, debt issuances, equity issuances and other sources of funding and may make exchanges of new securities, including common stock, for outstanding securities. Such repurchases may be at variable prices below, at or above prevailing market prices and may be conducted by way of privately negotiated transactions, open market purchases, tender or exchange offers or other means. PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings may utilize brokers or dealers or effect such repurchases directly. Any such repurchases may be commenced or discontinued at any time without notice. Energy Holdings A portion of the financing for Globals investments is normally provided by non recourse financing transactions. These consist of loans from banks and other lenders that are typically secured by project assets and cash flows. Non recourse transactions generally impose no material obligation on the parent level investor to repay any debt incurred by the project borrower. The consequences of permitting a project level default include the potential for loss of any invested equity by the parent. However, in some cases, certain obligations relating to the investment being financed, including additional equity commitments, may be guaranteed by Global and or Energy Holdings for their respective subsidiaries. PSEG does not provide guarantees or credit support to Energy Holdings or its subsidiaries. Operating Cash Flows PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings PSEG expects strong cash from operations primarily driven by earnings from Power supported by improved energy margins and capacity markets. Operating cash flows are expected to be sufficient to fund capital expenditures and shareholder dividend payments, with excess cash available to invest in the business, reduce debt and or repurchase common stock. PSEG For the year ended December 31, 2006, PSEGs operating cash flow increased by approximately $959 million from $970 million to $1.9 billion, as compared to 2005, due to net increases from its subsidiaries as discussed below. For the year ended December 31, 2005, PSEGs operating cash flow decreased by approximately $635 million from $1.6 billion to $970 million, as compared to 2004, primarily due to net decreases at Power for its working capital requirements, discussed below. PSE&G PSE&Gs operating cash flow increased approximately $115 million from $689 million to $804 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, primarily due to a decrease in customer receivables, reflecting lower sales volumes due to a warmer winter heating season and lower gas prices in 2006. PSE&Gs operating cash flow decreased approximately $7 million from $696 million to $689 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004. 71 Power Powers operating cash flow increased approximately $907 million from $136 million to $1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, due to a significant reduction in margin requirements and fuel inventories, largely resulting from decreases in commodity prices. Powers operating cash flow decreased approximately $371 million from $507 million to $136 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004 primarily due to increased margin requirements and an increase in fuel inventory because of significantly increased commodity prices. Energy Holdings Energy Holdings operating cash flow decreased approximately $114 million from $273 million to $159 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005. The decrease was mainly due to taxes paid related to the sale of Elcho, Skawina and RGE in 2006. The proceeds from the these sales are included in Cash Flows from Investing Activities on Energy Holdings Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Energy Holdings operating cash flow decreased approximately $130 million from $403 million to $273 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, due primarily to a decrease in Resources cash flows, which was driven by the timing of receipt of tax benefits, and the monetization of the remaining receivables of PETAMC in 2004. Common Stock Dividends Dividend payments on common stock for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $2.28 per share and totaled approximately $574 million. Dividend payments on common stock for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $2.24 per share and totaled approximately $541 million. Future dividends declared will be dependent upon PSEGs future earnings, cash flows, financial requirements, alternative investment opportunities and other factors. On January 17, 2007, PSEG announced an increase in its dividend from $0.57 to $0.585 per share for the first quarter of 2007. This quarterly increase reflects an indicated annual dividend rate of $2.34 per share. Short Term Liquidity PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings In December 2006, PSEG and Power established new credit facilities, which are available for letters of credit and short term funding, replacing their previous credit facilities. PSEGs new facility also provides liquidity backup for its $1 billion commercial paper program. Also in December 2006, PSE&G amended its $600 million credit facility to update the terms and extend the expiration date to June 2011. PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings each believe that sufficient liquidity exists to fund their respective short term cash needs. As of December 31, 2006, PSEG and its subsidiaries had a total of approximately $3.7 billion of committed credit facilities with approximately $3.3 billion of available liquidity under these facilities. In addition, PSEG and PSE&G have access to certain uncommitted credit facilities. Each of the facilities is restricted to availability and use to the specific companies as listed below. As of December 31, 2006, PSEG has no loans outstanding under its uncommitted facility and PSE&G had $31 million of loans outstanding under its uncommitted facility. 72 Company ExpirationDate TotalFacility PrimaryPurpose Usageas ofDecember 31,2006 AvailableLiquidityas ofDecember 31,2006 (Millions) PSEG: 5 year Credit Facility Dec 2011 $ 1,000 CP Support/Funding/Letters of Credit $ 354 $ 646 Uncommitted Bilateral Agreement N/A $ N/A Funding $ $ N/A PSE&G: 5 year Credit Facility June 2011 $ 600 CP Support/Funding/Letters of Credit $ $ 600 Uncommitted Bilateral Agreement N/A N/A Funding $ 31 $ N/A PSEG and Power:(A) Bilateral Credit Facility June 2007 $ 200 Funding/Letters of Credit $ 19 (C) $ 181 Power: 5 year Credit Facility Dec 2011 $ 1,600 Funding/Letters of Credit $ 20 (C) $ 1,580 Bilateral Credit Facility March 2010 $ 100 Funding/Letters of Credit $ $ 100 Energy Holdings: 5 year Credit Facility(B) June 2010 $ 150 Funding/Letters of Credit $ 6 (C) $ 144 (A) PSEG/Power joint and several co borrower facilities. (B) Energy Holdings/Global/Resources joint and several co borrower facility. (C) These amounts relate to letters of credit outstanding. Power As of December 31, 2006, Power had borrowed $54 million from PSEG in the form of an intercompany loan. During the year ending December 31, 2006, Powers required margin postings for sales contracts entered into in the normal course of business decreased as commodity prices declined. The required margin postings will fluctuate based on volatility in commodity prices. Should commodity prices rise, additional margin calls may be necessary relative to existing power sales contracts. As Powers contract obligations are fulfilled, liquidity requirements are reduced. In addition, ER&T maintains agreements that require Power, as its guarantor under performance guarantees, to satisfy certain creditworthiness standards. In the event of a deterioration of Powers credit rating to below investment grade, which represents at least a two level downgrade from its current ratings, many of these agreements allow the counterparty to demand that ER&T provide performance assurance, generally in the form of a letter of credit or cash. Providing this support would increase Powers costs of doing business and could restrict the ability of ER&T to manage and optimize Powers asset portfolio. Power believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet any required posting of collateral resulting from a credit rating downgrade. See Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of the Notes for further information. Energy Holdings Energy Holdings and its subsidiaries had $98 million in cash, including $38 million invested offshore as of December 31, 2006. In addition, as of December 31, 2006, Energy Holdings had an outstanding demand loan receivable from PSEG of $28 million. See External Financings Energy Holdings below for Energy Holdings additional use of its excess cash. 73 External Financings PSEG On September 1, 2006, PSEG began using treasury stock to settle the exercise of stock options. Prior to September 1, 2006, PSEG had purchased shares on the open market to meet the exercise of stock options. As of December 31, 2006, PSEG issued 410,365 shares of its common treasury stock in connection with settling stock options for approximately $15 million. For the year ended December 31, 2006, PSEG issued approximately 1 million shares of its common stock under its Dividend Reinvestment Program and its Employee Stock Purchase Program for approximately $68 million. In October 2006, PSEG repaid $49 million of its 6.89% Senior Notes which are due in equal installment payments through 2009. In February 2006, PSEG redeemed $154 million of its Subordinated Debentures underlying $150 million of Enterprise Capital Trust II, Floating Rate Capital Securities and its common equity investment in the trust. PSE&G On June 23, 2006, PSE&G repaid at maturity $175 million of its Floating Rate Series A First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds. On March 1, 2006, PSE&G repaid at maturity $147 million of its 6.75% Series UU First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds. In December 2006, PSE&G issued $250 million of 5.70% Secured Medium Term Notes Series D due 2036. The proceeds were used to replace in part the aforementioned matured Floating Rate Series A and 6.75% Series UU First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds. For the year ended December 31, 2006, PSE&G Transition Funding LLC (Transition Funding) and PSE&G Transition Funding II LLC (Transition Funding II) repaid approximately $155 million and $8 million, respectively, of their transition bonds. On January 2, 2007, PSE&G repaid at maturity $113 million of its 6.25% Series WW First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds. Power In April 2006, Power repaid at maturity $500 million of its 6.875% Senior Notes. Energy Holdings In January 2006, Energy Holdings redeemed all $309 million of its 7.75% Senior Notes due in 2007. On February 17, 2006, the maturity of the OdessaEctor Power Partners, L.P. (Odessa) debt was extended to December 31, 2009. Interest on the debt is based on a spread (currently 2.25%) above LIBOR. On September 29, 2006, an interest rate swap took effect which converted the floating LIBOR interest rate on approximately 80% of Odessas debt to a fixed rate of 5.4275% through December 31, 2009. On October 23, 2006, Energy Holdings redeemed $300 million of its $507 million outstanding 8.625% Senior Notes due in 2008. During 2006, Energy Holdings made cash distributions to PSEG totaling $520 million in the form of returns of capital. Also during 2006, Energy Holdings subsidiaries repaid approximately $51 million of non recourse debt, of which $43 million primarily related to SAESA and TIE, $6 million by Resources and $2 million by EGDC. Debt Covenants PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings PSEGs, PSE&Gs, Powers and Energy Holdings respective credit agreements may contain maximum debt to equity ratios, minimum cash flow tests and other restrictive covenants and conditions to borrowing. Compliance with applicable financial covenants will depend upon the respective future financial position, level of earnings and cash flows of PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings, as to which no assurances can be given. The ratios presented below are for the benefit of the investors of the related securities to which the covenants apply. They are not intended as financial performance or liquidity measures. The debt 74 underlying the preferred securities of PSEG, which is presented in Long Term Debt in accordance with FIN 46, is not included as debt when calculating these ratios, as provided for in the various credit agreements. Energy Holdings credit agreement also contains customary provisions under which the lender could refuse to advance loans in the event of a material adverse change in the borrowers business or financial condition. PSEG Financial covenants contained in PSEGs credit facilities include a ratio of debt (excluding non recourse project financings, securitization debt and debt underlying preferred securities and including commercial paper and loans, certain letters of credit not related to collateral postings for commodity/energy contracts and similar instruments) to total capitalization (including preferred securities outstanding and excluding any impacts for Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income adjustments related to marking energy contracts to market and equity reductions from the funded status of pensions or benefit plans associated with SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans) covenant. This covenant requires that such ratio not be more than 70.0%. As of December 31, 2006, PSEGs ratio of debt to capitalization (as defined above) was 51.6%. PSE&G Financial covenants contained in PSE&Gs credit facilities include a ratio of long term debt (excluding securitization debt, long term debt maturing within one year and short term debt) to total capitalization covenant. This covenant requires that such ratio will not be more than 65.0%. As of December 31, 2006, PSE&Gs ratio of long term debt to total capitalization (as defined above) was 48.5%. In addition, under its First and Refunding Mortgage (Mortgage), PSE&G may issue new First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds against previous additions and improvements, provided that its ratio of earnings to fixed charges calculated in accordance with its Mortgage is at least 2 to 1, and or against retired Mortgage Bonds. As of December 31, 2006, PSE&Gs Mortgage coverage ratio was 4.1 to 1 and the Mortgage would permit up to approximately $2.1 billion aggregate principal amount of new Mortgage Bonds to be issued against previous additions and improvements. Power Financial covenants contained in Powers credit facility include a ratio of debt to total capitalization covenant. The Power ratio is the same debt to total capitalization calculation as set forth above for PSEG except common equity is adjusted for the $986 million Basis Adjustment (see Consolidated Balance Sheets). This covenant requires that such ratio will not exceed 65.0%. As of December 31, 2006, Powers ratio of debt to total capitalization (as defined above) was 38.4%. Energy Holdings Energy Holdings bank revolving credit agreement has a covenant requiring the ratio of Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) to fixed charges to be greater than or equal to 1.75. As of December 31, 2006, Energy Holdings coverage of this covenant was 3.53. Additionally, Energy Holdings must maintain a ratio of net debt (recourse debt offset by funds loaned to PSEG) to EBITDA of less than 5.25. As of December 31, 2006, Energy Holdings ratio under this covenant was 2.59. Energy Holdings is a co borrower under this facility with Global and Resources, which are joint and several obligors. The terms of the agreement include a pledge of Energy Holdings membership interest in Global, restrictions on the use of proceeds related to material sales of assets and the satisfaction of certain financial covenants. Net cash proceeds from asset sales in excess of 5% of total assets of Energy Holdings during any 12 month period must be used to repay any outstanding amounts under the credit agreement. Net cash proceeds from asset sales during any 12 month period in excess of 10% of total assets must be retained by Energy Holdings or used to repay the debt of Energy Holdings, Global or Resources. Energy Holdings indenture with respect to its senior notes does not permit liens securing indebtedness in excess of 10% of consolidated net tangible assets as calculated under the terms of the indenture. The terms of Energy Holdings Senior Notes allow the holders to demand repayment if a transaction or series of related transactions causes the assets of Resources to be reduced by 20% or more and as a direct result there is a downgrade of ratings. 75 Cross Default Provisions PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings The PSEG bank credit agreement contains default provisions under which a default by it in an aggregate amount of $50 million or greater would result in the potential acceleration of payment under this agreement. Under certain conditions, a default by PSE&G or Power in an aggregate amount of $50 million or greater would also result in potential acceleration of payment under this agreement. PSEG has removed Energy Holdings from all cross default provisions. PSEGs bank credit agreement and note purchase agreements related to private placement of debt (collectively, Credit Agreements) contain cross default provisions under which certain payment defaults by PSE&G or Power, certain bankruptcy events relating to PSE&G or Power, the failure by PSE&G or Power to satisfy certain final judgments or the occurrence of certain events of default under the financing agreements of PSE&G or Power, would each constitute an event of default under the PSEG Credit Agreements. Under the note purchase agreements, it is also an event of default if PSE&G or Power ceases to be wholly owned by PSEG. Under the bank credit agreement, both PSE&G and Power would have to cease to be wholly owned by PSEG before an event of default would occur. PSE&G PSE&Gs Mortgage has no cross defaults. The PSE&G Medium Term Note Indenture has a cross default to the PSE&G Mortgage. The PSE&G credit agreement has a provision under which a default by PSE&G in the aggregate of $50 million or greater would result in an event of default and the potential acceleration of payment under that agreement. Power The Power Senior Debt Indenture contains a default provision under which a default by Power, Nuclear, Fossil or ER&T in an aggregate amount of $50 million or greater would result in an event of default and the potential acceleration of payment under the indenture. There are no cross defaults within Powers indenture from PSEG, Energy Holdings or PSE&G. The Power credit agreement also has a provision under which a default by Power, Nuclear, Fossil or ER&T in an aggregate amount of $50 million or greater would result in an event of default and the potential acceleration of payment under that agreement. Energy Holdings Energy Holdings credit agreement and Senior Note Indenture contain default provisions under which a default by it, Resources or Global in an aggregate amount of $25 million or greater would result in an event of default and the potential acceleration of payment under that agreement or the Indenture. Ratings Triggers PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings The debt indentures and credit agreements of PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings do not contain any material ratings triggers that would cause an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a ratings downgrade. However, in the event of a downgrade, any one or more of the affected companies may be subject to increased interest costs on certain bank debt and certain collateral requirements. PSE&G In accordance with the BPU approved requirements under the BGS contracts that PSE&G enters into with suppliers, PSE&G is required to maintain an investment grade credit rating. If PSE&G were to lose its investment grade rating, PSE&G would be required to file with the BPU a plan to assure continued payment for the BGS requirements of its customers. PSE&G is the servicer for the bonds issued by Transition Funding and Transition Funding II. If PSE&G were to lose its investment grade rating, PSE&G would be required to remit collected cash daily to the bond trustee. Currently, cash is remitted monthly. 76 Power In connection with the management and optimization of Powers asset portfolio, ER&T maintains underlying agreements that require Power, as its guarantor under performance guarantees, to satisfy certain creditworthiness standards. In the event of a deterioration of Powers credit rating to below an investment grade rating, many of these agreements allow the counterparty to demand that ER&T provide performance assurance, generally in the form of a letter of credit or cash. As of December 31, 2006, if Power were to lose its investment grade rating and assuming all the counterparties to agreements in which ER&T is out of the money were contractually entitled to demand, and demanded, performance assurance, ER&T could be required to post collateral in an amount equal to approximately $578 million. See Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of the Notes. Credit Ratings PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings Following the termination of the Merger Agreement in September 2006, credit ratings remained unchanged as shown in the table below. Standard & Poors (S&P) affirmed its BBB corporate credit rating for PSEG, Power, and PSE&G. S&P revised its outlook from watch developing to negative. Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) affirmed its credit ratings for PSEG and PSE&G while revising the outlooks from stable to negative. The ratings and outlooks for Power and Energy Holdings were unchanged by Moodys. Fitch Ratings (Fitch) announced there would be no immediate impact on ratings and outlooks for PSEG and its subsidiaries. At that time, the agencies noted that the ratings below were predicated on continued improvement in financial metrics, specifically operating cash flows and ongoing deleveraging, as well as continued strong operating performance from Powers generating units and reasonable outcomes to PSE&Gs pending electric and gas rate cases. If the rating agencies lower or withdraw the credit ratings, such revisions may adversely affect the market price of PSEGs, PSE&Gs, Powers and Energy Holdings securities and serve to materially increase those companies cost of capital and limit their access to capital. Outlooks assigned to ratings are as follows: stable, negative (Neg) or positive (Pos). There is no assurance that the ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be revised by the rating agencies, if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant. Each rating given by an agency should be evaluated independently of the other agencies ratings. The ratings should not be construed as an indication to buy, hold or sell any security.

During the year ended December 31, 2006, Powers Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss decreased from $487 million to $177 million. The primary cause was a decrease of approximately $310 million related to energy and related contracts that qualify for hedge accounting that were entered into by Power in the normal course of business. During the year ended December 31, 2006, the decrease in gas and electric prices resulted in a reduction in unrealized losses on many of those contracts, which are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. This decrease was partially offset by a $173 million adjustment recorded at Power in connection with the adoption of SFAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (SFAS 158). As of December 31, 2006, Energy Holdings had Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income of $103 million. The primary reasons for the improvement, as compared to the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss of $110 million as of December 31, 2005, were the realization of losses on Brazilian currency as a result of the sale of RGE and the unwinding of an interest rate swap due to the sale of Globals facilities in Poland. 78 CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings It is expected that the majority of each subsidiarys capital requirements over the next five years will come from internally generated funds. Projected construction and investment expenditures, excluding nuclear fuel purchases, for PSEGs subsidiaries for the next five years are presented in the table below. These amounts are subject to change, based on various factors. 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 (Millions) PSE&G: Facility Support $ 41 $ 77 $ 76 $ 45 $ 48 Environmental/Regulatory 44 30 31 28 28 Facility Replacement 173 175 178 165 179 System Reinforcement 183 183 185 165 161 New Business 164 163 161 157 159 Total PSE&G 605 628 631 560 575 Power: Hudson Environmental 68 143 229 263 8 Mercer Environmental 126 132 110 83 Other Non Recurring 264 220 64 51 45 Recurring 126 131 113 130 145 Total Power 584 626 516 527 198 Energy Holdings 37 31 40 30 31 Other 35 28 24 24 22 Total PSEG $ 1,261 $ 1,313 $ 1,211 $ 1,141 $ 826 PSE&G In 2006, PSE&G made approximately $528 million of capital expenditures, primarily for reliability of transmission and distribution systems. The $528 million does not include approximately $33 million spent on cost of removal. PSE&Gs projections for future capital expenditures include additions and replacements to its transmission and distribution systems to meet expected growth and to manage reliability. The current projections do not include investments required as a result of PJMs approval of the Regional Transmission Expansion Plan (RTEP) in December 2006. As project scope and cost estimates develop, PSE&G will modify its current projections to include these required investments. Power In 2006, Power made approximately $325 million of capital expenditures (excluding $93 million for nuclear fuel), primarily related to installation of emissions control equipment at the Bridgeport Harbor and Mercer stations, completion of construction at the Linden station, in New Jersey and various other projects at Nuclear and Fossil. The projections above include estimates for Hudson and Mercer related to the agreement reached with the EPA and the NJDEP. They do not include the costs, if any, associated with cooling towers for Salem, if required. For additional discussion of the potential costs related Hudson, Mercer and Salem, see Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of Notes. Energy Holdings In 2006, Energy Holdings incurred approximately $64 million of capital expenditures, primarily related to upgrades and expansion of SAESAs transmission and distribution systems. Energy Holdings capital needs in 2007 will be limited to fulfilling existing contractual and potential contingent commitments. The balance of the forecasted expenditures relates to capital requirements of consolidated subsidiaries, which will primarily be financed from internally generated cash flow within the projects and from local sources on a non recourse basis or limited discretionary investments by Energy Holdings. Such capital requirements include organic growth in SAESAs service territory and other capital improvements at Globals consolidated subsidiaries. 79 Disclosures about Long Term Maturities, Contractual and Commercial Obligations and Certain Investments The following table reflects PSEGs and its subsidiaries contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments in the respective periods in which they are due. In addition, the table summarizes anticipated recourse and non recourse debt maturities for the years shown. The table below does not reflect any anticipated cash payments for pension obligations. The table also does not reflect debt maturities of Energy Holdings non consolidated investments. If those obligations were not able to be refinanced by the project, Energy Holdings may elect to make additional contributions in these investments. For additional information, see Note 10.

See Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of the Notes for further discussion. PSEG and Energy Holdings Global has certain investments that are accounted for under the equity method in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Accordingly, amounts recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for such investments represent Globals equity investment, which is increased for Globals pro rata share of earnings less any dividend distribution from such investments. The companies in which Global invests that are accounted for under the equity method have an aggregate $878 million of debt on their combined, consolidated financial statements. PSEGs pro rata share of such debt is $414 million. This debt is non recourse to PSEG, Energy Holdings and Global. PSEG is generally not required to support the debt service obligations of these companies. However, default with respect to this non recourse debt could result in a loss of invested equity. Resources has investments in leveraged leases that are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases. Leveraged lease investments generally involve three parties: an owner/lessor, a creditor and a lessee. In a typical leveraged lease financing, the lessor purchases an asset to be leased. The purchase price is typically financed 80% with debt provided by the creditor and the balance comes from equity funds provided by the lessor. The creditor provides long term financing to the transaction secured by the property subject to the lease. Such long term financing is non recourse to the lessor and is not presented on Energy Holdings Consolidated Balance Sheets. In the event of default, the leased asset, and in some cases the lessee, secure the loan. As a lessor, Resources has ownership rights to the property and rents the property to the lessees for use in their business operation. As of December 31, 2006, Resources equity investment in leased assets was approximately $924 million, net of deferred taxes of approximately $1.9 billion. For additional information, see Note 8. Long Term Investments of the Notes. In the event that collectibility of the minimum lease payments to be received by the lessor is no longer reasonably assured, the accounting treatment for some of the leases may change. In such cases, Resources may deem that a lessee has a high probability of defaulting on the lease obligation, and would reclassify the lease from a leveraged lease to an operating lease and would consider the need to record an impairment of its investment. Should Resources ever directly assume a debt obligation, the fair value of the underlying asset and the associated debt would be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets instead of the net equity investment in the lease. Energy Holdings has guaranteed certain obligations of its subsidiaries or affiliates related to certain projects. See Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of the Notes for additional information. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings Under GAAP, many accounting standards require the use of estimates, variable inputs and assumptions (collectively referred to as estimates) that are subjective in nature. Because of this, differences between the actual measure realized versus the estimate can have a material impact on results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The managements of PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings have each determined that the following estimates are considered critical to the application of rules that relate to their respective businesses. Accounting for Pensions PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings account for pensions under SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS 87). Pension costs under SFAS 87 are calculated using various economic and demographic assumptions. Economic assumptions include the discount rate and the long term rate of return on trust assets. Demographic assumptions include projections of future mortality rates, pay increases and retirement patterns. In 2006, PSEG and its subsidiaries recorded pension expense of $97 million, compared to $109 million in 2005 and $102 million in 2004. Additionally, in 2006, PSEG and its respective 81 subsidiaries contributed cash of approximately $50 million, compared to cash contributions of $155 million in 2005 and $96 million in 2004. PSEGs discount rate assumption, which is determined annually, is based on the rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits. The discount rate used to calculate pension obligations is determined as of December 31 each year, PSEGs SFAS 87 measurement date. The discount rate used to determine year end obligations is also used to develop the following years net periodic pension cost. The discount rates used in PSEGs 2005 and 2006 net periodic pension costs were 6.00% and 5.75%, respectively. PSEGs 2007 net periodic pension cost was developed using a discount rate of 6.00%. PSEGs expected rate of return on plan assets reflects current asset allocations, historical long term investment performance and an estimate of future long term returns by asset class using input from PSEGs actuary and investment advisors, as well as long term inflation assumptions. For 2005 and 2006, PSEG assumed a rate of return of 8.75% on PSEGs pension plan assets. For 2007, PSEG will continue the rate of return assumption of 8.75%. Based on the above assumptions, PSEG has estimated net period pension costs of approximately $43 million and contributions of up to approximately $66 million in 2007. As part of the business planning process, PSEG has modeled its future costs assuming an 8.75% rate of return and a 6.0% discount rate for 2008 and beyond. Actual future pension expense and funding levels will depend on future investment performance, changes in discount rates, market conditions, funding levels relative to PSEGs projected benefit obligation and accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) and various other factors related to the populations participating in PSEGs pension plans. The following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in certain actuarial assumptions. The effects of the assumption changes shown below solely reflect the impact of that specific assumption. Actuarial Assumption Current Change/(Decrease) As ofDecember 31, 2006Impact onPension BenefitObligation Increase toPension Expensein 2007 (Millions) Discount Rate 6.00 % (1.00 %) $ 555 $ 52 Rate of Return on Plan Assets 8.75 % (1.00 %) $ $ 33 Accounting for Deferred Taxes PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings provide for income taxes based on the liability method required by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, as well as net operating loss and credit carryforwards. PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings evaluate the need for a valuation allowance against their respective deferred tax assets based on the likelihood of expected future taxable income. PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings do not believe a valuation allowance is necessary; however, if the expected level of future taxable income changes or certain tax planning strategies become unavailable, PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings would record a valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period the valuation allowance is deemed necessary. Resources and Globals ability to realize their deferred tax assets are dependent on PSEGs subsidiaries ability to generate ordinary income and capital gains. Hedge and Mark to Market (MTM) Accounting SFAS 133 requires an entity to recognize the fair value of derivative instruments held as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. SFAS 133 applies to all derivative instruments held by PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings. The fair value of most derivative instruments is determined by reference to quoted market prices, listed contracts, or quotations from brokers. Some of these derivative contracts are long term and rely on forward price quotations over the entire duration of the derivative contracts. In the absence of the pricing sources listed above, for a small number of contracts, PSEG and its subsidiary companies utilize mathematical models that rely on historical data to develop forward pricing information in the determination of fair value. Because the determination of fair value using such models is 82 subject to significant assumptions and estimates, PSEG and its subsidiary companies developed reserve policies that are consistently applied to model generated results to determine reasonable estimates of value to record in the financial statements. PSEG and its subsidiaries have entered into various derivative instruments in order to hedge exposure to commodity price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. Many such instruments have been designated as cash flow hedges. For a cash flow hedge, the change in the value of a derivative instrument is measured against the offsetting change in the value of the underlying contract or business condition the derivative instrument is intended to hedge. This is known as the measure of derivative effectiveness. In accordance with SFAS 133, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, net of tax, or as a Regulatory Asset (Liability). Amounts in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss are ultimately recognized in earnings when the related hedged forecasted transaction occurs. During periods of extreme price volatility, there will be significant changes in the value recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. The changes in the fair value of the ineffective portions of derivative instrument designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in earnings. For Powers and Holdings wholesale energy businesses, many of the forward sale, forward purchase and other option contracts are derivative instruments that hedge commodity price risk, but for which the businesses are not able to apply the hedge accounting guidance in SFAS 133. The changes in value of such derivative contracts are marked to market through earnings as commodity prices fluctuate. As a result, the earnings of PSEG, Power and Holdings may experience significant fluctuations depending on the volatility of commodity prices. For Powers energy trading activities, all changes in the fair value of energy trading derivative contracts are recorded in earnings. For additional information regarding Derivative Financial Instruments, see Note 11. Financial Risk Management Activities of the Notes. PSE&G Unbilled Revenues Electric and gas revenues are recorded based on services rendered to customers during each accounting period. PSE&G records unbilled revenues for the estimated amount customers will be billed for services rendered from the time meters were last read to the end of the respective accounting period. Unbilled usage is calculated in two steps. The initial step is to apply a base usage per day to the number of unbilled days in the period. The second step estimates seasonal loads based upon the time of year and the variance of actual degree days and temperature humidity index hours of the unbilled period from expected norms. The resulting usage is priced at current rate levels and recorded as revenue. A calculation of the associated energy cost for the unbilled usage is recorded as well. Each month the prior months unbilled amounts are reversed and the current months amounts are accrued. Using benchmarks other than those used in this calculation could have a material effect on the amounts accrued in a reporting period. The resulting revenue and expense reflect the service rendered in the calendar month. PSE&G SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (SFAS 71) PSE&G prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 71, which differs in certain respects from the application of GAAP by non regulated businesses. In general, SFAS 71 recognizes that accounting for rate regulated enterprises should reflect the economic effects of regulation. As a result, a regulated utility is required to defer the recognition of costs (a regulatory asset) or recognize obligations (a regulatory liability) if it is probable that, through the rate making process, there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in future rates. Accordingly, PSE&G has deferred certain costs, which will be amortized over various future periods. To the extent that collection of such costs or payment of liabilities is no longer probable as a result of changes in regulation and or PSE&Gs competitive position, the associated regulatory asset or liability is charged or credited to income. See Note 5. Regulatory Matters of the Notes for additional information related to these and other regulatory issues. 83 Power NDT Funds Power accounts for the assets in the NDT Funds under SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities (SFAS 115). The assets in the NDT Funds are classified as available for sale securities and are marked to market with unrealized gains and losses recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss unless securities with such unrealized losses are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired. Realized gains, losses and dividend and interest income are recorded on Powers and PSEGs Statements of Operations under Other Income and Other Deductions. Unrealized losses that are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired, as defined under SFAS 115, and related interpretive guidance, are charged against earnings rather than Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. Power and Energy Holdings Accounting for Goodwill Power and Energy Holdings evaluate their respective goodwill for impairment at least annually or when indications of impairment exist. An impairment may exist when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Accounting estimates related to goodwill fair value are highly susceptible to change from period to period because they require management to make cash flow assumptions about future sales, operating costs, economic conditions and discount rates over an indefinite life. The impact of recognizing an impairment could have a material impact on financial position and results of operations. Power and Energy Holdings perform annual goodwill impairment tests and continuously monitor the business environment in which they operate for any impairment issues that may arise. As indicated above, certain assumptions are used to arrive at a fair value for goodwill testing. Such assumptions are consistently employed and include, but are not limited to, free cash flow projections, interest rates, tariff adjustments, economic conditions prevalent in the geographic regions in which Power and Energy Holdings do business, local spot market prices for energy, foreign exchange rates and the credit worthiness of customers. If an adverse event were to occur, such an event could materially change the assumptions used to value goodwill and could result in impairments of goodwill. PSEG and Energy Holdings Foreign Currency Translation Energy Holdings financial statements are prepared using the U.S. Dollar as the reporting currency. In accordance with SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation, for foreign operations whose functional currency is deemed to be the local (foreign) currency, asset and liability accounts are translated into U.S. Dollars at current exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Translation gains and losses (net of applicable deferred taxes) are not included in determining Net Income but are reported in Other Comprehensive Income. Gains and losses on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the results of operations as incurred. The determination of an entitys functional currency requires managements judgment. It is based on an assessment of the primary currency in which transactions in the local environment are conducted, and whether the local currency can be relied upon as a stable currency in which to conduct business. As economic and business conditions change, Energy Holdings is required to reassess the economic environment and determine the appropriate functional currency. The impact of foreign currency accounting could have a material adverse impact on Energy Holdings results of operations. 84 ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings The market risk inherent in PSEGs, PSE&Gs, Powers and Energy Holdings market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity security prices and interest rates as discussed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Notes). It is the policy of each entity to use derivatives to manage risk consistent with its respective business plans and prudent practices. PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings have a Risk Management Committee (RMC) comprised of executive officers who utilize an independent risk oversight function to ensure compliance with corporate policies and prudent risk management practices. Additionally, PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings are exposed to counterparty credit losses in the event of non performance or non payment. PSEG has a credit management process, which is used to assess, monitor and mitigate counterparty exposure for PSEG and its subsidiaries. In the event of non performance or non payment by a major counterparty, there may be a material adverse impact on PSEG and its subsidiaries financial condition, results of operations or net cash flows. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk Energy Holdings Global is exposed to foreign currency risk and other foreign operations risk that arise from investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Primarily, Global is impacted by changes in the U.S. Dollar to Peruvian Nuevo Sol and the Chilean Peso exchange rates and to a much lesser extent, the Euro. Whenever possible, these subsidiaries and affiliates have attempted to limit potential foreign exchange impacts by entering into revenue contracts that adjust to changes in foreign exchange rates. Global also uses foreign currency forward, swap and option agreements to manage risk related to certain foreign currency transactions, when appropriate. Globals investment balances are also impacted by foreign currency changes through translation adjustments. Foreign currency has strengthened on a net basis since Globals acquisitions and investments in Chile and Peru. A foreign currency fluctuation of 10% in such foreign currencies would result in an aggregate change in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income of $92 million. As of December 31, 2006, Energy Holdings net gain in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income from currency fluctuations was approximately $111 million. Commodity Contracts PSEG and Power The availability and price of energy commodities are subject to fluctuations from factors such as weather, environmental policies, changes in supply and demand, state and federal regulatory policies, market rules and other events. To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, Power enters into supply contracts and derivative contracts, including forwards, futures, swaps and options with approved counterparties. These contracts, in conjunction with demand obligations help reduce risk and optimize the value of owned electric generation capacity. Normal Operations and Hedging Activities Power enters into physical contracts, as well as financial contracts, including forwards, futures, swaps and options designed to reduce risk associated with volatile commodity prices. Commodity price risk is associated with market price movements resulting from market generation demand, changes in fuel costs and various other factors. Under SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of qualifying cash flow hedge transactions are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, and gains and losses are recognized in earnings when the underlying transaction occurs. Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that do not meet hedge criteria under SFAS 133 and the ineffective portion of hedge contracts are recognized in earnings currently. Additionally, changes in the fair value attributable to fair value hedges are similarly recognized in earnings. 85 Many non trading contracts qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exemption under SFAS 133 and are accounted for upon settlement. Trading Power maintains a strategy of entering into trading positions to optimize the value of its portfolio of generation assets, gas supply contracts and its electric and gas supply obligations. Power engages in physical and financial transactions in the electricity wholesale markets and executes an overall risk management strategy to mitigate the effects of adverse movements in the fuel and electricity markets. In addition, Power has non asset based trading activities, which have significantly decreased. These contracts also involve financial transactions including swaps, options and futures. These activities are marked to market in accordance with SFAS 133 with gains and losses recognized in earnings. Value at Risk (VaR) Models Power Power uses VaR models to assess the market risk of its commodity businesses. The portfolio VaR model for Power includes its owned generation and physical contracts, as well as fixed price sales requirements, load requirements and financial derivative instruments. VaR represents the potential gains or losses, under normal market conditions, for instruments or portfolios due to changes in market factors, for a specified time period and confidence level. Power estimates VaR across its commodity businesses. Power manages its exposure at the portfolio level. Its portfolio consists of owned generation, load serving contracts (both gas and electric), fuel supply contracts and energy derivatives designed to manage the risk around generation and load. While Power manages its risk at the portfolio level, it also monitors separately the risk of its trading activities and its hedges. Non trading MTM VaR consists of MTM derivatives that are economic hedges, some of which qualify for hedge accounting. The MTM derivatives that are not hedges are included in the trading VaR. The VaR models used by Power are variance/covariance models adjusted for the delta of positions with a 95% one tailed confidence level and a one day holding period for the MTM trading and non trading activities and a 95% one tailed confidence level with a one week holding period for the portfolio VaR. The models assume no new positions throughout the holding periods, whereas Power actively manages its portfolio. Reduced trading activities by Power during 2006 have resulted in less trading risk. As of December 31, 2006, trading VaR was immaterial. As of December 31, 2005, trading VaR was approximately $1 million. For the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Trading VaR Non TradingMTM VaR (Millions) 95% Confidence Level, One Day Holding Period, One Tailed: Period End $ * $ 38 Average for the Period $ * $ 46 High $ * $ 55 Low $ * $ 38 99% Confidence Level, One Day Holding Period, Two Tailed: Period End $ * $ 59 Average for the Period $ * $ 73 High $ * $ 87 Low $ * $ 59 * less than $1 million Interest Rates PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings are subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. It is the policy of PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings to manage interest 86 rate risk through the use of fixed and floating rate debt, interest rate swaps and interest rate lock agreements. PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings manage their respective interest rate exposures by maintaining a targeted ratio of fixed and floating rate debt. As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10% change in market interest rates would result in a $7 million, $3 million, $1 million and an insignificant change (less than $500 thousand) in annual interest costs related to debt at PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10% change in market interest rates would result in a $7 million, $77 million, $105 million and $32 million change in the fair value of the debt of PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings, respectively. Debt and Equity Securities PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings PSEG has approximately $3.4 billion invested in its pension plans. Although fluctuations in market prices of securities within this portfolio do not directly affect PSEGs earnings in the current period, changes in the value of these investments could affect PSEGs future contributions to these plans, its financial position if its ABO under its pension plans exceeds the fair value of its pension funds and future earnings as PSEG could be required to adjust pension expense and its assumed rate of return. Power Powers NDT Funds are comprised of both fixed income and equity securities totaling $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2006. The fair value of equity securities is determined independently each month by the Trustee. As of December 31, 2006, the portfolio was comprised of approximately $785 million of equity securities and approximately $471 million in fixed income securities. The fair market value of the assets in the NDT Funds will fluctuate primarily depending upon the performance of equity markets. As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10% change in the equity market would impact the value of the equity securities in the NDT Funds by approximately $79 million. Power uses duration to measure the interest rate sensitivity of the fixed income portfolio. Duration is a summary statistic of the effective average maturity of the fixed income portfolio. The benchmark for the fixed income component of the NDT Funds is the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which currently has duration of 4.46 years and a yield of 5.34%. The portfolios value will appreciate or depreciate by the duration with a 1% change in interest rates. As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates would result in a decline in the market value for the fixed income portfolio of approximately $7.8 million. Credit Risk PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings Credit risk relates to the risk of loss that PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings would incur as a result of non performance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings have established credit policies that they believe significantly minimize credit risk. These policies include an evaluation of potential counterparties financial condition (including credit rating), collateral requirements under certain circumstances and the use of standardized agreements, which may allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty. PSE&G BGS suppliers expose PSE&G to credit losses in the event of non performance or non payment upon a default of the BGS supplier. Credit requirements are governed under BPU approved BGS contracts. Power Counterparties expose Powers trading operation to credit losses in the event of non performance or non payment. Power has a credit management process, which is used to assess, monitor and mitigate counterparty exposure for Power and its subsidiaries. Powers counterparty credit limits are based on a 87 scoring model that considers a variety of factors, including leverage, liquidity, profitability, credit ratings and risk management capabilities. Powers trading operations have entered into payment netting agreements or enabling agreements that allow for payment netting with the majority of its large counterparties, which reduce Powers exposure to counterparty risk by providing the offset of amounts payable to the counterparty against amounts receivable from the counterparty. In the event of non performance or non payment by a major counterparty, there may be a material adverse impact on Powers and its subsidiaries financial condition, results of operations or net cash flows. As of December 31, 2006, approximately 97% of the credit exposure (MTM plus net receivables and payables, less cash collateral) for Powers trading operations was with investment grade counterparties. The majority of the credit exposure with non investment grade counterparties was with certain companies that supply fuel (primarily coal) to Power. Therefore, this exposure relates to the risk of a counterparty performing under its obligations rather than payment risk. As of December 31, 2006, Powers trading operations had over 121 active counterparties. Energy Holdings Global Global has credit risk with respect to its counterparties to power purchase agreements (PPAs) and other parties. Resources As of December 31, 2006, Resources has a remaining gross investment in three leased aircraft of approximately $41 million, all with Northwest airlines. Resources successfully restructured the leases and converted them from leveraged leases to operating leases. Energy Holdings expects to recover its investment through cash flows from the operating leases. Resources has credit risk related to its investments in leveraged leases, totaling $924 million, which is net of deferred taxes of $1.9 billion, as of December 31, 2006. These investments are largely concentrated in the energy industry. As of December 31, 2006, 67% of counterparties in the lease portfolio were rated investment grade by both S&P and Moodys. As of December 31, 2006, the weighted average credit rating of the lessees in Resources leasing portfolio was A/A3 by S&P and Moodys respectively. Resources is the lessor of domestic generating facilities in several U.S. energy markets. Several of these lessees have credit ratings below investment grade. Resources investment in such transactions was approximately $264 million, net of deferred taxes of $510 million as of December 31, 2006. The credit exposure to the lessees is partially mitigated through various credit enhancement mechanisms within the lease transactions. These credit enhancement features vary from lease to lease. Some of the leasing transactions include covenants that restrict the flow of dividends from the lessee to its parent, over collateralization of the lessee with non leased assets, historical and forward cash flow coverage tests that prohibit discretionary capital expenditures and dividend payments to the parent/lessee if stated minimum coverages are not met and similar cash flow restrictions if ratings are not maintained at stated levels. These covenants are designed to maintain cash reserves in the transaction entity for the benefit of the non recourse lenders and the lessor/equity participants in the event of a market downturn or degradation in operating performance of the leased assets. In any lease transaction, in the event of a default, Energy Holdings would exercise its rights and attempt to seek recovery of its investment. The results of such efforts may not be known for a period of time. A bankruptcy of a lessee and failure to recover adequate value could lead to a foreclosure of the lease. Under a worst case scenario, if a foreclosure were to occur, Resources would record a pre tax write off up to its gross investment, including deferred taxes, in these facilities. Also, in the event of a potential foreclosure, the net tax benefits generated by Resources portfolio of investments could be materially reduced in the period in which gains associated with the potential forgiveness of debt at these projects occurs. The amount and timing of any potential reduction in net tax benefits is dependent upon a number of factors including, but not limited to, the time of a potential foreclosure, the amount of lease debt outstanding, any cash trapped at the projects and negotiations during such potential foreclosure process. The potential loss of earnings, impairment and or tax payments could have a material impact to PSEGs and Energy Holdings financial position, results of operations and net cash flows. 88 Other Supplemental Information Regarding Market Risk Power The following table describes the drivers of Powers energy trading and marketing activities and Operating Revenues included in its Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2006. Normal operations and hedging activities represent the marketing of electricity available from Powers owned or contracted generation sold into the wholesale market. As the information in this table highlights, MTM activities represent a small portion of the total Operating Revenues for Power. Activities accounted for under the accrual method, including normal purchases and sales, account for the majority of the revenue. The MTM activities reported here are those relating to changes in fair value due to external movement in prices. For additional information, see Note 11. Financial Risk Management Activities of the Notes.

For contracts where no quoted market exists, modeling techniques were employed using assumptions reflective of current market rates, yield curves and forward prices as applicable to interpolate certain prices. The effect of using such modeling techniques is not material to Powers financial results. PSEG, Power and Energy Holdings The following table identifies losses on cash flow hedges that are currently in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, a separate component of equity. Power uses forward sale and purchase contracts, swaps and firm transmission rights contracts to hedge forecasted energy sales from its generation stations and its contracted supply obligations. Power also enters into swaps, options and futures transactions to hedge the price of fuel to meet its fuel purchase requirements for generation. PSEG, Power and Energy Holdings are subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. PSEGs policy is to manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and interest rate derivatives. The table also provides an estimate of the losses, net of taxes that are expected to be reclassified out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss and into earnings over the next twelve months.

Credit exposure is defined as any positive results of netting accounts receivable/accounts payable and the forward value on open positions. It further delineates that exposure by the credit rating of the counterparties and provides guidance on the concentration of credit risk to individual counterparties and an indication of the maturity of a companys credit risk by credit rating of the counterparties.

A counterparty may have posted more collateral than the outstanding exposure, in which case there would not be exposure.
