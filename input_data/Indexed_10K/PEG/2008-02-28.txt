ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A) This combined MD&A is separately filed by Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (PSEG), PSEG Power LLC (Power) and Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G). Information contained herein relating to any individual company is filed by such company on its own behalf. Power and PSE&G each make representations only as to itself and make no other representations whatsoever as to any other company. OVERVIEW OF 2007 AND FUTURE OUTLOOK PSEG, Power and PSE&G PSEGs business consists of four reportable segments, which are Power, PSE&G and the two direct subsidiaries of Energy Holdings L.L.C. (Energy Holdings), PSEG Global L.L.C. (Global) and PSEG Resources L.L.C. (Resources). The following discussion relates to the regions and markets in which PSEGs 47 subsidiaries operate and compete, the corporate strategy for the conduct of PSEGs businesses within these markets and significant events that have occurred during 2007 and expectations for 2008 for Power, PSE&G and Energy Holdings, as well as the key factors that will drive the future performance of these businesses. Stock Split On January 15, 2008, PSEGs Board of Directors approved a two for one stock split of PSEGs outstanding shares of common stock. The stock split entitled each stockholder of record at the close of business on January 25, 2008 to receive one additional share for every outstanding share of common stock held. The additional shares resulting from the stock split were distributed on February 4, 2008. All share and per share amounts included in this Form 10 K retroactively reflect the effect of the stock split. Power Power is an electric generation and wholesale energy marketing and trading company that is focused on a generation market in the Northeast and Mid Atlantic U.S. Through its subsidiaries, Power seeks to produce low cost energy through efficient operations of its nuclear, coal and gas fired generation facilities, balance its generation production, fuel requirements and supply obligations through energy portfolio management and pursue disciplined growth. In addition to the electric generation business, Powers revenues include gas supply sales under the Basic Gas Supply Service (BGSS) contract with PSE&G. Powers principal operating subsidiaries, PSEG Fossil LLC (Fossil), PSEG Nuclear LLC (Nuclear) and PSEG Energy Resources & Trade LLC (ER&T) are regulated by the FERC. ER&T and Fossils subsidiary, PSEG Power Connecticut LLC, sell power at wholesale under Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved market based rate tariffs. Certain subsidiaries of Fossil are subject to state regulation and Nuclear is also subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. As a merchant generator, Powers profit is derived from selling under contract or on the spot market a range of diverse products such as energy, capacity, emissions credits, congestion credits and a series of energy related products that the system operator uses to optimize the operation of the energy grid, known as ancillary services. Accordingly, the availability of Powers diverse fleet of generation units to produce these products as well as the prices of commodities, such as electricity, gas, nuclear fuel, coal and emissions, can have a material effect on Powers profitability. In recent years, the prices at which transactions are entered into for future delivery of these products, as evidenced through the market for forward contracts at points such as PJM Interconnection L.L.C. (PJM) West, have escalated considerably over historical prices. Broad market price increases such as these have had a positive effect on Powers results. Historically, Powers nuclear and coal fired facilities have produced over 50% and 25% of Powers production, respectively. With the vast majority of its power sourced from these lower cost units, the rise in electric prices has yielded higher margins for Power. Over a longer term horizon, if these higher prices are sustained at levels reflective of what the current forward markets indicate, Power would have an attractive environment in which to contract for the sale of its anticipated output, allowing for potentially sustained higher profitability than recognized in prior years. These prices also increase the cost of replacement power, thereby placing risk on Power to operate the generating units to produce these products. Further, changes in the operation of Powers generating facilities, fuel and capacity prices, expected contract prices, capacity factors or other assumptions could materially affect its ability to meet earnings targets and or liquidity requirements. Power seeks to mitigate volatility in its results by contracting in advance for a significant portion of its anticipated electric output, capacity and fuel needs. Power believes this contracting strategy increases stability of earnings and cash flow. Power seeks to sell a portion of its anticipated low cost nuclear and coal fired generation over a multi year forward horizon, normally over a period of two to four years. As of February 15, 2008, Power has contracted for all of its anticipated 2008 nuclear and coal fired generation, with 85% to 95% contracted for 2009 and 40% to 50% contracted for 2010, with a modest amount contracted beyond 2010. Power has also entered into contracts for the future delivery of nuclear fuel and coal to support its contracted sales discussed above. As of February 15, 2008, Power had contracted for 100% of its annual nuclear uranium fuel needs through 2011 with decreasing percentages contracted through 2016. Power had also contracted for 85% to 95% of its anticipated coal needs, including transportation, for 2008, 75% to 85% for 2009, 55% to 65% for 2010 and modest amounts contracted beyond 2010. These estimated fuel needs are subject to change based upon the level of operation, and particular to coal, market demands 48 and pricing, which has increased recently. Power has recently negotiated through some disruptions in the delivery of certain contracted coal. Power believes it can continue to manage its fuel sourcing needs in this dynamic market but cannot predict the impact that rising prices and potential increasing demand may have on its operations in the future. By contrast, Power takes a more opportunistic approach in hedging its anticipated natural gas fired generation. The generation from these units is less predictable, as these units are generally dispatched only when aggregate market demand has exceeded the supply provided by lower cost units. The natural gas fired units generally provide a lower contribution to the margin of Power than either the nuclear or coal units. Power will generally purchase natural gas as gas fired generation is required to supply forward sale commitments. In a changing market environment, this hedging strategy may cause Powers realized prices to be materially different than current market prices. At the present time, some of Powers existing contractual obligations, entered into during lower priced periods, are anticipated to result in lower margins than would have been the case if no or little hedging activity had been conducted. Alternatively, in a falling price environment, this hedging strategy will tend to create margins in excess of those implied by the then current market. Overview and Future Outlook During 2007, Power continued to benefit from strong energy markets and sustained strong performance of its generating facilities. Going forward, Power expects continued strong margins as higher prices for its nuclear and coal fired generation output are realized due to the rolling nature of its forward hedge positions and the expiration of older lower priced power contracts. In the electricity markets where Power participates, the pricing of electricity can vary by location. For example, prices may be higher in congested areas due to transmission constraints during peak demand periods, reflecting the bid prices of the higher cost units that are dispatched to meet demand. This typically occurs in the eastern portion of PJM, where many of Powers plants are located. At various times, depending upon its production and its obligations, these price differentials can serve to increase or decrease Powers profitability. In PJM, the Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) provides generators with capacity payments for the reliability provided by their respective facilities. The Forward Capacity Market (FCM) in the New England Power Pool provides for similar reliability based capacity payments. The FERC has approved the market changes in each of these markets, beginning on June 1, 2007 for the RPM transition period and on December 1, 2006 for the FCM transition period. In October 2007, Power initiated planning activities with respect to the construction of 300 MW to 400 MW of new gas fired peaking capacity that could be available to bid into PJMs RPM base residual auctions in 2008. Power estimates that the cost of this new construction could range from $250 million to $350 million. Power has requested that PJM perform feasibility studies to determine the system impact of adding incremental gas fired capacity at some of its existing generating stations located in the constrained Eastern MAAC reliability region. Powers final decision whether or not to proceed with construction of any of these units would depend on estimated capital and interconnection costs, available siting and Powers ability to meet environmental permitting requirements. The costs related to these units are included in Powers forecasted capital expenditures. Power is also currently exploring a number of other initiatives for potential growth or development such as the possibility of supplying power directly to New York City from Powers Bergen 2 generating facility or the potential to build new nuclear generation. There is no guarantee that such initiatives will be achieved since many issues would need to be considered, such as system reliability concerns, regulatory approvals and construction or development costs. Power does believe it has reasonable opportunities to grow its business. A key factor in Powers ability to achieve its objectives is its ability to operate its nuclear and fossil stations at sufficient capacity factors to limit the need to purchase higher priced electricity to satisfy its obligations. Powers ability to achieve its objectives will also depend on the continuation of reasonable capacity markets. Power must also be able to effectively manage its construction projects and continue to economically operate its generation facilities under increasingly stringent environmental requirements, including legislation, regulation and voluntary restrictions to address: 49 the control of carbon dioxide emissions to reduce the effects of global climate change and greenhouse gas; other emissions such as nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and mercury; and the potential need for significant upgrades to existing intake structures and cooling systems at its larger once through cooled plants, including Salem, Hudson, Mercer, Sewaren, New Haven and Bridgeport. Power has two large environmental back end technology projects underway at its Mercer and Hudson coal plants aggregating approximately $1.1 billion in capital costs. These projects are scheduled to be completed by the end of 2010. Power is focused on completing these projects on schedule and within the established budgets, but faces many risks typically involved in managing large construction projects. In addition, with an increase in competition and market complexity and constantly changing forward prices, there is no assurance that Power will be able to contract its output at attractive prices. While these increases may have a potentially significant beneficial impact on margins, they could also raise any replacement power costs that Power may incur in the event of unanticipated outages, and could also further increase liquidity requirements as a result of contract obligations. For additional information on liquidity requirements, see Liquidity and Capital Resources. Power could also be impacted by a number of events, including regulatory or legislative actions favoring non competitive markets, energy efficiency initiatives, and regulatory policies favoring the construction of rate based transmission that may result in increased imports of generation, which may be subject to less stringent environmental regulation, into areas served by Powers generation assets. Further, some of the market based mechanisms in which Power participates, including Basic Generation Service (BGS) auctions and RPM capacity payments, are at times the subject of review or discussion by some of the participants in the New Jersey and federal regulatory and political arenas and the PJM market monitor. Power can provide no assurance that these mechanisms will continue to exist in their current form for the foreseeable future. PSE&G PSE&G operates as an electric and gas public utility in New Jersey under cost based regulation by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) for its distribution operations and by the FERC for its electric transmission and wholesale sales operations. Consequently, the earnings of PSE&G are largely determined by the regulation of its rates by those agencies. The BPU approved rate increases for gas delivery service in November 2006. Under the terms of the settlement of its electric and gas base rate cases, PSE&G is required to file jointly for any gas and electric petition for future base rate increases and no base rate changes may become effective before November 15, 2009. Overview and Future Outlook In February 2007, the BPU approved the results of New Jerseys annual BGS Fixed Price (FP) and BGS Commercial and Industrial Energy Price auctions and PSE&G successfully secured contracts to provide the electricity requirements for the majority of its customers needs. The Governor of New Jersey has directed the BPU, in partnership with other New Jersey agencies, to develop an Energy Master Plan (EMP) that reduces energy consumption while emphasizing energy efficiency, conservation and renewable energy resources to meet New Jerseys future energy demands without increasing its reliance on non renewable resources. In conjunction with these efforts, on April 19, 2007, PSE&G filed a proposal with the BPU designed to spur investment in solar power in New Jersey and meet energy goals under the EMP. Under the plan, PSE&G would invest approximately $100 million over two years following BPU approval of the plan to help finance the installation of solar systems throughout its service area. Under the Solar Energy Program, PSE&G would loan money to customers in its electric service territory for the installation of solar photovoltaic systems on the customers premises. The borrowers would repay the loans over a period of either 10 years (for residential customer loans) or 15 years (for all other loans) by providing PSE&G with solar renewable energy certificates (SRECs). Borrowers also have the option to repay the loans with cash. PSE&G has proposed that it be allowed to earn a fair return on and of its investment, and fully recover its administrative costs to implement the Solar Energy Program, through its regulated rates. 50 If approved by the BPU, the initiative could begin in the second quarter of 2008 and support 30 MW of solar power in the following two years, fulfilling approximately 50% of the BPUs Renewal Portfolio Standard requirements in PSE&Gs service area for energy years 2009 and 2010. On July 12, 2007, the BPU established a schedule for consideration of this proposal. PSE&G has held a series of stakeholder meetings to discuss program details with interested parties. Settlement discussions are ongoing, with a BPU decision expected in early 2008. The outcome of this proceeding cannot be predicted at this time. On June 8, 2007, PSE&G endorsed the construction of three new 500 kV transmission lines intended to significantly improve the reliability of the electrical grid serving New Jersey customers. On June 22, 2007, PJMs Board of Managers approved construction of one of the proposed lines and assigned construction responsibility to PSE&G, Pennsylvania Power and Light and FirstEnergy Corporation (FirstEnergy) for their respective service territories. On October 9, 2007, PJM provided a formal letter notification to PSE&G identifying PSE&G as the responsible party for the construction of both its portion of the new line and the portion originally assigned to FirstEnergy in New Jersey. The estimated cost of PSE&Gs portion of this construction project is between $600 million and $650 million. PSE&Gs costs will go into transmission rate base, subject to regulatory approval, and can be expected to have a positive impact on revenues and earnings for PSE&G. In addition, the U.S. Department of Energy has now designated the Mid Atlantic Area Corridor, which encompasses all of New Jersey, as a National Interest Electric Transmission Corridor to which the FERC back stop eminent domain authority will attach. The two other lines which PSE&G has endorsed have not yet been submitted to PJM for approval, as required by PJM rules, but PSE&G believes that construction of these lines, which would follow existing transmission rights of way, are needed to enhance the reliability of the transmission system. PJM has proposed significant changes to the rules establishing how economic transmission gets built within PJM. Economic transmission is transmission that is being built to reduce economic congestion on the system, as congestion can result in higher electricity prices paid by consumers located within congested areas. PJM proposes to forecast congestion levels well into the future and to use these forecasts as the basis for determining the benefits of an economic transmission project. PJMs proposal is focused on rate based rather than market conditions solutions. Power and PSE&G have actively participated in the FERC proceeding that is still considering the specifics of PJMs proposal. On June 1, 2007, new electric BGS FP rates went into effect with an expected increase of approximately 12% to residential customers bills. There was no change to the BGSS residential rate during 2007. As a result of the February 2008 auction new BGS FP rates will increase the average residential customers bill by approximately 12% effective June 2008. The risks to PSE&Gs business generally relate to the treatment of the various rate and other issues by the state and federal regulatory agencies, specifically the BPU and the FERC. PSE&Gs success will depend, in part, on its ability to attain a reasonable rate of return, continue cost containment initiatives, maintain system reliability and safety levels, continue recovery of the regulatory assets it has deferred and attain an adequate return on the investments it plans to make in its electric and gas transmission and distribution system and the level of recovery of distribution revenues in light of customer demand and conservation efforts. Also, PSE&Gs recent incentive rate treatment request for the Susquehanna Roseland line and classifying the new 69 kV facilities as transmission would result in improvements in reliability and more expeditious rate treatment for these facilities. The FERCs ruling regarding PJM long term transmission rate design, which remains subject to rehearing, benefits PSE&G customers by preserving lower rates than would likely be in effect under proposed rate design modifications. Since PSE&G earns no margin on the commodity portion of its electric and gas sales through tariff agreements, there is no anticipated commodity price volatility for PSE&G; however, commodity costs continue to put upward pressure on customer charges. Global Overview and Future Outlook Global has reduced its international risk by monetizing the majority of its international investments. On October 17, 2007, Global closed on the sale of its interests in Electroandes S.A. (Electroandes), its 180 MW hydro electric generation and transmission company in Peru to a wholly owned subsidiary of 51 Statkraft Norfund Power Invest (SN Power) of Norway for a total purchase price of approximately $390 million (subject to working capital and other adjustments), including the assumption of approximately $108 million of debt. After tax net cash proceeds, including dividends paid prior to closing, were approximately $220 million. On December 14, 2007, Global closed on the sale its 50% ownership interest in Chilquinta Energia S.A. (Chilquinta), an electric distribution company in Chile, and its 38% ownership of Luz del Sur S.A.A. (LDS), an electric distribution company in Peru to a subsidiary of AEI (formerly Ashmore Energy International), for approximately $685 million. After tax net cash proceeds were approximately $480 million. On December 18, 2007, PSEG announced its intention to sell its equity interest in the SAESA Group. The SAESA Group is Globals largest remaining international investment, consisting of four distribution companies, one transmission company and a generation facility located in Chile. For additional information on Electroandes, Chilquinta, LDS and SAESA, see Note 4. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions, Acquisitions and Impairments. Domestically, Global has investments in power producers that own and operate electric generation in Texas, California and Hawaii, with smaller investments in New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. Global expects these operations to continue to perform well and provide the opportunity for growth. As a merchant generation business with a load following asset profile, Globals largest domestic investment is in two generating facilities in Texas, and, as such, its success will be driven by the efficient operation of those plants and by changes in market conditions, particularly projected market heat rates and weather. Global seeks to sell its output from its Texas facilities by entering into a mix of contracts consisting of standard on peak calendar transactions and structured contracts normally selling forward 30% to 50% of its available capacity with the balance sold during the year and in the daily balancing and ancillary service markets. Globals results from its investments in Texas are also impacted by the recognition of unrealized mark to market (MTM) gains and losses on fixed price contracts that expire in 2010. Beginning in December 2008, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) will transition from a zonal market to a nodal wholesale market. The redesigned grid will consist of more than 4,000 nodes replacing the current four congestion management zones. The implementation of the nodal market design is expected to deliver improved price signals, improved dispatch efficiencies and direct assignment of local congestion. PSEG is currently evaluating the potential impact this change will have on its Texas generation facilities. Global is also continuing to explore options for monetizing its other remaining international investments in Italy, Venezuela and India, which total approximately $123 million. In June 2007, Global restarted Bioenergie S.p.A.s (Bioenergie) San Marco biomass generation facility after a seven month outage due to a pending criminal investigation regarding allegations of violations of the facilitys air permit. With respect to Globals investment in Turboven Company Inc. (Turboven), Global recently entered into preliminary valuation discussions with the government of Venezuela as part of the nationalization efforts which are ongoing. Based upon a recent review of the circumstances, an impairment charge of $7 million, after tax, was recorded in September 2007 to further write down Globals Venezuelan investments. No assurances can be given as to whether Global can recover the current book value of the investments in Venezuela. Globals investment in India is currently more stable than in prior years as evidenced by dividend payments of $6 million in 2007 and $2 million during 2006. The value of Globals investment in PPN Power Generating Company Limited (PPN), India was adjusted down by $2 million, after tax, to reflect the estimated current market value of PPN. Global is pursuing the potential development of wind, biomass and solar projects, primarily in PSEGs core markets. Resources Overview and Future Outlook Resources primarily has invested in energy related leveraged leases. Resources is focused on maintaining its current investment portfolio and does not expect to make any new investments. Resources future performance is subject to tax risks related to its lease transactions. See Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities for further discussion. 52 PSEG faces significant risk at Resources related to the tax treatment of uncertain tax positions which was impacted by new accounting guidance under FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement 109 (FIN 48) and FASB Staff Position No. FSP 13 2, Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction (FSP 13 2), both of which were effective as of January 1, 2007. This new guidance also reduced PSEGs earnings by approximately $30 million in 2007 as compared to 2006. Resources future earnings could also be impacted by changes to uncertain tax positions as determined by changes in substantive tax law and tax audit results, including resolution of tax audit claims associated with its leveraged lease transactions. See Note 2. Recent Accounting Standards and Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities for further discussion.

It also includes certain financing costs at the parent company. For additional information on intercompany transactions, see Note 21. Related Party Transactions. For a discussion of the causes for the variances at PSEG in the table above, see the discussions for Power, PSE&G and Energy Holdings that follow. Power For the year ended December 31, 2007, Power had Net Income of $941 million, an increase of $665 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Excluding the Losses from Discontinued Operations of Lawrenceburg of $8 million and $239 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, Income from Continuing Operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $949 million, an increase of $434 million as compared to 2006. The primary reasons for the increase in Income from Continuing Operations were higher prices realized from new contracts, including BGS contracts, combined with higher sales volumes and lower generation costs. Improved margins and higher sales volumes under the BGSS contract due to a colder winter heating season and more favorable fuel pricing in 2007 also contributed to the increase. The increase in Income from Continuing Operations also included the recognition of non trading MTM losses of $6 million, after tax, in 2007 as compared to $1 million of after tax MTM losses in 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2006, Power had Net Income of $276 million, an increase of $84 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Excluding Losses from Discontinued Operations of Lawrenceburg and Waterford of $239 million and $226 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, and a $16 million charge recorded for the cumulative effect adjustment of adopting FIN 47 in 2005, Income from Continuing Operations was $515 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $81 million as compared to 2006. The increase primarily resulted from higher BGS contract prices and higher sales volumes in the various power pools, supported by improved nuclear operations and the commencement of commercial operations at Linden in May 2006 and at the Bethlehem Energy Center (BEC) in July 2005 and lower generation costs due to lower pool prices and lower demand under BGS contracts. Power also had lower non trading losses, which were approximately $1 million in 2006 as compared to $8 million in 2005. Powers increased earnings were partially offset by reduced margins on BGSS, as market prices for natural gas declined from historically high price levels experienced in the second half of 2005 while the cost of gas in inventory was reasonably stable, and lower demand in 2006 due to a warmer winter heating system and customer conservation. Powers 2006 earnings were also affected by a $44 million pre tax write down of four gas turbines, which were sold in April 2007, a $30 million after tax decrease in Income from the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT) Funds and higher Operation and Maintenance Costs, Depreciation and Amortization and Interest Expense related to operation of the Linden and BEC facilities. 54 The year over year detail for these variances for these periods are discussed in more detail below: For the YearsEnded December 31, 2007 vs 2006 2006 vs 2005 2007 2006 2005 Increase(Decrease) % Increase(Decrease) % (Millions) (Millions) (Millions) Operating Revenues $ 6,796 $ 6,057 $ 6,027 $ 739 12 $ 30 N/A Energy Costs $ 3,975 $ 3,955 $ 4,266 $ 20 1 $ (311 ) (7 ) Operation and Maintenance $ 1,001 $ 958 $ 939 $ 43 4 $ 19 2 Write Down of Assets $ $ 44 $ $ (44 ) (100 ) $ 44 N/A Depreciation and Amortization $ 140 $ 140 $ 114 $ N/A $ 26 23 Other Income and Deductions $ 69 $ 66 $ 144 $ 3 5 $ (78 ) (54 ) Interest Expense $ (159 ) $ (148 ) $ (100 ) $ 11 7 $ 48 48 Income Tax Expense $ (641 ) $ (363 ) $ (318 ) $ 278 77 $ 45 14 Loss from Discontinued Operations, including Loss on Disposal, net of tax $ (8 ) $ (239 ) $ (226 ) $ (231 ) (97 ) $ 13 6 Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle, net of tax $ $ $ (16 ) $ N/A $ 16 N/A Operating Revenues The $739 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to 2006 was due to increases of $416 million in generation revenues and $349 million in gas supply revenues, which were partially offset by $26 million in lower trading revenues. The $30 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to 2005 was due to increases of $238 million in generation revenues and $27 million in trading revenues, which were partially offset by a decrease of $235 million in gas supply revenues. Generation The $416 million increase in generation revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 2006, was primarily due to higher revenues of $355 million from higher prices on BGS fixed price contracts. Also contributing to the increase was $149 million from higher capacity prices resulting from the changes in the capacity markets in PJM and Connecticut, which resulted in $47 million in reduced RMR revenues in these markets. Power also had increased revenues resulting from more generation being sold into the various pools in which it operated following the expiration of certain of its wholesale power contracts. The increased revenues from sales into the various pools offset the reduction in wholesale contract revenues. The $238 million increase in generation revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to an increase of $238 million from higher sales volumes in the various power pools, supported by improved nuclear operations and the commencement of the commercial operations of Linden in May 2006 and BEC in July 2005, partially offset by lower pool prices. Also contributing to the increase was $92 million of higher BGS contract revenues due to higher contract prices which were partly offset by a reduction in load being served under the fixed price BGS contracts and termination of BGS hourly contracts in May 2006. The increases were partially offset by a decrease of $58 million due to certain wholesale contracts ending in 2005 and early 2006 and $33 million of unrealized losses on asset backed electric forward contracts. Gas Supply The $349 increase in gas supply revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 2006, includes $248 million resulting from higher sales volumes under the BGSS contract, largely due to colder average temperatures in the 2007 winter heating season. The increase was also attributable to the recognition of gains of $69 million on financial hedging transactions. The remaining increases were primarily due to increased pricing and volumes sold to other gas distributors and increased revenues received for balancing and storage due to higher sales volumes and higher tariff rates that became effective in January 2007. The $235 million decrease in gas supply revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to decreases of $334 million due to lower demand under the BGSS contract in 2006 due to a warmer winter heating season and improved customer conservation in 2006 and $94 million in 55 decreased prices and gas volumes and pipeline capacity sold to other gas customers. The decreases were partially offset by an increase of $188 million due to higher prices under the BGSS contract. Trading The $26 million decrease in trading revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 2006, was due mainly to the absence of gains related to emissions credits that were realized in 2006. The $27 million increase in trading revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was principally due to higher realized gains related to emissions credits. Operating Expenses Energy Costs Energy Costs represent the cost of generation, which includes fuel purchases for generation as well as purchased energy in the market, and gas purchases to meet Powers obligation under its BGSS contract with PSE&G. The $20 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 2006, was due to a $247 million increase in gas costs offset by a decrease of $227 million in generation costs. The increase in gas costs reflected a $245 million increase due to a higher volume of gas sold to satisfy Powers BGSS obligations and an increase of $16 million due to the recognition of losses in 2007 coupled with gains in 2006 related to financial hedging transactions. The decrease in generation costs reflected decreases of $275 million due to lower pool purchases, primarily resulting from reduced load obligations in Connecticut following the expiration of a wholesale power contract in 2006, combined with $61 million in lower congestion and transmission costs. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $154 million due to higher volumes of fuel purchases, primarily natural gas, as these units ran more during 2007. The $311 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to decreases of $267 million from lower pool prices and lower demand under BGS contracts, $144 million from a reduced volume of gas purchased to satisfy Powers BGSS obligations, partially offset by higher gas prices related to inventory for the 2005/2006 winter heating season, and $58 million due to favorable pricing of fuel related asset backed transactions in 2006. These decreases were partially offset by $80 million of losses realized on gas hedges in 2006, an increase of $42 million in fuel costs and an increase of $35 million in transmission fees. The increase in fuel costs was largely due to higher volumes of gas purchased to meet increased production by the gas fired plants, including Linden and BEC, and higher oil prices, partially offset by lower gas prices during 2006 and a lower volume of oil purchases due to reduced running times of certain of the oil fired plants in 2006. Operation and Maintenance The $43 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 2006, was principally due to costs incurred in 2007 related to various maintenance projects at certain fossil stations, mainly Hudson and Mercer. The $19 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was principally due to higher maintenance costs of $60 million related to certain of the fossil plants and scheduled outages at the nuclear units. These increases were partially offset by the absence of a $14 million restructuring charge recorded in 2005 related to Nuclears workforce realignment plan, a decrease of $10 million in payroll and benefits due to a reduction in employees and a decrease of $14 million in fees paid to Services for information technology and various administrative services. Write Down of Assets The $44 million write down of assets recorded in 2006 related to four turbines for which Power had no immediate use and which Power sold in April 2007. For additional information, see Note 4. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions, Acquisitions and Impairments. 56 Depreciation and Amortization There was no material change in Depreciation and Amortization for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to 2006. The $26 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to the Linden and BEC plants being placed into service in May 2006 and July 2005, respectively. Other Income and Deductions The $3 million increase in Other Income and Deductions for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to 2006, was principally due to increased realized income of $76 million related to the NDT Funds, the absence of $14 million of penalties referenced below that were recorded in 2006 and increased interest income of $13 million from short term loans to PSEG (as parent company). These increases were partially offset by increased realized losses of $34 million and increased charges of $58 million recorded in 2007 for other than temporary impairments related to the NDT Fund securities and the absence of $6 million of expense reversals recorded in 2006 related to certain excess liability reserves. The $78 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to decreased net realized income of $29 million and increased realized losses of $19 million related to the NDT Funds. Also contributing to the decrease were charges recorded in 2006 of $14 million for an other than temporary impairment of certain NDT Fund securities and $14 million for penalties related to negotiations concerning environmental concerns and an alternate pollution reduction plan for Powers Hudson unit. Interest Expense Interest Expense increased $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 2006, due primarily to an increase in interest expense of $20 million due to the reclassification of Interest Expense to Discontinued Operations of the Lawrenceburg facility for year ended December 31, 2006 and through the sale of Lawrenceburg in May 2007 combined with an $8 million increase due to lower capitalized interest in 2007 since the Linden construction was completed in May 2006. These increases were partially offset by the absence of $10 million of interest expense in 2007 due to the maturity of the 6.87% Senior Notes in April 2006, as well as decreases in interest incurred on lower average short term borrowings from Enterprise and lower commitment and letter of credit fees. The $48 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was due primarily to lower capitalized interest costs in 2006 related to commencement of operations of the Linden and BEC facilities. Income Tax Expense Income Taxes increased in both 2007 and 2006, primarily due to higher pre tax income. Loss from Discontinued Operations, including Loss on Disposal, net of tax On May 16, 2007, Power completed the sale of its Lawrenceburg generation facility. The sale price for the facility and inventory was $325 million. The transaction resulted in an after tax charge to Powers earnings of $208 million and was reflected as a charge to Discontinued Operations in the fourth quarter of 2006. Losses from Discontinued Operations of Lawrenceburg, not including the Loss of Disposal, were $8 million, $31 million and $28 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. On May 27, 2005, Power reached an agreement to sell its Waterford generation facility for $220 million and recognized an estimated loss on disposal of $177 million, net of tax, for the initial write down of its carrying amount of Waterford to its fair value less cost to sell. On September 28, 2005, Power completed the sale of Waterford and recognized an additional loss of $1 million. Losses from Discontinued Operations of Waterford, not including the Loss of Disposal, were $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. See Note 4. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions, Acquisitions and Impairments for additional information. 57 Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle, net of tax For the year ended December 31, 2005, Power recorded an after tax loss in the amount of $16 million due to the required recording of a liability for the fair value of asset retirement costs primarily related to its generation plants under FIN 47, which was adopted in December 2005. PSE&G For the year ended December 31, 2007, PSE&G had Net Income of $380 million, an increase of $115 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. About $69 million of the increase was due to the full year effect of the electric and gas base rate increases in November 2006. The return to a normal heating load (degree days were 16% higher in 2007 compared to 2006) for gas and a 2% growth in electric sales added $60 million to net income. Offsetting these increases was a less than 2% increase in controllable Operation and Maintenance. For the year ended December 31, 2006, PSE&G had Net Income of $265 million, a decrease of $83 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. This decrease was primarily due to delayed decisions in the electric and gas base rate cases combined with the decline in electric and gas delivery volumes. In 2006, delivery volumes for gas and electric decreased 10% and 3%, respectively. The weather was the primary cause of these declines with a drop of 16% in the number of degree days impacting gas. Gas commodity prices were extremely high early in 2006, which also contributed to a further decline in weather normalized sales. Thermal Heat Index hours were normal in 2006 but 18% less than 2005, negatively impacting electric sales. The year over year detail for these variances for these periods are discussed in more detail below: For the YearsEnded December 31, 2007 vs 2006 2006 vs 2005 2007 2006 2005 Increase(Decrease) % Increase(Decrease) % (Millions) (Millions) (Millions) Operating Revenues $ 8,493 $ 7,569 $ 7,514 $ 924 12 $ 55 1 Energy Costs $ 5,498 $ 4,884 $ 4,756 $ 614 13 $ 128 3 Operation and Maintenance $ 1,308 $ 1,160 $ 1,151 $ 148 13 $ 9 1 Depreciation and Amortization $ 591 $ 620 $ 553 $ (29 ) (5 ) $ 67 12 Other Income and Deductions $ 12 $ 22 $ 12 $ (10 ) (45 ) $ 10 83 Interest Expense $ (332 ) $ (346 ) $ (342 ) $ (14 ) (4 ) $ 4 1 Income Tax Expense $ (257 ) $ (183 ) $ (235 ) $ 74 40 $ (52 ) (22 ) Operating Revenues PSE&G has three sources of revenue: commodity revenues from the sales of energy to customers and in the PJM spot market; delivery revenues from the transmission and distribution of energy through its system; and other operating revenues from the provision of various services. PSE&G makes no margin on gas commodity sales as the costs are passed through to customers. The difference between the gas costs paid under the requirements contract for residential customers and the revenues received from residential customers is deferred and collected from or returned to customers in future periods. Gas commodity prices fluctuate monthly for commercial and industrial customers and annually through the BGSS tariff for residential customers. In addition, for residential gas customers, PSE&G has the ability to adjust rates upward two additional times and downward at any time, if warranted, between annual BGSS proceedings. PSE&G makes no margin on electric commodity sales as the costs are passed through to customers. PSE&G secures its electric commodity through the annual BGS auction. Electric commodity supply prices are set based on the results of these auctions for residential and smaller industrial and commercial customers, and are translated into seasonally adjusted fixed rates. Electric supply for larger industrial and commercial customers is provided at a rate principally based on the hourly PJM real time energy price. Customers may obtain their electric supply through either the BGS default electric supply service or through competitive third party electric suppliers, and the majority of the customers subject to hourly pricing are currently receiving electric supply from third party suppliers. Any differences between amounts paid by PSE&G to BGS suppliers for electric commodity, and the amounts of electric commodity revenue collected from customers is deferred and collected or returned to customers in subsequent months. 58 PSE&G also purchases electric commodity from several Non Utility Generation (NUG) facilities which is resold in the PJM market. Most of the NUG contracts are priced above market under long term contracts. PSE&G recoups the difference in price through the Non Utility Generation Clause (NGC). The $924 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 2006, was due to increases of $613 million in commodity revenues and $301 million in delivery revenues, described below and $10 million in other operating revenues, primarily related to appliance service contracts. The $55 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005 was due to increases of $78 million in commodity revenues and $3 million in other operating revenues, offset by a decrease of $26 million in delivery revenues. Commodity The $613 million increase in commodity related revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 2006, was due to increases of $510 million and $103 million in electric and gas revenues, respectively. The electric increase was due to $541 million in higher BGS revenues (higher auction prices of $484 million plus increased sales of $57 million), $44 million in higher NUG prices, offset by a $74 million decrease in the NGC revenues ($78 million in lower prices due to a March 2007 rate change offset by $4 million in higher volumes). The gas increase was primarily due to $240 million in increased sales due to weather offset by $137 million in lower BGSS prices. The $78 million increase in commodity revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was due to an increase in electric commodity revenues of $213 million, offset by a decrease of $135 million in gas commodity revenues. The increase in electric revenues was due to $299 million in higher BGS revenues (higher auction prices of $346 million offset by reduced sales of $47 million) offset by $85 million in lower NUG revenues (lower prices of $82 million and by $3 million for lower volumes). The gas decrease was due to $317 million in lower volumes due to weather and $58 million due to the expiration of the Third Party Shopping Incentive Clause in July 2005. There was a corresponding $58 million increase in delivery revenues. These were offset by $240 million in higher BGSS prices. Delivery The $301 million increase in delivery revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 2006, was due to increases of $169 million and $132 million in electric and gas revenues, respectively. The electric increase was due primarily to $83 million for increased SBC rates, $42 million in rate relief effective November 9, 2006 and $44 million in increased sales and demands primarily due to weather. PSE&G retains no margins from SBC collections as the revenues are offset in operating expenses below. The gas increase was due to $67 million in increased sales primarily due to weather, $39 million due to the SBC rate increases on November 1, 2006 and March 9, 2007 and $31 million due to rate relief effective November 9, 2006. The $26 million decrease in delivery revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was due to a $27 million decrease in gas offset by a $1 million increase in electric revenues. The gas decrease was due to $101 million in lower volumes primarily due to weather offset by $74 million in increased prices, $58 million of which was due to the expiration of the Third Party Shopping Incentive Clause in July 2005, described above in commodity revenues, $8 million due to rate relief effective November 9, 2006 and $8 million due to the SBC November 1, 2006 rate increase. The electric increase was due primarily to $13 million in higher securitization tariff rates and $8 million from a rate increase effective November 9, 2006, offset by $20 million in lower volumes due to weather. Operating Expenses Energy Costs The $614 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to the same period in 2006, was comprised of increases of $512 million and $102 million in electric and gas costs, respectively. The electric increase was due to $453 million or 18% in higher prices for BGS and NUG purchases and $59 million or 2% in higher BGS volumes due to weather. The gas increase was caused by a $239 million or 11% increase in sales volumes due primarily to weather offset by $137 million in lower prices. The $128 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was comprised of an increase of $211 million in electric costs offset by a decrease of $83 million in gas costs. The electric 59 increase was caused by $255 million or 16% in higher prices for BGS and NUG purchases offset by $47 million in lower BGS volumes due to weather. The gas decrease was caused by a $362 million or 17% decrease in sales volumes due to weather and $8 million due to the expiration of the Gas Cost Underrecovery Adjustment clause in January 2005, offset by $287 million or 11% in higher prices. Operation and Maintenance The $148 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 2006, was due primarily to increased SBC expenses of $132 million, resulting from rate increases in November 2006 and March 2007, increased payroll of $16 million, a higher reserve for injuries and damages of $10 million and $5 million for outside services. Offsetting the increases was $19 million in lower pension expense. The increased SBC expenses were offset in delivery revenues with no impact on net income. The $9 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was due to $9 million in increased labor and fringe benefits due to increased wages and Other Postretirement Benefits costs and $7 million in increased bad debt expense. These increases were offset by decreases of $3 million in injuries and damage claims and $2 million in write offs and $2 million in Net Operating Loss purchases. Depreciation and Amortization The $29 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 2006, was due primarily to decreases of $30 million due to revised plant depreciation rates and $11 million due to lower cost of removal rates, both resulting from the November 2006 rate case. Also contributing to the decrease was $8 million due to software previously amortized in 2006. This was offset by increases of $11 million due to amortization of regulatory assets and $9 million due to additional plant in service. The $67 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was comprised of increases of $70 million from the expiration of an excess depreciation credit, $6 million due to amortization of regulatory assets and $3 million due to additional plant in service. These increases were offset by decreases of $5 million due to revised plant depreciation and cost of removal rates, $3 million due to software amortization and $3 million due to the amortization of the Remediation Adjustment Clause. Other Income and Deductions The $10 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 2006, was due primarily to $7 million reduction in income tax gross ups on contributions in aid of construction (CIAC). CIAC is taxable and PSE&G recognizes the gross up as income when collected. Also contributing to the decrease was $2 million in lower investment income and $1 million in increased donations. The $10 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was due to an $8 million income tax gross up on CIAC in 2006. CIAC are taxable and PSE&G recognizes the gross up as income when collected. Also included are increases of $1 million of short term interest income and $1 million in gains on the sale of excess property. Interest Expense The $14 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 2006, was due primarily to lower interest expense of $12 million related to settlement of IRS Audits in 2006 and lower interest on regulatory clauses of $7 million, offset by $5 million in increased long term debt due to new debt issuances in December 2006 and May 2007. Income Tax Expense The $74 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 2006, was primarily due to $77 million on higher pre tax income offset by $3 million in various tax adjustments and tax credits. The $52 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was due to $55 million on lower pre tax income offset by $3 million in various flow through adjustments. 60 Energy Holdings For the year ended December 31, 2007, Energy Holdings had Net Income of $81 million, a decrease of $194 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Excluding Income from Discontinued Operations of $24 million and $299 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, Income from Continuing Operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $57 million, an increase of $81 million as compared to 2006. The primary reason for the increase was the absence of the $178 million after tax loss on the sale of RGE in 2006 which was partially offset by the after tax loss of $23 million resulting from the sale of Chilquinta and Luz Del Sur in December 2007. The increase was also offset by lower operational earnings at PSEG Texas driven by lower generation at the plants and lower mark to market earnings which were $16 million, after tax, in 2007 as compared to $29 million, after tax, in 2006, due to increased future spark spreads caused by strengthening of forward curves for 2008 and beyond; lower operational earnings at Bioenergie in Italy largely due to sequestration and shut down in early 2007; losses recorded on the early retirement of debt in December 2007; and lower leveraged lease income at Resources. For the year ended December 31, 2006, Energy Holdings had Net Income of $275 million, an increase of $61 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Excluding Income from Discontinued Operations of $299 million and $67 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, the Loss from Continuing Operations was $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, a decrease in earnings of $174 million as compared to 2005. The primary reason for the decline was the $178 million after tax loss on the sale of RGE. The decreases were also due to the absence of an after tax gain of $43 million from the sale of Resources leveraged lease investment in Generation Station Unit 2 (Seminole) in December 2005. The decreases were partially offset by strong operations at PSEG Texas combined with $29 million of after tax mark to market gains on forward gas contracts in 2006 as compared to $3 million of after tax MTM losses in 2005 at PSEG Texas. The year over year detail for these variances for these periods are discussed in more detail below: For the YearsEnded December 31, 2007 vs 2006 2006 vs 2005 2007 2006 2005 Increase(Decrease) % Increase(Decrease) % (Millions) (Millions) (Millions) Operating Revenues $ 968 $ 955 $ 987 $ 13 1 $ (32 ) (3 ) Energy Costs $ 450 $ 523 $ 517 $ (73 ) (14 ) $ 6 1 Operation and Maintenance $ 139 $ 132 $ 157 $ 7 5 $ (25 ) (16 ) Write Down of Assets $ 16 $ 274 $ $ (258 ) (94 ) $ 274 N/A Depreciation and Amortization $ 38 $ 32 $ 29 $ 6 19 $ 3 10 Income from Equity Method Investments $ 116 $ 120 $ 124 $ (4 ) (3 ) $ (4 ) (3 ) Other (Deductions) and Income $ (26 ) $ 15 $ (4 ) $ (41 ) N/A $ 19 N/A Interest Expense $ (153 ) $ (185 ) $ (195 ) $ (32 ) (17 ) $ (10 ) (5 ) Income Tax (Expense) Benefit $ (207 ) $ 33 $ (58 ) $ 240 N/A $ (91 ) N/A Income from Discontinued Operations, including Gain on Disposal $ 24 $ 299 $ 67 $ (275 ) (92 ) $ 232 N/A The classification of the results of Globals investments is dependent upon Globals ownership percentage in the underlying investment which determines whether the investment is consolidated or if it is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Global owns 100% of PSEG Texas and 85% of Bioenergie. As a result, the revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities of those investments are consolidated. Globals investments in Chilquinta and Luz del Sur, which were sold in December 2007, as well as its investments GWF Energy LLC (GWF), Kalaeloa Partners L.P. (Kalaeloa) and several other smaller investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Therefore, Globals share of the net income from these projects is recorded as Income from Equity Method Investments on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The results for SAESA and Electroandes are included in Discontinued Operations for all periods presented. Operating Revenues The increase of $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 2006, was due to higher revenue at Global of $30 million. The increase at Global was primarily due to a pretax gain recorded on the sale of Chilquinta and Luz del Sur of $146 million that was largely offset by a reduction in generation revenues at PSEG Texas of $114 million. This decrease at PSEG Texas was largely due to reduced electricity 61 sales of $80 million, coupled with lower MTM gains on electricity of $42 million, which were partially offset by a slight price increase in 2007 which generated an increase of $8 million. PSEG Texas had lower generation primarily due to cooler spring and summer weather in 2007 and also due to forced outages at the Odessa and Guadalupe facilities. The lower MTM gains were largely driven by strengthening of forward curves for 2008. The increases at Global were partially offset by lower revenues at Resources of $17 million primarily due to the effect on leverage leases from the adoption of FIN 48 and FSP13 2. The decrease of $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was due to lower revenues at Resources of $73 million primarily due to the absence of a $71 million pre tax gain from the sale of Resources interest in Seminole Generation in December 2005 coupled with the absence of $20 million of leveraged lease income in 2006 due to the Seminole sale, partially offset by a $21 million write off of a leveraged lease investment with United Airlines in 2005. The decrease at Resources was partially offset by higher revenues at Global of $41 million, which was primarily related to a $79 million increase at PSEG Texas due to higher unrealized gains on forward contracts which were slightly offset by a reduction in gas sales and a $24 million increase due to the consolidation of Bioenergie. These increases were partly offset by a $37 million decrease due to the absence of a gain from withdrawal from the Eagle Point Cogeneration Partnership in the prior year and the absence of $20 million of revenue due to the deconsolidation of Dhofar Power Company S.A.O.C. Energy Costs The decrease of $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 2006, was primarily due to lower consumption driven by lower generation at PSEG Texas, including $42 million for lower fuel consumption, $22 million in reduced MTM costs on gas purchases driven by improvement of future spark spreads for 2008 and beyond and an $8 million reduction in purchased power costs. The increase of $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to an $8 million increase due to the consolidation of Bioenergie in May 2006, partially offset by a $5 million decrease related to the deconsolidation of Dhofar Power. Operation and Maintenance The increase of $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 2006, was primarily due to an increase of $12 million at Global driven largely by higher legal expenses of $4 million at Bioenergie (mainly in the early part of 2007 for resolution of legal issues); selling expenses of $6 million for the sale of equity method investments; and $5 million higher outage expenses at PSEG Texas. Globals increase was partially offset by decreases in general and administrative expenses at Resources and Energy Holdings (parent). The decrease of $25 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to a reduction of $9 million at Resources, mainly due to a reduction of operating lease expense and a $10 million reduction at Global, primarily due to a $9 million decrease at PSEG Texas. Also contributing to the decrease was a $4 million reduction in administrative expenses related to lower corporate assessments, wages and benefits, and legal and consulting expense. Write Down of Assets The $16 million write down of assets in 2007 was primarily related to an additional $12 million pre tax impairment recorded on Globals generation projects in Venezuela based on Globals estimated market valuation of these investments. Global also recorded an impairment loss of $4 million pre tax on its investment in PPN primarily related to Globals estimated market valuation of that project. The $274 million write down of assets in 2006 was primarily related to a $263 million pre tax loss on Globals sale of its 32% indirect ownership interest in RGE, $4 million pre tax loss related to the sale of Globals interest in Magellan Capital Holdings Corporation, and a $7 million pre tax loss on the impairment of Globals generation projects in Venezuela. See Note 4. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions, Acquisitions and Impairments. 62 Depreciation and Amortization The increase of $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 2006, was primarily due to the consolidation of Bioenergie in May 2006. The increase of $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to a $3 million increase at Resources and a $4 million increase related to the consolidation of Bioenergie offset by a $4 million decrease resulting from the deconsolidation of Dhofar Power. Income from Equity Method Investments The decrease of $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 2006, was primarily driven by the earnings of $11 million due to asset sales of RGE and Salalah in 2006; lower earnings of $8 million caused by lower generation and partial shutdown in 2007 at Bioenergies equity investment and the consolidation of Bioenergie from mid 2006; reduction in the income from Bridgewater for $3 million, mainly due to the expiration of the Purchase Power Agreement (PPA) in August 2007; these were partially offset by higher earnings at Chilquinta, LDS, GWF, Kalaeloa for a total of $17 million. The decrease of $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily driven by the absence of $12 million of earnings due to the sale of RGE in 2006 partially offset by the absence of foreign currency losses in 2005 from Bioenergie of $8 million. Other Income and Deductions The decrease of $41 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 2006, was primarily due to a $35 million loss on the early retirement of debt resulting from the call for early redemption in December 2007 of Energy Holdings 10% Senior Notes due 2009; lower interest income from PSEG of $9 million due to lower average intercompany debt balances and increase of $5 million in the fair value loss on the Chilquinta swap at Global. These were partially offset by the income recorded for the settlement of the Konya Ilgin litigation of $9 million. The increase of $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to an increase in interest and dividend income of $10 million and lower losses in foreign currency transactions due to favorable currency fluctuations mainly for Bioenergie operations in Italy. Interest Expense The decrease of $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 2006, was mainly due to lower interest expense of $22 million on senior notes at Energy Holdings due to October 2006 and December 2007 redemptions, decrease in interest expense of $7 million due to Resources lower debt balance and the reversal of the accrued interest for the IRS audits for the years 1994 to 1996 and lower interest expense of $4 million at Global due to lower debt balance. The decrease of $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was mainly due to a decrease in Energy Holdings debt outstanding and a net decrease of $2 million resulting from the consolidation of Bioenergie and the deconsolidation of Dhofar Power. Income Tax Expense The increase of $240 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 2006, was primarily attributable to $163 million of taxes recorded as a result of Globals sale of Chilquinta and Luz del Sur; $21 million of tax expense resulting from the implementation of FIN 48 at Global; higher taxation at Resources of $16 million due to higher pre tax income and adjustment to FIN 48 tax reserves; and the absence of the $93 million tax benefit obtained in 2006 on the impairment of RGE. These were partially offset by the tax credit of $18 million in Energy Holdings due to early redemption of debt and $25 million lower taxes at Global due to lower pre tax income in 2007 compared with 2006, excluding the amounts related to RGE, Chilquinta and Luz del Sur. The decrease of $91 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily attributable to a tax benefit resulting from Globals sale of its 32% indirect ownership interest in RGE. 63 Income from Discontinued Operations, including Gains on Disposal, net of tax Electroandes On October 17, 2007 Global completed the sale of Electroandes for a total purchase price of $390 million including the assumption of approximately $108 million of debt. Income from Discontinued Operations, including Gain on Disposal, related to Electroandes for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $58 million, $16 million and $14 million respectively. See Note 4. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions, Acquisitions and Impairments for additional information. SAESA Group On December 18, 2007, Global announced that it plans to sell its investment in the SAESA group of companies. As a result, operating results for the SAESA Group have been presented as Discontinued Operations. As a result of its intention to sell the SAESA Group, Global recorded an $82 million income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2007 related to the discontinuation of applying Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 23, Accounting for Income Taxes Special Areas as the income generated by the SAESA Group is no longer expected to be indefinitely reinvested. (Loss) Income from Discontinued Operations related to the SAESA Group for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $(34) million, $57 million and $35 million, respectively. See Note 4. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions, Acquisitions and Impairments for additional information. Elcho and Skawina In 2006, Global sold its interest in Elcho and Skawina, two coal fired plants in Poland. Proceeds, net of transaction costs, were $476 million. Income from Discontinued Operations, including the Gain on Disposal, related to Elcho and Skawina for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $226 million and $18 million, respectively. See Note 4. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions, Acquisitions and Impairments for additional information. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following discussion of liquidity and capital resources is on a consolidated basis for PSEG, noting the uses and contributions, where material, of PSEGs three direct operating subsidiaries, Power, PSE&G and Energy Holdings. Financing Methodology PSEG, Power and PSE&G Capital requirements for Power and PSE&G are met through liquidity provided by internally generated cash flow and external financings. PSEG and Power from time to time make equity contributions or otherwise provide credit support to their respective direct and indirect subsidiaries to provide for part of their capital and cash requirements, generally relating to long term investments. At times, PSEG utilizes intercompany dividends and intercompany loans (except however, that Fossil, Nuclear and ER&T may not, without prior FERC approval, and PSE&G may not, without prior BPU approval, make loans to their affiliates) to satisfy various subsidiary or parental needs and efficiently manage short term cash. Any excess funds are invested in short term liquid investments. External funding to meet PSEGs, Powers and PSE&Gs needs consist of corporate finance transactions. The debt incurred is the direct obligation of those respective entities. Some of the proceeds of these debt transactions may be used by the respective obligor to make equity investments in its subsidiaries. As discussed below, depending on the particular company, external financing may consist of public and private capital market debt and equity transactions, bank revolving credit and term loans, commercial paper and or project financings. Some of these transactions involve special purpose entities (SPEs), formed in accordance with applicable tax and legal requirements in order to achieve specified financial advantages, such as favorable legal liability treatment. PSEG consolidates SPEs, as applicable, in accordance with FIN No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) (FIN 46). 64 The availability and cost of external capital is affected by each entitys performance, as well as by the performance of their respective subsidiaries and affiliates. This could include the degree of structural separation between PSEG and its subsidiaries and the potential impact of affiliate ratings on consolidated and unconsolidated credit quality. Additionally, compliance with applicable financial covenants will depend upon future financial position, earnings and net cash flows, as to which no assurances can be given. Over the next several years, PSEG, Power and PSE&G may be required to extinguish or refinance maturing debt and, to the extent there is not sufficient internally generated funds, may incur additional debt and or provide equity to fund investment activities. Any inability to obtain required additional external capital or to extend or replace maturing debt and or existing agreements at current levels and reasonable interest rates may adversely affect PSEGs, Powers and PSE&Gs respective financial condition, results of operations and net cash flows. From time to time, PSEG, Power and PSE&G may repurchase portions of their respective debt securities using funds from operations, asset sales, commercial paper, debt issuances, equity issuances and other sources of funding and may make exchanges of new securities, including common stock, for outstanding securities. Such repurchases may be at variable prices below, at or above prevailing market prices and may be conducted by way of privately negotiated transactions, open market purchases, tender or exchange offers or other means. PSEG, Power and PSE&G may utilize brokers or dealers or effect such repurchases directly. Any such repurchases may be commenced or discontinued at any time without notice. Operating Cash Flows PSEG, Power and PSE&G PSEG expects strong cash from operations primarily driven by earnings from Power due to improvements in energy margins and capacity markets. The strong operating cash flows combined with proceeds from potential asset sales and financing activities are expected to be sufficient to fund capital expenditures and shareholder dividend payments, with excess cash available to invest in the business, reduce debt and or repurchase common stock. PSEG For the year ended December 31, 2007, PSEGs operating cash flow decreased by $13 million as compared to 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2006, PSEGs operating cash flow increased by $982 million as compared to 2005. The net changes were due to net changes from its subsidiaries as discussed below. Power Powers operating cash flow increased $162 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to 2006, due principally to an increase in net income of $457 million, net of the Loss on Disposal of Lawrenceburg, partially offset by an increase of $321 million in margin receivables related to higher collateral requirements. Powers operating cash flow increased $907 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, due to a significant reduction in margin requirements and fuel inventories, largely resulting from decreases in commodity prices. PSE&G PSE&Gs operating cash flow decreased $128 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to a decline in cash from working capital. The operating cash flow for the year 2006 was $806 million primarily due to very cold weather at the end of 2005 which resulted in increased cash flow during 2006. The return of more normal weather conditions in 2007 caused operating cash flow to decline to the 2005 level. PSE&Gs operating cash flow increased $122 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to 2005, primarily due to an increase in working capital. The colder than normal winter in 2005 caused an increase in cash flow in 2006. 65 Energy Holdings Energy Holdings operating cash flow decreased $91 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 2006. The decrease was mainly due to a $100 million tax deposit made with the IRS in the fourth quarter of 2007 and the timing of tax payments related to Globals sales of Elcho, Skawina and RGE in 2006. Energy Holdings operating cash flow decreased $98 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to 2005. The decrease was mainly due to taxes paid related to the sale of Elcho, Skawina and RGE in 2006. The proceeds from these sales are included in Cash Flows from Investing Activities on PSEGs Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Common Stock Dividends On January 15, 2008, PSEGs Board of Directors approved a two for one stock split of the PSEGs outstanding shares of common stock. All share and per share amounts included in this Form 10 K retroactively reflect the effect of the stock split. Dividend payments on common stock for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $1.17 per share and totaled $594 million. Dividend payments on common stock for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $1.14 per share and totaled $574 million. On January 15, 2008, PSEGs Board of Directors also approved a $0.03 increase in its quarterly common stock dividend, from $0.2925 to $0.3225 per share for the first quarter of 2008. This reflects an indicated annual dividend rate of $1.29 per share. PSEG expects to continue to pay cash dividends on its common stock, however, the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of PSEG common stock will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including PSEGs financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its business, alternate investment opportunities, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant. Short Term Liquidity As of December 31, 2007, PSEG, Power and PSE&G had the following committed credit facilities Each of the facilities is restricted as to availability and use to the specific companies as listed below. PSEG, Power and PSE&G believe sufficient liquidity exists to fund their respective short term cash requirements. Company ExpirationDate TotalFacility PrimaryPurpose Usageas ofDecember 31,2007 AvailableLiquidityas ofDecember 31,2007 (Millions) PSEG: 5 year Credit Facility(A) Dec 2012 $ 1,000 CP Support/Funding/ $ 1 (B) $ 999 Letters of Credit Uncommitted Bilateral Agreement N/A N/A Funding $ $ N/A Power: 5 year Credit Facility(A) Dec 2012 $ 1,600 Funding/Letters of $ 140 (B) $ 1,460 Credit Bilateral Credit Facility March 2010 $ 100 Funding/Letters of $ 56 (B) $ 44 Credit Bilateral Credit Facility March 2008 $ 200 Funding/Letters of $ 28 (B) $ 172 Credit PSE&G: 5 year Credit Facility(A) June 2012 $ 600 CP Support/Funding/ $ 55 $ 545 Letters of Credit Uncommitted Bilateral Agreement N/A N/A Funding $ 10 N/A (A) In 2012, facilities reduce by $47 million, $75 million, and $28 million for PSEG, Power and PSE&G, respectively. (B) These amounts relate to letters of credit outstanding. 66 Power As of December 31, 2007, Power had borrowed $238 million from PSEG in the form of an intercompany loan. On June 25, 2007, Power refinanced the $200 million PSEG/Power joint and several co borrower bilateral credit facility. The maturity was extended to March 2008 and terms were modified so that Power is the sole borrower under this facility. Powers required margin postings for sales contracts entered into in the normal course of business will fluctuate based on volatility in commodity prices. Should commodity prices rise, additional margin calls may be necessary relative to existing power sales contracts. As Powers contract obligations are fulfilled, liquidity requirements are reduced. In addition, ER&T maintains agreements that require Power, as its guarantor under performance guarantees, to satisfy certain creditworthiness standards. In the event of a deterioration of Powers credit rating to below investment grade, which represents at least a two level downgrade from its current ratings, many of these agreements allow the counterparty to demand that ER&T provide performance assurance, generally in the form of a letter of credit or cash. Providing this support would increase Powers costs of doing business and could restrict the ability of ER&T to manage and optimize Powers asset portfolio. Power believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet any required posting of collateral likely to result from a credit rating downgrade. See Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities for further information.

During 2007, Energy Holdings made cash distributions to PSEG of $355 million in the form of returns of capital. During 2007, Energy Holdings subsidiaries repaid $57 million of non recourse debt, including $51 million by Global, of which $45 million related to the PSEG Texas facilities and $6 million to the SAESA Group, $4 million by Resources and $2 million by EGDC. Debt Covenants PSEG, Power and PSE&G PSEGs, Powers and PSE&Gs respective credit agreements may contain maximum debt to equity ratios, minimum cash flow tests and other restrictive covenants and conditions to borrowing. Compliance with applicable financial covenants will depend upon the respective future financial position, level of earnings and cash flows of PSEG, Power and PSE&G, as to which no assurances can be given. The ratios presented below are for the benefit of the investors of the related securities to which the covenants apply. They are not intended as financial performance or liquidity measures. The debt underlying the preferred securities of PSEG, which is presented in Long Term Debt in accordance with FIN 46, is not included as debt when calculating these ratios, as provided for in the various credit agreements. PSEG Financial covenants contained in PSEGs note purchase agreements related to the private placement of debt include a ratio of total debt (excluding non recourse project financings, securitization debt and debt underlying preferred securities and including commercial paper and loans and certain letters of credit) to total capitalization (including preferred securities outstanding) covenant. This covenant requires that such ratio not be more than 70.0%. As of December 31, 2007, PSEGs ratio of debt to capitalization (as defined above) was 51.9%. PSEGs credit facility contains a similar but less restrictive financial covenant where total debt excludes letters of credit related to collateral postings and total capitalization excludes any impacts for Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/Loss adjustments related to marking energy contracts to market and equity reductions from the funded status of pensions or benefit plans associated with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans. This covenant requires that such ratio not be more than 70.0%. As of December 31, 2007, PSEGs ratio of debt to capitalization (as defined above) was 49.9%. 68 Power Financial covenants contained in Powers credit facility include a ratio of debt to total capitalization covenant. The Power ratio is the same debt to total capitalization calculation as set forth above for PSEG except common equity is adjusted for the $986 million Basis Adjustment (see Consolidated Balance Sheets). This covenant requires that such ratio will not exceed 65.0%. As of December 31, 2007, Powers ratio of debt to total capitalization (as defined above) was 41.3%. PSE&G Financial covenants contained in PSE&Gs credit facilities include a ratio of long term debt (excluding securitization debt, long term debt maturing within one year and short term debt) to total capitalization covenant. This covenant requires that such ratio will not be more than 65.0%. As of December 31, 2007, PSE&Gs ratio of long term debt to total capitalization (as defined above) was 48.0%. In addition, under its First and Refunding Mortgage (Mortgage), PSE&G may issue new First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds against previous additions and improvements, provided that its ratio of earnings to fixed charges calculated in accordance with its Mortgage is at least 2 to 1, and or against retired Mortgage Bonds. As of December 31, 2007, PSE&Gs Mortgage coverage ratio was 4.6 to 1 and the Mortgage would permit up to approximately $2.1 billion aggregate principal amount of new Mortgage Bonds to be issued against previous bondable additions and improvements to its property. Cross Default Provisions PSEG, Power and PSE&G The PSEG bank credit agreement contains default provisions under which a default by it in an aggregate amount of $50 million or greater would result in the potential acceleration of payment under this agreement. Under certain conditions, a default by Power or PSE&G in an aggregate amount of $50 million or greater would also result in potential acceleration of payment under this agreement. PSEG, Power and PSE&G have removed Energy Holdings from all cross default provisions. PSEGs bank credit agreement and note purchase agreements related to private placement of debt (collectively, Credit Agreements) contain cross default provisions under which certain payment defaults by Power or PSE&G, certain bankruptcy events relating to Power or PSE&G, the failure by Power or PSE&G to satisfy certain final judgments or the occurrence of certain events of default under the financing agreements of Power or PSE&G, would each constitute an event of default under the PSEG Credit Agreements. Under the note purchase agreements, it is also an event of default if Power or PSE&G ceases to be wholly owned by PSEG. Under the bank credit agreement, both Power and PSE&G would have to cease to be wholly owned by PSEG before an event of default would occur. Power The Power Senior Debt Indenture contains a default provision under which a default by Power, Nuclear, Fossil or ER&T in an aggregate amount of $50 million or greater would result in an event of default and the potential acceleration of payment under the indenture. There are no cross defaults within Powers indenture from PSEG, Energy Holdings or PSE&G. The Power credit agreement also has a provision under which a default by Power, Nuclear, Fossil or ER&T in an aggregate amount of $50 million or greater would result in an event of default and the potential acceleration of payment under that agreement. PSE&G PSE&Gs Mortgage has no cross defaults. The PSE&G Medium Term Note Indenture has a cross default to the PSE&G Mortgage. The PSE&G credit agreement has a provision under which a default by PSE&G in the aggregate of $50 million or greater would result in an event of default and the potential acceleration of payment under that agreement. 69 Ratings Triggers PSEG, Power and PSE&G The debt indentures and credit agreements of PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings do not contain any material ratings triggers that would cause an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a ratings downgrade. However, in the event of a downgrade, any one or more of the affected companies may be subject to increased interest costs on certain bank debt and certain collateral requirements. Power In connection with the management and optimization of Powers asset portfolio, ER&T maintains underlying agreements that require Power, as its guarantor under performance guarantees, to satisfy certain creditworthiness standards. In the event of a deterioration of Powers credit rating to below an investment grade rating, many of these agreements allow the counterparty to demand that ER&T provide performance assurance, generally in the form of a letter of credit or cash. As of December 31, 2007, if Power were to lose its investment grade rating and assuming all the counterparties to agreements in which ER&T is out of the money were contractually entitled to demand, and demanded, performance assurance, ER&T could be required to post collateral in an amount equal to approximately $777 million. See Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. PSE&G In accordance with the BPU approved requirements under the BGS contracts that PSE&G enters into with suppliers, PSE&G is required to maintain an investment grade credit rating. If PSE&G were to lose its investment grade rating, PSE&G would be required to file with the BPU a plan to assure continued payment for the BGS requirements of its customers. PSE&G is the servicer for the bonds issued by Transition Funding and Transition Funding II. If PSE&G were to lose its investment grade rating, PSE&G would be required to remit collected cash daily to the bond trustee. Currently, cash is remitted monthly. Credit Ratings PSEG, Power and PSE&G PSE&G has $494 million of variable rate pollution control notes outstanding which service and secure a like amount of insured tax exempt variable rate bonds of the Pollution Control Authority of Salem County. The credit ratings of these tax exempt securities are linked to the credit ratings of the insurers. In December 2007, due to credit pressures experienced by the insurers, the credit ratings on these tax exempt securities were placed on review for possible downgrade by Moodys and negative (Neg) outlook by S&P. In January 2008, Fitch downgraded these securities from AAA to A. In early February 2008, Moodys downgraded these securities from Aaa to A3. Currently, PSE&G is exposed to interest rate risk with resets every 35 days on the Salem Authority bonds and, in turn, PSE&Gs variable rate pollution control bonds. On November 20, 2007, Fitch upgraded the senior unsecured debt rating of PSEG and Power to BBB+ from BBB and the rating outlook for each entity is now stable. On June 22, 2007, S&P revised its outlook for the credit ratings of each of PSEG, Power and PSE&G from Neg to stable and upgraded its rating for the commercial paper of PSEG and PSE&G from A3 to A2. If the rating agencies lower or withdraw the credit ratings, such revisions may adversely affect the market price of PSEGs, Powers and PSE&Gs securities and serve to materially increase those companies cost of capital and limit their access to capital. Outlooks assigned to ratings are as follows: stable, Neg or positive (Pos). There is no assurance that the ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be revised by the rating agencies, if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant. Each rating given by an agency should be evaluated independently of the other agencies ratings. The ratings should not be construed as an indication to buy, hold or sell any security. 70 Moodys(A) S&P(B) Fitch(C) PSEG: Outlook Neg Stable Stable Commercial Paper P2 A2 F2 Power: Outlook Stable Stable Stable Senior Notes Baa1 BBB BBB+ PSE&G: Outlook Neg Stable Stable Mortgage Bonds A3 A A Preferred Securities Baa3 BB+ BBB+ Commercial Paper P2 A2 F2 (A) Moodys ratings range from Aaa (highest) to C (lowest) for long term securities and P1 (highest) to NP (lowest) for short term securities. (B) S&P ratings range from AAA (highest) to D (lowest) for long term securities and A1 (highest) to D (lowest) for short term securities. (C) Fitch ratings range from AAA (highest) to D (lowest) for long term securities and F1 (highest) to D (lowest) for short term securities. Other Comprehensive Income PSEG, Power and PSE&G For the year ended December 31, 2007, PSEG, Power and PSE&G had Other Comprehensive (Losses) Income of $(32) million, $(115) million and $1 million, respectively, due to higher unrealized losses on derivative contracts accounted for as hedges at Power, partially offset by gains from foreign currency translation adjustments. 71 CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS PSEG, Power and PSE&G It is expected that the majority of each subsidiarys capital requirements over the next five years will come from internally generated funds. Projected construction and investment expenditures, excluding nuclear fuel purchases, for PSEGs subsidiaries for the next five years are presented in the table below. These amounts are subject to change, based on various factors. 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 (Millions) Power: Hudson Environmental $ 240 $ 300 $ 215 $ 5 $ Mercer Environmental 215 100 10 Other Environmental 140 40 15 20 25 Exploration of New Nuclear Plant 5 20 15 15 55 Other Growth Opportunities 5 60 175 200 80 Other 285 155 190 190 190 Total Power 890 675 620 430 350 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 (Millions) PSE&G: Transmission System Reinforcement 140 160 265 420 465 Facility Replacement 15 30 30 30 30 Environmental/Regulatory 5 Distribution Support Facilities 175 175 275 235 220 New Business 165 160 160 165 175 Reliability Enhancements 110 120 95 90 90 Facility Replacement 165 180 190 190 200 Environmental/Regulatory 70 80 80 85 85 Total PSE&G 840 905 1,100 1,215 1,265 Other 65 35 30 30 30 Total PSEG $ 1,795 $ 1,615 $ 1,750 $ 1,675 $ 1,645 Power Powers projected expenditures above for the various items are primarily comprised of the following: Hudson Environmental construction of pollution control equipment, including a selective catalytic reduction system, a scrubber, a baghouse and a carbon injection system at our Hudson facility. Mercer Environmental construction of pollution control equipment, including scrubbers and baghouses, at our Mercer facility. Other Environmental construction of other pollution control equipment, including scrubbers at our Keystone facility. Exploration of New Nuclear Plant costs associated with exploring the feasibility of, and the technologies involved with, building a new nuclear plant. Other Growth Opportunities costs associated with potential opportunities to build other new plants such as peaking facilities. Other various capital projects at existing facilities to either extend plants useful lives or increase operating output. In 2007, Power made approximately $562 million of capital expenditures (excluding $153 million for nuclear fuel), primarily related to various projects at Fossil and Nuclear. PSE&G PSE&Gs projections for future capital expenditures include additions and replacements to its transmission and distribution systems to meet expected growth and to manage reliability. As project scope 72 and cost estimates develop, PSE&G will modify its current projections to include these required investments. PSE&Gs projected expenditures above for the various items are primarily comprised of the following: Support Facilities ancillary equipment needed to support the business lines, such as computers, office furniture, and buildings and structures housing support personnel or equipment/inventory. New Business investments made in support of new business to PSE&G (e.g. add new customers). Reliability Enhancements investments made to improve the reliability and efficiency of the system or function. Facility Replacement investments made to replace systems or equipment in kind. Environmental/Regulatory investments made in response to regulatory or legal mandates where financial loss is imminent if not pursued. In 2007, PSE&G made approximately $570 million of capital expenditures, primarily for reliability of transmission and distribution systems. The $570 million does not include approximately $37 million spent on cost of removal. Disclosures about Long Term Maturities, Contractual and Commercial Obligations and Certain Investments The following table reflects PSEGs and its subsidiaries contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments in the respective periods in which they are due. In addition, the table summarizes anticipated recourse and non recourse debt maturities for the years shown. The table also does not reflect debt maturities of Energy Holdings non consolidated investments. If those obligations were not able to be refinanced by the project, Energy Holdings may elect to make additional contributions in these investments. For additional information, see Note 10. Schedule of Consolidated Debt. In addition, the table below does not reflect any anticipated cash payments for pension obligations due to uncertain timing of payments or liabilities under FIN 48 since PSEG is unable to reasonably estimate the timing of FIN 48 liability payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions.

See Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities for further discussion. Energy Holdings Global has certain investments that are accounted for under the equity method in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Accordingly, amounts recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for such investments represent Globals equity investment, which is increased for Globals pro rata share of earnings less any dividend distribution from such investments. The companies in which Global invests that are accounted for under the equity method have an aggregate $351 million of debt on their combined, consolidated financial statements. PSEGs pro rata share of such debt is $173 million. This debt is non recourse to PSEG, Energy Holdings and Global. PSEG is generally not required to support the debt service obligations of these companies. However, default with respect to this non recourse debt could result in a loss of invested equity. Resources has investments in leveraged leases that are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases. Leveraged lease investments generally involve three parties: an owner/lessor, a creditor and a lessee. In a typical leveraged lease financing, the lessor purchases an asset to be leased. The purchase price is typically financed 80% with debt provided by the creditor and the balance comes from equity funds provided by the lessor. The creditor provides long term financing to the transaction secured by the property subject to the lease. Such long term financing is non recourse to the lessor and is not presented on Energy Holdings Consolidated Balance Sheets. In the event of default, the leased asset, and in some cases the lessee, secure the loan. As a lessor, Resources has ownership rights to the property and rents the property to the lessees for use in their business operation. As of December 31, 2007, Resources equity investment in leased assets was approximately $781 million, net of deferred taxes of approximately $2 billion. For additional information, see Note 8. Long Term Investments. In the event that collectibility of the minimum lease payments to be received by Resources is no longer reasonably assured, the accounting treatment for some of the leases may change. In such cases, Resources may deem that a lessee has a high probability of defaulting on the lease obligation, and would reclassify the lease from a leveraged lease to an operating lease and would consider the need to record an impairment of its investment. Should Resources ever directly assume a debt obligation, the fair value of the underlying asset and the associated debt would be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets instead of the net equity investment in the lease. Energy Holdings has guaranteed certain obligations of its subsidiaries or affiliates related to certain projects. See Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities for additional information. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES PSEG, Power and PSE&G Under GAAP, many accounting standards require the use of estimates, variable inputs and assumptions (collectively referred to as estimates) that are subjective in nature. Because of this, differences between the actual measure realized versus the estimate can have a material impact on results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The managements of PSEG, Power and PSE&G have each determined that the following estimates are considered critical to the application of rules that relate to their respective businesses. Accounting for Pensions PSEG, Power and PSE&G account for pensions under SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS 87). Pension costs under SFAS 87 are calculated using various economic and demographic assumptions. Economic assumptions include the discount rate and the long term rate of return on trust assets. Demographic assumptions include projections of future mortality rates, pay increases and retirement patterns. In 2007, PSEG and its subsidiaries recorded pension expense of $43 million, compared to $97 million in 2006 and $109 million in 2005. Additionally, in 2007, PSEG and its respective subsidiaries 75 contributed cash of approximately $16 million, compared to cash contributions of $50 million in 2006 and $155 million in 2005. PSEGs discount rate assumption, which is determined annually, is based on the rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits. The discount rate used to calculate pension obligations is determined as of December 31 each year, PSEGs SFAS 87 measurement date. The discount rate used to determine year end obligations is also used to develop the following years net periodic pension cost. The discount rates used in PSEGs 2006 and 2007 net periodic pension costs were 5.75% and 6.00%, respectively. PSEGs 2008 net periodic pension cost was developed using a discount rate of 6.50%. PSEGs expected rate of return on plan assets reflects current asset allocations, historical long term investment performance and an estimate of future long term returns by asset class and long term inflation assumptions. For 2006 and 2007, PSEG assumed a rate of return of 8.75% on PSEGs pension plan assets. For 2008, PSEG will continue the rate of return assumption of 8.75%. Based on the above assumptions, PSEG has estimated net period pension costs of approximately $37 million and contributions of up to approximately $50 million in 2008. As part of the business planning process, PSEG has modeled its future costs assuming an 8.75% rate of return and a 6.50% discount rate for 2009 and beyond. Actual future pension expense and funding levels will depend on future investment performance, changes in discount rates, market conditions, funding levels relative to PSEGs projected benefit obligation and accumulated benefit obligation and various other factors related to the populations participating in PSEGs pension plans. The following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in certain assumptions. The effects of the assumption changes shown below solely reflect the impact of that specific assumption. Assumption 2008Assumptions Change/(Decrease) As ofDecember 31, 2007Impact onPension BenefitObligation Increase toPension Expensein 2008 (Millions) Discount Rate 6.50 % (1.00 %) $ 478 $ 43 Rate of Return on Plan Assets 8.75 % (1.00 %) $ $ 33 Accounting for Deferred Taxes PSEG, Power and PSE&G provide for income taxes based on the liability method required by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, as well as net operating loss and credit carryforwards. PSEG, Power and PSE&G evaluate the need for a valuation allowance against their respective deferred tax assets based on the likelihood of expected future taxable income. PSEG, Power and PSE&G do not believe a valuation allowance is necessary; however, if the expected level of future taxable income changes or certain tax planning strategies become unavailable, PSEG, Power and PSE&G would record a valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period the valuation allowance is deemed necessary. Resources and Globals ability to realize their deferred tax assets are dependent on PSEGs subsidiaries ability to generate ordinary income and capital gains. Uncertain Tax Positions PSEG, Power and PSE&G are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. Beginning January 1, 2007, PSEG, Power and PSE&G began accounting for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two step approach, a more likely than not recognition criterion and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being ultimately realized upon ultimate settlement in accordance with FIN 48. If it is not more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit will be recorded. Uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. Prior to January 1, 2007, PSEG, Power and PSE&G estimated their 76 uncertain income tax obligations in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109) and SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (SFAS No. 5). The Registrants also have non income tax obligations related to real estate, sales and use and employment related taxes and ongoing appeals related to these tax matters that are outside the scope of FIN 48 and accounted for under SFAS No. 5. Accounting for tax obligations requires judgments, including estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. PSEG, Power and PSE&G also assess their ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. PSEG, Power and PSE&G do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets related to capital losses that they believe will be realized in future periods. While PSEG, Power and PSE&G believe the resulting tax reserve balances as of December 31, 2007 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with FIN 48, SFAS No. 5 and SFAS No. 109, as applicable, the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to their consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material. Hedge and MTM Accounting SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133) requires an entity to recognize the fair value of derivative instruments held as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. SFAS 133 applies to all derivative instruments held by PSEG, Power and PSE&G. The fair value of most derivative instruments is determined by reference to quoted market prices, listed contracts, or quotations from brokers. Some of these derivative contracts are long term and rely on forward price quotations over the entire duration of the derivative contracts. In the absence of the pricing sources listed above, for a small number of contracts, PSEG and its subsidiary companies utilize mathematical models that rely on historical data to develop forward pricing information in the determination of fair value. Because the determination of fair value using such models is subject to significant assumptions and estimates, PSEG and its subsidiary companies developed reserve policies that are consistently applied to model generated results to determine reasonable estimates of value to record in the financial statements. PSEG and its subsidiaries have entered into various derivative instruments in order to hedge exposure to commodity price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. Many such instruments have been designated as cash flow hedges. For a cash flow hedge, the change in the value of a derivative instrument is measured against the offsetting change in the value of the underlying contract or business condition the derivative instrument is intended to hedge. This is known as the measure of derivative effectiveness. In accordance with SFAS 133, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, net of tax, or as a Regulatory Asset (Liability). Amounts in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss are ultimately recognized in earnings when the related hedged forecasted transaction occurs. During periods of extreme price volatility, there will be significant changes in the value recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. The changes in the fair value of the ineffective portions of derivative instrument designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in earnings. For Powers wholesale energy business, many of the forward sale, forward purchase and other option contracts are derivative instruments that hedge commodity price risk, but for which the businesses are not able to apply the hedge accounting guidance in SFAS 133. The changes in value of such derivative contracts are marked to market through earnings as commodity prices fluctuate. As a result, the earnings of PSEG and Power may experience significant fluctuations depending on the volatility of commodity prices. For Powers energy trading activities, all changes in the fair value of energy trading derivative contracts are recorded in earnings. For additional information regarding Derivative Financial Instruments, see Note 11. Financial Risk Management Activities. 77 Power Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT) Funds Power accounts for the assets in the NDT Funds under SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities (SFAS 115). The assets in the NDT Funds are classified as available for sale securities and are marked to market with unrealized gains and losses recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss unless securities with such unrealized losses are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired. Realized gains, losses and dividend and interest income are recorded on Powers and PSEGs Statements of Operations under Other Income and Other Deductions. Unrealized losses that are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired, as defined under SFAS 115, and related interpretive guidance, are charged against earnings rather than Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. PSE&G Unbilled Revenues Electric and gas revenues are recorded based on services rendered to customers during each accounting period. PSE&G records unbilled revenues for the estimated amount customers will be billed for services rendered from the time meters were last read to the end of the respective accounting period. Unbilled usage is calculated in two steps. The initial step is to apply a base usage per day to the number of unbilled days in the period. The second step estimates seasonal loads based upon the time of year and the variance of actual degree days and temperature humidity index hours of the unbilled period from expected norms. The resulting usage is priced at current rate levels and recorded as revenue. A calculation of the associated energy cost for the unbilled usage is recorded as well. Each month the prior months unbilled amounts are reversed and the current months amounts are accrued. Using benchmarks other than those used in this calculation could have a material effect on the amounts accrued in a reporting period. The resulting revenue and expense reflect the service rendered in the calendar month. PSE&G SFAS 71 PSE&G prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 71, which differs in certain respects from the application of GAAP by non regulated businesses. In general, SFAS 71 recognizes that accounting for rate regulated enterprises should reflect the economic effects of regulation. As a result, a regulated utility is required to defer the recognition of costs (a Regulatory Asset) or recognize obligations (a Regulatory Liability) if it is probable that, through the rate making process, there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in future rates. Accordingly, PSE&G has deferred certain costs, which will be amortized over various future periods. To the extent that collection of such costs or payment of liabilities is no longer probable as a result of changes in regulation and or PSE&Gs competitive position, the associated Regulatory Asset or Liability is charged or credited to income. See Note 5. Regulatory Matters for additional information related to these and other regulatory issues. ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK PSEG, Power and PSE&G The market risk inherent in PSEGs, Powers and PSE&Gs market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity security prices and interest rates as discussed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Notes). It is the policy of each entity to use derivatives to manage risk consistent with its respective business plans and prudent practices. PSEG, Power and PSE&G have a Risk Management Committee comprised of executive officers who utilize an independent risk oversight function to ensure compliance with corporate policies and prudent risk management practices. Additionally, PSEG, Power and PSE&G are exposed to counterparty credit losses in the event of non performance or non payment. PSEG has a credit management process, which is used to assess, monitor and mitigate counterparty exposure for PSEG and its subsidiaries. In the event of non performance or non payment by a major counterparty, there may be a material adverse impact on PSEG and its subsidiaries financial condition, results of operations or net cash flows. 78 Commodity Contracts PSEG and Power The availability and price of energy related commodities are subject to fluctuations from factors such as weather, environmental policies, changes in supply and demand, state and federal regulatory policies, market rules and other events. To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, Power enters into supply contracts and derivative contracts, including forwards, futures, swaps and options with approved counterparties. These contracts, in conjunction with demand obligations help reduce risk and optimize the value of owned electric generation capacity. Normal Operations and Hedging Activities Power enters into physical contracts, as well as financial contracts, including forwards, futures, swaps and options designed to reduce risk associated with volatile commodity prices. Commodity price risk is associated with market price movements resulting from market generation demand, changes in fuel costs and various other factors. Under SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of qualifying cash flow hedge transactions are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, and gains and losses are recognized in earnings when the underlying transaction occurs. Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that do not meet hedge criteria under SFAS 133 and the ineffective portion of hedge contracts are recognized in earnings currently. Additionally, changes in the fair value attributable to fair value hedges are similarly recognized in earnings. Many non trading contracts qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exemption under SFAS 133 and are accounted for upon settlement. Trading Power maintains a strategy of entering into positions to optimize the value of its portfolio of generation assets, gas supply contracts and its electric and gas supply obligations. Power engages in physical and financial transactions in the electricity wholesale markets and executes an overall risk management strategy to mitigate the effects of adverse movements in the fuel and electricity markets. In addition, Power has non asset based trading activities, which have significantly decreased. These contracts also involve financial transactions including swaps, options and futures. These activities are marked to market in accordance with SFAS 133 with gains and losses recognized in earnings. Value at Risk (VaR) Models Power Power uses VaR models to assess the market risk of its commodity businesses. The portfolio VaR model for Power includes its owned generation and physical contracts, as well as fixed price sales requirements, load requirements and financial derivative instruments. VaR represents the potential gains or losses, under normal market conditions, for instruments or portfolios due to changes in market factors, for a specified time period and confidence level. Power estimates VaR across its commodity businesses. Power manages its exposure at the portfolio level. Its portfolio consists of owned generation, load serving contracts (both gas and electric), fuel supply contracts and energy derivatives designed to manage the risk around generation and load. While Power manages its risk at the portfolio level, it also monitors separately the risk of its trading activities and its hedges. Non trading MTM VaR consists of MTM derivatives that are economic hedges, some of which qualify for hedge accounting. The MTM derivatives that are not hedges are included in the trading VaR. The VaR models used by Power are variance/covariance models adjusted for the delta of positions with a 95% one tailed confidence level and a one day holding period for the MTM trading and non trading activities and a 95% one tailed confidence level with a one week holding period for the portfolio VaR. The models assume no new positions throughout the holding periods, whereas Power actively manages its portfolio. 79 Reduced trading activities by Power during 2007 have resulted in less trading risk. As of each of December 31, 2007 trading VaR was less than $1 million. For the Year Ended December 31, 2007 Trading VaR Non TradingMTM VaR (Millions) 95% Confidence Level, One Day Holding Period, One Tailed: Period End $ * $ 48 Average for the Period $ * $ 45 High $ 1 $ 61 Low $ * $ 29 99% Confidence Level, One Day Holding Period, Two Tailed: Period End $ 1 $ 75 Average for the Period $ * $ 71 High $ 1 $ 95 Low $ * $ 45 * less than $1 million Interest Rates PSEG, Power and PSE&G PSEG, Power and PSE&G are subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. It is the policy of PSEG, Power and PSE&G to manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floating rate debt, interest rate swaps and interest rate lock agreements. PSEG, Power and PSE&G manage their respective interest rate exposures by maintaining a targeted ratio of fixed and floating rate debt. As of December 31, 2007, a hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would result in $2 million of additional annual interest costs related to debt at PSEG. In addition, as of December 31, 2007, a hypothetical 10% decrease in market interest rates would result in a $227 million increase in the fair value of debt of PSEG and its subsidiaries, including $116 million at PSE&G and $95 million at Power. Debt and Equity Securities PSEG, Power and PSE&G PSEG has approximately $3.4 billion invested in its pension plans. Although fluctuations in market prices of securities within this portfolio do not directly affect PSEGs earnings in the current period, changes in the value of these investments could affect PSEGs future contributions to these plans, its financial position if its accumulated benefit obligation under its pension plans exceeds the fair value of its pension funds and future earnings as PSEG could be required to adjust pension expense and its assumed rate of return. Power Powers NDT Funds are comprised of both fixed income and equity securities totaling $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2007. The fair value of equity securities is determined independently each month by the Trustee. As of December 31, 2007, the portfolio was comprised of approximately $759 million of equity securities and approximately $517 million in fixed income securities. The fair market value of the assets in the NDT Funds will fluctuate primarily depending upon the performance of equity markets. As of December 31, 2007, a hypothetical 10% change in the equity market would impact the value of the equity securities in the NDT Funds by approximately $76 million. Power uses duration to measure the interest rate sensitivity of the fixed income portfolio. Duration is a summary statistic of the effective average maturity of the fixed income portfolio. The benchmark for the fixed income component of the NDT Funds is the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which currently has duration of 4.41 years and a yield of 6.97%. The portfolios value will appreciate or depreciate by the duration with a 1% change in interest rates. As of December 31, 2007, a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates would result in a decline in the market value for the fixed income portfolio of approximately $21 million. 80 Credit Risk PSEG, Power and PSE&G Credit risk relates to the risk of loss that PSEG, Power and PSE&G would incur as a result of non performance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. PSEG, Power and PSE&G have established credit policies that they believe significantly minimize credit risk. These policies include an evaluation of potential counterparties financial condition (including credit rating), collateral requirements under certain circumstances and the use of standardized agreements, which may allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty. Power Counterparties expose Powers operations to credit losses in the event of non performance or non payment. Power has a credit management process, which is used to assess, monitor and mitigate counterparty exposure for Power and its subsidiaries. Powers counterparty credit limits are based on a scoring model that considers a variety of factors, including leverage, liquidity, profitability, credit ratings and risk management capabilities. Power has entered into payment netting agreements or enabling agreements that allow for payment netting with the majority of its large counterparties, which reduce Powers exposure to counterparty risk by providing the offset of amounts payable to the counterparty against amounts receivable from the counterparty. In the event of non performance or non payment by a major counterparty, there may be a material adverse impact on Powers and its subsidiaries financial condition, results of operations or net cash flows. As of December 31, 2007, approximately 80% of the credit exposure (MTM plus net receivables and payables, less cash collateral) for Powers operations was with investment grade counterparties. The majority of the credit exposure with non investment grade counterparties was with certain companies that supply fuel (primarily coal) to Power. Therefore, this exposure relates to the risk of a counterparty performing under its obligations rather than payment risk. In the first quarter of 2008, exposure to coal counterparties increased, reducing credit exposure with investment grade counterparties to 64%. Coal prices have increased materially since the beginning of 2008. PSE&G BGS suppliers expose PSE&G to credit losses in the event of non performance or non payment upon a default of the BGS supplier. Credit requirements are governed under BPU approved BGS contracts. Global Global has credit risk with respect to its counterparties to PPAs and other parties. Resources Resources has credit risk related to its investments in leveraged leases, totaling $781 million, which is net of deferred taxes of $2 billion, as of December 31, 2007. These investments are largely concentrated in the energy industry. As of December 31, 2007, 66% of counterparties in the lease portfolio were rated investment grade by both S&P and Moodys. As of December 31, 2007, the weighted average credit rating of the lessees in Resources leasing portfolio was A/A3 by S&P and Moodys respectively. The credit exposure to the lessees is partially mitigated through various credit enhancement mechanisms within the lease transactions. These credit enhancement features vary from lease to lease. Some of the leasing transactions include covenants that restrict the flow of dividends from the lessee to its parent, over collateralization of the lessee with non leased assets, historical and forward cash flow coverage tests that prohibit discretionary capital expenditures and dividend payments to the parent/lessee if stated minimum coverages are not met and similar cash flow restrictions if ratings are not maintained at stated levels. These covenants are designed to maintain cash reserves in the transaction entity for the benefit of the non recourse lenders and the lessor/equity participants in the event of a market downturn or degradation in operating performance of the leased assets. In any lease transaction, in the event of a default, Resources would exercise its rights and attempt to seek recovery of its investment. The results of such efforts may not be known for a period of time. A bankruptcy of a lessee and failure to recover adequate value could lead to a foreclosure of the lease. Under a worst case scenario, if a foreclosure were to occur, Resources would record a pre tax write off up to its gross 81 investment, including deferred taxes, in these facilities. Also, in the event of a potential foreclosure, the net tax benefits generated by Resources portfolio of investments could be materially reduced in the period in which gains associated with the potential forgiveness of debt at these projects occurs. The amount and timing of any potential reduction in net tax benefits is dependent upon a number of factors including, but not limited to, the time of a potential foreclosure, the amount of lease debt outstanding, any cash trapped at the projects and negotiations during such potential foreclosure process. The potential loss of earnings, impairment and or tax payments could have a material impact to PSEGs financial position, results of operations and net cash flows. Other Supplemental Information Regarding Market Risk Power The following table describes the drivers of Powers energy trading and marketing activities and Operating Revenues included in its Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2007. Normal operations and hedging activities represent the marketing of electricity available from Powers owned or contracted generation sold into the wholesale market. As the information in this table highlights, MTM activities represent a small portion of the total Operating Revenues for Power. Activities accounted for under the accrual method, including normal purchases and sales, account for the majority of the revenue. The MTM activities reported here are those relating to changes in fair value due to external movement in prices. For additional information, see Note 11. Financial Risk Management Activities.

See Note 2. Recent Accounting Standards for additional information. Wherever possible, fair values for these contracts were obtained from quoted market sources. For contracts where no quoted market exists, modeling techniques were employed using assumptions reflective of current market rates, yield curves and forward prices as applicable to interpolate. 84 PSEG and Power The following table identifies losses on cash flow hedges that are currently in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, a separate component of equity. Power uses forward sale and purchase contracts, swaps and firm transmission rights contracts to hedge forecasted energy sales from its generation stations and its contracted supply obligations. Power also enters into swaps, options and futures transactions to hedge the price of fuel to meet its fuel purchase requirements for generation. PSEG and Power are subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. PSEGs policy is to manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and interest rate derivatives. The table also provides an estimate of the losses, net of taxes that are expected to be reclassified out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss and into earnings over the next twelve months.

Credit exposure is defined as any positive results of netting accounts receivable/accounts payable and the forward value on open positions. It further delineates that exposure by the credit rating of the counterparties and provides guidance on the concentration of credit risk to individual counterparties and an indication of the maturity of a companys credit risk by credit rating of the counterparties.
