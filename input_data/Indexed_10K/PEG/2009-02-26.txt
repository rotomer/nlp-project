ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A) This combined MD&A is separately filed by PSEG, Power and PSE&G. Information contained herein relating to any individual company is filed by such company on its own behalf. Power and PSE&G each make representations only as to itself and make no representations whatsoever as to any other company. PSEGs business consists of three reportable segments, which are: Power, our wholesale energy supply company that integrates its generating asset operations with its wholesale energy, fuel supply, energy trading and marketing and risk management activities primarily in the Northeast and Mid Atlantic U.S.; PSE&G, our public utility company which provides transmission and distribution of electric energy and gas in New Jersey; and Energy Holdings, which owns our other generation assets and holds other energy related investments. OVERVIEW OF 2008 AND FUTURE OUTLOOK Our business discussion in Item 1 provides a review of the regions and markets where we operate and compete, as well as our strategy for conducting our businesses within these markets, focusing on operational excellence, financial strength and making disciplined investments. The following discussion expands upon that discussion by describing significant events and business developments that have occurred during 2008 and key factors that will drive our future performance. Operational Excellence Market prices for electricity, fuels and other commodities related to our generation business are volatile, which can impact our business results positively or negatively, especially if sustained beyond our current contract periods. Given this volatility in the market, a key factor in our success is our ability to operate our nuclear and fossil generating stations at sufficient capacity factors in order to limit the need to purchase higher priced electricity to satisfy obligations under our sales contracts. In 2008, we completed projects at Hope Creek and Salem stations, increasing our nominal generating capacity by a total of approximately 173 MW. This additional capacity, combined with an increase in the capacity factor at our nuclear facilities from 91% in 2007 to 93% in 2008 and the improved output from our fossil plants drove an increase in the total output from our Northeast/Mid Atlantic generating facilities from approximately 53,200 GWh in 2007 to 55,300 GWh in 2008. Our estimated fuel needs are subject to change based upon the level of our operations as well as upon market demands for, and on the price of, coal. We have recently renegotiated our coal contract with a key supplier which will increase coal costs. For additional information, see Item 1. Business. We believe we can continue to manage our fuel sourcing needs in this dynamic market but changes in prices and demand could impact our future operations or financial results. Over the long term, our success also depends on the continuation of reasonable prices in the energy and capacity markets. We must also be able to effectively manage our construction projects and continue to economically operate our generation facilities under increasingly stringent environmental requirements, including legislation, regulation and voluntary restrictions that address: the control of carbon dioxide emissions to reduce the effects of global climate change and greenhouse gas; other emissions such as nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and mercury; and 49 the potential need for significant upgrades to existing intake structures and cooling systems at our larger once through cooled plants, including Salem, Hudson, Mercer, Sewaren, New Haven and Bridgeport. Our operations could also be impacted by regulatory or legislative actions favoring non competitive markets, energy efficiency initiatives, and regulatory policies favoring the construction of rate based transmission that may result in increased imports of generation, which may be subject to less stringent environmental regulation, into areas served by our generation assets. Also, at times, some of the market based mechanisms in which we participate, including BGS auctions and RPM capacity payments, are the subject of review or discussion in the regulatory and political arenas by participants including FERC, the BPU, and the PJM market monitor. Accordingly, we can provide no assurance that any or all of these mechanisms will continue to exist in their current form. For additional information, see Item 1. Business Regulatory Issues. Due to market volatility, strong competition, market complexity and constantly changing forward prices, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to contract our generation output at attractive prices. While higher forward prices may have a potentially significant beneficial impact on margins, they would also raise any replacement power costs that we may incur in the event of unanticipated outages, and could also further increase liquidity requirements as a result of contract obligations. For additional information on liquidity requirements, see Liquidity and Capital Resources. Our operations focus on maintaining system reliability and safety levels. During 2008, we continued to attain top decile performance in our ability to limit service interruptions, outage restoration times and gas leaks per mile. Our utility operation results depend on the treatment of the various rate and other issues by the BPU and FERC, as well as other state and federal regulatory agencies. Therefore, our success will depend on our ability to: continue cost containment initiatives; attain an adequate return on the investments we plan to make in our electric and gas transmission and distribution system; and continue recovery of the regulatory assets we have deferred. We expect to file a joint electric and gas rate case by mid 2009 with a request that rates become effective in 2010. The FERC has recently approved our petition to implement formula rates for our existing and future transmission investments. This forward looking formula rate mechanism allows us to update our transmission rates annually based on forecasted Operation and Maintenance Expense and capital expenditures for the coming year, with no lag of recovery, and will provide for a true up to actual expenditures in the subsequent year. Financial Strength We continued to take steps to strengthen our financial position during 2008. We reduced our international investment exposure through the sale of the SAESA Group in Chile and our 85% ownership interest in Bioenergie in Italy and used the proceeds from these assets sales and other cash on hand to reduce outstanding debt. We repurchased 2,382,200 shares of our Common Stock under a program authorized by the Board of Directors in August and added capacity to our credit facilities during the year. We also reduced our financial risk by establishing a reserve for a significant percentage of our leveraged lease related tax exposure. We believe that our strong operations and strong financial position will allow us to manage through the current weakening financial markets which has resulted in increased costs of borrowing as well as significant reductions in the value of both our pension trust and Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT) funds. The reduction in value of the pension trust fund during the year is expected to result in an increase 50 to pension expense of $131 million in 2009 as compared to 2008. We will also likely make additional cash contributions of up to $275 million for pension funding in 2009. Total pension costs were $37 million in 2008 and are projected to be approximately $215 million in 2009. Of the total amount of pension expense, the amounts recognized in 2008 and expected to be recognized in 2009 in the Consolidated Statements of Operations are as follows: 2008 2009Expected Millions Power $ 14 $ 77 PSE&G 15 82 Energy Holdings 2 3 Total $ 31 $ 162 The amounts above include the portion of Services costs charged to each company. The difference between total cost and amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations is due to amounts capitalized. We have and will continue to review our other proposed spending in response to these market concerns. Going forward, we will continue to focus on reducing costs while maintaining our safety and reliability standards. We expect that our cash from our operations, when combined with cash on hand, will be the primary source used to: support our projected capital expenditure program, fund shareholder dividends, fund contributions to the pension funds, and provide for potential payments to address income tax claims related to our leveraged lease transactions, discussed in Note 11. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. Any funds remaining after satisfying these obligations, when combined with potential additional financing capacity, would be discretionary cash that could be used to invest in the business, reduce debt and or repurchase common stock. Disciplined Investment During 2008, we also continued to pursue investments focusing on areas that complement our existing businesses and provide prudent growth opportunities. These areas include responding to climate change and continuing to improve environmental performance, upgrading critical energy infrastructure and providing new energy supplies in a disciplined manner. Some examples of actions taken pursuant to this investment philosophy include: Construction of back end technology at Mercer, Hudson and Keystone stations to meet our environmental commitments. Conducting engineering and design work in connection with the Susquehanna Roseland 500 kV transmission project with construction expected to begin in early 2010 to meet a 2012 in service date. Our share of this transmission project is expected to cost $750 million over the next four years. Proposing stimulus programs to the BPU for us to invest approximately $888 million in capital infrastructure and energy efficiency programs over a two year period beginning in April 2009. 51 Making funds available for approximately $105 million in a solar energy pilot program designed to spur investment in solar power in New Jersey to meet energy goals under the Energy Master Plan. Filing a new solar initiative with the BPU seeking to invest approximately $773 million to develop 120 MW of solar power over a five year horizon. Pursuing construction of 130 MW of gas fired peaking capacity in Connecticut for an estimated cost of $130 million to $140 million, with construction commencing in June 2011. Pursuing the potential development of an offshore wind project, and a modest amount of solar and other renewable energy projects at Energy Holdings. There is no guarantee that these or future initiatives will be achieved since many issues need to be favorably resolved, such as system reliability concerns, regulatory approvals and construction or development costs.

See Note 11. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities for additional information. 53 Earnings were slightly lower at PSE&G due to lower gas delivery sales and higher Operations and Maintenance expense. Earnings were higher at Power due to higher prices realized under sales contracts and higher sales volumes, partially offset by higher generation costs, losses in the NDT Funds and higher Operation and Maintenance Costs. Excluding the lease transaction charges, Energy Holdings earnings were higher due to lower interest and bond premiums and improved operations at the Texas generation facilities, partially offset by lower income from assets sold. For a detailed explanation of the variances, see the discussions for Power, PSE&G and Energy Holdings below. Power For the Years EndedDecember 31, Increase /(Decrease) Increase /(Decrease) 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs 2007 2007 vs 2006 Millions Income from Continuing Operations $ 1,050 $ 949 $ 515 $ 101 $ 434 Loss from Discontinued Operations, including Loss on Disposal, net of tax (8 ) (239 ) (8 ) (231 ) Net Income $ 1,050 $ 941 $ 276 $ 93 $ 203 For the year ended December 31, 2008, the primary reasons for the increase in Income from Continuing Operations were higher prices and sales volumes on BGS contracts and in the various power pools, partially offset by higher generation costs, and higher prices on a reduced sales volume under the BGSS contract due to customer conservation and a milder winter heating season in 2008, partially offset by net losses on investments in the NDT Funds. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the primary reasons for the increase in Income from Continuing Operations were higher prices realized from new contracts, including BGS contracts, combined with higher sales volumes and lower generation costs, and improved margins and higher sales volumes under the BGSS contract due to a colder winter heating season and more favorable fuel pricing in 2007. 54 The year over year detail for these variances for these periods are discussed below: Power For the Years EndedDecember 31, Increase /(Decrease) Increase /(Decrease) 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs 2007 2007 vs 2006 Millions Millions % Millions % Operating Revenues $ 7,770 $ 6,796 $ 6,057 $ 974 14 $ 739 N/A Energy Costs 4,556 3,975 3,955 581 15 20 1 Operation and Maintenance 1,054 1,001 1,002 53 5 (1 ) Depreciation and Amortization 164 140 140 24 17 Other Income and Deductions (121 ) 69 66 (190 ) (275 ) 3 5 Interest Expense (164 ) (159 ) (148 ) 5 3 11 7 Income Tax Expense (661 ) (641 ) (363 ) 20 3 278 77 Loss from Discontinued Operations, including Loss on Disposal, net of tax $ $ (8 ) $ (239 ) $ 8 100 $ (231 ) (97 ) For the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to 2007 Operating Revenues increased $974 million due to: Generation revenues increased $797 million due to a net increase of $355 million from higher prices on a higher volume of BGS contracts modestly offset by the expiration of several contracts in May 2008, higher revenues of $331 million and $20 million resulting from a higher volume of generation being sold at higher prices into PJM and NEPOOL, respectively, $33 million from higher prices on a lower volume of sales in the New York power pool, $67 million from higher capacity prices resulting from the changes in the capacity markets in PJM, New York and Connecticut, and $32 million for ancillary and other services as well as a damage claim awarded by the federal government for an oil spill in the Delaware River in 2004, partially offset by $25 million of net losses on financial hedging transactions. Gas Supply revenues increased $154 million including $130 million resulting from sales under the BGSS contract, comprised of $208 million from higher prices partly offset by lower sales volumes of $78 million due to customer conservation and milder winter temperatures in 2008, and a net increase of $27 million due to higher prices on sales to third party customers on a reduced sales volume. Trading revenues increased $23 million principally due to gains on electric related contracts and contracts related to financial transmission rights. Operating Expenses Energy Costs represent the cost of generation, which includes fuel purchases for generation as well as purchased energy in the market, and gas purchases to meet Powers obligation under its BGSS contract with PSE&G. Energy Costs increased by $581 million due to: Generation costs increased by $410 million due to $445 million of higher fuel costs related to higher prices and higher volumes of natural gas and $17 million of higher costs of purchases reflecting higher prices, partly offset by net gains of $59 million from financial hedging transactions. 55 Gas costs increased $171 million, reflecting net increases of $150 million and $34 million related to Powers obligations under the BGSS contract and sales to third party customers, respectively, reflecting higher inventory costs partially offset by reduced volumes. These increases were partially offset by a reduction of $14 million in losses on financial hedging transactions in 2008 as compared to 2007. Operation and Maintenance increased $53 million primarily due to a net increase of $47 million due to planned outages and higher maintenance costs at our fossil stations, primarily Hudson and Linden, and an increase of $10 million related to planned outages at the Peach Bottom and Salem stations. Depreciation and Amortization increased $24 million due to an increase of $14 million resulting from a larger depreciable nuclear and fossil asset base in 2008, and an increase of $9 million due to depreciation of pollution control equipment being placed into service at our Bridgeport generating facility. Other Income and Deductions decreased $190 million due to higher charges of $147 million ($219 million in 2008 versus $72 million in 2007) for other than temporary impairments related to the NDT Fund securities, net unrealized losses of $24 million on the NDT Fund derivative instruments, lower interest income of $13 million from short term loans to our parent company, and a $13 million charge for the purchase of net operating loss carryforwards under the State of New Jersey Tax Benefit Purchase Program, partially offset by an increase of $5 million from net realized income related to the NDT Funds. Interest Expense increased $5 million primarily due to the issuance of $40 million of 5.75% Pollution Control Bonds due 2037 in November 2007 and $44 million of 4.00% Pollution Control Bonds due 2042 in December 2007. Income Tax Expense increased $20 million in 2008 primarily due to an increase of $50 million due to higher pre tax income, partially offset by a reduction of $16 million due to lower earnings from the NDT Funds, and a reduction of $9 million due to increased benefits from a manufacturing deduction under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to 2006 Operating Revenues increased $739 million due to: Generation revenues increased $416 million due to higher revenues of $355 million from higher prices on BGS fixed price contracts, and $149 million from higher capacity prices resulting from the changes in the capacity markets in PJM and Connecticut, which resulted in $47 million in reduced RMR revenues in these markets. Power also had increased revenues resulting from more generation being sold into the various pools following the expiration of certain wholesale power contracts. The increased revenues from sales into the various pools offset the reduction in wholesale contract revenues. 56 Gas Supply revenues increased $349 million including $248 million resulting from higher sales volumes under the BGSS contract, largely due to colder average temperatures in the 2007 winter heating season, recognition of gains of $69 million on financial hedging transactions, and to a lesser degree, increases due to increased pricing and volumes sold to other gas distributors and increased revenues received for balancing and storage due to higher sales volumes and higher tariff rates that became effective in January 2007. Trading revenues decreased $26 million mainly due to the absence of gains related to emissions credits that were realized in 2006. Operating Expenses Energy Costs increased $20 million due to: Gas Costs increased $247 million due to a $209 million net increase from a higher volume of gas sold at lower prices to satisfy Powers BGSS obligations, an increase of $22 million from a higher volume of sales to third party customers and an increase of $16 million due to the recognition of losses in 2007 coupled with gains in 2006 related to financial hedging transactions. Generation Costs decreased $227 million due to lower pool purchases of $240 million, resulting from reduced load obligations in Connecticut following the expiration of a wholesale power contract in 2006, combined with $124 million in lower congestion and transmission costs. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $154 million due to higher volumes of fuel purchases, primarily natural gas, as these units ran more during 2007. Operation and Maintenance decreased $1 million due to a write down of $44 million in 2006 related to four turbines which were sold in April 2007. For additional information, see Note 3. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions and Impairments, mostly offset by an increase of $43 million due to costs incurred in 2007 related to various maintenance projects at certain fossil stations, mainly Hudson and Mercer. Depreciation and Amortization experienced no material change Other Income and Deductions increased $3 million due to increased net realized income of $42 million related to the NDT Funds, the absence of $14 million of penalties that were recorded in 2006 related to negotiations concerning environmental concerns and an alternate pollution reduction plan for Hudson, and increased interest income of $13 million from short term loans to our parent company, partially offset by increased charges of $58 million recorded in 2007 for other than temporary impairments related to the NDT Fund securities, and the absence of $6 million of expense reversals recorded in 2006 related to certain excess liability reserves. 57 Interest Expense increased $11 million due to a $20 million increase due to the reclassification of Interest Expense to Discontinued Operations of the Lawrenceburg facility combined with a $23 million increase due to the absence of capitalized interest related to the Linden construction project since its completion in May 2006, partially offset by a reduction of $15 million due to interest capitalized on a higher volume of construction projects in 2007, the absence of $10 million of interest expense in 2007 due to the maturity of the 6.87% Senior Notes in April 2006, as well as decreases in interest incurred on lower average short term borrowings from our parent company and lower commitment and letter of credit fees. Income Tax Expense increased $278 million in 2007 primarily due to higher pre tax income. Loss from Discontinued Operations, including Loss on Disposal, net of tax In connection with the sale of its Lawrenceburg generation facility, Power recorded an after tax charge of $208 million which was reflected in Discontinued Operations in the fourth quarter of 2006. After tax Losses from Discontinued Operations of Lawrenceburg, not including the Loss on Disposal, were $8 million and $31 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. See Note 3. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions and Impairments for additional information.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, the primary reasons for the increase in Income from Continuing Operations were the full year effect of the electric and gas base rate increases which became effective in November 2006, and the return to a normal heating load (degree days were 16% higher in 2007 compared to 2006) for gas and a 2% growth in electric sales. 58 The year over year detail for these variances for these periods are discussed below: PSE&G For the Years EndedDecember 31, Increase /(Decrease) Increase /(Decrease) 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs 2007 2007 vs 2006 Millions Millions % Millions % Operating Revenues $ 9,038 $ 8,493 $ 7,569 $ 545 6 $ 924 12 Energy Costs 6,072 5,498 4,884 574 10 614 13 Operation and Maintenance 1,338 1,308 1,160 30 2 148 13 Depreciation and Amortization 583 591 620 (8 ) (1 ) (29 ) (5 ) Other Income and Deductions 8 12 22 (4 ) (33 ) (10 ) (45 ) Interest Expense (325 ) (332 ) (346 ) (7 ) (2 ) (14 ) (4 ) Income Tax Expense (228 ) (257 ) (183 ) (29 ) (11 ) 74 40 For the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to 2007 Operating Revenues increased $545 million primarily due to: Commodity related revenues increased $573 million due to increased electric revenues of $432 million primarily due to $379 million in higher BGS revenues (higher auction prices of $491 million offset by decreased sales of $112 million) and $75 million in higher non utility generation (NUG) prices, and increased gas revenues of $141 million due to $234 million in increased BGSS prices offset by $93 million in lower sales due to weather and economic conditions. Delivery revenues decreased $23 million due to decreased gas revenues of $23 million due to $14 million of lower SBC revenues and $9 million of lower sales due to weather and economic conditions. The SBC revenues were 10% lower in 2008, and flat electric revenues including $49 million in decreased sales and demands due to weather and economic conditions and a lower transmission peak, offset by $49 million for SBC, securitization transition charge and transmission rate increases. PSE&G retains no margins from SBC or STC collections as the revenues are offset in operating expenses below. Operating Expenses Energy Costs increased $574 million due to increased electric costs of $432 million due to $556 million or 17% in higher prices for BGS and NUG purchases offset by $124 million or 4% in lower BGS volumes due to weather and economic conditions, and increased gas costs of $142 million due to $234 million or 11% in higher prices offset by $93 million or 4% in lower sales volumes due to weather and economic conditions. Operation and Maintenance increased $30 million primarily due to increases in Electric SBC expenses of $42 million, and $8 million of bad debt expense, partially offset by lower injuries and damages of $8 million, lower gas SBC expenses of $6 million which were offset in delivery revenues with no impact on net income, and 59 decreased payroll and fringes of $8 million. Depreciation and Amortization decreased $8 million due to decreases of $10 million for amortization of regulatory assets, $5 million in software amortization, and $5 million in amortization of DOE enrichment facility decommissioning costs, partially offset by increases of $12 million due to additional plant in service. Other Income and Deductions decreased $4 million due to $7 million in lower investment income due to current market conditions, partially offset by a $3 million reduction in income tax gross ups on contributions in aid of construction (CIAC). CIAC is taxable and PSE&G recognizes the gross up as income when collected. Interest Expense experienced no material change. Income Tax Expense decreased $29 million primarily due to $18 million on lower pre tax income, and $17 million in FIN 48 adjustments related to an IRS refund. For the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to 2006 Operating Revenues increased $924 million primarily due to: Commodity related revenues increased $613 million due to increased electric revenues of $510 million due to $541 million in higher BGS revenues (higher auction prices of $484 million plus increased sales of $57 million), and $44 million in higher NUG prices, offset by a $74 million decrease in the NGC revenues ($78 million in lower prices due to a March 2007 rate change offset by $4 million in higher volumes), increased gas revenues of $103 million due to $240 million in increased sales due to weather offset by $137 million in lower BGSS prices. Delivery revenues increased $301 million due to Electric revenues increased $169 million due to $83 million for increased SBC rates, $42 million due to increased base rates effective November 2006 and $44 million in increased sales and demands primarily due to weather. Gas revenues increased $132 million due to weather, $39 million due to the SBC rate increases in November 2006 and March 2007 and $31 million due to base rate increases effective November 2006. Operating Expenses Energy Costs increased $614 million due to increased electric costs of $512 million due to $453 million or 18% in higher prices for BGS and NUG purchases and $59 million or 2% in higher BGS volumes due to weather, and increased gas costs of $102 million due to a $239 million or 11% increase in sales volumes due to weather offset by $137 million in lower prices. 60 Operation and Maintenance increased $148 million primarily due to increased SBC expenses of $132 million resulting from rate increases in November 2006 and March 2007, which were offset in delivery revenues with no impact on net income, increased payroll of $16 million, and a higher reserve for injuries and damages of $10 million, partially offset by $19 million in lower pension expenses. Depreciation and Amortization decreased $29 million due to decreases of $30 million due to revised plant depreciation rates and $11 million due to lower cost of removal rates, both resulting from the November 2006 rate case, and a decrease of $8 million for software fully amortized in 2006, partially offset by increases of $11 million due to amortization of regulatory assets and $9 million due to additional plant in service. Other Income and Deductions decreased $10 million primarily due to a $7 million reduction in income tax gross ups on CIAC. Interest Expense decreased $14 million due to lower interest expense of $12 million related to settlement of IRS audits in 2006, and lower interest on regulatory clauses of $7 million, partially offset by an increase of $5 million due to new debt issuances in December 2006 and May 2007. Income Tax Expense increased $74 million primarily due to higher pre tax income.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, the primary reasons for the increase in Income from Continuing Operations were the absence of the loss on the sale of RGE in 2006, 61 partially offset by lower operational earnings at our Texas plants, driven by lower volume and lower unrealized MTM gains, partially offset by higher prices, the loss resulting from the sale of Chilquinta and LDS in 2007, higher premium on bond redemption, and lower leveraged lease income in 2007. The year over year detail for these variances for these periods are below: Energy Holdings For the Years EndedDecember 31, Increase /(Decrease) Increase /(Decrease) 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs 2007 2007 vs 2006 Millions Millions % Millions % Operating Revenues $ 345 $ 793 $ 929 $ (448 ) (56 ) $ (136 ) (15 ) Energy Costs 496 439 515 57 13 (76 ) (15 ) Operation and Maintenance 128 126 127 2 2 (1 ) (2 ) Depreciation and Amortization 29 30 28 (1 ) (3 ) 2 7 Income from Equity Method Investments 37 115 115 (78 ) (68 ) Gain (Loss) on Sale of and (Impairment) on Equity Method Investments (27 ) 137 (272 ) (164 ) N/A 409 N/A Other Income and (Deductions) 25 (25 ) 15 50 N/A (40 ) N/A Interest Expense (83 ) (151 ) (183 ) (68 ) (45 ) (32 ) (17 ) Income Tax (Expense) Credit (47 ) (211 ) 36 (164 ) (78 ) 247 N/A Income from Discontinued Operations, including Gain (Loss) on Disposal, net of tax $ 205 $ 18 $ 305 $ 187 N/A $ (287 ) (94 ) For the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to 2007 Operating Revenues decreased $448 million primarily due to $485 million charge on leveraged leases in 2008, and $38 million decrease in leveraged lease income, due to lease adjustments, partially offset by $87 million in higher revenue from our Texas plants due to $172 million increase in electricity prices, partially offset by $31 million in higher unrealized MTM losses, and a $54 million decrease in electricity sales. Operating Expenses Energy Costs increased $57 million related to our Texas plants primarily due to $103 million for higher fuel prices, partially offset by $41 million in lower fuel consumption, and $9 million in higher unrealized MTM gains on gas purchases driven by strengthening of the forward market curve for 2008 and beyond. Operation and Maintenance increased $2 million primarily due to higher scheduled maintenance at our Texas plants. Depreciation and Amortization experienced no material change. 62 Income from Equity Method Investments decreased $78 million primarily due to the absence of earnings of $65 million from Chilquinta and LDS which were sold in 2007, and $7 million in lower income from GWF, due to higher fuel costs and lower generation. Gain (Loss) on Sale of and Impairment on Equity Method Investments decreased $164 million due to the absence of $153 million pre tax gain on the sale of equity investments in 2007, and $11 million in higher write downs of investment in PPN and Turboven in 2008 as compared to 2007. Other Income and Deductions increased $50 million primarily due to $46 million of lower loss on the early retirement of debt resulting from the December 2007 redemption of Energy Holdings 10% Senior Notes due 2009, and $6 million of higher interest and dividend income. Interest Expense decreased $68 million primarily due to lower debt balances. Income Tax Expense decreased $164 million primarily due to the absence of $163 million of taxes recorded as a result of the sale of Chilquinta and LDS in 2007, and $37 million of lower FIN 48 expense, partially offset by $14 million in higher taxes on pre tax income and $18 million of federal and state audit adjustments for prior years paid in 2008. Income from Discontinued Operations, including Gains on Disposal, net of tax Electroandes In October 2007, we sold our investment in Electroandes. Income from Discontinued Operations, including Gain on Disposal, related to Electroandes for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $58 million and $16 million respectively. SAESA Group In July 2008, we sold our investment in SAESA Group. Income from Discontinued Operations, including Gain on Disposal, related to SAESA for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $217 million, $(34) million and $57 million, respectively. Bioenergie In November 2008, we sold our ownership interest in Bioenergie. Income from Discontinued Operations, including Loss on Disposal, related to Bioenergie for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $(12) million, $(6) million and $6 million respectively. See Note 3. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions and Impairments for additional information. For the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to 2006 Operating Revenues decreased $136 million, primarily due to $114 million in lower generation revenues at our Texas plants, primarily due to $80 million of lower electricity sales, resulting from forced outages at both facilities, and $42 million in lower unrealized MTM gains on electricity, largely driven by strengthening of forward curves for 2007, partially offset by an $8 million increase in electricity prices, and $17 million in reduced leveraged lease revenue due primarily to the effect of adopting FIN 48 and FSP13 2. 63 Operating Expenses Energy Costs decreased $76 million primarily due to lower generation at our Texas plants including $42 million in lower fuel consumption, $22 million in reduced MTM costs on gas purchases driven by improvement of future spark spreads for 2007 and beyond, and an $8 million reduction in purchased power costs. Operation and Maintenance experienced no material change. Depreciation and Amortization experienced no material change. Gain (Loss) on Sale and Impairment of Equity Method Investments increased $409 million primarily due to the absence of $263 million pre tax loss on the sale of RGE in 2006, and $153 million pre tax gain on the sale of equity investments in 2007, partially offset by $9 million in higher write down of investments in PPN and Turboven. Other Income and Deductions decreased $40 million primarily due to $35 million loss on the early retirement of debt resulting from the redemption of Energy Holdings Senior Notes in 2007, and $9 million in lower interest income from our parent due to lower average intercompany debt balances. Interest Expense decreased $32 million due to $22 million in lower interest expense on senior notes at Energy Holdings due to redemptions, and lower interest expense due to lower non recourse debt balances. Income Tax Expense increased $247 million due primarily to $163 million of taxes recorded in 2007 as a result of the sale of Chilquinta and LDS, and the absence of the $93 million tax benefit obtained in 2006 on the impairment of RGE. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following discussion of our liquidity and capital resources is on a consolidated basis, noting the uses and contributions, where material, of our three direct operating subsidiaries. Financing Methodology Our capital requirements are met through internally generated cash flows and external financings, consisting of short term debt for liquidity purposes and long term debt and equity for capital investments. PSE&Gs sources of external liquidity include a $600 million multi year syndicated credit facility as well as bilateral credit agreements. PSE&Gs commercial paper program, which is sized at $600 million, is the primary vehicle for meeting its short term funding needs. This program provides liquidity to meet seasonal, intra month and temporary working capital needs. PSE&G does not engage in any intercompany borrowing or lending with PSEG or any other affiliate. PSE&Gs dividend payments to PSEG are consistent with its capital structure objectives which have been established to achieve solid investment grade credit ratings. PSE&Gs long term financing plan is designed to replace maturities, fund a portion of its capital program and manage short term debt balances. Generally, PSE&G uses either secured medium term notes or first mortgage bonds to raise long term capital which it believes will provide the lowest cost of financing and most consistent access to capital markets. 64 PSEG, Power, Energy Holdings and Services participate in a corporate money pool, an aggregation of daily cash balances designed to efficiently manage their respective short term liquidity needs. Energy Holdings has historically lent to the money pool; its primary source of liquidity is its invested balance with PSEG and a $136 million credit facility. PSEGs sources of external liquidity include a $1.0 billion multi year syndicated credit facility as well as bilateral credit agreements. These facilities are available to back stop PSEGs $1.0 billion commercial paper program, issue letters of credit, and for general corporate purposes. These facilities may also be used to provide support to Power for the issuance of letters of credit. PSEGs credit facilities and the $1 billion commercial paper program are available to support PSEG working capital needs or to temporarily fund growth opportunities in advance of obtaining permanent financing. From time to time, PSEG may make equity contributions or provide credit support to its subsidiaries. Powers sources of external liquidity include a $1.6 billion syndicated multi year credit facility. Additionally, from time to time, Power maintains bilateral credit agreements designed to enhance its liquidity position. Credit capacity is primarily used to provide collateral in support of hedging activities and to meet potential collateral postings in the event of a credit rating downgrade below investment grade. Powers dividends payments to the parent are also designed to be consistent with its capital structure objectives which have been established to achieve solid investment grade credit ratings and provide sufficient financial flexibility. Generally, Power issues either retail medium term notes or senior unsecured debt to raise long term capital. Operating Cash Flows Our operating cash flows combined with cash on hand and financing activities are expected to be sufficient to fund capital expenditures and shareholder dividend payments, with excess cash available to invest in the business, reduce debt and or repurchase common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2008, our operating cash flow increased by $424 million as compared to 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2007, our operating cash flow decreased by $5 million as compared to 2006. The net changes were due to net changes from our subsidiaries as discussed below. Power Powers operating cash flow increased $481 million from $1,205 million to $1,686 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to 2007, primarily resulting from an increase of $400 million in net cash collateral receipts, an increase of $121 million from net collections of counterparty receivables and an increase in net income of $109 million, partially offset by a decrease of $197 million due to higher gas and coal inventory prices and a buildup of coal inventory at the end of 2008. Powers operating cash flow increased $162 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to 2006, due principally to an increase in net income of $457 million, net of the Loss on Disposal of Lawrenceburg of $208 million, partially offset by an increase of $322 million in margin receivables related to higher collateral requirements. PSE&G PSE&Gs operating cash flow increased $235 million from $678 million to $913 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to 2007, primarily due to increases of $164 million in deferred income taxes due to bonus depreciation and increased planned 2009 pension contributions; $199 million in collections of customer receivables offset by decreases of $122 million in accounts payable due primarily to lower electric and gas payables; and $39 million in higher 2008 pension fund contributions. The December 2008 accounts receivable balance was slightly higher than the previous year while December 2007 had increased dramatically in comparison to the prior year when there was unusually mild weather in December 2006. The impact was higher cash flow from receivables in 2008. PSE&G anticipates lower cash collections from customers resulting in higher accounts receivable balances in 2009 due to current economic conditions. PSE&Gs operating cash flow decreased $128 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 2006, primarily due to a decline in cash from working capital. The operating cash flow for the year 2006 65 was $806 million primarily due to very cold weather at the end of 2005 which resulted in increased cash flow during 2006. The return of more normal weather conditions in 2007 caused operating cash flow to decline to the 2005 level. Energy Holdings Energy Holdings operating cash flow decreased $381 million from $71 million to $(310) million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to 2007. The decrease was mainly attributable to increased tax payments in 2008. Energy Holdings operating cash flow decreased $83 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 2006. The decrease was mainly due to a $100 million tax deposit made with the IRS in the fourth quarter of 2007 and the timing of tax payments related to the sales of Elcho, Skawina and RGE in 2006. Short Term Liquidity We have been managing our liquidity to assure that we continue to have sufficient access to cash to operate our businesses in the event the capital markets do not allow for near term financing at reasonable terms. We are also closely monitoring the financial condition and concentration of lenders in our bank facilities. There is no provision in any of the credit facilities that would require other lenders in the facility to assume loan commitments of any financial institution that fails to meet its loan commitments. No single institution is committing more than 9% of the total. We continually monitor our liquidity and seek to add capacity as needed to meet our liquidity requirements. During 2008, PSEG, Power and PSE&G added capacity of $147 million, $225 million and $28 million, respectively. Each of our credit facilities is restricted as to availability and use to the specific companies as listed below; however, if necessary, the PSEG facilities can also be used to support Powers liquidity needs. Our total credit facilities and available liquidity as of December 31, 2008 were as follows: Company/Facility TotalFacility As ofDecember 31, 2008 Usage AvailableLiquidity Millions PSEG $ 1,100 $ 13 $ 1,087 Power 2,000 288 1,712 PSE&G 600 20 580 Energy Holdings 136 21 115 Total $ 3,836 $ 342 $ 3,494 During 2009, $400 million of bilateral credit facilities at PSEG and Power are scheduled to expire. While we expect to request renewal of each of these facilities, no assurances can be given that such facilities will be renewed or renewed on reasonable terms. For additional information on the specific credit facilities, see Note 12. Schedule of Consolidated Debt. Long Term Debt Financing PSEG, Power and PSE&G have $249 million, $250 million and $60 million, respectively, of debt maturities upcoming in 2009, excluding securitized and non recourse debt. These maturities will occur during the second quarter of 2009 for Power and PSE&G and during the third and fourth quarters for PSEG. In February 2009, Energy Holdings issued a par call notice for the early redemption of its remaining $280 million outstanding non recourse project debt associated with its Texas assets. The debt, which is due on December 31, 2009, is expected to be redeemed by the end of February 2009. We believe that we will be 66 able to refinance or retire these obligations given our current financial position and demonstrated continued access to the capital markets. For a discussion of our long term debt transactions during 2008 and into 2009, see Note 12. Schedule of Consolidated Debt. Debt Covenants Our credit agreements may contain maximum debt to equity ratios, minimum cash flow tests and other restrictive covenants and conditions to borrowing. We are currently in compliance with all of our debt covenants. Continued compliance with applicable financial covenants will depend upon our future financial position, level of earnings and cash flows, as to which no assurances can be given. In addition, under its First and Refunding Mortgage (Mortgage), PSE&G may issue new First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds against previous additions and improvements, provided that its ratio of earnings to fixed charges calculated in accordance with its Mortgage is at least 2 to 1, and or against retired Mortgage Bonds. As of December 31, 2008, PSE&Gs Mortgage coverage ratio was 4.1 to 1 and the Mortgage would permit up to approximately $2.2 billion aggregate principal amount of new Mortgage Bonds to be issued against additions and improvements to its property. Default Provisions Our bank credit agreements and indentures contain various default provisions that could result in the potential acceleration of payment under the defaulting companys agreement. We have not defaulted under these agreements. PSEGs bank credit agreement and note purchase agreements related to private placement of debt contain cross default provisions under which events at Power or PSE&G, including payment defaults, bankruptcy events, the failure to satisfy certain final judgments or other events of default under their financing agreements, would each constitute an event of default under PSEGs agreements. Under the note purchase agreements, it is also an event of default if Power or PSE&G ceases to be wholly owned by PSEG. Under the bank credit agreement, both Power and PSE&G would have to cease to be wholly owned by PSEG before an event of default would occur. There are no cross default provisions to affiliates in Powers or PSE&Gs credit agreements or indentures. Ratings Triggers Our debt indentures and credit agreements do not contain any material ratings triggers that would cause an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a ratings downgrade. However, in the event of a downgrade, any one or more of the affected companies may be subject to increased interest costs on certain bank debt and certain collateral requirements. Fluctuations in commodity prices or a deterioration of Powers credit rating to below investment grade could increase Powers required margin postings under various agreements entered into in the normal course of business. Power believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet the required posting of collateral which would likely result from a credit rating downgrade at todays market prices. See Note 11. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities for further information. In accordance with BPU requirements under the BGS contracts, PSE&G is required to maintain an investment grade credit rating. If PSE&G were to lose its investment grade rating, it would be required to file a plan to assure continued payment for the BGS requirements of its customers. PSE&G is the servicer for the bonds issued by PSE&G Transition Funding LLC and PSE&G Transition Funding II LLC. If PSE&G were to lose its investment grade rating, PSE&G would be required to remit collected cash daily to the bond trustee. Currently, cash is remitted monthly. 67 Common Stock Dividends and Repurchases Dividend payments on common stock for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $1.29 per share and totaled $655 million. Dividend payments on common stock for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $1.17 per share and totaled $594 million. In July 2008, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of our common stock to be executed over 18 months beginning August 1, 2008. We are not obligated to acquire any specific number of shares and may suspend or terminate share repurchases at any time. We repurchased 2,382,200 shares of our common stock for $92 million under this authorization through September 30, 2008. No repurchases have been made since that date. On February 17, 2009, our Board of Directors also approved a $0.01 increase in our quarterly common stock dividend, from $0.3225 to $0.3325 per share for the first quarter of 2009. This reflects an indicated annual dividend rate of $1.33 per share. We expect to continue to pay cash dividends on our common stock; however, the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of our business, alternate investment opportunities, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant. Credit Ratings If the rating agencies lower or withdraw our credit ratings, such revisions may adversely affect the market price of our securities and serve to materially increase our cost of capital and limit access to capital. Outlooks assigned to ratings are as follows: stable, negative (Neg) or positive (Pos). There is no assurance that the ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be revised by the rating agencies, if, in their respective judgments, circumstances warrant. Each rating given by an agency should be evaluated independently of the other agencies ratings. The ratings should not be construed as an indication to buy, hold or sell any security. In June 2008, Moodys affirmed the rating of Energy Holdings and changed the ratings outlook to Stable from Negative. In July 2008, Moodys affirmed the ratings of PSEG and PSE&G and changed the ratings outlook of both companies to Stable from Negative. The rating and outlook of Power remained unchanged.

(C) Fitch ratings range from AAA (highest) to D (lowest) for long term securities and F1 (highest) to D (lowest) for short term securities. 68 Other Comprehensive Income For the year ended December 31, 2008, we had Other Comprehensive Income of $39 million on a consolidated basis. Other Comprehensive Income was primarily due to $429 million of unrealized gains on derivative contracts accounted for as hedges, substantially offset by $79 million of unrealized losses related to the NDT Funds, a $205 million increase in our consolidated liability for pension and postretirement benefits and $106 million of losses from foreign currency translation adjustments. CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS It is expected that the majority of our capital requirements over the next three years will come from internally generated funds. Projected construction and investment expenditures, excluding nuclear fuel purchases, for the next three years are presented in the table below. These amounts are subject to change, based on various factors. 2009 2010 2011 Millions Power: Hudson Environmental $ 305 $ 214 $ 5 Mercer Environmental 101 11 1 Other Environmental 67 32 13 Exploration of New Nuclear Plant 11 14 9 Other, including Growth Opportunities 209 334 341 Total Power $ 693 $ 605 $ 369 PSE&G: Transmission Reliability Enhancements $ 211 $ 391 $ 587 Facility Replacement 81 95 117 Environmental/Regulatory 4 5 1 Support 1 1 1 Distribution Support Facilities 39 59 56 New Business 159 147 154 Reliability Enhancements 78 153 109 Facility Replacement 155 152 155 Environmental/Regulatory 114 108 57 Total PSE&G $ 842 $ 1,111 $ 1,237 Other 72 128 158 Total PSEG $ 1,607 $ 1,844 $ 1,764 Power Powers projected expenditures for the various items listed above are primarily comprised of the following: Hudson Environmental construction of pollution control equipment, including a selective catalytic reduction system, a scrubber, and a baghouse at our Hudson facility. Mercer Environmental construction of pollution control equipment, including scrubbers, at our Mercer facility. Other Environmental construction of other pollution control equipment, including scrubbers at our Keystone facility. 69 Exploration of New Nuclear Plant costs associated with exploring the feasibility of, and the technologies involved with, building a new nuclear plant. Other, including Growth Opportunities costs associated with potential opportunities to build other new plants, such as peaking facilities, and various capital projects at existing facilities to either extend plants useful lives or increase operating output. In 2008, Power made $822 million of capital expenditures (excluding $150 million for nuclear fuel), primarily related to the Salem steam generator replacement, the Hope Creek uprate, upgrades at Hudson and the baghouse installation at Mercer. PSE&G PSE&Gs projections for future capital expenditures include additions and replacements to its transmission and distribution systems to meet expected growth and to manage reliability. As project scope and cost estimates develop, PSE&G will modify its current projections to include these required investments. PSE&Gs projected expenditures for the various items reported above are primarily comprised of the following: Support Facilities ancillary equipment needed to support the business lines, such as computers, office furniture, and buildings and structures housing support personnel or equipment/inventory. New Business investments made in support of new business to PSE&G (e.g. add new customers). Reliability Enhancements investments made to improve the reliability and efficiency of the system or function. Facility Replacement investments made to replace systems or equipment in kind. Environmental/Regulatory investments made in response to regulatory or legal mandates where financial loss is imminent if not pursued. In 2008, PSE&G made $761 million of capital expenditures, primarily for transmission and distribution system reliability. This does not include $44 million spent on cost of removal. Disclosures about Long Term Maturities, Contractual and Commercial Obligations and Certain Investments The following table reflects our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments in the respective periods in which they are due. See Note 11. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities for a discussion of contractual commitments for a variety of services for which annual amounts are not quantifiable. In addition, the table summarizes anticipated recourse and non recourse debt maturities for the years shown. The table does not reflect debt maturities of Energy Holdings non consolidated investments. If those obligations were not able to be refinanced by the project, Energy Holdings may elect to make additional contributions in these investments. For additional information, see Note 12. Schedule of Consolidated Debt. The table below does not reflect any anticipated cash payments for pension obligations due to uncertain timing of payments or liabilities under FIN 48 since we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of FIN 48 liability payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 18.

See Note 11. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities for further discussion. Energy Holdings We have certain investments that are accounted for under the equity method in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Accordingly, amounts recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for such investments represent our equity investment, which is increased for our pro rata share of earnings less any dividend distribution from such investments. The companies in which we invest that are accounted for under the equity method have an aggregate $154 million of debt on their combined, Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our pro rata share of such debt is $81 million. This debt is non recourse to us. We are generally not required to support the debt service obligations of these companies. However, default with respect to this non recourse debt could result in a loss of invested equity. Energy Holdings has investments in leveraged leases that are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases. Leveraged lease investments generally involve three parties: an owner/lessor, a creditor and a lessee. In a typical leveraged lease financing, the lessor purchases an asset to be leased. The purchase price is typically financed 80% with debt provided by the creditor and the balance comes from equity funds provided by the lessor. The creditor provides long term financing to the transaction secured by the property subject to the lease. Such long term financing is non recourse to the lessor and is not presented on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In the event of default, the leased asset, and in some cases the lessee, secure the loan. As a lessor, Energy Holdings has ownership rights to the property and rents the property to the lessees for use in their business operation. For additional information, see Note 6. Long Term Investments. In the event that collectibility of the minimum lease payments to be received by Energy Holdings is no longer reasonably assured, the accounting treatment for some of the leases may change. In such cases, Energy Holdings may deem that a lessee has a high probability of defaulting on the lease obligation, and would reclassify the lease from a leveraged lease to an operating lease and would consider the need to record an impairment of its investment. Should Energy Holdings ever directly assume a debt obligation, the fair value of the underlying asset and the associated debt would be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets instead of the net equity investment in the lease. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Under GAAP, many accounting standards require the use of estimates, variable inputs and assumptions (collectively referred to as estimates) that are subjective in nature. Because of this, differences between the actual measure realized versus the estimate can have a material impact on results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We have determined that the following estimates are considered critical to the application of rules that relate to the respective businesses. Accounting for Pensions We account for pensions under SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS 87). Pension costs under SFAS 87 are calculated using various economic and demographic assumptions. Economic assumptions include the discount rate and the long term rate of return on trust assets. Demographic assumptions include projections of future mortality rates, pay increases and retirement patterns. Assumption 2009 2008 2007 Discount Rate 6.80 % 6.50 % 6.00 % Rate of Return on Plan Assets 8.75 % 8.75 % 8.75 % 72 Our discount rate assumption, which is determined annually, is based on the rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits. The discount rate used to calculate pension obligations is determined as of December 31 each year, our SFAS 87 measurement date. The discount rate used to determine year end obligations is also used to develop the following years net periodic pension cost. Our expected rate of return on plan assets reflects current asset allocations, historical long term investment performance and an estimate of future long term returns by asset class and long term inflation assumptions. Based on the above assumptions, we have estimated net periodic pension expense of approximately $162 million, net of amounts capitalized, and contributions of up to $275 million in 2009. As part of the business planning process, we have modeled future costs assuming an 8.75% rate of return and a 6.80% discount rate for 2010 and beyond. Actual future pension expense and funding levels will depend on future investment performance, changes in discount rates, market conditions, funding levels relative to our projected benefit obligation and accumulated benefit obligation and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans. The following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in certain assumptions. The effects of the assumption changes shown below solely reflect the impact of that specific assumption.

Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, as well as net operating loss and credit carryforwards. We evaluate the need for a valuation allowance against respective deferred tax assets based on the likelihood of expected future taxable income. We do not believe a valuation allowance is necessary; however, if the expected level of future taxable income changes or certain tax planning strategies become unavailable, we would record a valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period the valuation allowance is deemed necessary. Our subsidiaries ability to realize their deferred tax assets are dependent on other subsidiaries ability to generate ordinary income and capital gains. Uncertain Tax Positions We are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities. Beginning January 1, 2007, we began accounting for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two step approach, a more likely than not recognition criterion and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement in accordance with FIN 48. If it is not more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit will be recorded. Uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. Prior to January 1, 2007, we estimated our uncertain income tax obligations in accordance with SFAS 109 and SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (SFAS No. 5). We also have non income tax obligations related to real estate, sales and use and employment related taxes and ongoing appeals related to these tax matters that are outside the scope of FIN 48 and accounted for under SFAS No. 5. 73 Accounting for tax obligations requires judgments, including estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. We also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. We do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets related to capital losses that we believe will be realized in future periods. While we believe the resulting tax reserve balances as of December 31, 2008 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with FIN 48, SFAS No. 5 and SFAS No. 109, as applicable, the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material. Hedge and MTM Accounting SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133) requires an entity to recognize the fair value of derivative instruments held as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. SFAS 133 applies to all derivative instruments that we hold. The fair value of most derivative instruments is determined by reference to quoted market prices, listed contracts, or quotations from brokers. Some of these derivative contracts are long term and rely on forward price quotations over the entire duration of the derivative contracts. In the absence of the pricing sources listed above, for a small number of contracts, we utilize mathematical models that rely on historical data to develop forward pricing information in the determination of fair value. Because the determination of fair value using such models is subject to significant assumptions and estimates, we developed reserve policies that are consistently applied to model generated results to determine reasonable estimates of value to record in the financial statements. We have entered into various derivative instruments to hedge exposure to commodity price risk and interest rate risk. Many such instruments have been designated as cash flow hedges. For a cash flow hedge, the change in the value of a derivative instrument is measured against the offsetting change in the value of the underlying contract, anticipated transaction or other business condition that the derivative instrument is intended to hedge. This is known as the measure of derivative effectiveness. In accordance with SFAS 133, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, net of tax, or as a Regulatory Asset (Liability). Amounts in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss are ultimately recognized in earnings when the related hedged forecasted transaction occurs. During periods of extreme price volatility, there will be significant changes in the value recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. The changes in the fair value of the ineffective portions of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in earnings. For our wholesale energy business, many of the forward sale, forward purchase, option and other contracts are derivative instruments that hedge commodity price risk, but for which the business is not able to meet the hedge accounting requirements in SFAS 133. The changes in value of such derivative contracts are marked to market through earnings as the related commodity prices fluctuate. As a result, our earnings may experience significant fluctuations depending on the volatility of commodity prices. For additional information regarding Derivative Financial Instruments, see Note 14. Financial Risk Management Activities. NDT Funds We account for the assets in the NDT Funds under SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities (SFAS 115). The assets in the NDT Funds are classified as available for sale securities and are marked to market with unrealized gains and losses recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss unless securities with such unrealized losses are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired. Realized gains, losses and dividend and interest income are recorded in our Statements of Operations as Other Income and Other Deductions. Unrealized losses that are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired, as defined under SFAS 115, and related interpretive guidance, are charged against earnings rather than Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. 74 Unbilled Revenues Electric and gas revenues are recorded based on services rendered to customers during each accounting period. We record unbilled revenues for the estimated amount customers will be billed for services rendered from the time meters were last read to the end of the respective accounting period. Unbilled usage is calculated in two steps. The initial step is to apply a base usage per day to the number of unbilled days in the period. The second step estimates seasonal loads based upon the time of year and the variance of actual degree days and temperature humidity index hours of the unbilled period from expected norms. The resulting usage is priced at current rate levels and recorded as revenue. A calculation of the associated energy cost for the unbilled usage is recorded as well. Each month, the prior months unbilled amounts are reversed and the current months amounts are accrued. The resulting revenue and expense reflect the service rendered in the calendar month. Using benchmarks other than those used in this calculation could have a material effect on the amounts accrued in a reporting period. SFAS 71 PSE&G prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 71, which differs in certain respects from the application of GAAP by non regulated businesses. In general, SFAS 71 recognizes that accounting for rate regulated enterprises should reflect the economic effects of regulation. As a result, a regulated utility is required to defer the recognition of costs (a Regulatory Asset) or recognize obligations (a Regulatory Liability) if it is probable that, through the rate making process, there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in future rates. Accordingly, PSE&G has deferred certain costs, which will be amortized over various future periods. To the extent that collection of such costs or payment of liabilities is no longer probable as a result of changes in regulation and or PSE&Gs competitive position, the associated Regulatory Asset or Liability is charged or credited to income. See Note 5. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities for additional information related to these and other regulatory issues. ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The market risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity prices, equity security prices and interest rates as discussed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. It is our policy to use derivatives to manage risk consistent with business plans and prudent practices. We have a Risk Management Committee comprised of our executive officers who utilize a risk oversight function to ensure compliance with our corporate policies and risk management practices. Additionally, we are exposed to counterparty credit losses in the event of non performance or non payment. We have a credit management process, which is used to assess, monitor and mitigate counterparty exposure. In the event of non performance or non payment by a major counterparty, there may be a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or net cash flows. Commodity Contracts The availability and price of energy related commodities are subject to fluctuations from factors such as weather, environmental policies, changes in supply and demand, state and federal regulatory policies, market rules and other events. To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, we enter into supply contracts and derivative contracts, including forwards, futures, swaps and options with approved counterparties. These contracts, in conjunction with demand obligations, help reduce risk and optimize the value of owned electric generation capacity. Value at Risk (VaR) Models We use VaR models to assess the market risk of our commodity businesses. The portfolio VaR model includes our owned generation and physical contracts, as well as fixed price sales requirements, load requirements and financial derivative instruments. VaR represents the potential gains or losses, under normal 75 market conditions, for instruments or portfolios due to changes in market factors, for a specified time period and confidence level. We estimate VaR across our commodity businesses. We manage our exposure at the portfolio level, which consists of owned generation, load serving contracts (both gas and electric), fuel supply contracts and energy derivatives designed to manage the risk around generation and load. While we manage our risk at the portfolio level, we also monitor separately the risk of our trading activities and hedges. Non trading mark to market (MTM) VaR consists of MTM derivatives that are economic hedges, some of which qualify for hedge accounting. The MTM derivatives that are not hedges are included in the trading VaR. The VaR models used are variance/covariance models adjusted for the delta of positions with a 95% one tailed confidence level and a one day holding period for the MTM trading and non trading activities and a 95% one tailed confidence level with a one week holding period for the portfolio VaR. The models assume no new positions throughout the holding periods, however, we actively manage our portfolio. Increased trading activities during 2008 have led to a higher VaR as compared to December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2008, VaR was $1 million. As of December 31, 2007, trading VaR was less than $1 million. For the Year Ended December 31, 2008 TradingVaR Non TradingMTM VaR Millions 95% Confidence Level, One Day Holding Period, One Tailed: Period End $ 1 $ 44 Average for the Period $ 1 $ 56 High $ 1 $ 71 Low $ * $ 43 99% Confidence Level, One Day Holding Period, Two Tailed: Period End $ 1 $ 69 Average for the Period $ 1 $ 88 High $ 2 $ 111 Low $ * $ 67 * less than $1 million Interest Rates We are subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. It is our policy to manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floating rate debt, interest rate swaps and interest rate lock agreements. We manage our respective interest rate exposures by maintaining a targeted ratio of fixed and floating rate debt. As of December 31, 2008, a hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would result in $2 million of additional annual interest costs related to both the current and long term portion of long term debt, and a $253 million decrease in the fair value of debt, including a $132 million decrease at PSE&G and a $92 million decrease at Power. Debt and Equity Securities We have $2.4 billion invested in our pension plans. Although fluctuations in market prices of securities within this portfolio do not directly affect our earnings in the current period, changes in the value of these investments could affect our future contributions to these plans, 76 our financial position if our accumulated benefit obligation under our pension plans exceeds the fair value of the pension funds, and future earnings, as we could be required to adjust pension expense and the assumed rate of return. The NDT Funds are comprised of both fixed income and equity securities totaling $970 million as of December 31, 2008. The fair value of equity securities is determined independently each month by the Trustee. As of December 31, 2008, the portfolio was comprised of $413 million of equity securities and $557 million in fixed income securities. The fair market value of the assets in the NDT Funds will fluctuate primarily depending upon the performance of equity markets. As of December 31, 2008, a hypothetical 10% change in the equity market would impact the value of the equity securities in the NDT Funds by approximately $41 million. We use duration to measure the interest rate sensitivity of the fixed income portfolio. Duration is a summary statistic of the effective average maturity of the fixed income portfolio. The benchmark for the fixed income component of the NDT Funds currently has a duration of 3.71 years and a yield of 3.99%. The portfolios value will appreciate or depreciate by the duration with a 1% change in interest rates. As of December 31, 2008, a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates would result in a decline in the market value for the fixed income portfolio of approximately $18 million. Credit Risk Credit risk relates to the risk of loss that we would incur as a result of non performance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. We have established credit policies that we believe significantly minimize credit risk. These policies include an evaluation of potential counterparties financial condition (including credit rating), collateral requirements under certain circumstances and the use of standardized agreements, which may allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty. Counterparties expose Powers operations to credit losses in the event of non performance or non payment. We have a credit management process, which is used to assess, monitor and mitigate counterparty exposure for Power and its subsidiaries. Powers counterparty credit limits are based on a scoring model that considers a variety of factors, including leverage, liquidity, profitability, credit ratings and risk management capabilities. Power has entered into master agreements that allow for payment netting with the majority of its large counterparties, which reduce Powers exposure to counterparty risk by providing the offset of amounts payable to the counterparty against amounts receivable from the counterparty. In the event of non performance or non payment by a major counterparty, there may be a material adverse impact on Powers financial condition, results of operations or net cash flows. As of December 31, 2008, 81% of the credit exposure (MTM plus net receivables and payables, less cash collateral) for Powers operations was with investment grade counterparties. The majority of the credit exposure with non investment grade counterparties was with certain companies that supply fuel (primarily coal) to Power. This exposure relates to the risk of a counterparty performing under its obligations rather than payment risk. The following table provides information on Powers credit exposure, net of collateral, as of December 31, 2008. Credit exposure is defined as any positive results of netting accounts receivable/accounts payable and the forward value on open positions. It further delineates that exposure by the credit rating of the counterparties and provides guidance on the concentration of credit risk to individual counterparties and an indication of the maturity of a companys credit risk by credit rating of the counterparties. 77 Schedule of Credit Risk Exposure on Energy Contracts NetAssets As of December 31, 2008 Rating CurrentExposure SecuritiesHeldas Collateral NetExposure Number ofCounterparties&gt;10% Net ExposureCounterparties&gt;10% Millions Millions Investment Grade External Rating $ 1,028 $ 280 $ 996 1 (A) $ 545 Non Investment Grade External Rating 235 235 1 (B) 231 Investment Grade No External Rating 14 15 Non Investment Grade No External Rating 12 1 11 Total $ 1,289 $ 281 $ 1,257 2 $ 776 (A) PSE&G is a counterparty with net exposure of $545 million. (B) Credit exposure is with a non investment grade counterparty that is a coal supplier to Power. Therefore, this exposure relates to the risk of the counterpartys non performance under its obligations rather than payment risk. The net exposure listed above, in some cases, will not be the difference between the current exposure and the collateral held. Counterparty may have posted more cash collateral than the outstanding exposure, in which case there would not be exposure. When letters of credit have been posted as collateral, the exposure amount is not reduced, but the exposure amount is transferred to the rating of the issuing bank. As of December 31, 2008, Power had 140 active counterparties. BGS suppliers expose PSE&G to credit losses in the event of non performance or non payment upon a default of the BGS supplier. Credit requirements are governed under BPU approved BGS contracts. Energy Holdings has credit risk with respect to its counterparties to power purchase agreements and other parties. Energy Holdings also has credit risk related to its investments in leveraged leases, totaling $285 million, which is net of deferred taxes of $2 billion, as of December 31, 2008. These investments are largely concentrated in the energy industry. As of December 31, 2008, 58% of counterparties in the lease portfolio was rated investment grade by both S&P and Moodys. As of December 31, 2008, the weighted average credit rating of the lessees in Holdings leasing portfolio was A/A3 by S&P and Moodys respectively. The credit exposure to the lessees is partially mitigated through various credit enhancement mechanisms within the lease transactions. These credit enhancement features vary from lease to lease. Some of the leasing transactions include covenants that restrict the flow of dividends from the lessee to its parent, over collateralization of the lessee with non leased assets, historical and forward cash flow coverage tests that prohibit discretionary capital expenditures and dividend payments to the parent/lessee if stated minimum coverages are not met and similar cash flow restrictions if ratings are not maintained at stated levels. These covenants are designed to maintain cash reserves in the transaction entity for the benefit of the non recourse lenders and the lessor/equity participants in the event of a market downturn or degradation in operating performance of the leased assets. In any lease transaction, in the event of a default, Energy Holdings would exercise its rights and attempt to seek recovery of its investment. The results of such efforts may not be known for a period of time. A bankruptcy of a lessee and failure to recover adequate value could lead to a foreclosure of the lease. Under a worst case scenario, if a foreclosure were to occur, Energy Holdings would record a pre tax write off up to its gross investment, including deferred taxes, in these facilities. Also, in the event of a potential 78 foreclosure, the net tax benefits generated by Energy Holdings portfolio of investments could be materially reduced in the period in which gains associated with the potential forgiveness of debt at these projects occurs. The amount and timing of any potential reduction in net tax benefits is dependent upon a number of factors including, but not limited to, the time of a potential foreclosure, the amount of lease debt outstanding, any cash trapped at the projects and negotiations during such potential foreclosure process. The potential loss of earnings, impairment and or tax payments could have a material impact to our financial position, results of operations and net cash flows.
