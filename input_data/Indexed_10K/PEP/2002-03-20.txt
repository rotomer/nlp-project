Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition On August 2, 2001, we completed a merger transaction, which resulted in The Quaker Oats Company (Quaker) becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of PepsiCo. As a result, we restated all prior periods presented to reflect the combined results of operations, financial position and cash flows of both companies as if they had always been merged. For further detail see "Merger of PepsiCo and The Quaker Oats Company". Tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Percentage changes are based on unrounded amounts. Managements Discussion and Analysis is presented in four sections. The first section discusses critical accounting policies, transactions with related and other parties, items affecting comparability, new accounting standards and market and other risk factors. The second section analyzes the results of operations, first on a consolidated basis and then for each of our business segments. The final two sections address consolidated cash flows and liquidity and capital resources. Cautionary Statements From time to time, in written reports and in oral statements, we discuss expectations regarding our future performance including synergies from the merger, the impact of the euro conversion and the impact of global macroeconomic issues. These "forward looking statements" are based on currently available competitive, financial and economic data and our operating plans. They are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could turn out to be significantly different from our expectations. INTRODUCTION TO OUR BUSINESS Critical Accounting Policies An understanding of our accounting policies is necessary for a complete analysis of our results, financial position, liquidity and trends. We focus your attention on the following: Principles of consolidation The financial statements include the consolidated accounts of PepsiCo, Inc. and its controlled affiliates. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates over which we exercise significant influence, but not control, are accounted for by the equity method. Our definition of control for majority owned affiliates considers the exercisability of the minority interest rights, and consolidation would be precluded to the extent that the minority interest holds substantive participating rights. Our share of the net income or loss of unconsolidated affiliates accounted for by the equity method is included in our consolidated net income. As a result of changes in the operations of our European snack joint venture, we have determined that, effective in 2002, consolidation is required. Revenue recognition We recognize revenue when products are delivered to customers consistent with sales terms. Sales terms generally do not allow a right of return. 10 Derivative instruments and hedging We manage risks associated with commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, interest rates and our stock price and may use derivative instruments to hedge these risks. As a matter of policy, we do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The evaluation of hedge effectiveness is subject to assumptions based on the terms and timing of the underlying exposures. All derivative instruments are recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. The fair value of our derivative instruments is generally based on quoted market prices. Asset impairment All long lived assets, including goodwill, investments in unconsolidated affiliates and other identifiable intangibles, are evaluated for impairment on the basis of undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair market value based on the best information available. Estimated fair market value is generally measured by discounting estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows. Assumptions used in these cash flows are consistent with internal forecasts. Income taxes Our effective tax rate and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities reflect our best estimate of the ultimate outcome of tax audits. Valuation allowances are established where expected future taxable income does not support the realization of the deferred tax assets. Commitments and contingencies We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes and environmental matters, as well as commitments under contractual and other commercial obligations. We recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments when a loss is probable and estimable. Our contractual and other commercial obligations primarily relate to the procurement of goods and services in the normal course of business and to guarantees related to our equity investees. Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements for additional information on our accounting policies. Transactions with Related and Other Parties Significant related parties include our bottling franchisees in which we own an equity interest. We have entered into agreements with these bottlers and expect these arrangements to continue. These agreements cover the prices and terms for the sale of concentrate and full goods bearing our trademarks, as well as the manufacturing and distribution of our fountain products. In addition, we provide various forms of marketing support to or on behalf of our bottlers covering a variety of initiatives including marketplace support, marketing programs, capital equipment and shared media expense. The level of this support is negotiated annually and can be increased or decreased at our discretion. We provide this support because we share a common business objective with our bottlers of increasing the availability and consumption of Pepsi Cola beverages and the level of support has a direct impact on these objectives. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for related party commitments and guarantees and Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on related parties. 11 Certain members of our Board of Directors also serve on the boards of certain vendors and customers. Our transactions with these vendors and customers are in the normal course of business and consistent with terms negotiated with other vendors and customers. Those Board members do not participate in vendor selection and negotiations nor in customer negotiations. In addition, certain officers serve on the boards of our anchor bottlers and other equity investees and may receive compensation from such entities consistent with that of other members serving on those boards. Items Affecting Comparability Fifty third Week in 2000 Comparisons of 2000 to 2001 and 1999 are affected by an additional week of results in the 2000 reporting year. Because our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in December, a fifty third week is added every five or six years. The fifty third week increased 2000 net sales by an estimated $294 million, operating profit by an estimated $62 million and net income by an estimated $44 million or $0.02 per share. Merger of PepsiCo and The Quaker Oats Company Under the Quaker merger agreement dated December 2, 2000, Quaker shareholders received 2.3 shares of PepsiCo common stock in exchange for each share of Quaker common stock, including a cash payment for fractional shares. We issued approximately 306 million shares of our common stock in exchange for all the outstanding common stock of Quaker. In connection with the merger transaction, we sold the global rights in our All Sport beverage brand to The Monarch Company, Inc. of Atlanta. As part of the terms of the sale, we agreed that, for 10 years after the Quaker transaction closing date, we would not distribute Gatorade sports drink through our bottling system in the United States and would not include Gatorade with Pepsi Cola products in certain marketing or promotional arrangements covering specific distribution channels. The merger was accounted for as a tax free transaction and as a pooling of interests. As a result, all prior period consolidated financial statements presented have been restated to include the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of both companies as if they had always been combined. Certain reclassifications were made to conform the presentation of the financial statements, and the fiscal calendar and certain interim reporting policies were also conformed. There were no material transactions between pre merger PepsiCo and Quaker. 12 The results of operations of the separate companies and the combined company for the most recent interim period prior to the merger and for the years presented in the consolidated financial statements are as follows: 24 Weeks Ended 6/16/01 2000 1999 Reported Net Sales: PepsiCo.................................. $ 9,820 $20,438 $20,367 Quaker................................... 2,741 5,041 4,726 Adjustments (a).......................... (518) Combined................................... $12,043 $25,479 $25,093 Reported Net Income: PepsiCo.................................. $ 1,150 $ 2,183 $ 2,050 Quaker................................... 279 360 455 Adjustments (a).......................... (61) Combined................................... $ 1,368 $ 2,543 $ 2,505 (a) Adjustments reflect the impact of changing Quakers fiscal calendar to conform to PepsiCos and conforming the accounting policies of the two companies applicable to interim reporting. These changes have no impact on full year net sales or net income. During 2001, we recognized costs of $356 million associated with our merger with Quaker. The components of these merger related costs were as follows: Transaction costs.......................... $ 117 Integration and restructuring costs........ 239 Total merger related costs.............. $ 356 After tax............................ $ 322 Per share............................ $0.18 Transaction costs were incurred to complete the merger and consist primarily of fees and expenses for investment bankers, attorneys and accountants, SEC filing fees, stock exchange listing fees and financial printing and other related charges. Integration costs represent incremental one time merger related costs. Such costs include consulting fees and expenses, expenses for accelerated vesting under change in control provisions, information system integration costs and employee related costs. The restructuring charges primarily reflect termination costs for approximately 580 corporate, sales, distribution, manufacturing, research and marketing employees. Employee termination costs include retirement benefit costs, severance costs and expenses associated with change in control provisions of pre merger employment contracts. As of December 29, 2001, approximately 380 of the terminations have occurred. The terminations are expected to be completed during 2002. 13 Additional merger related actions are expected to bring the total integration costs and restructuring charges to between $450 million and $550 million. Ongoing merger related cost savings and revenue enhancement opportunities are expected to reach $400 million a year by 2005. We expect to achieve up to $175 million of the synergies by the end of 2002. Other Impairment and Restructuring Charges 2001 2000 1999 Asset impairment charges Held and used in the business Property, plant and equipment............ $ 19 $ 125 $ 8 Held for disposal/abandonment Property, plant and equipment........... 34 Total asset impairment............... 19 125 42 Restructuring charges Employee related costs..................... 41 20 Other charges.............................. 12 18 11 Total restructuring.................. 12 59 31 Total...................................... $ 31 $ 184 $ 73 After tax............................. $ 19 $ 111 $ 45 Per share............................ $0.01 $0.06 $0.02 2001 and 2000 The 2001 and 2000 other impairment and restructuring charges relate to a three year supply chain reconfiguration project announced in 1999 to upgrade and optimize Quakers manufacturing and distribution capabilities across all of its North American businesses. The asset impairment charges primarily reflect the reduction in the carrying value of the land, buildings and production machinery and equipment to their estimated fair market value based on analyses of the liquidation values of similar assets. The restructuring charges primarily included severance and termination benefits for approximately 1,000 employees and other shutdown costs. No future charges are expected on this project. 1999 The 1999 other impairment and restructuring charges of $73 million were comprised of the following: A charge of $65 million, for asset impairment of $37 million and restructuring charges of $28 million, related to the closure of three plants and impairment of equipment at Frito Lay North America. The asset impairment charges primarily reflected the reduction in the carrying value of the land and buildings to their estimated fair market value based on selling prices for comparable real estate, less costs to sell, and the write off of the net book value of equipment which could not be redeployed. The plant closures were completed during 1999. The majority of these assets were either disposed of or abandoned in 1999. The restructuring charges of $28 million primarily included severance costs and plant closing costs. 14 A charge of $8 million, for asset impairment of $5 million and restructuring charges of $3 million, related to the previously discussed Quaker supply chain reconfiguration project. The charge included costs to consolidate several cereal manufacturing lines and employee related costs. The employee related costs for 1999 of $20 million primarily included severance and early retirement benefits for approximately 930 employees. Substantially all of the terminations occurred during 1999. Total restructuring reserves of $100 million, including merger related reserves, at December 29, 2001, are included in accounts payable and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Bottling Transactions During 1999, we completed a series of transactions creating our anchor bottlers. In April 1999, certain wholly owned bottling businesses, referred to as The Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG), completed an initial public offering with PepsiCo retaining a direct noncontrolling ownership interest of 35.5%. In May, we combined certain other bottling operations with Whitman Corporation retaining a noncontrolling ownership interest of approximately 38%. In July, we combined certain other bottling operations with PepCom Industries, Inc. retaining a noncontrolling interest of 35% in the combined entity renamed Pepsi Bottling Ventures, LLC. In October, we formed a business venture with Pohlad Companies, a Pepsi Cola franchisee, retaining a noncontrolling ownership interest of approximately 24% in the ventures principal operating subsidiary, PepsiAmericas, Inc. Our financial statements include the results of our bottling operations on a consolidated basis through the transaction dates above, and our proportionate share of income under the equity method subsequent to those dates. In December 2000, Whitman merged with PepsiAmericas. We now own approximately 37% of the combined company, which has since changed its name to PepsiAmericas, Inc. As part of the merger, we participate in an earn out option whereby we may receive additional shares when certain performance targets are met. Our three anchor bottlers distribute approximately three fourths of our beverage products in North America. Tax Item In 1999, Quaker adjusted its tax accruals and tax assets to reflect developments and information received during the year. The net effect of these adjustments reduced the income tax provision by $59 million or $0.03 per share. 15 New Accounting Standards On December 31, 2000, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. (SFAS) 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities. It requires that we recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. The adoption of SFAS 133 on December 31, 2000 increased assets by approximately $12 million and liabilities by approximately $10 million with approximately $3 million recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income and a loss of less than $1 million recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. During 2000 and 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) addressed various issues related to the income statement classification of certain promotional payments, including consideration from a vendor to a reseller or another party that purchases the vendors products. EITF 01 9, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of the Vendors Products was issued in November 2001 and codified earlier pronouncements. Primarily effective for 2002, adoption of EITF 01 9 will reduce our net sales by $3.4 billion in 2001, $3.1 billion in 2000 and $2.9 billion in 1999, with selling, general and administrative expenses reduced by the same amounts. In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 141, Business Combinations. SFAS 141 eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations and modifies the application of the purchase accounting method. The elimination of the pooling of interests method is effective for transactions initiated after June 30, 2001. The remaining provisions of SFAS 141 are effective for transactions accounted for using the purchase method that are completed after June 30, 2001. Since our merger with Quaker (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements) was initiated in December 2000 and our acquisition of South Beach Beverage Company, LLC (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements) was completed in January 2001, adoption of this statement does not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. In July 2001, the FASB also issued SFAS 142, Goodwill and Intangibles. SFAS 142 eliminates the current requirement to amortize goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, addresses the amortization of intangible assets with finite lives and addresses impairment testing and recognition for goodwill and intangible assets. SFAS 142 applies to existing goodwill and intangible assets, as well as to transactions completed after the statements effective date. SFAS 142 is effective for 2002. Adoption of SFAS 142 will increase income before taxes by approximately $87 million in 2002 reflecting the cessation of goodwill amortization and changes in the lives of other intangibles. The required transition impairment evaluations are not expected to result in impairment charges. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. SFAS 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. It requires that we recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. We are currently assessing SFAS 143 and the impact that adoption, in 2003, will have on our consolidated financial statements. 16 In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. SFAS 144 establishes a single model for the impairment of long lived assets and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. SFAS 144 is effective for 2002. Adoption will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Market and Other Risk Factors Market Risks The principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are: commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and fuel; foreign exchange risks; interest rates on our debt and short term investment portfolios; and our stock price. In the normal course of business, we manage these risks through a variety of strategies, including the use of hedging transactions, executed in accordance with our policies. Our hedging transactions include, but are not limited to, the use of various derivative instruments. As a matter of policy, we do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Any change in the value of our derivative instruments would be substantially offset by an opposite change in the value of the underlying hedged items. Commodity Prices We are subject to market risk with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. We manage this risk primarily through the use of fixed price purchase orders, pricing agreements, geographic diversity and derivative instruments. Derivative instruments, including futures, options and swaps, are used to hedge fluctuations in prices of a portion of anticipated commodity purchases, primarily corn, oats, natural gas, heating oil, vegetable oil and packaging materials. Our use of derivative instruments is not significant to our commodity purchases. Our commodity derivative positions were $252 million at December 29, 2001 and $52 million at December 30, 2000. Our commodity derivative positions resulted in a net unrealized loss of $16 million at December 29, 2001 and a net unrealized gain of $3 million at December 30, 2000. We estimate that a 10% decline in commodity prices would have increased the loss by $18 million in 2001 and reduced the gain by $6 million resulting in a loss in 2000. 17 Foreign Exchange International operations constitute about one fifth of our annual business segment operating profit. Operating in international markets involves exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates, primarily the Mexican peso, British pound, Canadian dollar, euro and Brazilian real, which principally impacts the translation of our international operating profit into U.S. dollars. On occasion, we may enter into derivative instruments, as necessary, to reduce the effect of foreign exchange rate changes. We manage the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally. Our foreign currency derivative positions had an aggregate notional value of $355 million, with $223 million relating to contracts to exchange British pounds for U.S. dollars, at December 29, 2001 and $344 million, with $336 million relating to contracts to exchange British pounds to U.S. dollars, at December 30, 2000. These forward contracts had a net gain of $4 million at December 29, 2001 and losses of $9 million at December 30, 2000. We estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the exchange rates would have decreased the 2001 gain by $35 million resulting in a loss and increased the 2000 losses by $35 million. Interest Rates We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks, tax consequences and overall financing strategies. We use interest rate and currency swaps to effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances, with the objective of reducing our overall borrowing costs. These swaps are entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt. Our credit risk related to interest rate and currency swaps is considered low because such swaps are entered into only with strong creditworthy counterparties, are generally settled on a net basis and are of relatively short duration. Assuming year end 2001 and 2000 variable rate debt and investment levels, a one point increase in interest rates would have increased net interest expense by $3 million in 2001 and $7 million in 2000. The change in this impact from 2000 resulted from decreased variable debt levels and increased investment levels at year end 2001. This sensitivity analysis includes the impact of existing interest rate and currency swaps. Stock Price The portion of our deferred compensation liability which is based on our stock price is subject to market risk. Prepaid forward contracts with financial institutions with an aggregate notional amount of $52 million at year end 2001 were used to hedge this risk and are accounted for as natural hedges. The change in fair value of these equity derivative contracts resulted in $1 million of expense in 2001, $19 million of income in 2000 and $6 million of expense in 1999. We estimate that a 10% unfavorable change in the year end stock price would have increased the 2001 loss by $6 million and reduced the 2000 gain by $7 million. 18 Euro Conversion Our operating subsidiaries affected by the euro conversion successfully addressed the issues raised by the euro currency conversion including, among others, adapting computer and financial systems, business processes and equipment, such as vending machines, to accommodate euro denominated transactions and took actions to reduce the impact of one common currency on cross border pricing. We have experienced no business interruption as a result of the issuance and circulation of euro denominated bills and coins and the withdrawal of legacy currencies. The system and equipment conversion costs were not material. Due to numerous uncertainties, we cannot reasonably estimate the long term effects one common currency may have on pricing and the resulting impact, if any, on financial condition or results of operations. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS General In the discussions below, the year over year dollar change in unit sales is referred to as volume. Price changes over the prior year and the impact of product, package and country sales mix changes are referred to as effective net pricing. Comparable results in all periods presented below exclude: the costs associated with our merger with Quaker, the impact of the fifty third week in 2000, other impairment and restructuring charges and various Quaker one time items and the gain on the bottling transactions in 1999, and also reflect the impact of certain reclassifications and tax items. In addition, comparable net sales and operating profit present the deconsolidation of our bottling operations as if it had occurred at the beginning of 1998. Consolidated Review Net Sales % Change B/(W) 2001 2000 1999 2001 2000 Reported $26,935 $25,479 $25,093 6 2 Comparable $26,935 $25,185 $23,385 7 8 In 2001, comparable net sales increased 7%. This increase is primarily due to volume gains and higher effective net pricing of worldwide snacks and worldwide beverages, as well as the acquisition of South Beach Beverage Company, LLC (SoBe). These gains were partially offset by a net unfavorable foreign currency impact. The SoBe acquisition enhanced comparable net sales growth by nearly 1 percentage point and the unfavorable foreign currency impact, primarily in Brazil and Europe, reduced comparable net sales growth by more than 1 percentage point. 19 In 2000, comparable net sales increased 8%. This increase is primarily due to volume gains and higher effective net pricing of worldwide snacks, Pepsi Cola North America and PepsiCo Beverages International. These increases were partially offset by a net unfavorable foreign currency impact, primarily in Europe, which reduced comparable net sales growth by 1 percentage point. The fifty third week enhanced reported net sales growth by 1 percentage point. Volume Servings are based on U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines for single serving sizes of our products. Total servings increased 4% in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to contributions from our international divisions and Pepsi Cola North America. Total servings increased 5% in 2000 compared to 1999 driven by our international divisions, as well as contributions from Frito Lay North America and Gatorade/Tropicana North America. Operating Profit and Margin Change B/(W) 2001 2000 1999 2001 2000 Reported Operating profit $4,021 $3,818 $3,483 5% 10% Operating profit margin 14.9% 15.0% 13.9% (0.1) 1.1 Comparable Operating profit $4,406 $3,957 $3,487 11% 13% Operating profit margin 16.4% 15.7% 14.9% 0.7 0.8 In 2001, comparable operating profit margin increased 0.7 percentage points primarily reflecting the favorable margin impact of higher effective net pricing and increased volume. These improvements were partially offset by the margin impact of increased advertising and marketing and general and administrative expenses. In 2000, comparable operating profit margin increased 0.8 percentage points primarily reflecting the favorable margin impact of higher effective net pricing and increased volume. These improvements were partially offset by the margin impact of increases in selling and distribution expenses, primarily in Frito Lay International, advertising and marketing and general and administrative expenses. Bottling Equity Income and Transaction Gains and Losses Bottling equity income and transaction gains and losses includes our share of the net earnings or losses from our bottling equity investments. From time to time, we may increase or dispose of particular bottling investments. Any gains or losses from disposals, as well as other transactions related to our bottling investments, are also reflected on a pre tax basis in equity income and transaction gains and losses. 20 In 2001, comparable net bottling equity income and transaction gains and losses increased 28% to $160 million, primarily reflecting the strong performance of PBG. Results for 2001 also include a gain of $59 million from the sale of approximately 2 million shares of PBG stock and a net credit of $23 million related to the resolution of issues for which a prior year accrual was established in connection with the creation of our anchor bottler system. These increases were offset by impairment charges of $62 million related to certain international bottling investments, primarily our equity investment in Turkey, reflecting a major currency devaluation and adverse macroeconomic conditions. Additionally, $27 million for our share of a charge recorded by PepsiAmericas for environmental liabilities relating to discontinued operations is included in our share of the net earnings from our bottling equity investments in 2001. In 2000, comparable net bottling equity income and transaction gains and losses increased 51% to $125 million. Our share of net earnings from our bottling equity investments includes $18 million from the favorable impact of an accounting change by PBG. In addition, results for 2000 include our share of charges related to restructuring actions in certain other bottling affiliates and the net loss from changes in our equity ownership interests. The fifty third week in 2000 enhanced reported net bottling equity income and transaction gains and losses by $5 million. In 1999, reported bottling equity income and transaction gains and losses includes a gain on bottling transactions of $1.0 billion ($270 million after tax or $0.15 per share) relating to the second quarter PBG and Whitman bottling transactions. The PBG transaction resulted in a pre tax gain of $1.0 billion ($476 million after tax or $0.26 per share). The majority of the taxes are expected to be deferred indefinitely. The Whitman transaction resulted in an after tax loss to us of $206 million or $0.11 per share. The 1999 PepCom transaction was accounted for as a nonmonetary exchange for book purposes. However, a portion of the transaction was taxable which resulted in income tax expense of $25 million or $0.01 per share. The 1999 Pohlad transaction was structured as a fair value exchange with no resulting gain or loss. Further, 1999 bottling equity income and transaction gains and losses reflects $83 million for the equity income of our previously consolidated bottling operations from the applicable transaction closing dates and the equity income or loss of other unconsolidated bottling affiliates for the second, third and fourth quarters. 21 Interest Expense, net % Change B/(W) 2001 2000 1999 2001 2000 Reported Interest expense $(219) $(272) $(421) 20 35 Interest income 67 85 130 (22) (34) Interest expense, net $(152) $(187) $(291) 19 36 Comparable Interest expense $(219) $(268) $(421) 19 36 Interest income 67 66 136 (51) Interest expense, net $(152) $(202) $(285) 25 29 Reported and comparable interest income in 2001 includes a loss on investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability. Reported interest income in 2000 and 1999 includes gains or losses from the equity derivative contracts used to hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability. These equity derivative gains or losses are now classified in selling, general and administrative expenses in connection with the 2001 adoption of the accounting standard on derivative instruments. Comparable interest income for 2000 and 1999 reflects this reclassification. The fifty third week increased reported net interest expense in 2000 by $3 million. In 2001, comparable net interest expense declined 25%. Interest expense declined primarily as a result of significantly lower average debt levels. Interest income remained nearly flat as the increase from higher average investment balances was offset by lower average interest rates and a loss on the investments hedging a portion of our deferred compensation liability. In 2000, comparable net interest expense declined 29%. Interest expense declined reflecting significantly lower average debt levels, partially offset by higher average interest rates. Lower average debt levels reflect the third quarter 1999 repayment of borrowings used to finance the Tropicana acquisition and the absence of the financing related to PBG. Interest income declined primarily due to lower average investment balances. Provision for Income Taxes 2001 2000 1999 Reported Provision for income taxes $1,367 $1,218 $1,770 Effective tax rate 33.9% 32.4% 41.4% Comparable Provision for income taxes $1,412 $1,270 $1,099 Effective tax rate 32.0% 32.7% 32.9% 22 In 2001, the comparable effective tax rate decreased 0.7 percentage points primarily due to lower taxes on foreign results. The reported effective tax rate increased 1.5 percentage points primarily due to limited tax benefits associated with merger related costs recognized during the year. In 2000, the comparable effective tax rate remained nearly flat. The reported effective tax rate decreased 9 percentage points primarily as a result of the 1999 bottling transactions. Net Income and Net Income Per Common Share Assuming Dilution % Change B/(W) 2001 2000 1999 2001 2000 Reported Net income $2,662 $2,543 $2,505 5 2 Net income per common share $1.47 $1.42 $1.38 4 3 Comparable Net income $3,002 $2,610 $2,239 15 17 Net income per common share $1.66 $1.46 $1.23 14 18 In 2001, comparable net income increased 15% and the related net income per common share increased 14%. These increases primarily reflect increased operating profit, lower net interest expense and a lower effective tax rate. In 2000, comparable net income increased 17% and the related net income per common share increased 18% reflecting higher operating profit and lower net interest expense. The increase in net income per common share also reflects the benefit from a 1.4% reduction in average shares outstanding.

This growth was led by single digit growth in Lays potato chips, Cheetos cheese flavored snacks, Doritos tortilla chips, Fritos corn chips and the introduction of our new Lays Bistro Gourmet potato chips. These gains were partially offset by a double digit decline in Ruffles potato chips. Pound volume growth including the fifty third week in 2000 was 1%. Comparable net sales grew 6% due to higher effective net pricing and the increased volume. Lays Bistro Gourmet potato chips contributed nearly 1 percentage point to this growth. Comparable operating profit increased 10% primarily reflecting the higher effective net pricing and increased volume, partially offset by increased advertising and marketing expenses. Advertising and marketing expenses grew at a faster rate than sales primarily due to increased promotional allowances. 2000 vs. 1999 Pound volume advanced 5% excluding the impact of the fifty third week. This growth was primarily driven by most of our core brands, excluding the low fat and no fat versions, and by our new Snack Kit products. The growth in core brands was led by solid single digit growth in Lays potato chips, Cheetos cheese flavored snacks and Ruffles potato chips, as well as double digit growth in Tostitos tortilla chips. These gains were partially offset by continued declines in WOW! products. Pound volume growth including the fifty third week was 7%. Comparable net sales increased 7% primarily due to the volume gains and higher effective net pricing. Sales of our new Snack Kit and Snack Mix products and Oberto natural beef jerky snacks accounted for almost 30% of this growth. The fifty third week enhanced reported net sales growth by 2 percentage points. 24 Comparable operating profit increased 12% primarily reflecting the higher volume, the higher effective net pricing and reduced vegetable oil costs, partially offset by higher energy and fuel costs. Advertising and marketing expenses grew at a slightly slower rate than sales. The margin impact of these favorable factors contributed to the comparable operating profit margin improvement of 0.9 percentage points.

This growth was primarily driven by a 9% increase in salty snack kilos and a 5% increase in sweet snack kilos. The salty snack growth was led by double digit growth at our European joint venture, in Brazil and in Poland and single digit growth at Walkers. Acquisitions contributed 2 percentage points of salty growth. The sweet snack increase was primarily attributable to growth at Gamesa. Kilo volume growth including the fifty third week in 2000 was 5%. Comparable net sales increased 7%, primarily driven by the volume growth in Walkers, Gamesa and Poland and effective net pricing at Sabritas and Gamesa. Acquisitions contributed 1 percentage point to sales growth. Weaker foreign currencies in Brazil and the United Kingdom decreased net sales by 4 percentage points. Operating profit increased 17%, led by solid results from Sabritas, Walkers, Poland and Gamesa, partially offset by a decrease in Argentina as a result of macroeconomic conditions. The weaker foreign currencies, primarily in Brazil and the United Kingdom, decreased operating profit growth by 2 percentage points. 2000 vs. 1999 Kilo volume increased 10%, excluding the impact of the fifty third week. This growth was primarily driven by a 13% increase in salty snack kilos and a 9% increase in other non snack food kilos. The salty snack growth was led by double digit increases at Sabritas, our European and Latin American joint ventures and Walkers. The other non snack food growth was led by our business in Brazil. Acquisitions did not significantly impact the kilo growth. Kilo volume growth including the fifty third week was 11%. 25 Comparable net sales increased 13% primarily driven by the volume growth at Sabritas, Walkers and in Turkey, largely due to promotional programs, and effective net pricing at Gamesa and Sabritas.

This increase was primarily driven by high single digit growth in Mountain Dew reflecting the introduction of Code Red, strong growth in Sierra Mist and Aquafina, the acquisition of SoBe and the launch of Dole. These gains were partially offset by a low single digit decline in trademark Pepsi, which was mitigated, in part, by the successful launch of Pepsi Twist, and a double digit decline in Slice reflecting the strong growth of Sierra Mist. Bottler case sales volume increased 4%. The carbonated soft drink portfolio and the acquisition of SoBe each contributed 1 percentage point to both concentrate shipments and equivalents and bottler case sales growth. Comparable net sales increased 18% primarily due to the increased volume and higher effective net pricing. The acquisition of SoBe and our new products Dole, Mountain Dew Code Red, Sierra Mist and Pepsi Twist, accounted for the majority of the volume growth. These gains were partially offset by increased customer support. SoBe and Dole are sold as finished product to our bottling system. Accordingly, net sales growth was accelerated due to their significantly higher price per unit. The SoBe acquisition contributed 7 percentage points to net sales growth. Operating profit increased 13% primarily due to the increased volume and higher effective net pricing. These gains were partially offset by the increased advertising and marketing expenses related to bottler funding and other programs, increased general and administrative expenses and the increased customer support. General and administrative expenses grew at a significantly faster rate than sales, while advertising and marketing expenses grew at a significantly slower rate. The SoBe acquisition reduced operating profit growth by 4 percentage points. 2000 vs. 1999 Bottler case sales volume increased 1% driven by double digit growth in Aquafina and distribution gains from Fruitworks. In addition, the introduction of Sierra Mist and low single digit growth in Diet Pepsi contributed to the increase. These gains were partially offset by a low single digit decline in Pepsi and double digit declines in Pepsi One and Lemon Lime Slice. Concentrate shipments were in line with bottler case sales. On a fifty three week basis, concentrate shipments increased 1.3%. Comparable net sales increased 8%. Higher concentrate and fountain pricing and higher Aquafina royalties contributed 8 percentage points of growth, and the increased volume, including the launch of Sierra Mist and our new Dole juice product, contributed 2 percentage points. These increases were partially offset by increased customer support. The fifty third week enhanced reported net sales growth by 1 percentage point. Comparable operating profit increased 9% primarily due to the higher concentrate pricing, increased volume and the higher Aquafina royalties. These increases were partially offset by higher advertising and marketing expenses, increased customer support and increased general and administrative expenses. 27 Gatorade/Tropicana North America % Change B/(W) 2001 2000 1999 2001 2000 Net sales Reported $4,016 $3,841 $3,452 5 11 Comparable $4,016 $3,808 $3,452 5 10 Operating profit Reported $530 $500 $433 6 16 Comparable $530 $495 $433 7 15 2001 vs. 2000 Volume grew 4% excluding the impact of the fifty third week in 2000. This growth was led by three new Gatorade flavors and double digit growth in Tropicana Pure Premium nutritionals, offset by low double digit declines in Tropicana Seasons Best. Comparable net sales increased 5% due to the volume gains and higher effective net pricing for Gatorade. Comparable operating profit increased 7% due to the volume gains, the higher effective net pricing and lower general and administrative expenses. These increases were partially offset by higher promotional allowances and higher manufacturing costs primarily resulting from lower fruit yields, higher energy costs and lower production leverage. 2000 vs. 1999 Volume grew 10% due to the introduction of two new Gatorade flavors, multiple packs and expanded distribution. Continued double digit growth in Tropicana Pure Premium, including strong double digit growth in Tropicana Pure Premium nutritionals and blends, also contributed to this growth. On a fifty three week basis, volume increased 11%. Comparable net sales increased 10% primarily due to the volume gains. Lower effective net pricing at Tropicana was substantially offset by increased pricing of selected Gatorade products. Comparable operating profit increased 15% primarily due to the volume gains. These gains were partially offset by increased advertising and marketing expenses, including costs to support the launch of Propel fitness water, and increased packaging and transportation costs. 28 PepsiCo Beverages International % Change B/(W) 2001 2000 1999 2001 2000 Net sales Reported $2,582 $2,531 $2,407 2 5 Comparable $2,582 $2,531 $2,429 2 4 Operating profit $221 $169 $108 31 56 2001 vs. 2000 Volume increased 4.5% due to broad based increases led by Russia, China and Brazil. These increases were partially offset by pricing related declines in Mexico and Saudi Arabia coupled with a macroeconomic decline in Turkey. Total carbonated soft drink concentrate shipments to franchisees, including those bottlers in which we own an equity interest, grew 3% while their bottler case sales grew at about the same rate. Net sales increased 2%. This increase was primarily due to the volume gains and higher effective net pricing, partially offset by a net unfavorable foreign currency impact. The net unfavorable foreign currency impact, primarily in Europe, Brazil and Egypt, reduced net sales growth by 4 percentage points. Operating profit increased 31% primarily reflecting the volume gains and higher effective net pricing, partially offset by a net unfavorable foreign currency impact. The net unfavorable foreign currency impact, primarily in Europe, reduced operating profit growth by 12 percentage points. Overall margin improvements contributed to operating profit growth. 2000 vs. 1999 Volume increased 6%. This reflects broad based increases led by a doubling of volume in Russia, where volumes recovered from the effects of the 1998 ruble devaluation. Volume growth was also driven by double digit growth in China, India and Thailand and by growth in Mexico. Total carbonated soft drink concentrate shipments to franchisees, including those bottlers in which we own an equity interest, grew 2% while their bottler case sales grew at a higher rate. Comparable net sales increased 4% due to the volume gains and higher effective net pricing, partially offset by a broad based net unfavorable foreign currency impact led by Europe. The net unfavorable foreign currency impact reduced net sales growth by 5 percentage points. Operating profit increased 56% primarily reflecting the volume gains and higher effective net pricing, partially offset by a net unfavorable foreign currency impact, primarily in Europe, higher advertising and marketing and higher general and administrative expenses to support top line growth. 29 Quaker Foods North America Quaker Foods North America manufactures, markets and sells ready to eat cereals, hot cereals, flavored rice and pasta products, mixes and syrups, hominy grits and cornmeal in North America. Products manufactured and sold include Quaker oatmeal, Capn Crunch and Life ready to eat cereals, Rice A Roni products, Aunt Jemima mixes and syrups and Quaker grits. % Change B/(W) 2001 2000 1999 2001 2000 Net sales $1,991 $1,972 $1,993 1 (1) Operating profit $415 $392 $363 6 8 2001 vs. 2000 Volume decreased 1% driven by declines in ready to eat cereals and bulk cornmeal and oats products, largely offset by growth in hot cereals. The hot cereals growth resulted primarily from new products and flavor varieties. Net sales increased 1% primarily due to higher effective net pricing reflecting a mix shift to higher priced products, as well as price increases for cereals. This increase was offset by the lower overall volume. Operating profit increased 6% reflecting the higher effective net pricing from growth in higher priced products and the price increases in cereals. 2000 vs. 1999 Volume declined 1% driven by price competition in the ready to eat cereal category, partially offset by gains from the introduction of new varieties of hot cereals. Net sales declined 1% primarily due to the lower overall volume. Operating profit increased 8% reflecting the higher margin hot cereals volume growth, productivity gains and lower marketing spending. Advertising and marketing expenses declined at a faster rate than sales. 30 CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOWS Operating cash flow for 2001 was $2.9 billion compared with $3.1 billion for 2000. Operating cash flow primarily reflects externally reported net cash provided by operating activities of $4.2 billion, excluding after tax net interest payments and the cash payments for merger related costs and other impairment restructuring charges, less capital spending, sales of property, plant and equipment and other net investing activity. Our 2001 operating cash flow reflects a $421 million contribution to our U.S. pension plans compared to a $70 million contribution in 2000. The 2001 payment was made following a review of our anticipated future sources and uses of cash. We do not expect to make a cash contribution to our U.S. pension plans in 2002. Additionally, in 2001, we received tax refunds of $62 million versus $145 million in 2000. As shown in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, our 2001 cash and cash equivalents decreased $355 million to $683 million reflecting cash used for investing and financing activities primarily funded from net cash provided by operations. The cash used in investing activities reflects capital spending, net purchases of short term investments, the acquisition of SoBe and the contribution to our pension plans. The cash used in financing activities reflects share repurchases and dividend payments, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the net proceeds of $524 million from the issuance of shares in connection with the merger with Quaker. We issued 13.2 million shares of our repurchased common stock to qualify for pooling of interests accounting treatment. Our 2000 cash and cash equivalents decreased $208 million to $1 billion reflecting cash used for financing and investing activities primarily funded from net cash provided by operations. The cash used in financing activities reflects share repurchases, dividend payments and net long term debt payments, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options. The cash used in investing activities reflects capital spending and net purchases of short term investments. Common Share Repurchases Common share repurchase activity was as follows: 2001 2000 1999 Cost $1,716 $1,430 $1,285 Shares repurchased Number of shares (in millions) 35 38 36 % of shares outstanding at beginning of year 2.4% 2.6% 2.4% Quaker repurchased common shares totaling $242 million in 2000 and $373 million in 1999. 31 Subsequent to our merger with Quaker, we repurchased 35 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $1.7 billion under the emergency and exemptive orders from the Securities and Exchange Commission aimed at facilitating the reopening of the U.S. equities market on September 17, 2001, following the September 11th terrorist attacks. Our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2 billion worth of our common stock during the terms of the orders. Repurchases under the orders did not compromise our ability to account for the merger with Quaker as a pooling of interests. All authorizations for share repurchases have been rescinded as a result of the PepsiCo and Quaker merger. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our strong cash generating capability and financial condition give us ready access to capital markets throughout the world. Our principle source of liquidity is operating cash flows, which are derived from net sales. Macroeconomic conditions may impact the demand for and pricing of our products. Our debt rating of A1 from Moodys and A from Standard & Poors contributes to our accessibility to global capital markets. These ratings reflect our strong operating cash flows and include the impact of the cash flows and debt of our anchor bottlers. We have maintained these healthy ratings since 1989 demonstrating the stability of our operating cash flows. At year end 2001, we maintained $750 million of revolving credit facilities. Of the $750 million, approximately $375 million expires in June 2002 with the remaining $375 million expiring in June 2006. Annually, these facilities are extendable for an additional year upon the mutual consent of PepsiCo and the lending institutions. The credit facilities exist largely to support issuances of short term debt and remain unused at year end 2001. At year end 2001, $375 million of short term borrowings were reclassified as long term, reflecting our intent and ability, through the existence of the unused credit facilities, to refinance these borrowings on a long term basis. Quaker integration costs will require cash, of which $228 million was paid in 2001. We expect the balance will be paid in 2002 and 2003. Long term financial obligations and other commercial commitments Long term financial obligations: Payments Due by Period Less than 1 3 4 5 After 5 Total 1 year years years years Long term debt, including current maturities (a) $2,970 $319 $ 926 $769 $ 956 Operating leases 605 138 206 99 162 Total $3,575 $457 $1,132 $868 $1,118 (a) As recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

(which we spun off in 1997) and other commitments in the normal course of business, including obligations for customer promotional incentives, approximating $60 million with terms primarily extending up to 5 years. Our commitments for goods and services purchases do not exceed our projected requirements over the related terms and are in the normal course of business. 33
