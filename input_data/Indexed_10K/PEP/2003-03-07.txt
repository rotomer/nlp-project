Tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Percentage changes are based on unrounded amounts. OUR BUSINESS Our Operations We are a leading, global snack and beverage company. We manufacture, market and sell a variety of salty, convenient, sweet and grain based snacks, carbonated and noncarbonated beverages and foods. We are organized in six divisions: Frito Lay North America, Frito Lay International, Pepsi Cola North America, Gatorade/Tropicana North America, PepsiCo Beverages International, and Quaker Foods North America. Net sales and operating profit contributions from each of our six divisions are as follows: Our North American divisions operate in the United States and Canada. Our international divisions operate in over 175 countries, with our largest operations in Mexico and the United Kingdom. Additional information concerning our divisions and geographic areas is presented in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. Beginning in 2003, we will combine the results of PCNA and GTNA as PepsiCo Beverages North America and of our international food and beverage businesses as PepsiCo International to reflect operating and management changes. Snacks Frito Lay North America (FLNA) manufactures, markets, sells and distributes branded snacks. These snacks include Lays potato chips, Doritos flavored tortilla chips, Cheetos cheese flavored snacks, Fritos corn chips, Tostitos tortilla chips, Ruffles potato chips, Rold Gold pretzels, branded dips, Quaker Chewy granola bars, Sunchips multigrain snacks, Grandmas cookies, Quaker Fruit & Oatmeal bars, Quaker Quakes corn and rice snacks, Quaker rice cakes, Cracker Jack treats and Go Snacks. 10 Table of Contents In addition to many of the FLNA and Quaker branded snacks sold in North America, Frito Lay International (FLI) also manufactures and sells a number of leading snack brands including Sabritas, Gamesa and Alegro brands in Mexico, Walkers and Wotsits brands in the United Kingdom, and Smiths brand in Australia. These products are manufactured by consolidated businesses, as well as by noncontrolled affiliates. FLNA and FLI branded products are sold to independent distributors and retailers. Our snacks businesses measure physical volume growth on a system wide basis, which includes the volume sold by our noncontrolled affiliates. Beverages Pepsi Cola North America (PCNA) manufactures, markets and sells beverage concentrates, and sells fountain syrups and finished goods, under the brands Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Sierra Mist, Mug, Slice, FruitWorks, SoBe and Dole. PCNA manufactures, markets and sells ready to drink tea and coffee products through joint ventures with Lipton and Starbucks. PCNA sells concentrate and finished goods for these brands to bottlers licensed by us. PCNA also licenses the Aquafina water brand to its bottlers. The franchise bottlers sell our brands as finished goods to independent distributors and retailers. PCNA reports two measures of volume performance. Concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE) reflects PCNAs sales to its bottlers, as well as bottler Aquafina volume, and is reported on a fiscal year basis consistent with net sales. Bottler case sales (BCS) reflects the sales of beverages bearing our trademarks that franchise bottlers have sold to independent distributors and retailers and is reported on a monthly basis. CSE and BCS growth may vary due to differences in the reporting calendar and short term changes in bottler inventory. Gatorade/Tropicana North America (GTNA) manufactures, markets and sells Gatorade sports drinks, Tropicana Pure Premium, Dole, Tropicana Seasons Best and Tropicana Twister juices and juice drinks and Propel fitness water. These branded products are sold to independent distributors and retailers. PepsiCo Beverages International (PBI) manufactures, markets and sells beverage concentrates, fountain syrups and finished goods under the brands Pepsi, 7UP, Mirinda, Mountain Dew, Gatorade and Tropicana outside North America. Generally, PBIs brands are sold to franchise bottlers. However, in certain markets, PBI operates bottling plants and distribution facilities. PBI also licenses the Aquafina water brand to certain of its franchise bottlers. PBI reports two measures of volume. Concentrate shipments reflects PBIs sale of concentrate to franchise bottlers only and is reported on a monthly basis consistent with net sales. BCS reflects company owned and franchise bottler sales of beverages bearing our trademarks and is also reported on a monthly basis. Concentrate shipments and the related BCS may differ due to short term changes in bottler inventory. Foods Quaker Foods North America (QFNA) manufactures, markets and sells cereals, rice, pasta and other branded products. QFNAs products include Quaker oatmeal, Capn Crunch and Life ready to eat cereals, Rice A Roni, Pasta Roni and Near East side dishes, Aunt Jemima mixes and syrups and Quaker grits. These branded products are sold to independent distributors and retailers. 11 Table of Contents Our Customers Our customers include franchise bottlers and independent distributors and retailers. We grant our bottlers exclusive contracts to manufacture and or sell specified beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area. These arrangements specify the amount to be paid by our bottlers for concentrate and full goods and for Aquafina royalties, as well as the manufacturing process required for product quality. Since we do not sell directly to the consumer, we rely on, and provide financial incentives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products. For our independent distributors and retailers, these incentives include volume based rebates, promotions and displays. For our bottlers, these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs, such as consumer incentives, advertising support, new product support and vending and cooler equipment placement. Consumer incentives include consumer coupons, pricing discounts and consumer promotions, such as sweepstakes and other promotional offers. Advertising support is directed at advertising programs and supporting bottler media. New product funding includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives for these products and direct marketplace support, such as point of purchase materials, media and advertising. Vending and cooler equipment placement programs support the acquisition and placement of vending machines and cooler equipment. The nature and type of programs vary annually. The level of bottler funding is at our discretion because these incentives are not required by the terms of our bottling contracts. No single customer represents more than 10% of our net sales. However, when considering both our volume and that of our bottlers, Wal Mart Stores, Inc. is a significant customer. Retail consolidation has increased the importance of major customers and further consolidation is expected. Also see Cautionary Statements. Our Related Party Bottlers We have ownership interests in certain of our bottlers. Our ownership is generally less than fifty percent and since we do not control these bottlers, we do not consolidate their results. We include our share of their net income based on our percentage of ownership in our income statement as bottling equity income. We have designated three related party bottlers, The Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG), PepsiAmericas (PAS) and Pepsi Bottling Ventures (PBV), as our anchor bottlers. Our anchor bottlers distribute over 70% of our Pepsi Cola North America case sales volume and approximately 14% of our PepsiCo Beverages International case sales volume. These bottlers participate in the bottler funding programs described above. Approximately 12% of our total sales incentives are paid to these bottlers. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on these related parties and related party commitments and guarantees. Our Distribution Network Our products are brought to market through direct store delivery, broker warehouse and food service and vending distribution networks. The distribution system used depends on customer needs, product characteristics, and local trade practices. 12 Table of Contents Direct Store Delivery We and our bottlers operate direct store delivery systems that deliver snacks and beverages directly to retail stores where the products are merchandised by our employees or our bottlers. Direct store delivery enables us to merchandise with maximum visibility and appeal. Direct store delivery is especially well suited to products that have high retail turnover and respond to in store promotion and merchandising. Broker Warehouse Systems Some of our products are delivered from our warehouses to customer warehouses and retail stores. These less costly systems generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishable, have lower turnover, and are less likely to be impulse purchases. Foodservice and Vending Our foodservice and vending sales force distributes snacks, foods and beverages to third party foodservice and vending distributors and operators, and through our bottlers. This distribution system supplies our products to schools, businesses, stadiums, restaurants and similar locations. Our Competition Our businesses operate in highly competitive markets. We compete against global companies and regional and private label manufacturers on the basis of price, quality, product variety and effective distribution. Success in this competitive environment is primarily achieved through effective promotion of existing products and the introduction of new products. We believe that the strength of our brands, innovation and marketing, coupled with our quality products and flexible distribution network, allow us to effectively compete. Other Relationships Certain members of our Board of Directors also serve on the boards of certain vendors and customers. Those Board members do not participate in our vendor selection and negotiations nor in our customer negotiations. Our transactions with these vendors and customers are in the normal course of business and are consistent with terms negotiated with other vendors and customers. In addition, certain of our employees serve on the boards of our anchor bottlers and other affiliated companies and do not receive incremental compensation for their board services. Our Market Risks We are exposed to the risks arising from adverse changes in: commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and fuel; foreign exchange rates; interest rates on our short term investment and debt portfolios; and stock prices. 13 Table of Contents In the normal course of business, we manage these risks through a variety of strategies, including the use of derivatives designated as cash flow and fair value hedges. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these hedges and our hedging policies. The fair value of our hedges fluctuates based on market rates and prices. The sensitivity of our hedges to these market fluctuations is discussed below. See Our Critical Accounting Policies for a discussion of the exposure of our pension plan assets and liabilities to risks related to interest rates and stock prices. Inflationary, deflationary and recessionary conditions impacting these market risks also impact the demand for and pricing of our products. See Cautionary Statements for further discussion. Commodity Prices Our commodity derivatives totaled $70 million at December 28, 2002 and $252 million at December 29, 2001. These derivatives resulted in a net unrealized gain of $6 million at December 28, 2002 and a net unrealized loss of $16 million at December 29, 2001. We estimate that a 10% decline in commodity prices would have resulted in an unrealized loss of $2 million in 2002 and increased the unrealized loss by $18 million in 2001. Foreign Exchange Our operations outside of the United States generate 34% of our net sales of which Mexico, the United Kingdom and Canada contribute 19%. As a result, we are exposed to foreign currency risks from unforeseen economic changes and political unrest. During 2002, the impact of declines in the Mexican peso were substantially offset by increases in the British pound and the euro. However, if future declines in the Mexican peso are not offset by increases in the British pound and the euro, our future results would be adversely impacted. We may enter into derivatives to manage our exposure to foreign currency transaction risk. Our foreign currency derivatives had a total face value of $329 million at December 28, 2002 and $355 million at December 29, 2001. These contracts had a net unrealized loss of less than $1 million at December 28, 2002 and a net unrealized gain of $4 million at December 29, 2001. We estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the exchange rates would have increased the unrealized loss by $34 million in 2002 and would have resulted in an unrealized loss of $31 million in 2001. Interest Rates Late in 2002, we terminated the majority of our interest rate swaps used to manage our interest rate risk. As a result, 12% of our debt is exposed to variable interest rates compared to approximately 45% in 2001. Assuming year end variable rate debt and investment levels, a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates would have reduced net interest expense by $11 million in 2002 and increased net interest expense by $3 million in 2001. The impact of the 1 percentage point increase in rates at year end 2002 reflects higher investment balances and lower variable debt balances. This sensitivity analysis includes the impact of existing interest rate swaps during these years. 14 Table of Contents Stock Prices We manage the market risk related to our deferred compensation liability, which is indexed to certain market indices and our stock price, with mutual fund investments and prepaid forward contracts for the purchase of our stock. The combined losses on these investments are offset by changes in our deferred compensation liability which is included in Corporate selling, general and administrative expenses. Cautionary Statements We discuss expectations regarding our future performance, such as our business outlook, in our annual and quarterly reports, press releases, and other written and oral statements. These forward looking statements are based on currently available competitive, financial and economic data and our operating plans. They are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could turn out to be significantly different from our expectations. You should consider the following key factors when evaluating our trends and future results: continued demand for our products, which is dependent on successful product introductions and other innovations, effectiveness of our sales incentives, advertising campaigns and marketing programs, seasonal weather conditions, relationships with key customers (including our bottlers), and our response to consumer health concerns and changes in product category consumption; competitive product and pricing pressures; continued success from our productivity initiatives, which is dependent upon our ability to implement and leverage these programs; continued success of acquisition integrations, including our ability to achieve cost savings and revenue enhancement opportunities from the Quaker merger; unforeseen economic changes and political unrest, which may result in business interruption, foreign currency devaluation, inflation, deflation and decreased demand, particularly in areas outside North America, such as in Latin America and the Middle East; maintenance of our profit margin in the face of a consolidating retail environment; changes in laws and regulations, including changes in food and drug laws, accounting standards, taxation requirements (including tax rate changes, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations) and environmental laws; and fluctuations in manufacturing costs and the availability of raw materials. The discussion of these risks and uncertainties is by no means all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider. OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES An understanding of our accounting policies is necessary to completely analyze our financial results. Our critical accounting policies require management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties. As a result, estimates are included in and may significantly impact our financial results. The precision of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes. We applied our estimation methods consistently in all periods presented. 15 Table of Contents Our critical accounting policies arise in conjunction with the following: revenue recognition, brands and goodwill, income taxes, and pension and retiree medical plans. Revenue Recognition Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery and may allow discounts for early payment. We recognize revenue upon delivery to our customers in accordance with written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return. However, our policy for direct store delivery and chilled products is to remove and replace out of date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness that they expect. Based on our historical experience with this practice, we have reserved for anticipated out of date product. Our bottlers have a similar replacement policy and are responsible for our products that they distribute. We offer sales incentives through various programs to customers, consumers and, for PCNA, directly to certain retailers. Sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction of sales and totaled $5.5 billion in 2002, $4.7 billion in 2001 and $4.3 billion in 2000. A number of these programs, such as bottler funding and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year for the expected payout. The accruals are based on our previous experience with similar programs. The terms of most of our incentive arrangements do not exceed a year. However, we have arrangements, such as fountain pouring rights, which extend up to 12 years. Costs incurred to obtain these rights are recognized over the life of the contract as a reduction of sales, and the outstanding balance is included in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We estimate and reserve for our bad debt exposure from credit sales based on our experience. Our method of determining the reserves has not changed during the years presented in the consolidated financial statements. Bad debt expense is classified within selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Income Statement. Brands and Goodwill We sell products under a number of brand names around the world, many of which were developed by us. The brand development costs are expensed as incurred. We also purchase brands and goodwill in acquisitions. Upon acquisition, the purchase price is first allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities, including brands, based on estimated fair value, with any remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill. Goodwill and perpetual brands are not amortized. We believe that a brand has an indefinite life if it has significant market share in a stable macroeconomic environment, and a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance that we expect to continue for the foreseeable future. If these perpetual brand criteria are not met, brands are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from five to twenty years. Determining the expected life of a brand requires considerable management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors, including the competitive environment, market share, brand history and the macroeconomic environment of the country in which the brand is sold. 16 Table of Contents Perpetual brands and goodwill are assessed for impairment at least annually to ensure that future cash flows continue to exceed the related book value. A perpetual brand is impaired if its book value exceeds its fair value. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment if the book value of its reporting unit exceeds its fair value. A reporting unit can be a division or business. If the fair value of an evaluated asset is less than its book value, the asset is written down based on its discounted future cash flows to fair value. Amortizable brands are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is generally based on discounted future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital, are consistent with our internal projections and operating plans. We did not recognize any impairment charges for perpetual brands or goodwill during 2002. As of December 28, 2002, we had over $4 billion of perpetual brands and goodwill, of which 75% related to Tropicana and Walkers. In our most recent impairment evaluations for Tropicana and Walkers, no impairment charges would have resulted even if operating profit growth were assumed to be 5% lower. Income Taxes Our reported effective tax rate was 31.9% for 2002. Excluding the impact of nondeductible merger related costs, our effective tax rate was 31.2%. For 2003, our effective tax rate, excluding the impact of nondeductible merger related costs, is expected to be 30.5%. The decrease from 2002 primarily reflects the impact of our new concentrate plant. Our effective tax rate is based on expected income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may not succeed. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that we consider appropriate, as well as related interest. This rate is then applied to our quarterly operating results. In the event that there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in our operating results, the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or one time item. We consider the Quaker merger related costs to be a significant one time item. 17 Table of Contents Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, our effective tax rate reflected in our financial statements is different than that reported in our tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses which are not deductible on our tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for which we have already taken a deduction on our tax return, but have not yet recognized as expense in our financial statements. We have not recognized any United States tax expense on undistributed international earnings since we intend to reinvest the earnings outside the United States for the foreseeable future. These undistributed earnings are approximately $7.5 billion at December 28, 2002. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. In the United States, the audits for 1991 through 1993 remain open for certain items and the Internal Revenue Service is currently examining our tax returns for 1994 through 1997. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe that our reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies. Unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require use of our cash. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the year of resolution. Our tax reserves are presented in the balance sheet within other liabilities, except for amounts relating to items we expect to settle in the coming year which are classified as current. Pension and Retiree Medical Plans Our pension plans cover full time U.S. employees and certain international employees. Benefits are determined based on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings. U.S. employees are also eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements and qualify for retirement benefits. Generally, our retiree medical costs are capped at a specified dollar amount, with retirees contributing the remainder. The expected benefit to be paid is expensed over the employees expected service. Management must make many assumptions to determine the expected benefit and expected service, including: the interest rate used to determine the present value of liabilities (discount rate), the expected return on plan assets for plans funded by us, the rate of salary increases for plans where benefits are based on earnings, health care cost trend rates for retiree medical plans, and certain employee related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality. We make contributions to trusts maintained to provide plan benefits for certain pension plans. These contributions are made in accordance with applicable tax regulations that provide for current tax deductions for our contributions and taxation to the employee only upon receipt of plan benefits. We do not generally fund pension plans and retiree medical plans when our contributions would not be tax deductible or when the employee would be taxed prior to receipt of benefit. Pension plan investment guidelines are established based upon an evaluation of market conditions, risk tolerance and plan investment horizon. 18 Table of Contents The assets, liabilities and assumptions used to measure pension and retiree medical expense are determined as of September 30 of the preceding year (measurement date). Since the liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate is a significant assumption. It is based on interest rates for high quality, long term corporate debt at each measurement date. The expected return on pension plan assets is based on our historical experience and our expectations for long term rates of return. To measure pension expense, we use a calculated value for plan assets which recognizes changes in fair value over five years rather than the current fair value at each measurement date. The other assumptions also reflect our historical experience and managements best judgment regarding future expectations. Gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions are determined at each measurement date. If the net total gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion of the net gain or loss is included in expense for the next year. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service, is included in expense over the expected service of the employees. Weighted average assumptions for pension and retiree medical expense: 2003 2002 2001 2000 Pension Expense discount rate 6.7% 7.4% 7.7% 7.7% Expected rate of return on plan assets 8.2% 9.1% 9.8% 9.9% Rate of salary increases 4.4% 4.4% 4.6% 4.5% Retiree medical Expense discount rate 6.7% 7.5% 7.8% 7.8% We review our assumptions at least at the annual measurement date. During 2002, we completed a review of our pension investment and funding strategy for our U.S. pension plans. As a result, we revised our U.S. investment allocation to a maximum of 65% equities with the balance in fixed income securities. As a result of the mid year 2002 investment funding and strategy changes, we remeasured pension expense for our U.S. plans to incorporate a reduction in the rate of return on plan assets to 8.2%, as well as changes to employee related assumptions based on current data. This mid year valuation resulted in a weighted average expected return on plan assets for 2002 of 9.1% and increased the balance of year pension expense by $29 million. This increase is reported in Corporate selling, general and administrative expenses. Health care cost trend rates have an impact on the retiree medical plan expense. A 1 percentage point increase in the assumed health care trend rate would increase the service and interest costs by $4 million for 2003 and a 1 percentage point decrease would reduce these costs by $4 million. Pension expense for 2003 is estimated to be approximately $160 million and retiree medical expense is estimated to be approximately $120 million compared to 2002 pension expense of $111 million and retiree medical expense of $88 million. These estimates incorporate the 2003 assumptions, as well as the impact of the increased pension plan assets resulting from our contributions to funded plans. 19 Table of Contents OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS Consolidated Statement of Income PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries Fiscal years ended December 28, 2002, December 29, 2001 and December 30, 2000 (in millions except per share amounts) 2002 2001 2000 Net Sales $ 25,112 $ 23,512 $ 22,337 Cost of sales 11,497 10,750 10,226 Selling, general and administrative expenses 8,523 8,189 7,962 Amortization of intangible assets 138 165 147 Merger related costs 224 356 Other impairment and restructuring charges 31 184 Operating Profit 4,730 4,021 3,818 Bottling equity income 280 160 130 Interest expense (178 ) (219 ) (272 ) Interest income 36 67 85 Income before Income Taxes 4,868 4,029 3,761 Provision for Income Taxes 1,555 1,367 1,218 Net Income $ 3,313 $ 2,662 $ 2,543 Net Income per Common Share Basic $1.89 $1.51 $1.45 Diluted $1.85 $1.47 $1.42 See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements. 20 Table of Contents Items Affecting Comparability The year over year comparisons of our financial results are affected by the following one time items and accounting changes: 2002 2001 2000 Net Sales SVE consolidation $706 $648 53rd week in 2000 $(294 ) Operating Profit Merger related costs $224 $356 SFAS 142 adoption $23 $88 SVE consolidation $13 $16 Other impairment and restructuring charges $31 $184 53rd week in 2000 $(62 ) Other $(2 ) $17 Bottling Equity Income SFAS 142 adoption $65 $70 53rd week in 2000 $(5 ) Net Income Merger related costs $190 $322 SFAS 142 adoption $102 $151 Other impairment and restructuring charges $19 $111 53rd week in 2000 $(44 ) Net Income per Common Share Diluted Merger related costs $0.11 $0.18 SFAS 142 adoption $0.06 $0.08 Other impairment and restructuring charges $0.01 $0.06 53rd week in 2000 $(0.02 ) Merger Related Costs We incurred costs associated with our merger with Quaker. We expect to incur additional costs of approximately $50 million in 2003 to complete the integration of the two companies. For additional information, see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. SFAS 142 Adoption In 2002, we adopted SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which eliminated amortization of goodwill and perpetual brands (our nonamortizable intangibles), and resulted in the acceleration of the amortization of certain of our other intangibles. The prior year adjustments in the above table reflect the impact that would have resulted if adoption had occurred at the beginning of 2000. For additional information, see Our Critical Accounting Policies and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. 21 Table of Contents SVE Consolidation As a result of changes in the operations of Snack Ventures Europe (SVE), we determined that consolidation was required, and we consolidated SVE in 2002. The prior year adjustments in the above table reflect the impact that would have resulted if consolidation had occurred at the beginning of 2000. For further information on our consolidation of SVE, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. Other Impairment and Restructuring Charges We incurred costs for Quakers supply chain reconfiguration and manufacturing and distribution optimization project. 53rd Week in 2000 Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in December, and as a result, a 53rd week is added every five or six years. Comparisons of 2002 and 2001 to 2000 are affected by an additional week of results in 2000. Other This adjustment primarily reflects the reclassification of our prepaid forward contracts. Beginning in 2001, in connection with the adoption of the accounting standard on derivative instruments, gains or losses on prepaid forward contracts, which are used to hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability, were reclassified to Corporate selling, general and administrative expenses. These amounts were previously reported in interest income. For more information on these prepaid forward contracts, see Our Market Risks. Pending Accounting Changes Current pending accounting standards are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements. For a description of these new accounting standards see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. 22 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Review In the discussions of net sales and operating profit below, effective net pricing reflects the year over year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries. Servings Since our divisions each use different measures of physical unit volume (e.g., kilos, pounds, case sales, gallons, etc.), a common servings metric is necessary to reflect our consolidated physical unit volume. Our divisions physical volume measures are converted into servings based on U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines for single serving sizes of our products. Total servings increased 4% in 2002 compared to 2001 due to volume gains across all divisions led by beverages. Total servings increased 4% in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to contributions from our international divisions and Pepsi Cola North America. Net Sales and Total Operating Profit Change 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 Net sales $25,112 $23,512 $22,337 7% 5% Operating profit $4,730 $4,021 $3,818 18% 5% Operating profit margin 18.8% 17.1% 17.1% 1.7 2002 Net sales increased 7% and operating profit increased 18% driven by volume gains across all divisions, the consolidation of SVE, higher concentrate pricing and favorable mix. These gains were partially offset by increased promotional spending at Gatorade/Tropicana North America and Frito Lay North America and net unfavorable foreign currency movement. The consolidation of SVE increased net sales growth by 3 percentage points and operating profit by 1 percentage point. In addition, operating profit growth improved 5 percentage points from the impact of lower merger related costs, the absence of other impairment and restructuring costs and the adoption of SFAS 142. The impact of net unfavorable foreign currency movements reduced net sales growth by 1 percentage point. Operating profit growth was not materially affected by foreign currency movements. Our operating profit margin increased 1.7 percentage points primarily due to lower costs reflecting merger synergies of approximately $250 million, lower merger costs and productivity. We expect our operating margins to continue to improve as a result of Quaker merger related synergies that are expected to reach $400 million a year by 2004 and by our ongoing productivity initiatives. 23 Table of Contents 2001 Net sales and operating profit increased 5% primarily reflecting increased volume and higher effective net pricing of snacks and beverages, as well as the acquisition of South Beach Beverage Company, LLC (SoBe), which contributed nearly 1 percentage point to net sales growth. These gains were partially offset by the inclusion of the 53rd week in 2000, which reduced net sales growth by more than 1 percentage point and operating profit growth by 1.5 percentage points, and a net unfavorable foreign currency impact. In addition, operating profit was reduced by merger related costs and higher general and administrative expenses, partially offset by lower costs for the Quaker supply chain project. Merger related costs and lower supply chain costs reduced operating profit growth by approximately 5 percentage points. The unfavorable foreign currency impact, primarily in Brazil and Europe, reduced net sales growth by more than 1 percentage point. Operating profit growth was reduced nearly 1 percentage point as a result of unfavorable foreign currency. Bottling Equity Income 2002 2001 2000 % Change 2002 2001 Bottling equity income $280 $160 $130 75 23 Bottling equity income includes our share of the net income or loss of our noncontrolled bottling affiliates as described in Our Customers. Our interest in these bottling investments may change from time to time. Any gains or losses from these changes, as well as other transactions related to our bottling investments, are also included on a pre tax basis. 2002 Bottling equity income increased 75%. This increase primarily reflects the adoption of SFAS 142. The impact of impairment charges of $35 million related to a Latin American bottling investment was more than offset by the settlement of issues upon the sale of our investment in Pepsi Gemex, our Mexican bottling affiliate, and the absence of one time items discussed in 2001 below. Excluding these items, bottling equity income increased approximately 13% reflecting improved performance of our international bottling investments, and the contribution of our North American anchor bottlers. 2001 Bottling equity income increased 23%, primarily reflecting the strong performance of PBG. Results for 2001 also include a gain of $59 million from the sale of approximately 2 million shares of PBG stock, and a net credit of $23 million related to the resolution of issues for which a prior year accrual was established in connection with the creation of our anchor bottler system. Bottling equity income in 2001 also benefited from $5 million of losses from the 53rd week in 2000. These increases were offset by impairment charges of $62 million related to certain international bottling investments, primarily our equity investment in Turkey and a charge of $27 million for our share of a charge recorded by PepsiAmericas for environmental liabilities related to discontinued operations. 24 Table of Contents Interest Expense, net % Change 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 Interest expense, net $(142) $(152) $(187) 6 19 2002 Net interest expense declined 6% primarily due to lower average debt levels, partially offset by increased losses of $10 million on investments used to hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability. Decreases in borrowing rates were offset by decreases in investment rates. 2001 Net interest expense declined 19%. Interest expense declined primarily as a result of significantly lower average debt levels. Interest income declined as 2000 includes $19 million in gains from prepaid forward contracts. Excluding the prepaid forward contracts, interest income increased slightly as the impact of higher average investment balances was largely offset by lower average interest rates and losses on the investments hedging a portion of our deferred compensation liability. Effective Tax Rate 2002 2001 2000 Effective tax rate 31.9 % 33.9 % 32.4 % 2002 The effective tax rate decreased 2 percentage points compared to prior year. The adoption of SFAS 142 reduced the rate by 0.8 percentage points. The impact of nondeductible merger related costs on the rate decreased from 1.9 percentage points in 2001 to 0.7 percentage points in 2002. Excluding the impact of nondeductible merger related costs in 2002, our effective tax rate would have been 31.2%. 2001 The effective tax rate increased 1.5 percentage points primarily due to limited tax benefits associated with merger related costs, partially offset by lower taxes on foreign results. Net Income and Net Income per Common Share % Change 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 Net income $3,313 $2,662 $2,543 24 5 Net income per common share diluted $1.85 $1.47 $1.42 26 4 25 Table of Contents 2002 Net income increased 24% and the related net income per common share increased 26%. These increases primarily reflect the solid operating profit growth, lower merger related costs and the adoption of SFAS 142. Net income per common share also reflects the benefit of a reduction in average shares outstanding primarily as a result of increased share buyback activity. Merger related costs reduced net income per common share by $0.11 in 2002. 2001 Net income increased 5% and the related net income per common share increased 4%. These increases primarily reflect increased operating profit, reduced other impairment and restructuring costs, lower net interest expense, and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by merger related costs. Division Review The results and discussions below are based on how our Chief Executive Officer monitors the performance of our divisions. Prior year amounts reflect the adoption of SFAS 142 and consolidation of SVE and exclude the results of divested businesses. In addition, when our fiscal year contains a 53rd week, as occurred in 2000, our divisions are managed on a fifty two week basis and, accordingly, the 53rd week is excluded from the results below. For additional information on these items and our divisions, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. Frito Lay North America % Change 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 Net sales $8,565 $8,216 $7,769 4 6 Operating profit $2,216 $2,056 $1,875 8 10 2002 Pound volume grew 4% primarily due to new products, strong growth in branded snack mix, single digit growth in Cheetos cheese flavored snacks, Doritos tortilla chips, branded dips and Quaker Chewy Granola bars, and double digit growth in Rold Gold pretzels. Go Snacks significantly contributed to the new product growth and Munchies drove the branded snack mix growth. These gains were partially offset by a single digit decline in Ruffles potato chips. Growth in net sales of 4% and operating profit of 8% reflects the increased volume. Approximately half of the net sales growth came from new products. Increased promotional spending more than offset favorable mix and other pricing. Lower costs, particularly performance based compensation and commodity prices for vegetable oils and natural gas, contributed 4 percentage points of the operating profit growth. 26 Table of Contents 2001 Pound volume advanced 3%. This growth was led by single digit growth in Lays potato chips, Cheetos cheese flavored snacks, Doritos tortilla chips, Fritos corn chips and the introduction of our new Lays Bistro Gourmet potato chips. These gains were partially offset by a double digit decline in Ruffles potato chips. Growth in net sales of 6% and operating profit of 10% primarily reflects higher effective net pricing and the increased volume. Lays Bistro Gourmet potato chips contributed nearly 1 percentage point to the sales growth. Advertising and marketing expenses grew at a faster rate than sales, also negatively impacting operating profit growth. Frito Lay International % Change 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 Net sales $5,713 $5,492 $5,172 4 6 Operating profit $781 $651 $577 20 13 2002 Volume grew 6% primarily reflecting 3% growth in salty snacks, 8% growth in sweet snacks and 6% growth in foods. Single digit growth at Walkers and Sabritas contributed over 70% of the salty volume growth. Strong single digit growth at Gamesa contributed nearly 80% of the sweet growth and the introduction of Chipita croissants in Russia contributed the remainder. Brazil drove the foods volume. Unfavorable foreign currencies in Mexico, Argentina and Brazil reduced net sales growth by 4 percentage points. This impact was partially offset by the favorable 1 percentage point impact of the British pound and the euro. Foreign currency was not a factor in operating profit growth as the unfavorable Mexican peso offset the favorable impact of the British pound and, as a result of operating losses, the Argentinean peso. Growth in net sales of 4% and operating profit of 20% primarily reflects solid results at Walkers, Gamesa and Sabritas. The impact of higher net effective pricing in Brazil and Argentina contributed 1 percentage point to net sales growth. These gains were partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign currencies. Walkers and Gamesa together contributed over 60% of the net sales growth and nearly half of the operating profit growth. Favorable advertising and marketing costs at Sabritas also contributed to operating profit growth. 2001 Volume increased 6%, reflecting growth in the salty and sweet categories. The salty volume grew 9% led by double digit growth at SVE, in Brazil and in Poland, single digit growth at Walkers and 2 percentage points of growth from acquisitions. Sweet volume grew 5% driven by growth at Gamesa. 27 Table of Contents Growth in net sales of 6% and operating profit of 13% primarily reflects solid results from Walkers, Gamesa and Poland, effective net pricing at Sabritas and Gamesa, and the impact of acquisitions. Macroeconomic conditions in Argentina negatively impacted operating profit growth. Unfavorable foreign currency movements in Brazil and the United Kingdom decreased net sales by 4 percentage points and operating profit growth by 2 percentage points. Pepsi Cola North America % Change 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 Net sales $3,365 $3,189 $2,657 6 20 Operating profit $987 $881 $820 12 7 2002 Concentrate shipments and equivalents increased 2% driven by strong double digit growth in Aquafina, the introductions of Lipton Brisk Lemonade and Pepsi Blue, and continued growth of Pepsi Twist, Code Red and Sierra Mist. Trademark Mountain Dew was flat compared to prior year reflecting the double digit growth of Code Red offset by declines in base Mountain Dew. Trademark Pepsi was down slightly compared to prior year as gains from Pepsi Twist and Pepsi Blue were more than offset by declines in base Pepsi. BCS increased 2% over the prior year. Net sales increased 6% and operating profit increased 12%. These increases reflect higher concentrate pricing contributing 3 percentage points to net sales growth and substantially all of the operating profit growth. These increases also reflect volume from the new product introductions, increased Aquafina royalties and higher national fountain pricing, partially offset by lower concentrate volume, costs associated with litigation, increased inventory costs and increased advertising and marketing expenses related to our new products. New products contributed approximately 2 percentage points to the net sales growth. Advertising and marketing costs, costs of sales and general and administrative expenses grew at a slower rate than sales. As in 2002, we expect concentrate pricing to favorably impact our results due to the 2% price increase effective in the first quarter of 2003. In addition, our carbonated soft drink volume will be favorably impacted by the expanded distribution of Sierra Mist by many of our U.S. bottlers as these bottlers distribute Sierra Mist as their exclusive lemon lime brand. 2001 Concentrate shipments and equivalents increased 4%. This increase was primarily driven by high single digit growth in Mountain Dew reflecting the introduction of Code Red, strong growth in Sierra Mist and Aquafina, the acquisition of SoBe and the launch of Dole. These gains were partially offset by a low single digit decline in trademark Pepsi, which was mitigated by the successful launch of Pepsi Twist, and a double digit decline in Slice as a result of the introduction of Sierra Mist. Bottler case sales volume increased 4%. The carbonated soft drink portfolio and the acquisition of SoBe each contributed 1 percentage point to both concentrate shipments and equivalents and bottler case sales growth. 28 Table of Contents Growth in net sales of 20% and operating profit of 7% primarily reflects the increased volume and higher effective net pricing. The acquisition of SoBe and our new products Dole, Mountain Dew Code Red, Sierra Mist and Pepsi Twist, accounted for the majority of the revenue growth. SoBe and Dole are sold as finished product to our bottlers. Accordingly, net sales growth was accelerated due to their significantly higher price per unit for these products. The SoBe acquisition contributed 7 percentage points to net sales growth. These gains were partially offset by increased customer support. Operating profit growth was slowed by the increased advertising and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses grew at a significantly faster rate than sales. The SoBe acquisition reduced operating profit growth by 4 percentage points primarily due to brand amortization. Gatorade/Tropicana North America % Change 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 Net sales $3,835 $3,699 $3,514 4 5 Operating profit $590 $585 $554 1 6 2002 Overall volume grew 8% reflecting strong 17% growth in Gatorade products and a 1% decline in Tropicana products. The Gatorade volume growth resulted from new product introductions and the national launch of Propel. Excluding the loss of the single serve Pure Premium business at Burger King, Tropicana volume growth was nearly 1% as gains in Tropicana chilled products, driven by Pure Premium nutritionals and Dole blends, were offset by declines in Tropicana ambient products led by Twister. Net sales increased 4% and operating profit increased 1% primarily due to the volume gains and favorable product mix. The volume gains contributed over 7 percentage points to the net sales growth which were greatly offset by increased promotional spending. The increased promotional spending reflects the competitive marketplace and chilled juice and juice drink category softness. Operating profit benefited from lower costs driven by merger related synergies. 2001 Overall volume grew 4%. This growth was led by three new Gatorade flavors and double digit growth in Tropicana Pure Premium nutritionals, offset by low double digit declines in Tropicana Seasons Best. Net sales increased 5% and operating profit increased 6% due to the volume gains and higher effective net pricing for Gatorade. Operating profit also benefited from lower general and administrative expenses, partially offset by higher advertising and marketing expenses and higher Tropicana manufacturing costs as a result of lower fruit yields, higher energy costs and lower production leverage. 29 Table of Contents PepsiCo Beverages International % Change 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 Net sales $2,036 $2,012 $1,981 1 2 Operating profit $261 $212 $161 23 32 2002 BCS increased 5% reflecting broad based increases led by strong double digit growth in China, India, Turkey and Russia. These advances were partially offset by declines in Argentina due to poor macroeconomic conditions. For the year, total concentrate shipments to franchisees grew 6%, while their BCS grew at a slower rate. Unfavorable foreign currency movements reduced net sales growth by 2 percentage points and operating profit by 7 percentage points as currency weaknesses in Latin America and Egypt were partially offset by stronger currencies in Europe. Net sales increased 1% and operating profit increased 23% due to the volume gains partially offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency movements. We franchised our Gatorade business in certain countries and, as a result, we now sell concentrate as opposed to full goods to bottlers in these countries. The impact of the franchising reduced net sales growth by 2 percentage points. The Gatorade franchising increased operating profit growth by 13 percentage points as a result of prior year operating losses. This growth was partially offset by increases in general and administrative and advertising and marketing expenses. 2001 BCS increased 4.5% due to broad based increases led by Russia, China and Brazil. These increases were partially offset by pricing related declines in Mexico and Saudi Arabia coupled with a macroeconomic decline in Turkey. For the year, total concentrate shipments to franchisees grew 3%, while their BCS grew at about the same rate. Net sales increased 2% and operating profit increased 32% primarily due to the volume gains and higher effective net pricing, partially offset by a net unfavorable foreign currency impact. The net unfavorable foreign currency impact reduced net sales growth by 4.5 percentage points, primarily in Europe, Brazil and Egypt, and reduced operating profit growth by 11 percentage points, primarily in Europe. Overall margin improvements contributed to operating profit growth. 30 Table of Contents Quaker Foods North America % Change 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 Net sales $1,491 $1,466 $1,453 2 1 Operating profit $481 $399 $369 21 8 2002 Pound volume increased 2%. Hot cereals and ready to eat cereals each contributed 1 percentage point of volume growth driven by new product introductions and product news. Growth in net sales of 2% and operating profit of 21% was due to increased cereal volume. In addition, the benefit of productivity, merger related synergies and lower advertising and marketing expense, partially offset by higher oat prices, contributed more than 15 percentage points of the operating profit growth. 2001 Pound volume decreased 1% driven by declines in ready to eat cereals and bulk cornmeal and oats products, largely offset by growth in hot cereals. The hot cereals growth resulted primarily from new products and flavor varieties. Growth in net sales of 1% and operating profit of 8% was primarily due to higher effective net pricing, reflecting a mix shift to higher priced products, and the price increases for cereals which more than offset lower overall volume. 31 Table of Contents Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries Fiscal years ended December 28, 2002, December 29, 2001 and December 30, 2000 (in millions) 2002 2001 2000 Operating Activities Net income $ 3,313 $ 2,662 $ 2,543 Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities Depreciation and amortization 1,112 1,082 1,093 Merger related costs 224 356 Other impairment and restructuring charges 31 184 Cash payments for merger related costs and other restructuring charges (123 ) (273 ) (38 ) Pension plan contributions (820 ) (446 ) (103 ) Bottling equity income, net of dividends (222 ) (103 ) (74 ) Deferred income taxes 288 162 33 Deferred compensation ESOP 48 36 Other noncash charges and credits, net 263 209 303 Changes in operating working capital, excluding effects of acquisitions and dispositions Accounts and notes receivable (260 ) 7 (52 ) Inventories (53 ) (75 ) (51 ) Prepaid expenses and other current assets (78 ) (6 ) (35 ) Accounts payable and other current liabilities 426 (236 ) 219 Income taxes payable 278 394 335 Net change in operating working capital 313 84 416 Other 279 8 (215 ) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 4,627 3,820 4,178 Investing Activities Capital spending (1,437 ) (1,324 ) (1,352 ) Sales of property, plant and equipment 89 57 Acquisitions and investments in noncontrolled affiliates (351 ) (432 ) (98 ) Divestitures 376 33 Short term investments, by original maturity More than three months purchases (62 ) (2,537 ) (4,950 ) More than three months maturities 833 2,078 4,585 Three months or less, net (14 ) (41 ) (9 ) Snack Ventures Europe consolidation 39 Net Cash Used for Investing Activities (527 ) (2,256 ) (1,734 ) (Continued on following page) 32 Table of Contents Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (continued) PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries Fiscal years ended December 28, 2002, December 29, 2001 and December 30, 2000 (in millions) 2002 2001 2000 Financing Activities Proceeds from issuances of long term debt 11 324 130 Payments of long term debt (353 ) (573 ) (879 ) Short term borrowings, by original maturity More than three months proceeds 707 788 198 More than three months payments (809 ) (483 ) (155 ) Three months or less, net 40 (397 ) 1 Cash dividends paid (1,041 ) (994 ) (949 ) Share repurchases common (2,158 ) (1,716 ) (1,430 ) Share repurchases preferred (32 ) (10 ) Quaker share repurchases (5 ) (254 ) Proceeds from reissuance of shares 524 Proceeds from exercises of stock options 456 623 690 Net Cash Used for Financing Activities (3,179 ) (1,919 ) (2,648 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 34 (4 ) Net Increase/(Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents 955 (355 ) (208 ) Cash and Cash Equivalents, Beginning of Year 683 1,038 1,246 Cash and Cash Equivalents, End of Year $ 1,638 $ 683 $ 1,038 See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements. 33 Table of Contents OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our strong cash generating capability and financial condition give us ready access to capital markets throughout the world. Our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows, which are derived from net income. This cash generating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating, investing and financing needs. We focus on management operating cash flow as a key element in achieving maximum shareholder value. Operating Activities In 2002, net cash provided by operating activities of $4.6 billion primarily reflects our solid business results and our emphasis on working capital efficiencies. Net cash provided by operating activities includes pension plan contributions of $820 million and a net tax refund of approximately $250 million in 2002. We expect pension plan contributions to be at a significantly lower level in 2003. In 2001, net cash provided by operating activities of $3.8 billion primarily reflects our solid business results less cash paid for merger related costs and other restructuring charges. Investing Activities In 2002, net cash used in investing activities of $0.5 billion primarily reflects capital spending and acquisitions, primarily the Wotsits brand in the United Kingdom, partially offset by maturities of short term investments of $0.8 billion, and proceeds from the Pepsi Gemex transaction. In 2001, net cash used in investing activities of $2.3 billion primarily reflects capital spending, the acquisition of SoBe and purchases of short term investments of $0.5 billion. Capital spending was $1.4 billion in 2002, $1.3 billion in 2001 and $1.4 billion in 2000. We expect capital spending to continue at a rate of approximately 5.5% to 6% of net sales. Financing Activities In 2002, cash used for financing activities of $3.2 billion primarily reflects share repurchases of $2.2 billion and dividend payments of $1 billion. Our policy is to pay dividends equal to approximately one third of our previous years net income. In 2001, cash used for financing activities of $1.9 billion primarily reflects share repurchases of $1.7 billion and dividend payments of $1.0 billion. These payments were partially offset by the net proceeds of $524 million from the issuance of 13.2 million shares of our repurchased common stock to qualify for pooling of interests accounting treatment in connection with the merger with Quaker. 34 Table of Contents In 2002, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $5 billion over a three year period. In 2003, we expect share repurchases to continue at a level consistent with the years presented. In 2001, subsequent to our merger with Quaker, we repurchased shares of our common stock, as permitted by the emergency and exemptive orders from the Securities and Exchange Commission aimed at facilitating the reopening of the United States equities market on September 17, 2001, following the events of September 11th. Our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2 billion worth of our common stock during the terms of these orders. Repurchases under these orders did not compromise our accounting for the Quaker merger. All prior authorizations for share repurchases had been rescinded as a result of the PepsiCo and Quaker merger. Management Operating Cash Flow Management operating cash flow is the primary measure management uses to monitor cash flow performance. It is not a measure calculated under United States generally accepted accounting principles. We believe capital spending is a recurring and essential use of cash necessary to maintain our operating capabilities. The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities as reflected in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows to our management operating cash flow. 2002 2001 2000 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 4,627 $ 3,820 $ 4,178 Capital spending (1,437 ) (1,324 ) (1,352 ) Sales of property, plant and equipment 89 57 After tax interest and forex 10 87 116 Management operating cash flow $ 3,289 $ 2,583 $ 2,999 Management operating cash flow was used primarily to fund share repurchases and dividend payments. In 2000, management operating cash flow was also used to reduce long term debt. We expect management operating cash flow for fiscal year 2003 to remain strong and at levels consistent with the years presented above. However, see Cautionary Statements for certain factors that may impact our operating cash flows. Credit Ratings Our debt ratings of A1 from Moodys and A from Standard & Poors contribute to our ability to access global capital markets. Each rating is considered a strong investment grade bond rating with strong debt protection measures. These ratings reflect the third highest rankings out of nine tier ranking systems. They reflect our strong operating cash flows and include the impact of the cash flows and debt of our anchor bottlers. We have maintained these healthy ratings since 1989, demonstrating the stability of our operating cash flows. 35 Table of Contents Credit Facilities and Long Term Contractual Commitments See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities and long term contractual commitments. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements It is not our business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements nor is it our policy to issue guarantees to our bottlers, noncontrolled affiliates or third parties. However, certain guarantees were necessary to facilitate the separation of our bottling and restaurant operations from us.

See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements. 38 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions Basis of Presentation Our financial statements include the consolidated accounts of PepsiCo, Inc. and the affiliates that we control. In addition, we include our share of the results of certain other affiliates based on our ownership interest. We do not control these other affiliates as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally less than fifty percent. Our share of the net income of noncontrolled bottling affiliates is reported in our income statement as bottling equity income. See Note 8 for additional information on our noncontrolled bottling affiliates. Our share of other noncontrolled affiliates is included in division operating profit. As a result of changes in the operations of our European snack joint venture, Snack Ventures Europe (SVE), we determined that effective in 2002, consolidation was required. Therefore, SVEs results of operations are consolidated with PepsiCo in 2002. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in December and, as a result, a 53rd week is added every fifth or sixth year. The fiscal year ended December 30, 2000 consisted of fifty three weeks. The impact of the 53rd week and certain other items, such as merger related costs (described in Note 3), the adoption of SFAS 142 (described in Note 4) and the SVE consolidation affect the comparability of our consolidated results. For additional unaudited information on these items, see Our Divisions below and Items Affecting Comparability in Managements Discussion and Analysis. Tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to prior year amounts to conform to the 2002 presentation. Our Divisions 39 Table of Contents We manufacture, market and sell a variety of salty, sweet and grain based snacks, carbonated and noncarbonated beverages, and foods through our North American and international business divisions. Our North American divisions include the United States and Canada. The accounting policies for the divisions are the same as those described in Note 2. Division results are based on how our Chief Executive Officer manages our divisions. Beginning in 2003, we will combine our North American beverage businesses as PepsiCo Beverages North America and our international food and beverage businesses as PepsiCo International to reflect operating and management changes. Merger related costs and significant other impairment and restructuring charges are not included in division results. In addition, prior year division results are adjusted to reflect the adoption of SFAS 142 and consolidation of SVE, and exclude divested businesses. For additional unaudited information on our divisions, see Our Operations in Managements Discussion and Analysis. 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 2000 Net Sales Operating Profit Snacks FLNA $ 8,565 $ 8,216 $ 7,769 $2,216 $2,056 $1,875 FLI 5,713 5,492 5,172 781 651 577 Beverages PCNA 3,365 3,189 2,657 987 881 820 GTNA 3,835 3,699 3,514 590 585 554 PBI 2,036 2,012 1,981 261 212 161 QFNA 1,491 1,466 1,453 481 399 369 Total division 25,005 24,074 22,546 5,316 4,784 4,356 Divested businesses 107 144 145 15 29 36 Corporate (377 ) (371 ) (331 ) 25,112 24,218 22,691 4,954 4,442 4,061 Merger related costs (224 ) (356 ) Other impairment and restructuring charges (31 ) (184 ) Other 2 (17 ) SVE consolidation (706 ) (648 ) (13 ) (16 ) SFAS 142 adoption (23 ) (88 ) 53rd week in 2000 294 62 Total $25,112 $23,512 $22,337 $4,730 $4,021 $3,818 40 Table of Contents Divested Businesses During 2002, we sold our Quaker Foods North America bagged cereal business and our Frito Lay International food businesses in Colombia and Venezuela. A net loss of $5 million was recorded on the sale of these businesses. The net loss and results prior to the divestitures are presented as divested businesses. Prior year division operating results have been reclassified as follows: 2001 2000 2001 2000 Net Sales Operating Profit Frito Lay International $ 44 $ 41 $ 6 $ 6 Quaker Foods North America 100 104 23 30 $144 $145 $29 $36 Corporate Corporate includes costs of our corporate headquarters, centrally managed initiatives, unallocated insurance and benefit programs, foreign exchange transaction gains and losses and certain one time charges. Merger Related Costs See Note 3. Other Impairment and Restructuring Charges We incurred other impairment and restructuring costs for Quakers supply chain reconfiguration and manufacturing and distribution optimization project initiated in 1999. Approximately $14 million of these costs remain payable at December 28, 2002 and $23 million was payable at December 29, 2001. Other This adjustment primarily reflects the reclassification of our prepaid forward contracts. For more unaudited information on these prepaid forward contracts, see Items Affecting Comparability in Managements Discussion and Analysis. The following items are necessary to reconcile division results to consolidated results since, as noted above, division results are presented as managed. SVE Consolidation We have consolidated SVE in 2002. As a result, prior period amounts were adjusted to include SVE for planning and performance measurement purposes as follows: 2001 2000 Frito Lay International net sales $706 $648 Frito Lay International operating profit $14 $17 Corporate $(1 ) $(1 ) 41 Table of Contents SFAS 142 Adoption In 2002, we adopted SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which eliminated amortization of goodwill and perpetual brands, and resulted in an acceleration of the amortization of certain of our other intangibles. See Note 4 for additional information, and the after tax impact. After adoption, prior period division results were adjusted for planning and performance measurement purposes as follows: 2001 2000 Frito Lay International $ 18 $ 32 Pepsi Cola North America (50 ) PepsiCo Beverages International (21 ) (20 ) Gatorade/Tropicana North America 69 69 Quaker Foods North America 7 7 $ 23 $ 88 53rd Week in 2000 Since we manage our results on a fifty two week basis, the impact of the 53rd week in 2000 is excluded as follows: Net Sales Operating Profit Frito Lay North America $164 $40 Frito Lay International 61 10 Pepsi Cola North America 36 13 Gatorade/Tropicana North America 33 5 $294 68 Corporate (6) $62 42 Table of Contents Other Division Information 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 2000 Total Assets Capital Spending Snacks FLNA $ 5,099 $ 4,623 $ 4,282 $ 523 $ 514 $ 524 FLI (a) 5,131 4,321 4,278 337 290 276 Beverages PCNA 1,380 1,325 836 135 70 59 GTNA 4,311 4,078 3,893 232 289 261 PBI 2,144 2,038 2,202 136 95 98 QFNA 1,001 878 917 50 55 95 Total division 19,066 17,263 16,408 1,413 1,313 1,313 Divested businesses 58 80 1 3 3 Corporate (b) 2,072 1,927 1,737 23 8 36 Investments in bottling affiliates 2,336 2,447 2,532 $23,474 $21,695 $20,757 $1,437 $1,324 $1,352 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 2000 Amortization of Intangible Assets Depreciation and Other Amortization Snacks FLNA $ 3 $ 7 $ 7 $399 $377 $374 FLI 27 31 13 219 211 206 Beverages PCNA 70 69 2 69 64 94 GTNA 137 129 118 PBI 37 37 36 81 99 111 QFNA 1 1 1 37 41 49 Total division 138 145 59 942 921 952 Divested businesses 3 4 3 Corporate 29 18 16 SVE consolidation (3 ) (26 ) (25 ) SFAS 142 adoption 23 88 $138 $165 $147 $974 $917 $946 43 Table of Contents 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 2000 Net Sales Long Lived Assets(c) United States $16,588 $15,976 $15,076 $ 9,767 $ 9,439 $ 9,035 Mexico 2,686 2,609 2,404 764 1,065 934 United Kingdom 1,106 954 946 1,529 1,104 1,156 Canada 967 896 866 410 375 367 All other countries 3,765 3,077 3,045 2,750 2,605 2,759 $25,112 $23,512 $22,337 $ 15,220 $ 14,588 $ 14,251 (a) Frito Lay International assets include investments in noncontrolled affiliates, principally Productos SAS, of $145 million in 2002 and $155 million in 2001. (b) Corporate assets consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short term investments primarily held outside the United States and property, plant and equipment. (c) Long lived assets represent net property, plant and equipment, nonamortizable and net amortizable intangible assets and investments in noncontrolled affiliates. Note 2 Our Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue upon delivery to our customers in accordance with written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return. However, our policy for direct store delivery and chilled products is to remove and replace out of date products from store shelves to ensure that our consumers receive the product quality and freshness that they expect. Based on our historical experience with this practice, we have reserved for anticipated out of date product. For additional unaudited information on our revenue recognition and related policies, see Our Critical Accounting Policies in Managements Discussion and Analysis. Sales Incentives and Other Marketplace Spending We offer sales incentives through various programs to our customers, consumers and, for PCNA, directly to certain retailers. Sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction to sales and totaled $5.5 billion in 2002, $4.7 billion in 2001 and $4.3 billion in 2000. These sales incentives include the impact of adopting EITF 01 9, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of the Vendors Products, which reduced 44 Table of Contents our net sales by $3.4 billion in 2001 and $3.1 billion in 2000, with selling, general and administrative expenses reduced by the same amounts. Most of these incentive arrangements have terms of no more than one year. However, we have arrangements, such as fountain pouring rights, which extend up to twelve years. Costs incurred to obtain these rights are expensed over the contract period and the remaining balance of $349 million at December 28, 2002 and $374 million at December 29, 2001 is primarily reported in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For additional unaudited information on our sales incentives, see Our Critical Accounting Policies in Managements Discussion and Analysis. Other marketplace spending includes the costs of advertising and other marketing activities and is reported as selling, general and administrative expenses. Advertising expenses were $1.5 billion in 2002 and $1.7 billion in 2001 and 2000. Deferred advertising costs are not expensed until the year first used and consist of: media and personal service prepayments, promotional materials in inventory, and production costs of future media advertising. Deferred advertising costs of $147 million at year end 2002 and $111 million at year end 2001 are classified as prepaid expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Distribution Costs Distribution costs, including the costs of shipping and handling activities, are reported as selling, general and administrative expenses for direct store delivery distribution systems. For our other distribution systems, these costs are reported in cost of sales. Shipping and handling expenses classified as selling, general and administrative expenses were $2.8 billion in 2002, $2.6 billion in 2001 and $2.5 billion in 2000. Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents are investments with original maturities of three months or less. Commitments and Contingencies We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes and environmental matters, as well as commitments under contractual and other commercial obligations. We recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments when a loss is probable and estimable. For additional information on our commitments and other contractual and commercial obligations, see Note 9. 45 Table of Contents Other Significant Accounting Policies Our other significant accounting policies are disclosed as follows: Income Taxes Note 5 and, for additional unaudited information, see Our Critical Accounting Policies in Managements Discussion and Analysis.

Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets Note 4 and, for additional unaudited information on brands and goodwill, see Our Critical Accounting Policies in Managements Discussion and Analysis. Pending Accounting Changes In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. SFAS 143 addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. It requires that we recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. We currently have no significant asset retirement obligations, and therefore, adoption will have no impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS 146 addresses the accounting and reporting for costs associated with restructuring activities. This new standard changes the timing of the recognition of restructuring charges. Liabilities for restructuring costs will be required to be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than when we commit to the plan. SFAS 146 is effective for restructuring activity initiated after December 31, 2002. Note 3 Our Merger with Quaker On August 2, 2001, we completed our merger with Quaker. Under the terms of the merger agreement, we issued approximately 306 million shares of our common stock in exchange for all the outstanding common stock of Quaker. The merger was accounted for as a tax free transaction and as a pooling of interests. As a result, all prior period consolidated financial statements presented have been restated to include the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of both companies as if they had always been combined. Certain reclassifications were made to conform the presentation of the financial statements, and the fiscal calendar and certain interim reporting policies were also conformed. There were no material transactions between pre merger PepsiCo and Quaker. 46 Table of Contents We have recognized the following costs associated with our merger with Quaker: 2002 2001 Transaction costs $ $117 Integration and restructuring costs 224 239 Total merger related costs $224 $356 After tax $190 $322 Per share $0.11 $0.18 Transaction costs were incurred to complete the merger and consist primarily of fees and expenses for investment bankers, attorneys and accountants, SEC filing fees, stock exchange listing fees and financial printing and other related charges. Integration and restructuring costs represent incremental one time merger related costs. Such costs include consulting fees and expenses, employee related costs, information system integration costs, asset impairments and other costs related to the integration of Quaker. Employee related costs include retirement benefit and severance costs and expenses related to change in control provisions of pre merger employment contracts. As of December 28, 2002, an accrual has been recorded for costs associated with the termination of approximately 1,100 corporate, sales, distribution, manufacturing, research, information technology and marketing employees, a majority of which have occurred. We expect to incur additional costs in 2003 to integrate the two companies. Merger related integration and restructuring reserves are included within accounts payable and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Merger related integration and restructuring reserves: Integration Employee Related Asset Impairment Facility and Other Exit Total 2001 costs $124 $106 $ 1 $ 8 $ 239 Cash payments (80 ) (33 ) (2 ) (115 ) Reclassification to retiree medical/ postemployment liabilities (22 ) (22 ) Other noncash utilization (22 ) (1 ) (2 ) (25 ) Reserves, December 29, 2001 22 51 4 77 2002 costs 90 53 56 25 224 Cash payments (62 ) (43 ) (13 ) (118 ) Reclassification to retiree medical/ postemployment liabilities (7 ) (9 ) (16 ) Other noncash utilization (4 ) (56 ) (10 ) (70 ) Reserves, December 28, 2002 $ 43 $ 48 $ $ 6 $ 97 47 Table of Contents Note 4 Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets Useful Life 2002 2001 2000 Property, plant and equipment, net Land and improvements $ 504 $ 464 Buildings and improvements 20 40 3,119 2,846 Machinery and equipment, including fleet 5 15 9,005 8,135 Construction in progress 767 735 13,395 12,180 Accumulated depreciation (6,005 ) (5,304 ) $ 7,390 $ 6,876 Depreciation expense $929 $843 $840 Amortizable intangible assets, net Brands 5 40 $ 938 $ 869 Other identifiable intangibles 3 15 203 207 1,141 1,076 Accumulated amortization (340 ) (201 ) $ 801 $ 875 Amortization expense $138 $165 $147 Depreciation and amortization are recognized on a straight line basis over an assets estimated useful life. Land is not depreciated and construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service. Amortization for each of the next five years, based on existing intangible assets and 2002 foreign exchange rates, is expected to be $138 million in 2003, $129 million in 2004 and 2005 and $19 million thereafter. No impairment charges resulted from the adoption of SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. Depreciable and amortizable assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. In these circumstances, if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is generally based on discounted future cash flows. Useful lives are periodically evaluated to determine whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate the need to revise the useful lives. For additional unaudited information on our amortizable brand policies, see Our Critical Accounting Policies in Managements Discussion and Analysis. Nonamortizable Intangible Assets Perpetual brands and goodwill are assessed for impairment at least annually to ensure that future cash flows continue to exceed the related book value. A perpetual brand is impaired if its book value exceeds its fair value. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment if the book value of its reporting unit 48 Table of Contents exceeds its fair value. A reporting unit can be a division or business. If the fair value of an evaluated asset is less than its book value, the asset is written down based on its discounted future cash flows to fair value. No impairment charges resulted from the required impairment evaluations in 2002. The change in the book value of nonamortizable intangible assets during 2002 is as follows: Balance, Beginning of Year Acquisitions Translation and Other Balance, End of Year Frito Lay North America Goodwill $ 107 $ $ 2 $ 109 Frito Lay International (a) Goodwill 788 39 109 936 Brands 427 248 45 720 1,215 287 154 1,656 Gatorade/Tropicana North America Goodwill 2,148 1 2,149 Brands 59 59 2,207 1 2,208 PepsiCo Beverages International Goodwill 250 250 Quaker Foods North America Goodwill 187 187 Corporate Pension intangible 8 8 Total goodwill 3,480 39 112 3,631 Total brands 486 248 45 779 Total pension intangible 8 8 $3,966 $287 $165 $4,418 (a) Beginning of year balance includes the impact of consolidating Snack Ventures Europe in 2002 for Frito Lay International. We adopted SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in 2002. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 142, our nonamortizable intangible assets had useful lives ranging from 20 to 40 years.

These operating losses will expire as follows: $0.1 billion in 2003, $2.9 billion between 2004 and 2018 and $0.3 billion may be carried forward indefinitely. In addition, certain tax credits generated in prior periods of approximately $72 million are available to reduce certain foreign tax liabilities through 2011. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. We have not recognized any United States tax expense on undistributed international earnings since we have the intention to reinvest the earnings outside the United States for the foreseeable future. These undistributed earnings are approximately $7.5 billion at December 28, 2002. 51 Table of Contents Analysis of valuation allowances: 2002 2001 2000 Balance, beginning of year $511 $813 $804 (Benefit)/provision (22 ) (300 ) 7 Other (deductions)/additions (2 ) (2 ) 2 Balance, end of year $487 $511 $813 For additional unaudited information on our income tax policies, see Our Critical Accounting Policies in Managements Discussion and Analysis. Note 6 Pension and Retiree Medical Plans Our pension plans cover full time U.S. employees and certain international employees. Benefits are determined based on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings. U.S. employees are also eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements and qualify for retirement benefits. We use a September 30 measurement date. Prior service costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits.

Pension Assets Pension assets include approximately 5.5 million shares of PepsiCo common stock with a market value of $202 million in 2002, and 4.7 million shares with a market value of $227 million in 2001. Our investment policy limits the investment in PepsiCo stock to 10% of the fair value of plan assets. Retiree Medical Cost Trend Rates An average increase of 10% in the cost of covered retiree medical benefits is assumed for 2003. This average increase is then projected to decline gradually to 4.5% in 2007 and thereafter. Generally, our costs are capped at a specified dollar amount, with retirees contributing the remainder. These assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant impact on the retiree medical plan expense and liability. A 1 percentage point change in the assumed health care trend rate would have the following effects: 1% Increase 1% Decrease 2002 service and interest cost components $7 $(6) 2002 benefit liability $37 $(34) 54 Table of Contents Note 7 Employee Stock Options Our stock option program is a broad based program designed to attract and retain talent while creating alignment with the interests of our shareholders. Employees at all levels participate in our stock option program. In addition, members of our Board of Directors receive stock options for their service on our Board. Stock options are granted to employees under the following active plans. SharePower Stock Option Plan (SharePower) SharePower options are awarded to all eligible employees based on annual earnings and tenure, become exercisable after three years and have a 10 year term. SharePower options represent approximately 20% of our annual employee option grants. At year end 2002, 35.1 million shares were available for future awards under SharePower. Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) All senior management and certain middle management are awarded LTIP grants, generally based on a multiple of base salary. LTIP options generally become exercisable at the end of three years and have a 10 year term. Beginning in 2001, the entire award was made in stock options. Prior to 2001, two thirds of the award consisted of stock options with the balance in stock options or paid in cash based on the employees selection. Amounts expensed for expected cash payments were $18 million in 2002 and $37 million in 2001 and 2000. At year end 2002, 36.6 million shares were available for future awards under the LTIP. Stock Option Incentive Plan (SOIP) SOIP options are available to middle management employees based on a multiple of base salary. SOIP options generally become exercisable at the end of three years and have a 10 year term. At year end 2002, 29.3 million shares were available for future awards under the SOIP. Accounting Policy We account for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method rather than the fair value method. Under the intrinsic value method, compensation expense is measured as the excess, if any, of the market value of PepsiCo common stock at the award date over the amount the employee must pay for the stock (exercise price). Our policy is to award stock options with an exercise price equal to the market value at the date of award, and accordingly, no compensation expense is recognized. If the fair value method of accounting had been used, compensation expense would have been recognized over the vesting period of the awards resulting in lower net income and net income per common share as shown below. We have no current plans to change our intrinsic value accounting. 55 Table of Contents We believe there are a number of valuation issues with the fair value method that still need to be resolved as well as potential changes necessary to reconcile international and United States standards. Upon resolution of these matters, we will be better able to consider implementation of the fair value method. 2002 2001 2000 Pro forma impact of fair value method Reported net income $3,313 $2,662 $2,543 Less: fair value impact of employee stock compensation (360 ) (306 ) (200 ) Pro forma net income $2,953 $2,356 $2,343 Earnings per common share Basic as reported $1.89 $1.51 $1.45 Diluted as reported $1.85 $1.47 $1.42 Basic pro forma $1.68 $1.33 $1.34 Diluted pro forma $1.65 $1.30 $1.31 Weighted average Black Scholes fair value assumptions Risk free interest rate 4.4% 4.8% 6.7% Expected life 6 yrs. 5 yrs. 5 yrs.

Note 8 Noncontrolled Bottling Affiliates Our most significant noncontrolled bottling affiliates are The Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG) and PepsiAmericas (PAS). These affiliates account for over 40% of our worldwide bottler case sales. The Pepsi Bottling Group In addition to approximately 38% of PBGs outstanding common stock that we own at year end 2002, we own 100% of PBGs class B common stock and approximately 7% of the equity of Bottling Group, LLC, PBGs principal operating subsidiary. This gives us economic ownership of approximately 42% of PBGs combined operations. PBGs summarized financial information is as follows: 2002 2001 Current assets $ 1,737 $1,548 Noncurrent assets 8,290 6,309 Total assets $10,027 $7,857 Current liabilities $1,248 $1,081 Noncurrent liabilities 6,607 4,856 Minority interest 348 319 Total liabilities $8,203 $6,256 Our investment $1,107 $962 2002 2001 2000 Net sales $9,216 $8,443 $7,982 Gross profit $4,215 $3,863 $3,577 Operating profit $898 $676 $590 Net income $428 $305 $229 57 Table of Contents In December 2002, PBG acquired Pepsi Gemex, a franchise bottler in Mexico, in which we previously held a 34% ownership interest. Under the terms of the agreement, we received the cash tender price for our Pepsi Gemex shares, net of a payment of $17 million to PBG. Including the gain from our net investment hedge, the transaction resulted in an after tax loss of approximately $8 million. The table above includes the results of Pepsi Gemex from the transaction date forward. Our investment in PBG was $118 million higher than our ownership interest in their net assets at year end 2002. Based upon the quoted closing price of PBG shares at year end 2002, the calculated market value of our shares in PBG, excluding our investment in Bottling Group, LLC, exceeded our investment balance by approximately $1.9 billion. PepsiAmericas PepsiAmericas was formed in December 2000 when two of our bottling affiliates, Whitman and PepsiAmericas, merged. At year end 2002, we owned approximately 39% of the combined company. PepsiAmericas summarized financial information is as follows: 2002 2001 Current assets $ 550 $ 481 Noncurrent assets 3,013 2,938 Total assets $3,563 $3,419 Current liabilities $ 698 $ 643 Noncurrent liabilities 1,416 1,346 Total liabilities $2,114 $1,989 Our investment $782 $746 2002 2001 2000 Net sales $3,240 $3,144 $2,511 Gross profit $1,272 $1,232 $1,017 Operating profit $301 $268 $223 Income from continuing operations $136 $90 $72 Net income $130 $19 $80 The above financial information for 2000 includes the results of the former PepsiAmericas after the date of the merger with Whitman. Our investment in PAS was $215 million higher than our ownership interest in their net assets at year end 2002. Based upon the quoted closing price of PAS shares at year end 2002, the calculated market value of our shares in PepsiAmericas was less than our investment balance by approximately $27 million. 58 Table of Contents Related Party Transactions Our significant related party transactions involve our noncontrolled bottling affiliates. We sell concentrate to these affiliates that is used in the production of carbonated soft drinks and noncarbonated beverages. The sale of concentrate is reported net of bottler funding. We also sell certain finished goods to these affiliates and we receive royalties for the use of our trademark for certain products. For further unaudited information on these bottlers, see Our Customers in Managements Discussion and Analysis. These transactions with our bottling affiliates are reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Income as follows: 2002 2001 2000 Net sales $3,455 $2,262 $1,978 Selling, general and administrative expenses $83 $57 $5 As of December 28, 2002, the receivables from these bottling affiliates were $126 million and payables to these affiliates were $122 million. As of December 29, 2001, the receivables from these bottling affiliates were $119 million and payables to these affiliates were $108 million. Such amounts are settled on terms consistent with other trade receivables and payables. See Note 9 regarding our guarantee of certain PBG debt. In addition, we coordinate, on an aggregate basis, the negotiation and purchase of sweeteners and other raw materials requirements for certain of our bottlers with suppliers. Once we have negotiated the contracts, the bottlers order and take delivery directly from the supplier and pay the suppliers directly. Consequently, these transactions are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As the contracting party, we could be liable to these suppliers in the event of any nonpayment by our anchor bottlers, but we consider this exposure to be remote. Note 9 Debt Obligations and Commitments 2002 2001 Short term debt obligations Current maturities of long term debt $ 485 $ 319 Other borrowings (5.7% and 6.4%) 452 410 Amounts reclassified to long term debt (375 ) (375 ) $ 562 $ 354 Long term debt obligations Short term borrowings, reclassified $ 375 $ 375 Notes due 2003 2026 (4.0% and 4.1%) 1,716 1,986 Zero coupon notes, $625 million due 2003 2012 (12.6%) 338 356 Other, due 2003 2015 (7.6% and 6.9%) 243 253 2,672 2,970 Less: current maturities of long term debt obligations (485 ) (319 ) $2,187 $2,651 59 Table of Contents Short term borrowings are reclassified to long term when we have the intent and ability, through the existence of the unused lines of credit, to refinance these borrowings on a long term basis. The weighted average interest rates in the above table include the impact of outstanding interest rate swaps at year end. See Note 10 for additional information on our interest rate swaps. At year end 2002, we maintained $750 million in corporate lines of credit subject to normal banking terms and conditions. These credit facilities support short term debt issuances and remained unused at year end 2002. Of the $750 million, $375 million expires in June 2003 with the remaining $375 million expiring in June 2007. Upon consent of PepsiCo and the lenders, these facilities can be extended an additional year. In addition, $270 million of our debt was outstanding on various lines of credit maintained for our international divisions. These lines of credit are subject to normal banking terms and conditions and are committed to the extent of our borrowings.

Long term contractual commitments, except for our long term debt obligations, are not recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Non cancelable purchasing, capital equipment and marketing commitments are in the normal course of our business for our projected needs. Our non cancelable capital equipment commitments primarily relate to our new concentrate plant in Ireland. As bottler funding is negotiated on an annual basis, these commitments are not reflected in our long term contractual commitments. See Note 8 regarding our commitments to noncontrolled bottling affiliates. 60 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements It is not our business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements nor is it our policy to issue guarantees to our bottlers, noncontrolled affiliates or third parties. However, certain guarantees were necessary to facilitate the separation of our bottling and restaurant operations from us. In connection with these transactions, we have guaranteed $2.3 billion of Bottling Group, LLCs long term debt through 2012 and $68 million of YUM! Brands, Inc. (YUM) outstanding obligations, primarily property leases. The terms of our Bottling Group, LLC debt guarantee are intended to preserve the structure of PBGs separation from us and our payment obligation would be triggered if Bottling Group, LLC failed to perform under these debt obligations or the structure significantly changed. Our guarantees of certain obligations ensured YUMs continued use of these properties. These guarantees would require our cash payment if YUM failed to perform under these lease obligations. Note 10 Risk Management We are exposed to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in: commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and fuel; foreign exchange risks; interest rates on our debt and short term investment portfolios; and stock prices. In the normal course of business, we manage these risks through a variety of strategies, including the use of derivative instruments designated as cash flow and fair value hedges. See Our Market Risks in Managements Discussion and Analysis for further unaudited information on our hedges. For cash flow hedges, changes in fair value are generally deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders equity until the underlying hedged item is recognized in net income. For fair value hedges, changes in fair value are recognized immediately in earnings, consistent with the underlying hedged item. Hedging transactions are limited to an underlying exposure. As a result, any change in the value of our derivative instruments would be substantially offset by an opposite change in the value of the underlying hedged items. Hedging ineffectiveness and a net earnings impact occur when the change in the value of the hedge does not offset the change in the value of the underlying hedged item. We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes and, to manage credit risk, we limit our exposure to individual counterparties. 61 Table of Contents Commodity Prices We are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited in the competitive environment in which we operate. This risk is managed through the use of fixed price purchase orders, pricing agreements, geographic diversity and cash flow hedges. We use cash flow hedges, with terms of no more than two years, to hedge price fluctuations in a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases, primarily for corn, natural gas, oats, packaging materials and wheat. Any ineffectiveness is recorded immediately. However, our commodity hedges have not had any material ineffectiveness. We classify both the earnings and cash flow impact from these hedges consistent with the underlying hedged item. During the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify gains of approximately $4 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net income. Foreign Exchange Our operations outside of the United States generated 34% of our net sales of which Mexico, the United Kingdom and Canada contributed 19%. As a result, we are exposed to foreign currency risks from unforeseen economic changes and political unrest. On occasion, we enter into fair value hedges, primarily forward contracts, to reduce the effect of foreign exchange rates. Ineffectiveness resulting from our fair value hedges was not material to our results of operations. In 2002, we hedged 2.1 billion Mexican pesos related to our net investment in Pepsi Gemex which resulted in a $5 million gain upon our disposal of Pepsi Gemex described in Note 8. Interest Rates We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks, tax consequences and overall financing strategies. We have used interest rate swaps to effectively change the interest rate of specific debt issuances, with the objective of reducing our overall borrowing costs. Late in 2002, we terminated the majority of our interest rate swaps resulting in a gain of approximately $23 million which will be amortized over the remaining term of the related debt. As a result, 12% of our debt at year end 2002 is exposed to variable interest rates compared to approximately 45% at year end 2001. 62 Table of Contents Stock Prices The portion of our deferred compensation liability that is based on our stock price is subject to market risk. We hold prepaid forward contracts to manage this risk. Changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized immediately in earnings and are offset by changes in the related compensation liability. Fair Value All derivative instruments are recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. The fair value of our derivative instruments is generally based on quoted market prices. Book and fair values of our derivative and financial instruments are as follows: 2002 2001 Book Value Fair Value Book Value Fair Value Assets Cash and cash equivalents $1,638 $1,638 $683 $683 Short term investments (a) $207 $207 $966 $966 Forward exchange contracts (b) $2 $2 $6 $6 Commodity contracts (b) $6 $6 $1 $1 Prepaid forward contracts (b) $96 $96 $65 $65 Interest rate swaps (b) $1 $1 $32 $32 Liabilities Forward exchange contracts (c) $3 $3 $2 $2 Commodity contracts (c) $2 $2 $17 $17 Debt obligations $2,749 $3,134 $3,005 $3,270 Included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet under the captions noted above or as indicated below. (a) Includes $82 million at December 28, 2002 and $89 million at December 29, 2001 of mutual fund investments used to manage a portion of market risk arising from our deferred compensation liability. (b) Included within prepaid expenses and other current assets. (c) Included within accounts payable and other current liabilities. This table excludes guarantees, including our guarantee of $2.3 billion of Bottling Group, LLCs long term debt. The guarantee had a fair value of $35 million at December 28, 2002 and $59 million at December 29, 2001 based on an external estimate of the cost to us of transferring the liability to an independent financial institution. See Note 9 for additional information on our guarantees. 63 Table of Contents Note 11 Net Income per Common Share Basic net income per common share is net income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share is calculated using the weighted average of common shares outstanding adjusted to include the effect that would occur if in the money employee stock options were exercised and preferred shares were converted into common shares. Options to purchase 69.4 million shares in 2002, 0.4 million shares in 2001 and 0.1 million shares in 2000 were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because these options were out of the money.

The financial statements were prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and include amounts based upon our estimates and assumptions, as required. The financial statements have been audited by our independent auditors, KPMG LLP, who were given free access to all financial records and related data, including minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors and Committees of the Board. We believe that our representations to the independent auditors are valid and appropriate. Management maintains a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the financial statements, as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition. The system is supported by formal policies and procedures, including an active Code of Conduct program intended to ensure employees adhere to the highest standards of personal and professional integrity. Our internal audit function monitors and reports on the adequacy of and compliance with the internal control system, and appropriate actions are taken to address significant control deficiencies and other opportunities for improving the system as they are identified. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors consists solely of directors who are not salaried employees and who are, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, free from any relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment as a committee member. The Committee meets during the year with representatives of management, including internal auditors and the independent auditors to review our financial reporting process and our controls to safeguard assets. Both our independent auditors and internal auditors have free access to the Audit Committee. Although no cost effective internal control system will preclude all errors and irregularities, we believe our controls as of December 28, 2002 provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements are reliable and that our assets are reasonably safeguarded. /S/ PETER A.

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of PepsiCo, Inc.s management.

We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 28, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
