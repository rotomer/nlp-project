Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The information required by this item is incorporated by reference to Financial Review, which appears on pages 17 25; Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, which appears on pages 32 33; Note 2, Restructuring Program, which appears on pages 33 34; Note 3, Acquisitions and Spin off, which appears on pages 34 35; Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, which appears on page 43; and Note 13, Segment Information, which appears on page 44 of the Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002. The Company has made and will make certain forward looking statements in the Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002 and in other contexts relating to volume and net sales growth, increases in market shares, financial goals and cost reduction, among others. These forward looking statements are based on assumptions and estimates regarding competitive activity, pricing, product introductions, economic conditions, technological innovation, currency movements, governmental action and the development of certain markets. Among the key factors necessary to achieve the Companys goals are: (1) the successful integration of the Companys new organization structure, including achievement of expected cost and tax savings; (2) the ability to achieve business plans, including growing volume profitably, despite high levels of competitive activity, especially with respect to the product categories and geographical markets in which the Company has chosen to focus; (3) the ability to maintain key customer relationships; (4) the achievement of growth in significant developing markets such as China, Turkey, Mexico, the Southern Cone of Latin America, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the countries of Southeast Asia; (5) the ability to successfully manage regulatory, tax and legal matters, including resolution of pending matters within current estimates; (6) the successful and timely execution of planned brand divestitures; (7) the ability to successfully implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans in manufacturing and overhead areas; (8) the ability to successfully manage currency (including currency issues in Latin America), interest rate and certain commodity cost exposures; and (9) the ability to manage the continued political and or economic uncertainty in Latin America and the Middle East, as well as any political and or economic uncertainty due to terrorist activities. If the Companys assumptions and estimates are incorrect or do not come to fruition, or if the Company does not achieve all of these key factors, then the Companys actual performance could vary materially from the forward looking statements made herein. 8 Table of Contents Item 7A.
