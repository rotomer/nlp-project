Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The information required by this item is incorporated by reference to Financial Review, which appears on pages 23 33; Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, which appears on pages 40 42; Note 2, Restructuring Program, which appears on pages 42 43; Note 3, Acquisitions and Spin Off, which appears on pages 43 44 excluding the first paragraph, which is updated by the information on Wella in the third paragraph of Item I of this report; Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, which appears on page 53; and Note 12, Segment Information, which appears on pages 53 54 of the Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003. The Company has made certain forward looking statements in the Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003 and in other contexts relating to volume and net sales growth, increases in market shares, financial goals and cost reduction, among others. These forward looking statements are based on assumptions and estimates regarding competitive activity, pricing, product introductions, economic conditions, customer and consumer trends, technological innovation, currency movements, governmental action and the development of certain markets available at the time the statements are made. Among the key factors necessary to achieve the Companys goals are: (1) the ability to achieve business plans, including growing existing sales and volume profitably and successfully managing and integrating key acquisitions (including Wella) and completing planned divestitures (including a potential sale of the Companys juice business), despite high levels of competitive activity, especially with respect to the product categories and geographical markets (including developing markets) on which the Company has chosen to focus; (2) the ability to manage and maintain key customer relationships; (3) the ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply sources (including sole supplier and plant manufacturing sources); (4) the ability to successfully manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability matters), and to resolve pending matters within current estimates; (5) the ability to successfully implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans in manufacturing and overhead areas, including successful completion of the Companys outsourcing projects; (6) the ability to successfully manage currency (including currency issues in volatile countries), interest rate and certain commodity cost exposures; (7) the ability to manage the continued global political and or economic uncertainty, especially in the Companys significant geographical markets, as well as any political and or economic uncertainty due to terrorist activities; and (8) the ability to successfully manage increases in the prices of raw materials used to make the Companys products. If the Companys assumptions and estimates are incorrect or do not come to fruition, or if the Company does not achieve all of these key factors, then the Companys actual performance could vary materially from the forward looking statements made herein. 7 Table of Contents Item 7A.
