The information required by this item is incorporated by reference to Managements Discussion and Analysis, which appears on pages 29 43; Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, which appears on pages 50 52; Note 2, Restructuring Program, which appears on page 52; Note 3, Acquisitions and Spin Off, which appears on pages 52 54; Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, which appears on page 64; and Note 12, Segment Information, 8 Table of Contents which appears on pages 65 66 of the Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004. The Company has made certain forward looking statements in the Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 and in other contexts relating to volume and net sales growth, increases in market shares, financial goals and cost reduction, among others. These forward looking statements are based on assumptions and estimates regarding competitive activity, pricing, product introductions, economic conditions, customer and consumer trends, technological innovation, currency movements, governmental action and the development of certain markets available at the time the statements are made. Among the key factors that could impact results and must be managed by the Company are: (1) the ability to achieve business plans, including with respect to lower income consumers and growing existing sales and volume profitably despite high levels of competitive activity, especially with respect to the product categories and geographical markets (including developing markets) in which the Company has chosen to focus; (2) successfully executing, managing and integrating key acquisitions (including the Domination and Profit Transfer Agreement with Wella); (3) the ability to manage and maintain key customer relationships; (4) the ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply sources (including sole supplier and plant manufacturing sources); (5) the ability to successfully manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability matters), and to resolve pending matters within current estimates; (6) the ability to successfully implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans in manufacturing and overhead areas, including the success of the Companys outsourcing projects; (7) the ability to successfully manage currency (including currency issues in volatile countries), interest rate and certain commodity cost exposures; (8) the ability to manage the continued global political and or economic uncertainty and disruptions, especially in the Companys significant geographical markets, as well as any political and or economic uncertainty and disruptions due to terrorist activities; (9) the ability to successfully manage increases in the prices of raw materials used to make the Companys products; (10) the ability to stay close to consumers in an era of increased media fragmentation; and (11) the ability to stay on the leading edge of innovation. If the Companys assumptions and estimates are incorrect or do not come to fruition, or if the Company does not achieve all of these key factors, then our actual results might differ materially from the forward looking statements made herein. 9 Table of Contents Item 7A.
