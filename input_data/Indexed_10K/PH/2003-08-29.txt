ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The information set forth on pages 13 2 to 13 9 of Exhibit 13 hereto is incorporated herein by reference. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The Company enters into forward exchange contracts, costless collar contracts and cross currency swap agreements to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in related foreign currencies. The total value of open contracts and 16 any risk to the Company as a result of these arrangements is not material to the Companys financial position, liquidity or results of operations. The Companys debt portfolio contains variable rate debt, inherently exposing the Company to interest rate risk. The Companys objective is to maintain a 60/40 mix between fixed rate and variable rate debt thereby limiting its exposure to changes in near term interest rates. The Company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement for a $200 million notional principal amount. The swap agreement converts a portion of the Companys variable rate debt to a fixed rate through 2004. The agreement is with a major financial institution and the risk of loss is considered remote. The carrying and fair value of this agreement is not material to the Companys financial position, liquidity or results of operations. A one hundred basis point increase in near term interest rates would increase annual interest expense on variable rate debt by approximately $3.0 million. For further discussion see the Significant Accounting Policies Footnote on pages 13 15 to 13 18 of Exhibit 13 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
