ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The information set forth on pages 13 2 to 13 13 of Exhibit 13 to this Annual Report on Form 10 K is incorporated into this section by reference. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The Company enters into forward exchange contracts and costless collar contracts, comprised of puts and calls, to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in both freely convertible and non freely convertible foreign currencies. These contracts are with major financial institutions and the risk of loss is considered remote. None of these contracts were designated as hedging instruments. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The total fair value and carrying amount and any risk to the Company as a result of these arrangements is not material to the Companys financial position, liquidity or results of operations. The Company considers Venezuela to be a highly inflationary economy; therefore, the United States dollar is the functional currency for the Companys Venezuelan operations. The effect of treating Venezuela as a highly inflationary economy did not have a material effect on the Companys results of operations or financial position. The Companys debt portfolio contains variable rate debt, inherently exposing the Company to interest rate risk. The Companys objective is to maintain a 60/40 mix between fixed rate and variable rate debt, thereby limiting its exposure to changes in near term interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in near term interest rates would increase annual interest expense on variable rate debt by approximately $856,370. For further discussion, see the discussion of Significant Accounting Policies Footnote on page 13 22 of Exhibit 13 to this Annual Report on Form 10 K and incorporated into this section by reference.
