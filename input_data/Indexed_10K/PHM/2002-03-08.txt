ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview: A summary of our operating results by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 is as follows ($000s omitted, except per share data): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Pre tax income (loss): Homebuilding operations $ 520,908 $ 392,383 $ 316,561 Financial Services operations 28,331 19,009 20,828 Corporate (57,452 ) (56,296 ) (50,984 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes 491,787 355,096 286,405 Income taxes 189,362 136,712 108,118 Income from continuing operations 302,425 218,384 178,287 Loss from discontinued operations (1,032 ) (29,871 ) (122 ) Net income $ 301,393 $ 188,513 $ 178,165 Per share data assuming dilution: Income from continuing operations $ 6.01 $ 5.18 $ 4.07 Loss from discontinued operations (.02 ) (.71 ) Net income $ 5.99 $ 4.47 $ 4.07 A comparison of pre tax income (loss), for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 is as follows: Pre tax income of our homebuilding business segment increased 33% in 2001 and 24% in 2000. Results in 2001 reflect a 9% increase in average selling price to $225,000 and a 120 basis point improvement in gross margin to 20%. Our 2001 results also reflect five months of the acquired operations of Del Webb Corporation as this merger was completed on July 31, 2001 (please see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Compared to 1999, our 2000 results primarily reflect a 10% increase in domestic average selling price to $206,000 and a 100 basis point improvement in gross margins. Pre tax income of $28,331,000 for our financial services business segment represents an increase of 49% over 2000 due to increased loan originations and secondary marketing gains resulting from a favorable interest rate environment. Del Webbs mortgage operations also contributed to this increase. Pre tax income decreased 9% in 2000 from 1999 to $19,009,000. Pre tax income for 2000 was impacted by competitive market conditions due to higher interest rates early in the year, which reduced profitability. Results for 1999 also reflect a net gain of approximately $1,700,000 in connection with the sale of the mortgage backed securities by Pulte Financial Companies, Inc., one of our subsidiaries. Pre tax loss of our corporate business segment increased $1,156,000 in 2001 from $56,296,000 in 2000 as an increase in net interest expense, primarily due to the inclusion of Del Webbs debt, was partially offset by lower Corporate expenditures. In 2000, our pre tax loss increased $5,312,000 from $50,984,000 in 1999 reflecting an increase in net interest expense. 15 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding Operations: Our homebuilding operations are organized into two distinct business units: Domestic and International. Domestic Homebuilding operations are conducted in 43 markets, located throughout 25 states. Domestic Homebuilding offers a broad product line to meet the needs of the first time, first and second move up, and active adult homebuyers. International Homebuilding operations are conducted through subsidiaries of Pulte International Corporation in Mexico, Puerto Rico and Argentina. International Homebuilding product offerings focus on the demand of first time buyers, and social interest housing in Mexico and Puerto Rico. Housing for middle to upper income consumer groups is also available in Puerto Rico and Argentina. We have agreements in place with multi national corporations to provide social interest housing in Mexico. Certain operating data relating to our homebuilding operations and our joint ventures are as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Pulte/Pulte affiliate homebuilding settlement revenues: Domestic $ 5,145,526 $ 4,083,816 $ 3,713,332 International 215,790 175,957 127,310 Total Homebuilding $ 5,361,316 $ 4,259,773 $ 3,840,642 Pulte/Pulte affiliate settlements units: Domestic: Pulte 22,915 19,799 19,569 Pulte affiliated entity 279 Total Domestic 22,915 19,799 19,848 International: Pulte 221 264 262 Pulte affiliated entities 7,258 7,718 6,512 Total International 7,479 7,982 6,774 Total Pulte/Pulte affiliate settlements units 30,394 27,781 26,622 16 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding Operations (continued): Domestic Homebuilding: The Domestic Homebuilding business unit represents our core business. Operations are conducted in 43 markets, located throughout 25 states, and are organized into five groups as follows: Northeast: Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia Southeast: Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee Midwest: Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio Central: Colorado, Texas West: Arizona, California, Nevada The metropolitan Atlanta market accounted for 10% of the total unit settlements in 2000. No other individual market represented more than 10% of total Domestic Homebuilding net new orders, unit settlements or revenues during the three years ended December 31, 2001. The following table presents selected unit information for our Domestic Homebuilding operations: Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Unit settlements: Northeast 2,014 2,000 2,486 Southeast 8,126 7,820 7,607 Midwest 3,288 2,903 3,044 Central 3,982 3,622 3,337 West 5,505 3,454 3,095 22,915 19,799 19,569 Net new orders units: Northeast 2,035 1,970 2,511 Southeast 8,544 7,815 7,920 Midwest 3,756 2,818 3,166 Central 4,071 3,644 2,956 West 7,710 3,597 2,814 26,116 19,844 19,367 Net new orders dollars ($000s omitted) $ 5,926,000 $ 4,211,000 $ 3,784,000 Backlog at December 31 units: Northeast 831 810 840 Southeast 2,559 2,141 2,146 Midwest 1,375 907 992 Central 903 814 792 West 3,010 805 662 8,678 5,477 5,432 Backlog at December 31 dollars ($000s omitted) $ 2,118,000 $ 1,307,000 $ 1,180,000 17 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding Operations (continued): Domestic Homebuilding (continued): Net new orders increased for the thirteenth consecutive year to an all time record of 26,116 units in 2001, a 32% increase over 2000 order levels. This increase is primarily due to the inclusion of Del Webbs operations, which contributed 5,968 units, including an acquired backlog of 3,823 units. Order growth in the Central and West groups offset by softer performance in the Northeast and Midwest groups contributed to a 2% increase in 2000 orders over 1999 levels. Unit settlements in 2001 also hit a record setting high, to 22,915 units with the majority of the increase due to the inclusion of Del Webbs operations, which contributed 2,797 units. Unit settlement activity in 2000 increased 1% over 1999 levels reflecting strong performance in the Southeast, Central and West groups offset by a decline in the Northeast. The average home sales price increased from $187,000 in 1999 to $206,000 in 2000 and to $225,000 in the current year. Changes in average selling price reflect a number of factors, including price increases, the mix of product closed during a period and the number of options purchased by customers. 2001 benefited from increased product prices, improved product mix and the inclusion of Del Webb product offerings, which had an average selling price of $264,000. Ending backlog, which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed, jumped 58% to 8,678 homes, including 3,171 Del Webb units, while the dollar value was up 62% to $2.1 billion at December 31, 2001. Unit backlog at December 31, 2000, was slightly higher than that noted at the end of 1999 while the dollar value was up 11%. Overall, strong demand supported by a favorable interest rate environment and the addition of Del Webbs operations drove increased order activity and record levels of backlog. The following table presents a summary of pre tax income for our Domestic Homebuilding operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Home sale revenue (settlements) $ 5,145,526 $ 4,083,816 $ 3,655,775 Land sale revenue 129,134 84,700 33,480 Home cost of sales (4,118,442 ) (3,315,106 ) (3,003,504 ) Land cost of sales (97,941 ) (56,250 ) (25,697 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (482,128 ) (365,704 ) (314,463 ) Interest (36,006 ) (28,019 ) (25,187 ) Other expense, net (16,851 ) (14,403 ) (9,381 ) $ 523,292 $ 389,034 $ 311,023 Average sales price $ 225 $ 206 $ 187 We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories and charge the interest to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. 18 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding Operations (continued): Domestic Homebuilding (continued): Gross profit margins in 2001 increased 120 basis points over 2000 to 20.0%, including the effect of purchase accounting associated with the Del Webb merger. Excluding the effect of purchase accounting, gross margins in 2001 would have been 20.2%. Gross profit margins in 2000 increased to 18.8%, up 100 basis points over 1999. Factors that contributed to this favorable trend include strong customer demand, positive home pricing, the benefits of leverage buy purchasing activities and effective production and inventory management. Land sales increased over each of the prior three years representing our land development core competency which includes development and entitlement of certain land positions for sale primarily to other homebuilders, as well as to retail and commercial establishments. Revenues and their related gains/losses may vary significantly between periods, depending on the timing of future land sales. We continue to rationalize certain existing land positions to ensure the most effective use of invested capital. For the year ended December 31, 2001, selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA), as a percentage of home settlement revenues, increased 42 basis points to 9.37% after increasing 35 basis points to 8.95% in 2000. Higher startup costs for new communities, increased compensation related costs, local market advertising expenses and the inclusion of Del Webbs operations are the primary reasons for the increase in 2001. The increase in 2000 reflects higher sales and marketing expenses, and startup costs associated with the opening of new communities. Other expense, net increased to $16,851,000 in 2001 as a result of increased land inventory valuation reserves for certain land positions and amortization of tradenames and trademarks acquired in the merger with Del Webb. The increase from 1999 to 2000 represents an increase in various market level non operational expenditures. Our Domestic Homebuilding operations controlled approximately 116,000 and 74,900 lots, of which approximately 81,200 and 40,800 lots were owned, and approximately 34,800 and 34,100 lots were controlled through option agreements at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Domestic Homebuilding inventory at December 31, 2001, was approximately $3.7 billion of which $2.8 billion is related to land and land development. At December 31, 2000, inventory was approximately $1.8 billion of which $1.3 billion was related to land and land development. Included in other assets is approximately $223.5 million in land held for disposition as of December 31, 2001, as compared to $88.3 million in the prior year. International Homebuilding: International Homebuilding operations are primarily conducted through subsidiaries of Pulte International Corporation (International) in Mexico, Puerto Rico and Argentina. Mexico Internationals 100% owned subsidiary, Pulte International Mexico, Inc., conducts its operations primarily through five joint ventures located throughout Mexico. Its net investment in these joint ventures approximated $47.7 million at December 31, 2001. The largest of these ventures, Condak Pulte S. De R.L. De C.V. (Condak Pulte), is based in Cuidad Juarez. Condak Pulte is currently developing communities in Juarez, Chihuahua, Nuevo Laredo, Monterrey, Reynosa, Saltillo and Matamoros, under agreements with Delphi Automotive Systems, Gigante, S.A. de C.V. and Centro Comerciales Soriana, S.A. De C. V. As of December 31, 2001, Internationals net investment in Condak Pulte approximated $38.9 million. Desarrollos Residenciales Turisticos, S.A. de C.V., another of its joint ventures in Mexico, is constructing primarily social interest housing in Central Mexico. Current development plans for this venture include housing projects in the Bajio region surrounding Mexico City, targeting the cities of Celaya, Leon, Puebla, Queretaro, San Jose du Iturbide and San Juan del Rio. At December 31, 2001, Internationals net investment in this joint venture approximated $7.2 million. Effective January 1, 2002, Pulte International reorganized its structure within Mexico to create a single company, Pulte Mexico, which ranks as one of the largest builders in the country. The new operating structure will facilitate growth, enable operating leverage and improve efficiencies through standardized systems and procedures. The new company, which combines several entities, including Condak Pulte and DRT, will be consolidated into our financial statements. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding Operations (continued): International Homebuilding (continued): Puerto Rico Operations in Puerto Rico are primarily conducted through Internationals 100% owned subsidiary, Pulte International Caribbean Corporation. Desarrolladores Urbanos (Canovanas), S.E., its Puerto Rican joint venture, is developing 121 acres located in Metropolitan San Juan. At December 31, 2001, its net investment in this joint venture approximated $3.8 million. Argentina Operations in Argentina are conducted through Pulte SRL, Internationals 100% owned Argentine subsidiary which recorded its first closings during the second quarter of 2001. The following table presents selected financial data for Pultes International Homebuilding operations for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Revenues $ 35,169 $ 27,159 $ 21,941 Cost of sales (30,937 ) (24,611 ) (20,337 ) Selling, general and administrative expense (11,820 ) (5,621 ) (4,588 ) Other income, net 66 967 2,522 Equity in income of Mexico operations 5,138 5,455 6,000 Pre tax income (loss) $ (2,384 ) $ 3,349 $ 5,538 Unit settlements: Pulte 221 264 262 Pulte affiliated entities 7,258 7,718 6,512 7,479 7,982 6,774 Increased revenues in 2001 are due to the opening of operations in Argentina and a higher average selling price for our Puerto Rican operations. The higher average selling price in Puerto Rico, which results from concentrating more in middle market housing than in social interest housing, was offset by a decrease in closings from 264 in 2000 to 176 in 2001. Increased revenues in 2000 from 1999 are also attributable to this shift in focus. Results in 1999 benefited from a $2,400,000 land sale gain. SGA expense increased $6,199,000 in 2001 as a result of the start up of the Argentine operations. The Argentine operations recorded a $463,000 foreign currency transaction loss in 2001 as a result of the Argentine governments decision to de link the valuation of the Argentine peso from the U. S. dollar. We also recorded a foreign currency translation loss of $14,110,000, net of income taxes of $8,833,000, as a component of other comprehensive income in 2001. It is unclear at this time how the Argentine financial and currency markets will be affected in 2002. It is also unclear how the current economic situation may affect customer homebuying attitudes and the homebuilding business in general. In 2001, the Mexican operations were affected by changes in government lending practices, which slowed mortgage funding, resulting in lower closings than in 2000. It is anticipated that the rate of mortgage funding in Mexico will accelerate in 2002, which should increase the pace of closings over what was experienced in 2001. Our Mexican joint venture operations recorded 7,718 closings in 2000, representing a 19% increase over comparable 1999 results. Our share of pre tax income of $5,455,000 for 2000 for the Mexican joint ventures was slightly lower than the $6,000,000 recorded in 1999 as earnings in 1999 included currency gains of $1,702,000 versus currency losses of $78,000 for 2000. Currency losses in Mexico amounted to $378,000 in 2001. Eliminating the impact of the currency gains and losses, operating income for our Mexican operations increased by approximately 29% in 2000. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Financial Services Operations: We conduct our financial services operations principally through Pulte Mortgage Corporation (PMC), our mortgage banking subsidiary and during 1999, through Pulte Financial Companies, Inc. (PFCI). Pre tax income of our financial services operations is as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Pre tax income: Mortgage banking $ 28,331 $ 19,009 $ 19,017 Financing activities 1,811 Pre tax income $ 28,331 $ 19,009 $ 20,828 Mortgage Banking: Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Total originations: Loans 19,018 13,415 13,728 Principal $ 2,937,100 $ 1,957,300 $ 1,908,200 Originations for Pulte customers: Loans 13,786 11,109 10,858 Principal $ 2,131,000 $ 1,697,600 $ 1,558,400 We sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts. Due to the short period of time the servicing rights are held, usually three to four months, we do not amortize the servicing asset. Since the servicing rights are recorded at the value in the servicing sales contracts, there are no impairment issues related to these assets. We also originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various credit arrangements, and then sell such mortgage loans to outside investors. Mortgage origination principal volume for the year ended December 31, 2001, increased 50% over 2000, which benefited from an increase in the capture rate of 400 basis points to 60%, an increased average loan size and the inclusion of Del Webbs mortgage operations, which accounted for approximately 13% of the increase. Origination unit volume increased 42% due to the same factors. Mortgage origination principal volume in 2000 increased 3% over 1999, due to increases in year to date unit sales and higher average selling prices realized in our Domestic Homebuilding operations. However, the number of loans for 2000 was down 2% from 1999 levels due to competitive market conditions and rising mortgage interest rates during the last six months of 1999 and first three quarters of 2000. Our home buying customers continue to account for the majority of total loan production, representing 79% of total PMC unit production for 2001, compared with 83% in 2000 and 79% in 1999. Refinancings represented 10% of total loan production in 2001, compared with 2% in 2000 and 4% during 1999. At December 31, 2001, loan application backlog increased 54% to $827 million as compared to $536 million and $499 million at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. 21 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Financial Services Operations (continued): Mortgage Banking (continued): Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2001, increased 49% to $28.3 million, due to increases in volume, capture rate and secondary marketing gains. The addition of Del Webbs mortgage operations for the last five months of 2001 contributed approximately 8% of this increase. Pricing and marketing gains increased $17.4 million, or 71%, from the same period in 2000, primarily due to a consistent drop in interest rates throughout 2001. As compared with 2000, net interest income increased $3.1 million to $5.0 million during 2001 due to increased production and a steeper yield curve as a result of the drop in interest rates during 2001. Offsetting these gains was an increase in SGA expenses of $10 million as a result of increased headcount and other related costs due to the increase in volume during 2001. Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2000, was unchanged from 1999, as increases in origination fees and other income were offset by decreases in pricing and marketing gains and net interest income. During 2000, origination fees increased $1.6 million, or 23%, over the prior year due primarily to an increase in brokered loans. Pricing and marketing gains decreased $3.6 million, or 13%, from the same period in 1999, primarily due to competitive market conditions for much of 2000. As compared with 1999, net interest income decreased 17% to $1.8 million during 2000 as a result of a drop in funded production and a higher cost of funds due to a new warehouse line that became effective March 31, 2000. During 2000, we recognized increased equity income from our minority interest in a Mexican mortgage banking company, and also recognized income from mortgage reinsurance operations. Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, requires companies to recognize all of their derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship, and further, on the type of hedging relationship. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company must designate the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. We hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed mortgage loans with derivative financial instruments. For the year ended December 31, 2001, we did not recognize any net gains or losses related to the ineffective portion of the hedging instrument excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We also did not recognize any gains or losses during 2001, for cash flow hedges that were discontinued because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur. At December 31, 2001, we expect to reclassify $592,000, net of taxes, of net losses on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next twelve months from sales of closed mortgage loans. Financing Activities: Our secured financing operations, which were conducted by a limited purpose subsidiary of PFCI, ceased operations during 1999. During the first quarter of 1999, we recognized a net gain of approximately $1.7 million in connection with the sale of its remaining mortgage backed securities portfolio. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Corporate: Corporate is a non operating business segment whose primary purpose is to support the operations of our subsidiaries as the internal source of financing, to develop and implement strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies, and to provide the administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity. As a result, the corporate segments operating results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve. The following table presents this segments results of operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Net interest expense $ 34,261 $ 28,987 $ 22,824 Other corporate expenses, net 23,191 27,309 28,160 Loss before income taxes $ 57,452 $ 56,296 $ 50,984 An increase in net interest expense offset by a decrease in other corporate expenses, net, resulted in a 2% increase in the net loss for the Corporate segment. The increase in the corporate net interest spread, which is net of interest capitalized into inventory, is attributable to a higher debt balance as a result of the Del Webb merger and the issuance in February 2001 of $200 million and in August 2001 of $500 million in Senior Notes, primarily for use in repaying certain indebtedness acquired from Del Webb (see Del Webb Merger). The decrease in other corporate expenses, net in 2001 is primarily due to the effect of the write down of a commercial land position in 2000. The increase in 2000 of the pre tax loss to $56.3 million was primarily a result of an increase in net interest expense. Increases in net interest expense were attributed to higher average use of our unsecured revolving credit facility in addition to the April 2000 issuance of $175 million Senior Notes. Interest incurred for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, excluding interest incurred by our financial services operations, was approximately $116.9, $62.8 and $49.5 million, respectively. Corporate net interest expense is net of amounts capitalized into homebuilding inventories. Interest is amortized to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. Interest in inventory at December 31, 2001, increased primarily as a result of higher levels of indebtedness and the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Information related to Corporate interest capitalized into inventory is as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Interest in inventory at beginning of year $ 24,202 $ 19,092 $ 16,356 Interest capitalized 80,399 33,129 27,923 Interest expensed (36,006 ) (28,019 ) (25,187 ) Interest in inventory at end of year $ 68,595 $ 24,202 $ 19,092 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources: Continuing Operations: Our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2001, was $418,796,000 as higher net income was offset by increases in inventory and residential mortgage loans available for sale over 2000 and the resolution of the First Heights litigation. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2001 increased primarily due to the net cash acquired from Del Webb. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $297,131,000 as proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes of $200 million and $500 million, and increased borrowings under the revolving credit arrangements, were offset by the repayment of debt acquired from Del Webb (see Del Webb Merger). Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2000, amounted to $23,322,000. Increases in inventory, other assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities during 2000 were less than during 1999, and were offset by a larger increase in residential mortgage loans available for sale. Net cash used in investing activities was $5,185,000 for 2000. The effects of PFCIs sale of the underlying collateral of its mortgage backed securities portfolio and the purchase of BREs interest in the net assets of our active adult joint venture are reflected in 1999. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2000, was $114,051,000, as compared to a use of cash of $87,642,000 in 1999. These increased cash flows primarily reflect our issuance of $175 million Senior Notes in April 2000 and issuance of common stock pursuant to our employee stock option plans, offset by stock repurchases. We finance homebuilding land acquisition, development and construction activities from internally generated funds and existing credit agreements. We had $110 million outstanding under our $560 million unsecured revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2001. PMC provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available through various committed and uncommitted credit arrangements which, at December 31, 2001, amounted to $450 million, an amount deemed adequate to cover foreseeable needs. There were approximately $410 million of borrowings outstanding under the PMC arrangements at December 31, 2001. Mortgage loans originated by PMC are subsequently sold. We anticipate that there will be adequate mortgage financing available for purchasers of our homes. In February 2001, we sold $200 million of 8 1/8% Senior Notes, due 2011 from an active $500 million shelf registration. The net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes were used to repay short term borrowings under our revolving bank credit arrangements and for general corporate purposes. In August 2001, we sold in a private placement, $500 million of 7 7/8% Senior Notes due in 2011 and subsequently filed an S 4 Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in December 2001. Net proceeds received from the sale were used to repay certain indebtedness acquired in the Del Webb transaction, to pay certain expenses associated with that transaction and for general corporate purposes. Our income tax liabilities are affected by a number of factors. In 2001, our effective tax rate was 38.50% compared to 38.50% in 2000 and 37.75% in 1999. Our lower effective income tax rate in 1999 resulted from a lower effective state tax rate and the favorable resolution of various state income tax matters. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2002 will be approximately 39%. At December 31, 2001, we had cash and equivalents of $72.1 million and total long term indebtedness of $1.7 billion. Our total long term indebtedness includes $1.4 billion of unsecured Senior Notes, $368.6 million of unsecured Senior Subordinated Notes, other limited recourse debt of $15 million and other non recourse short term notes payable of $60.7 million. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related project. If the obligations related to the project are ongoing, annual extensions are granted on a year to year basis. Performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These bonds, which approximated $775 million at December 31, 2001, are typically outstanding over a period that approximates 3 5 years. In the normal course of business, we acquire rights under options or option type agreements to purchase land to be used in homebuilding operations at future dates. These rights, which may be cancelled at our discretion, may extend over several years and are typically secured by small deposits. Further, these rights are frequently extended or renegotiated to better match the needs of our homebuilding operations. The total purchase price applicable to approved land under option for use by our homebuilding operations at future dates approximated $1.1 billion at December 31, 2001, which represented approximately 35,000 lots. In addition, there were approximately 25,000 lots valued at $644 million under option at December 31, 2001, pending approval, that are under review and evaluation for future use by our homebuilding operations. Sources of our working capital at December 31, 2001, include our cash and equivalents, our $560 million committed unsecured revolving credit facilities and PMCs $450 million revolving credit facilities. Our debt to total capitalization, excluding our non guarantor asset secured borrowings, was 44.8% as of December 31, 2001. We expect to manage our debt to total capitalization to the 40% level by the end of 2002. It is our intent to exercise, over time, the early call provisions of the Senior Subordinated Notes issued by Del Webb, as allowed under these notes. We routinely monitor current operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate the use of available financial sources, including securities offerings. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): Del Webb Merger: On July 31, 2001, we merged with Del Webb Corporation as discussed in Note 3 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. At closing, we paid off and cancelled Del Webbs revolving credit facility, which had a balance outstanding of approximately $300 million at closing. Under the terms of Del Webbs $100 million, 9 3/4%, due 2003, Senior Subordinated Notes, we exercised our option to redeem the entire bond issuance at par during the third quarter of 2001. Under the terms of Del Webbs other Senior Subordinated Notes, we were required, as a result of the change in control, to offer to purchase four series of its Senior Subordinated Notes. As of December 31, 2001, we had repurchased, through tender offers and open market purchases, $127 million of these Notes. Under the terms of Del Webbs $150 million 9 3/4%, due 2008, Senior Subordinated Notes, we exercised our optional right to redeem the remaining outstanding balance of $122 million at the price stipulated in the indenture by placing with the trustee as of December 31, 2001, sufficient proceeds to satisfy a January 15, 2002, final payoff. Inflation: We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation also increases our financing, labor and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices. To date, inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies: The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements, giving due regard to materiality. Inventory valuation: Our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated cost or net realizable value. Included in inventories are all direct development costs. We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories and charge the interest to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. This period increased in 2001 due to the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated cost, unless they are determined to be impaired, in which case these inventories are measured at fair value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory adjustments may be required. Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis or on a relative sales value basis as cost of sales. Under the specific identification basis, units are assigned an average cost by project based on actual costs to date plus the estimated cost of completion. Units costed using the relative sales value basis are assigned cost based on the sales value of the unit in relation to the total estimated sales value of the project. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued): Goodwill and Intangible Assets: Goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed by management for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $467 million at the end of 2001, which represented 8% of total assets. The majority of these assets resulted from the acquisition of Del Webb in 2001. Del Webb has a long history of operating success and profitability, has well recognized brand names and holds a significant position in the active adult market which should continue in the future. The integration of Del Webb should enable the combined businesses to accelerate the pace of land absorptions, enhance the visibility of the Del Webb and Sun City brand names and obtain the synergies of enhanced purchasing leverage, complementary product offerings and combined operations in the future. Changes in strategy and or market conditions could impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our long term debt to the extent long term rates decline. The following tables set forth, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, our long term debt obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value ($000s omitted).

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) PMC, operating as a mortgage banker, is also subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed upon terms (i.e., commits to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2001 and 2000, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float. We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to the Federal Funds rate and (ii) hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments with off balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in long term mortgage rates of plus 50, 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results. Our aggregate net equity investment in Mexico approximated $61.1 million at December 31, 2001. This investment, which is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk, could devalue by as much as $10 million in 2002, assuming a hypothetical 18% annualized devaluation of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar during 2002. Our aggregate net investment in Argentina approximated $20.1 million at December 31, 2001. This investment is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. It is unclear at this time how the Argentine financial and currency markets will be affected in 2002 as a result of the Argentine governments decision to de link the valuation of the Argentine peso from the U. S. dollar. It is therefore unclear what effect this may have on the continuing value of our investment in Argentina. SPECIAL NOTES CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS As a cautionary note, except for the historical information contained herein, certain matters discussed in Item 7., Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such matters involve risks and uncertainties, including: our exposure to certain market risks, changes in economic conditions, tax and interest rates, increases in raw material and labor costs, issues and timing surrounding land entitlement and development, weather conditions, government regulations and environmental matters, as well as, general competitive factors, that may cause actual results to differ materially; and our ability to integrate the recently acquired business operations of Del Webb Corporation, including Del Webbs activities, management and corporate culture, with our own, and our ability to develop and manage large scale active adult communities which differ from our historical homebuilding business. 28 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding Operations: Our homebuilding operations are organized into two distinct business units: Domestic and International. Domestic Homebuilding operations are conducted in 43 markets, located throughout 25 states. Domestic Homebuilding offers a broad product line to meet the needs of the first time, first and second move up, and active adult homebuyers. International Homebuilding operations are conducted through subsidiaries of Pulte International Corporation in Mexico, Puerto Rico and Argentina. International Homebuilding product offerings focus on the demand of first time buyers, and social interest housing in Mexico and Puerto Rico. Housing for middle to upper income consumer groups is also available in Puerto Rico and Argentina. We have agreements in place with multi national corporations to provide social interest housing in Mexico. Certain operating data relating to our homebuilding operations and our joint ventures are as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Pulte/Pulte affiliate homebuilding settlement revenues: Domestic $ 5,145,526 $ 4,083,816 $ 3,713,332 International 215,790 175,957 127,310 Total Homebuilding $ 5,361,316 $ 4,259,773 $ 3,840,642 Pulte/Pulte affiliate settlements units: Domestic: Pulte 22,915 19,799 19,569 Pulte affiliated entity 279 Total Domestic 22,915 19,799 19,848 International: Pulte 221 264 262 Pulte affiliated entities 7,258 7,718 6,512 Total International 7,479 7,982 6,774 Total Pulte/Pulte affiliate settlements units 30,394 27,781 26,622 16 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding Operations (continued): Domestic Homebuilding: The Domestic Homebuilding business unit represents our core business. Operations are conducted in 43 markets, located throughout 25 states, and are organized into five groups as follows: Northeast: Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia Southeast: Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee Midwest: Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio Central: Colorado, Texas West: Arizona, California, Nevada The metropolitan Atlanta market accounted for 10% of the total unit settlements in 2000. No other individual market represented more than 10% of total Domestic Homebuilding net new orders, unit settlements or revenues during the three years ended December 31, 2001. The following table presents selected unit information for our Domestic Homebuilding operations: Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Unit settlements: Northeast 2,014 2,000 2,486 Southeast 8,126 7,820 7,607 Midwest 3,288 2,903 3,044 Central 3,982 3,622 3,337 West 5,505 3,454 3,095 22,915 19,799 19,569 Net new orders units: Northeast 2,035 1,970 2,511 Southeast 8,544 7,815 7,920 Midwest 3,756 2,818 3,166 Central 4,071 3,644 2,956 West 7,710 3,597 2,814 26,116 19,844 19,367 Net new orders dollars ($000s omitted) $ 5,926,000 $ 4,211,000 $ 3,784,000 Backlog at December 31 units: Northeast 831 810 840 Southeast 2,559 2,141 2,146 Midwest 1,375 907 992 Central 903 814 792 West 3,010 805 662 8,678 5,477 5,432 Backlog at December 31 dollars ($000s omitted) $ 2,118,000 $ 1,307,000 $ 1,180,000 17 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding Operations (continued): Domestic Homebuilding (continued): Net new orders increased for the thirteenth consecutive year to an all time record of 26,116 units in 2001, a 32% increase over 2000 order levels. This increase is primarily due to the inclusion of Del Webbs operations, which contributed 5,968 units, including an acquired backlog of 3,823 units. Order growth in the Central and West groups offset by softer performance in the Northeast and Midwest groups contributed to a 2% increase in 2000 orders over 1999 levels. Unit settlements in 2001 also hit a record setting high, to 22,915 units with the majority of the increase due to the inclusion of Del Webbs operations, which contributed 2,797 units. Unit settlement activity in 2000 increased 1% over 1999 levels reflecting strong performance in the Southeast, Central and West groups offset by a decline in the Northeast. The average home sales price increased from $187,000 in 1999 to $206,000 in 2000 and to $225,000 in the current year. Changes in average selling price reflect a number of factors, including price increases, the mix of product closed during a period and the number of options purchased by customers. 2001 benefited from increased product prices, improved product mix and the inclusion of Del Webb product offerings, which had an average selling price of $264,000. Ending backlog, which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed, jumped 58% to 8,678 homes, including 3,171 Del Webb units, while the dollar value was up 62% to $2.1 billion at December 31, 2001. Unit backlog at December 31, 2000, was slightly higher than that noted at the end of 1999 while the dollar value was up 11%. Overall, strong demand supported by a favorable interest rate environment and the addition of Del Webbs operations drove increased order activity and record levels of backlog. The following table presents a summary of pre tax income for our Domestic Homebuilding operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Home sale revenue (settlements) $ 5,145,526 $ 4,083,816 $ 3,655,775 Land sale revenue 129,134 84,700 33,480 Home cost of sales (4,118,442 ) (3,315,106 ) (3,003,504 ) Land cost of sales (97,941 ) (56,250 ) (25,697 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (482,128 ) (365,704 ) (314,463 ) Interest (36,006 ) (28,019 ) (25,187 ) Other expense, net (16,851 ) (14,403 ) (9,381 ) $ 523,292 $ 389,034 $ 311,023 Average sales price $ 225 $ 206 $ 187 We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories and charge the interest to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. 18 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding Operations (continued): Domestic Homebuilding (continued): Gross profit margins in 2001 increased 120 basis points over 2000 to 20.0%, including the effect of purchase accounting associated with the Del Webb merger. Excluding the effect of purchase accounting, gross margins in 2001 would have been 20.2%. Gross profit margins in 2000 increased to 18.8%, up 100 basis points over 1999. Factors that contributed to this favorable trend include strong customer demand, positive home pricing, the benefits of leverage buy purchasing activities and effective production and inventory management. Land sales increased over each of the prior three years representing our land development core competency which includes development and entitlement of certain land positions for sale primarily to other homebuilders, as well as to retail and commercial establishments. Revenues and their related gains/losses may vary significantly between periods, depending on the timing of future land sales. We continue to rationalize certain existing land positions to ensure the most effective use of invested capital. For the year ended December 31, 2001, selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA), as a percentage of home settlement revenues, increased 42 basis points to 9.37% after increasing 35 basis points to 8.95% in 2000. Higher startup costs for new communities, increased compensation related costs, local market advertising expenses and the inclusion of Del Webbs operations are the primary reasons for the increase in 2001. The increase in 2000 reflects higher sales and marketing expenses, and startup costs associated with the opening of new communities. Other expense, net increased to $16,851,000 in 2001 as a result of increased land inventory valuation reserves for certain land positions and amortization of tradenames and trademarks acquired in the merger with Del Webb. The increase from 1999 to 2000 represents an increase in various market level non operational expenditures. Our Domestic Homebuilding operations controlled approximately 116,000 and 74,900 lots, of which approximately 81,200 and 40,800 lots were owned, and approximately 34,800 and 34,100 lots were controlled through option agreements at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Domestic Homebuilding inventory at December 31, 2001, was approximately $3.7 billion of which $2.8 billion is related to land and land development. At December 31, 2000, inventory was approximately $1.8 billion of which $1.3 billion was related to land and land development. Included in other assets is approximately $223.5 million in land held for disposition as of December 31, 2001, as compared to $88.3 million in the prior year. International Homebuilding: International Homebuilding operations are primarily conducted through subsidiaries of Pulte International Corporation (International) in Mexico, Puerto Rico and Argentina. Mexico Internationals 100% owned subsidiary, Pulte International Mexico, Inc., conducts its operations primarily through five joint ventures located throughout Mexico. Its net investment in these joint ventures approximated $47.7 million at December 31, 2001. The largest of these ventures, Condak Pulte S. De R.L. De C.V. (Condak Pulte), is based in Cuidad Juarez. Condak Pulte is currently developing communities in Juarez, Chihuahua, Nuevo Laredo, Monterrey, Reynosa, Saltillo and Matamoros, under agreements with Delphi Automotive Systems, Gigante, S.A. de C.V. and Centro Comerciales Soriana, S.A. De C. V. As of December 31, 2001, Internationals net investment in Condak Pulte approximated $38.9 million. Desarrollos Residenciales Turisticos, S.A. de C.V., another of its joint ventures in Mexico, is constructing primarily social interest housing in Central Mexico. Current development plans for this venture include housing projects in the Bajio region surrounding Mexico City, targeting the cities of Celaya, Leon, Puebla, Queretaro, San Jose du Iturbide and San Juan del Rio. At December 31, 2001, Internationals net investment in this joint venture approximated $7.2 million. Effective January 1, 2002, Pulte International reorganized its structure within Mexico to create a single company, Pulte Mexico, which ranks as one of the largest builders in the country. The new operating structure will facilitate growth, enable operating leverage and improve efficiencies through standardized systems and procedures. The new company, which combines several entities, including Condak Pulte and DRT, will be consolidated into our financial statements. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding Operations (continued): International Homebuilding (continued): Puerto Rico Operations in Puerto Rico are primarily conducted through Internationals 100% owned subsidiary, Pulte International Caribbean Corporation. Desarrolladores Urbanos (Canovanas), S.E., its Puerto Rican joint venture, is developing 121 acres located in Metropolitan San Juan. At December 31, 2001, its net investment in this joint venture approximated $3.8 million. Argentina Operations in Argentina are conducted through Pulte SRL, Internationals 100% owned Argentine subsidiary which recorded its first closings during the second quarter of 2001. The following table presents selected financial data for Pultes International Homebuilding operations for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Revenues $ 35,169 $ 27,159 $ 21,941 Cost of sales (30,937 ) (24,611 ) (20,337 ) Selling, general and administrative expense (11,820 ) (5,621 ) (4,588 ) Other income, net 66 967 2,522 Equity in income of Mexico operations 5,138 5,455 6,000 Pre tax income (loss) $ (2,384 ) $ 3,349 $ 5,538 Unit settlements: Pulte 221 264 262 Pulte affiliated entities 7,258 7,718 6,512 7,479 7,982 6,774 Increased revenues in 2001 are due to the opening of operations in Argentina and a higher average selling price for our Puerto Rican operations. The higher average selling price in Puerto Rico, which results from concentrating more in middle market housing than in social interest housing, was offset by a decrease in closings from 264 in 2000 to 176 in 2001. Increased revenues in 2000 from 1999 are also attributable to this shift in focus. Results in 1999 benefited from a $2,400,000 land sale gain. SGA expense increased $6,199,000 in 2001 as a result of the start up of the Argentine operations. The Argentine operations recorded a $463,000 foreign currency transaction loss in 2001 as a result of the Argentine governments decision to de link the valuation of the Argentine peso from the U. S. dollar. We also recorded a foreign currency translation loss of $14,110,000, net of income taxes of $8,833,000, as a component of other comprehensive income in 2001. It is unclear at this time how the Argentine financial and currency markets will be affected in 2002. It is also unclear how the current economic situation may affect customer homebuying attitudes and the homebuilding business in general. In 2001, the Mexican operations were affected by changes in government lending practices, which slowed mortgage funding, resulting in lower closings than in 2000. It is anticipated that the rate of mortgage funding in Mexico will accelerate in 2002, which should increase the pace of closings over what was experienced in 2001. Our Mexican joint venture operations recorded 7,718 closings in 2000, representing a 19% increase over comparable 1999 results. Our share of pre tax income of $5,455,000 for 2000 for the Mexican joint ventures was slightly lower than the $6,000,000 recorded in 1999 as earnings in 1999 included currency gains of $1,702,000 versus currency losses of $78,000 for 2000. Currency losses in Mexico amounted to $378,000 in 2001. Eliminating the impact of the currency gains and losses, operating income for our Mexican operations increased by approximately 29% in 2000. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Financial Services Operations: We conduct our financial services operations principally through Pulte Mortgage Corporation (PMC), our mortgage banking subsidiary and during 1999, through Pulte Financial Companies, Inc. (PFCI). Pre tax income of our financial services operations is as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Pre tax income: Mortgage banking $ 28,331 $ 19,009 $ 19,017 Financing activities 1,811 Pre tax income $ 28,331 $ 19,009 $ 20,828 Mortgage Banking: Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Total originations: Loans 19,018 13,415 13,728 Principal $ 2,937,100 $ 1,957,300 $ 1,908,200 Originations for Pulte customers: Loans 13,786 11,109 10,858 Principal $ 2,131,000 $ 1,697,600 $ 1,558,400 We sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts. Due to the short period of time the servicing rights are held, usually three to four months, we do not amortize the servicing asset. Since the servicing rights are recorded at the value in the servicing sales contracts, there are no impairment issues related to these assets. We also originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various credit arrangements, and then sell such mortgage loans to outside investors. Mortgage origination principal volume for the year ended December 31, 2001, increased 50% over 2000, which benefited from an increase in the capture rate of 400 basis points to 60%, an increased average loan size and the inclusion of Del Webbs mortgage operations, which accounted for approximately 13% of the increase. Origination unit volume increased 42% due to the same factors. Mortgage origination principal volume in 2000 increased 3% over 1999, due to increases in year to date unit sales and higher average selling prices realized in our Domestic Homebuilding operations. However, the number of loans for 2000 was down 2% from 1999 levels due to competitive market conditions and rising mortgage interest rates during the last six months of 1999 and first three quarters of 2000. Our home buying customers continue to account for the majority of total loan production, representing 79% of total PMC unit production for 2001, compared with 83% in 2000 and 79% in 1999. Refinancings represented 10% of total loan production in 2001, compared with 2% in 2000 and 4% during 1999. At December 31, 2001, loan application backlog increased 54% to $827 million as compared to $536 million and $499 million at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. 21 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Financial Services Operations (continued): Mortgage Banking (continued): Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2001, increased 49% to $28.3 million, due to increases in volume, capture rate and secondary marketing gains. The addition of Del Webbs mortgage operations for the last five months of 2001 contributed approximately 8% of this increase. Pricing and marketing gains increased $17.4 million, or 71%, from the same period in 2000, primarily due to a consistent drop in interest rates throughout 2001. As compared with 2000, net interest income increased $3.1 million to $5.0 million during 2001 due to increased production and a steeper yield curve as a result of the drop in interest rates during 2001. Offsetting these gains was an increase in SGA expenses of $10 million as a result of increased headcount and other related costs due to the increase in volume during 2001. Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2000, was unchanged from 1999, as increases in origination fees and other income were offset by decreases in pricing and marketing gains and net interest income. During 2000, origination fees increased $1.6 million, or 23%, over the prior year due primarily to an increase in brokered loans. Pricing and marketing gains decreased $3.6 million, or 13%, from the same period in 1999, primarily due to competitive market conditions for much of 2000. As compared with 1999, net interest income decreased 17% to $1.8 million during 2000 as a result of a drop in funded production and a higher cost of funds due to a new warehouse line that became effective March 31, 2000. During 2000, we recognized increased equity income from our minority interest in a Mexican mortgage banking company, and also recognized income from mortgage reinsurance operations. Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, requires companies to recognize all of their derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship, and further, on the type of hedging relationship. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company must designate the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. We hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed mortgage loans with derivative financial instruments. For the year ended December 31, 2001, we did not recognize any net gains or losses related to the ineffective portion of the hedging instrument excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We also did not recognize any gains or losses during 2001, for cash flow hedges that were discontinued because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur. At December 31, 2001, we expect to reclassify $592,000, net of taxes, of net losses on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next twelve months from sales of closed mortgage loans. Financing Activities: Our secured financing operations, which were conducted by a limited purpose subsidiary of PFCI, ceased operations during 1999. During the first quarter of 1999, we recognized a net gain of approximately $1.7 million in connection with the sale of its remaining mortgage backed securities portfolio. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Corporate: Corporate is a non operating business segment whose primary purpose is to support the operations of our subsidiaries as the internal source of financing, to develop and implement strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies, and to provide the administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity. As a result, the corporate segments operating results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve. The following table presents this segments results of operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Net interest expense $ 34,261 $ 28,987 $ 22,824 Other corporate expenses, net 23,191 27,309 28,160 Loss before income taxes $ 57,452 $ 56,296 $ 50,984 An increase in net interest expense offset by a decrease in other corporate expenses, net, resulted in a 2% increase in the net loss for the Corporate segment. The increase in the corporate net interest spread, which is net of interest capitalized into inventory, is attributable to a higher debt balance as a result of the Del Webb merger and the issuance in February 2001 of $200 million and in August 2001 of $500 million in Senior Notes, primarily for use in repaying certain indebtedness acquired from Del Webb (see Del Webb Merger). The decrease in other corporate expenses, net in 2001 is primarily due to the effect of the write down of a commercial land position in 2000. The increase in 2000 of the pre tax loss to $56.3 million was primarily a result of an increase in net interest expense. Increases in net interest expense were attributed to higher average use of our unsecured revolving credit facility in addition to the April 2000 issuance of $175 million Senior Notes. Interest incurred for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, excluding interest incurred by our financial services operations, was approximately $116.9, $62.8 and $49.5 million, respectively. Corporate net interest expense is net of amounts capitalized into homebuilding inventories. Interest is amortized to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. Interest in inventory at December 31, 2001, increased primarily as a result of higher levels of indebtedness and the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Information related to Corporate interest capitalized into inventory is as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Interest in inventory at beginning of year $ 24,202 $ 19,092 $ 16,356 Interest capitalized 80,399 33,129 27,923 Interest expensed (36,006 ) (28,019 ) (25,187 ) Interest in inventory at end of year $ 68,595 $ 24,202 $ 19,092 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources: Continuing Operations: Our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2001, was $418,796,000 as higher net income was offset by increases in inventory and residential mortgage loans available for sale over 2000 and the resolution of the First Heights litigation. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2001 increased primarily due to the net cash acquired from Del Webb. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $297,131,000 as proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes of $200 million and $500 million, and increased borrowings under the revolving credit arrangements, were offset by the repayment of debt acquired from Del Webb (see Del Webb Merger). Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2000, amounted to $23,322,000. Increases in inventory, other assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities during 2000 were less than during 1999, and were offset by a larger increase in residential mortgage loans available for sale. Net cash used in investing activities was $5,185,000 for 2000. The effects of PFCIs sale of the underlying collateral of its mortgage backed securities portfolio and the purchase of BREs interest in the net assets of our active adult joint venture are reflected in 1999. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2000, was $114,051,000, as compared to a use of cash of $87,642,000 in 1999. These increased cash flows primarily reflect our issuance of $175 million Senior Notes in April 2000 and issuance of common stock pursuant to our employee stock option plans, offset by stock repurchases. We finance homebuilding land acquisition, development and construction activities from internally generated funds and existing credit agreements. We had $110 million outstanding under our $560 million unsecured revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2001. PMC provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available through various committed and uncommitted credit arrangements which, at December 31, 2001, amounted to $450 million, an amount deemed adequate to cover foreseeable needs. There were approximately $410 million of borrowings outstanding under the PMC arrangements at December 31, 2001. Mortgage loans originated by PMC are subsequently sold. We anticipate that there will be adequate mortgage financing available for purchasers of our homes. In February 2001, we sold $200 million of 8 1/8% Senior Notes, due 2011 from an active $500 million shelf registration. The net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes were used to repay short term borrowings under our revolving bank credit arrangements and for general corporate purposes. In August 2001, we sold in a private placement, $500 million of 7 7/8% Senior Notes due in 2011 and subsequently filed an S 4 Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in December 2001. Net proceeds received from the sale were used to repay certain indebtedness acquired in the Del Webb transaction, to pay certain expenses associated with that transaction and for general corporate purposes. Our income tax liabilities are affected by a number of factors. In 2001, our effective tax rate was 38.50% compared to 38.50% in 2000 and 37.75% in 1999. Our lower effective income tax rate in 1999 resulted from a lower effective state tax rate and the favorable resolution of various state income tax matters. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2002 will be approximately 39%. At December 31, 2001, we had cash and equivalents of $72.1 million and total long term indebtedness of $1.7 billion. Our total long term indebtedness includes $1.4 billion of unsecured Senior Notes, $368.6 million of unsecured Senior Subordinated Notes, other limited recourse debt of $15 million and other non recourse short term notes payable of $60.7 million. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): Continuing Operations (continued): The following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2001: Payments Due by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 After 2006 Contractual obligations: Guarantor short term borrowings $ 110,000 $ 110,000 $ $ $ Non guarantor short term borrowings 413,675 413,675 Long term indebtedness 1,737,869 3,147 395,606 198,339 1,140,777 Operating leases 102,423 30,505 33,618 17,673 20,627 Total contractual obligations $ 2,363,967 $ 557,327 $ 429,224 $ 216,012 $ 1,161,404 The following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2001: Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 After 2006 Other commercial commitments: Guarantor revolving credit facilities $ 560,000 $ $ $ 560,000 $ Non guarantor revolving credit facilities 450,000 225,000 225,000 Standby letters of credit 125,617 107,841 16,825 951 Total commercial commitments $ 1,135,617 $ 332,841 $ 241,825 $ 560,951 $ Standby letters of credit and performance bonds are used to guarantee our performance under various contracts, principally in connection with the development of our projects. The expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related project. If the obligations related to the project are ongoing, annual extensions are granted on a year to year basis. Performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These bonds, which approximated $775 million at December 31, 2001, are typically outstanding over a period that approximates 3 5 years. In the normal course of business, we acquire rights under options or option type agreements to purchase land to be used in homebuilding operations at future dates. These rights, which may be cancelled at our discretion, may extend over several years and are typically secured by small deposits. Further, these rights are frequently extended or renegotiated to better match the needs of our homebuilding operations. The total purchase price applicable to approved land under option for use by our homebuilding operations at future dates approximated $1.1 billion at December 31, 2001, which represented approximately 35,000 lots. In addition, there were approximately 25,000 lots valued at $644 million under option at December 31, 2001, pending approval, that are under review and evaluation for future use by our homebuilding operations. Sources of our working capital at December 31, 2001, include our cash and equivalents, our $560 million committed unsecured revolving credit facilities and PMCs $450 million revolving credit facilities. Our debt to total capitalization, excluding our non guarantor asset secured borrowings, was 44.8% as of December 31, 2001. We expect to manage our debt to total capitalization to the 40% level by the end of 2002. It is our intent to exercise, over time, the early call provisions of the Senior Subordinated Notes issued by Del Webb, as allowed under these notes. We routinely monitor current operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate the use of available financial sources, including securities offerings. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): Del Webb Merger: On July 31, 2001, we merged with Del Webb Corporation as discussed in Note 3 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. At closing, we paid off and cancelled Del Webbs revolving credit facility, which had a balance outstanding of approximately $300 million at closing. Under the terms of Del Webbs $100 million, 9 3/4%, due 2003, Senior Subordinated Notes, we exercised our option to redeem the entire bond issuance at par during the third quarter of 2001. Under the terms of Del Webbs other Senior Subordinated Notes, we were required, as a result of the change in control, to offer to purchase four series of its Senior Subordinated Notes. As of December 31, 2001, we had repurchased, through tender offers and open market purchases, $127 million of these Notes. Under the terms of Del Webbs $150 million 9 3/4%, due 2008, Senior Subordinated Notes, we exercised our optional right to redeem the remaining outstanding balance of $122 million at the price stipulated in the indenture by placing with the trustee as of December 31, 2001, sufficient proceeds to satisfy a January 15, 2002, final payoff. Inflation: We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation also increases our financing, labor and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices. To date, inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies: The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements, giving due regard to materiality. Inventory valuation: Our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated cost or net realizable value. Included in inventories are all direct development costs. We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories and charge the interest to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. This period increased in 2001 due to the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated cost, unless they are determined to be impaired, in which case these inventories are measured at fair value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory adjustments may be required. Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis or on a relative sales value basis as cost of sales. Under the specific identification basis, units are assigned an average cost by project based on actual costs to date plus the estimated cost of completion. Units costed using the relative sales value basis are assigned cost based on the sales value of the unit in relation to the total estimated sales value of the project. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued): Goodwill and Intangible Assets: Goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed by management for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $467 million at the end of 2001, which represented 8% of total assets. The majority of these assets resulted from the acquisition of Del Webb in 2001. Del Webb has a long history of operating success and profitability, has well recognized brand names and holds a significant position in the active adult market which should continue in the future. The integration of Del Webb should enable the combined businesses to accelerate the pace of land absorptions, enhance the visibility of the Del Webb and Sun City brand names and obtain the synergies of enhanced purchasing leverage, complementary product offerings and combined operations in the future. Changes in strategy and or market conditions could impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our long term debt to the extent long term rates decline. The following tables set forth, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, our long term debt obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value ($000s omitted).

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) PMC, operating as a mortgage banker, is also subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed upon terms (i.e., commits to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2001 and 2000, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float. We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to the Federal Funds rate and (ii) hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments with off balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in long term mortgage rates of plus 50, 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results. Our aggregate net equity investment in Mexico approximated $61.1 million at December 31, 2001. This investment, which is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk, could devalue by as much as $10 million in 2002, assuming a hypothetical 18% annualized devaluation of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar during 2002. Our aggregate net investment in Argentina approximated $20.1 million at December 31, 2001. This investment is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. It is unclear at this time how the Argentine financial and currency markets will be affected in 2002 as a result of the Argentine governments decision to de link the valuation of the Argentine peso from the U. S. dollar. It is therefore unclear what effect this may have on the continuing value of our investment in Argentina. SPECIAL NOTES CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS As a cautionary note, except for the historical information contained herein, certain matters discussed in Item 7., Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such matters involve risks and uncertainties, including: our exposure to certain market risks, changes in economic conditions, tax and interest rates, increases in raw material and labor costs, issues and timing surrounding land entitlement and development, weather conditions, government regulations and environmental matters, as well as, general competitive factors, that may cause actual results to differ materially; and our ability to integrate the recently acquired business operations of Del Webb Corporation, including Del Webbs activities, management and corporate culture, with our own, and our ability to develop and manage large scale active adult communities which differ from our historical homebuilding business. 28 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding Operations (continued): Domestic Homebuilding: The Domestic Homebuilding business unit represents our core business. Operations are conducted in 43 markets, located throughout 25 states, and are organized into five groups as follows: Northeast: Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia Southeast: Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee Midwest: Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio Central: Colorado, Texas West: Arizona, California, Nevada The metropolitan Atlanta market accounted for 10% of the total unit settlements in 2000. No other individual market represented more than 10% of total Domestic Homebuilding net new orders, unit settlements or revenues during the three years ended December 31, 2001. The following table presents selected unit information for our Domestic Homebuilding operations: Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Unit settlements: Northeast 2,014 2,000 2,486 Southeast 8,126 7,820 7,607 Midwest 3,288 2,903 3,044 Central 3,982 3,622 3,337 West 5,505 3,454 3,095 22,915 19,799 19,569 Net new orders units: Northeast 2,035 1,970 2,511 Southeast 8,544 7,815 7,920 Midwest 3,756 2,818 3,166 Central 4,071 3,644 2,956 West 7,710 3,597 2,814 26,116 19,844 19,367 Net new orders dollars ($000s omitted) $ 5,926,000 $ 4,211,000 $ 3,784,000 Backlog at December 31 units: Northeast 831 810 840 Southeast 2,559 2,141 2,146 Midwest 1,375 907 992 Central 903 814 792 West 3,010 805 662 8,678 5,477 5,432 Backlog at December 31 dollars ($000s omitted) $ 2,118,000 $ 1,307,000 $ 1,180,000 17 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding Operations (continued): Domestic Homebuilding (continued): Net new orders increased for the thirteenth consecutive year to an all time record of 26,116 units in 2001, a 32% increase over 2000 order levels. This increase is primarily due to the inclusion of Del Webbs operations, which contributed 5,968 units, including an acquired backlog of 3,823 units. Order growth in the Central and West groups offset by softer performance in the Northeast and Midwest groups contributed to a 2% increase in 2000 orders over 1999 levels. Unit settlements in 2001 also hit a record setting high, to 22,915 units with the majority of the increase due to the inclusion of Del Webbs operations, which contributed 2,797 units. Unit settlement activity in 2000 increased 1% over 1999 levels reflecting strong performance in the Southeast, Central and West groups offset by a decline in the Northeast. The average home sales price increased from $187,000 in 1999 to $206,000 in 2000 and to $225,000 in the current year. Changes in average selling price reflect a number of factors, including price increases, the mix of product closed during a period and the number of options purchased by customers. 2001 benefited from increased product prices, improved product mix and the inclusion of Del Webb product offerings, which had an average selling price of $264,000. Ending backlog, which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed, jumped 58% to 8,678 homes, including 3,171 Del Webb units, while the dollar value was up 62% to $2.1 billion at December 31, 2001. Unit backlog at December 31, 2000, was slightly higher than that noted at the end of 1999 while the dollar value was up 11%. Overall, strong demand supported by a favorable interest rate environment and the addition of Del Webbs operations drove increased order activity and record levels of backlog. The following table presents a summary of pre tax income for our Domestic Homebuilding operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Home sale revenue (settlements) $ 5,145,526 $ 4,083,816 $ 3,655,775 Land sale revenue 129,134 84,700 33,480 Home cost of sales (4,118,442 ) (3,315,106 ) (3,003,504 ) Land cost of sales (97,941 ) (56,250 ) (25,697 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (482,128 ) (365,704 ) (314,463 ) Interest (36,006 ) (28,019 ) (25,187 ) Other expense, net (16,851 ) (14,403 ) (9,381 ) $ 523,292 $ 389,034 $ 311,023 Average sales price $ 225 $ 206 $ 187 We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories and charge the interest to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. 18 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding Operations (continued): Domestic Homebuilding (continued): Gross profit margins in 2001 increased 120 basis points over 2000 to 20.0%, including the effect of purchase accounting associated with the Del Webb merger. Excluding the effect of purchase accounting, gross margins in 2001 would have been 20.2%. Gross profit margins in 2000 increased to 18.8%, up 100 basis points over 1999. Factors that contributed to this favorable trend include strong customer demand, positive home pricing, the benefits of leverage buy purchasing activities and effective production and inventory management. Land sales increased over each of the prior three years representing our land development core competency which includes development and entitlement of certain land positions for sale primarily to other homebuilders, as well as to retail and commercial establishments. Revenues and their related gains/losses may vary significantly between periods, depending on the timing of future land sales. We continue to rationalize certain existing land positions to ensure the most effective use of invested capital. For the year ended December 31, 2001, selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA), as a percentage of home settlement revenues, increased 42 basis points to 9.37% after increasing 35 basis points to 8.95% in 2000. Higher startup costs for new communities, increased compensation related costs, local market advertising expenses and the inclusion of Del Webbs operations are the primary reasons for the increase in 2001. The increase in 2000 reflects higher sales and marketing expenses, and startup costs associated with the opening of new communities. Other expense, net increased to $16,851,000 in 2001 as a result of increased land inventory valuation reserves for certain land positions and amortization of tradenames and trademarks acquired in the merger with Del Webb. The increase from 1999 to 2000 represents an increase in various market level non operational expenditures. Our Domestic Homebuilding operations controlled approximately 116,000 and 74,900 lots, of which approximately 81,200 and 40,800 lots were owned, and approximately 34,800 and 34,100 lots were controlled through option agreements at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Domestic Homebuilding inventory at December 31, 2001, was approximately $3.7 billion of which $2.8 billion is related to land and land development. At December 31, 2000, inventory was approximately $1.8 billion of which $1.3 billion was related to land and land development. Included in other assets is approximately $223.5 million in land held for disposition as of December 31, 2001, as compared to $88.3 million in the prior year. International Homebuilding: International Homebuilding operations are primarily conducted through subsidiaries of Pulte International Corporation (International) in Mexico, Puerto Rico and Argentina. Mexico Internationals 100% owned subsidiary, Pulte International Mexico, Inc., conducts its operations primarily through five joint ventures located throughout Mexico. Its net investment in these joint ventures approximated $47.7 million at December 31, 2001. The largest of these ventures, Condak Pulte S. De R.L. De C.V. (Condak Pulte), is based in Cuidad Juarez. Condak Pulte is currently developing communities in Juarez, Chihuahua, Nuevo Laredo, Monterrey, Reynosa, Saltillo and Matamoros, under agreements with Delphi Automotive Systems, Gigante, S.A. de C.V. and Centro Comerciales Soriana, S.A. De C. V. As of December 31, 2001, Internationals net investment in Condak Pulte approximated $38.9 million. Desarrollos Residenciales Turisticos, S.A. de C.V., another of its joint ventures in Mexico, is constructing primarily social interest housing in Central Mexico. Current development plans for this venture include housing projects in the Bajio region surrounding Mexico City, targeting the cities of Celaya, Leon, Puebla, Queretaro, San Jose du Iturbide and San Juan del Rio. At December 31, 2001, Internationals net investment in this joint venture approximated $7.2 million. Effective January 1, 2002, Pulte International reorganized its structure within Mexico to create a single company, Pulte Mexico, which ranks as one of the largest builders in the country. The new operating structure will facilitate growth, enable operating leverage and improve efficiencies through standardized systems and procedures. The new company, which combines several entities, including Condak Pulte and DRT, will be consolidated into our financial statements. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding Operations (continued): International Homebuilding (continued): Puerto Rico Operations in Puerto Rico are primarily conducted through Internationals 100% owned subsidiary, Pulte International Caribbean Corporation. Desarrolladores Urbanos (Canovanas), S.E., its Puerto Rican joint venture, is developing 121 acres located in Metropolitan San Juan. At December 31, 2001, its net investment in this joint venture approximated $3.8 million. Argentina Operations in Argentina are conducted through Pulte SRL, Internationals 100% owned Argentine subsidiary which recorded its first closings during the second quarter of 2001. The following table presents selected financial data for Pultes International Homebuilding operations for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Revenues $ 35,169 $ 27,159 $ 21,941 Cost of sales (30,937 ) (24,611 ) (20,337 ) Selling, general and administrative expense (11,820 ) (5,621 ) (4,588 ) Other income, net 66 967 2,522 Equity in income of Mexico operations 5,138 5,455 6,000 Pre tax income (loss) $ (2,384 ) $ 3,349 $ 5,538 Unit settlements: Pulte 221 264 262 Pulte affiliated entities 7,258 7,718 6,512 7,479 7,982 6,774 Increased revenues in 2001 are due to the opening of operations in Argentina and a higher average selling price for our Puerto Rican operations. The higher average selling price in Puerto Rico, which results from concentrating more in middle market housing than in social interest housing, was offset by a decrease in closings from 264 in 2000 to 176 in 2001. Increased revenues in 2000 from 1999 are also attributable to this shift in focus. Results in 1999 benefited from a $2,400,000 land sale gain. SGA expense increased $6,199,000 in 2001 as a result of the start up of the Argentine operations. The Argentine operations recorded a $463,000 foreign currency transaction loss in 2001 as a result of the Argentine governments decision to de link the valuation of the Argentine peso from the U. S. dollar. We also recorded a foreign currency translation loss of $14,110,000, net of income taxes of $8,833,000, as a component of other comprehensive income in 2001. It is unclear at this time how the Argentine financial and currency markets will be affected in 2002. It is also unclear how the current economic situation may affect customer homebuying attitudes and the homebuilding business in general. In 2001, the Mexican operations were affected by changes in government lending practices, which slowed mortgage funding, resulting in lower closings than in 2000. It is anticipated that the rate of mortgage funding in Mexico will accelerate in 2002, which should increase the pace of closings over what was experienced in 2001. Our Mexican joint venture operations recorded 7,718 closings in 2000, representing a 19% increase over comparable 1999 results. Our share of pre tax income of $5,455,000 for 2000 for the Mexican joint ventures was slightly lower than the $6,000,000 recorded in 1999 as earnings in 1999 included currency gains of $1,702,000 versus currency losses of $78,000 for 2000. Currency losses in Mexico amounted to $378,000 in 2001. Eliminating the impact of the currency gains and losses, operating income for our Mexican operations increased by approximately 29% in 2000. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Financial Services Operations: We conduct our financial services operations principally through Pulte Mortgage Corporation (PMC), our mortgage banking subsidiary and during 1999, through Pulte Financial Companies, Inc. (PFCI). Pre tax income of our financial services operations is as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Pre tax income: Mortgage banking $ 28,331 $ 19,009 $ 19,017 Financing activities 1,811 Pre tax income $ 28,331 $ 19,009 $ 20,828 Mortgage Banking: Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Total originations: Loans 19,018 13,415 13,728 Principal $ 2,937,100 $ 1,957,300 $ 1,908,200 Originations for Pulte customers: Loans 13,786 11,109 10,858 Principal $ 2,131,000 $ 1,697,600 $ 1,558,400 We sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts. Due to the short period of time the servicing rights are held, usually three to four months, we do not amortize the servicing asset. Since the servicing rights are recorded at the value in the servicing sales contracts, there are no impairment issues related to these assets. We also originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various credit arrangements, and then sell such mortgage loans to outside investors. Mortgage origination principal volume for the year ended December 31, 2001, increased 50% over 2000, which benefited from an increase in the capture rate of 400 basis points to 60%, an increased average loan size and the inclusion of Del Webbs mortgage operations, which accounted for approximately 13% of the increase. Origination unit volume increased 42% due to the same factors. Mortgage origination principal volume in 2000 increased 3% over 1999, due to increases in year to date unit sales and higher average selling prices realized in our Domestic Homebuilding operations. However, the number of loans for 2000 was down 2% from 1999 levels due to competitive market conditions and rising mortgage interest rates during the last six months of 1999 and first three quarters of 2000. Our home buying customers continue to account for the majority of total loan production, representing 79% of total PMC unit production for 2001, compared with 83% in 2000 and 79% in 1999. Refinancings represented 10% of total loan production in 2001, compared with 2% in 2000 and 4% during 1999. At December 31, 2001, loan application backlog increased 54% to $827 million as compared to $536 million and $499 million at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. 21 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Financial Services Operations (continued): Mortgage Banking (continued): Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2001, increased 49% to $28.3 million, due to increases in volume, capture rate and secondary marketing gains. The addition of Del Webbs mortgage operations for the last five months of 2001 contributed approximately 8% of this increase. Pricing and marketing gains increased $17.4 million, or 71%, from the same period in 2000, primarily due to a consistent drop in interest rates throughout 2001. As compared with 2000, net interest income increased $3.1 million to $5.0 million during 2001 due to increased production and a steeper yield curve as a result of the drop in interest rates during 2001. Offsetting these gains was an increase in SGA expenses of $10 million as a result of increased headcount and other related costs due to the increase in volume during 2001. Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2000, was unchanged from 1999, as increases in origination fees and other income were offset by decreases in pricing and marketing gains and net interest income. During 2000, origination fees increased $1.6 million, or 23%, over the prior year due primarily to an increase in brokered loans. Pricing and marketing gains decreased $3.6 million, or 13%, from the same period in 1999, primarily due to competitive market conditions for much of 2000. As compared with 1999, net interest income decreased 17% to $1.8 million during 2000 as a result of a drop in funded production and a higher cost of funds due to a new warehouse line that became effective March 31, 2000. During 2000, we recognized increased equity income from our minority interest in a Mexican mortgage banking company, and also recognized income from mortgage reinsurance operations. Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, requires companies to recognize all of their derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship, and further, on the type of hedging relationship. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company must designate the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. We hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed mortgage loans with derivative financial instruments. For the year ended December 31, 2001, we did not recognize any net gains or losses related to the ineffective portion of the hedging instrument excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We also did not recognize any gains or losses during 2001, for cash flow hedges that were discontinued because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur. At December 31, 2001, we expect to reclassify $592,000, net of taxes, of net losses on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next twelve months from sales of closed mortgage loans. Financing Activities: Our secured financing operations, which were conducted by a limited purpose subsidiary of PFCI, ceased operations during 1999. During the first quarter of 1999, we recognized a net gain of approximately $1.7 million in connection with the sale of its remaining mortgage backed securities portfolio. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Corporate: Corporate is a non operating business segment whose primary purpose is to support the operations of our subsidiaries as the internal source of financing, to develop and implement strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies, and to provide the administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity. As a result, the corporate segments operating results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve. The following table presents this segments results of operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Net interest expense $ 34,261 $ 28,987 $ 22,824 Other corporate expenses, net 23,191 27,309 28,160 Loss before income taxes $ 57,452 $ 56,296 $ 50,984 An increase in net interest expense offset by a decrease in other corporate expenses, net, resulted in a 2% increase in the net loss for the Corporate segment. The increase in the corporate net interest spread, which is net of interest capitalized into inventory, is attributable to a higher debt balance as a result of the Del Webb merger and the issuance in February 2001 of $200 million and in August 2001 of $500 million in Senior Notes, primarily for use in repaying certain indebtedness acquired from Del Webb (see Del Webb Merger). The decrease in other corporate expenses, net in 2001 is primarily due to the effect of the write down of a commercial land position in 2000. The increase in 2000 of the pre tax loss to $56.3 million was primarily a result of an increase in net interest expense. Increases in net interest expense were attributed to higher average use of our unsecured revolving credit facility in addition to the April 2000 issuance of $175 million Senior Notes. Interest incurred for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, excluding interest incurred by our financial services operations, was approximately $116.9, $62.8 and $49.5 million, respectively. Corporate net interest expense is net of amounts capitalized into homebuilding inventories. Interest is amortized to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. Interest in inventory at December 31, 2001, increased primarily as a result of higher levels of indebtedness and the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Information related to Corporate interest capitalized into inventory is as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Interest in inventory at beginning of year $ 24,202 $ 19,092 $ 16,356 Interest capitalized 80,399 33,129 27,923 Interest expensed (36,006 ) (28,019 ) (25,187 ) Interest in inventory at end of year $ 68,595 $ 24,202 $ 19,092 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources: Continuing Operations: Our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2001, was $418,796,000 as higher net income was offset by increases in inventory and residential mortgage loans available for sale over 2000 and the resolution of the First Heights litigation. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2001 increased primarily due to the net cash acquired from Del Webb. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $297,131,000 as proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes of $200 million and $500 million, and increased borrowings under the revolving credit arrangements, were offset by the repayment of debt acquired from Del Webb (see Del Webb Merger). Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2000, amounted to $23,322,000. Increases in inventory, other assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities during 2000 were less than during 1999, and were offset by a larger increase in residential mortgage loans available for sale. Net cash used in investing activities was $5,185,000 for 2000. The effects of PFCIs sale of the underlying collateral of its mortgage backed securities portfolio and the purchase of BREs interest in the net assets of our active adult joint venture are reflected in 1999. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2000, was $114,051,000, as compared to a use of cash of $87,642,000 in 1999. These increased cash flows primarily reflect our issuance of $175 million Senior Notes in April 2000 and issuance of common stock pursuant to our employee stock option plans, offset by stock repurchases. We finance homebuilding land acquisition, development and construction activities from internally generated funds and existing credit agreements. We had $110 million outstanding under our $560 million unsecured revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2001. PMC provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available through various committed and uncommitted credit arrangements which, at December 31, 2001, amounted to $450 million, an amount deemed adequate to cover foreseeable needs. There were approximately $410 million of borrowings outstanding under the PMC arrangements at December 31, 2001. Mortgage loans originated by PMC are subsequently sold. We anticipate that there will be adequate mortgage financing available for purchasers of our homes. In February 2001, we sold $200 million of 8 1/8% Senior Notes, due 2011 from an active $500 million shelf registration. The net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes were used to repay short term borrowings under our revolving bank credit arrangements and for general corporate purposes. In August 2001, we sold in a private placement, $500 million of 7 7/8% Senior Notes due in 2011 and subsequently filed an S 4 Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in December 2001. Net proceeds received from the sale were used to repay certain indebtedness acquired in the Del Webb transaction, to pay certain expenses associated with that transaction and for general corporate purposes. Our income tax liabilities are affected by a number of factors. In 2001, our effective tax rate was 38.50% compared to 38.50% in 2000 and 37.75% in 1999. Our lower effective income tax rate in 1999 resulted from a lower effective state tax rate and the favorable resolution of various state income tax matters. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2002 will be approximately 39%. At December 31, 2001, we had cash and equivalents of $72.1 million and total long term indebtedness of $1.7 billion. Our total long term indebtedness includes $1.4 billion of unsecured Senior Notes, $368.6 million of unsecured Senior Subordinated Notes, other limited recourse debt of $15 million and other non recourse short term notes payable of $60.7 million. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): Continuing Operations (continued): The following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2001: Payments Due by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 After 2006 Contractual obligations: Guarantor short term borrowings $ 110,000 $ 110,000 $ $ $ Non guarantor short term borrowings 413,675 413,675 Long term indebtedness 1,737,869 3,147 395,606 198,339 1,140,777 Operating leases 102,423 30,505 33,618 17,673 20,627 Total contractual obligations $ 2,363,967 $ 557,327 $ 429,224 $ 216,012 $ 1,161,404 The following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2001: Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 After 2006 Other commercial commitments: Guarantor revolving credit facilities $ 560,000 $ $ $ 560,000 $ Non guarantor revolving credit facilities 450,000 225,000 225,000 Standby letters of credit 125,617 107,841 16,825 951 Total commercial commitments $ 1,135,617 $ 332,841 $ 241,825 $ 560,951 $ Standby letters of credit and performance bonds are used to guarantee our performance under various contracts, principally in connection with the development of our projects. The expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related project. If the obligations related to the project are ongoing, annual extensions are granted on a year to year basis. Performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These bonds, which approximated $775 million at December 31, 2001, are typically outstanding over a period that approximates 3 5 years. In the normal course of business, we acquire rights under options or option type agreements to purchase land to be used in homebuilding operations at future dates. These rights, which may be cancelled at our discretion, may extend over several years and are typically secured by small deposits. Further, these rights are frequently extended or renegotiated to better match the needs of our homebuilding operations. The total purchase price applicable to approved land under option for use by our homebuilding operations at future dates approximated $1.1 billion at December 31, 2001, which represented approximately 35,000 lots. In addition, there were approximately 25,000 lots valued at $644 million under option at December 31, 2001, pending approval, that are under review and evaluation for future use by our homebuilding operations. Sources of our working capital at December 31, 2001, include our cash and equivalents, our $560 million committed unsecured revolving credit facilities and PMCs $450 million revolving credit facilities. Our debt to total capitalization, excluding our non guarantor asset secured borrowings, was 44.8% as of December 31, 2001. We expect to manage our debt to total capitalization to the 40% level by the end of 2002. It is our intent to exercise, over time, the early call provisions of the Senior Subordinated Notes issued by Del Webb, as allowed under these notes. We routinely monitor current operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate the use of available financial sources, including securities offerings. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): Del Webb Merger: On July 31, 2001, we merged with Del Webb Corporation as discussed in Note 3 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. At closing, we paid off and cancelled Del Webbs revolving credit facility, which had a balance outstanding of approximately $300 million at closing. Under the terms of Del Webbs $100 million, 9 3/4%, due 2003, Senior Subordinated Notes, we exercised our option to redeem the entire bond issuance at par during the third quarter of 2001. Under the terms of Del Webbs other Senior Subordinated Notes, we were required, as a result of the change in control, to offer to purchase four series of its Senior Subordinated Notes. As of December 31, 2001, we had repurchased, through tender offers and open market purchases, $127 million of these Notes. Under the terms of Del Webbs $150 million 9 3/4%, due 2008, Senior Subordinated Notes, we exercised our optional right to redeem the remaining outstanding balance of $122 million at the price stipulated in the indenture by placing with the trustee as of December 31, 2001, sufficient proceeds to satisfy a January 15, 2002, final payoff. Inflation: We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation also increases our financing, labor and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices. To date, inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies: The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements, giving due regard to materiality. Inventory valuation: Our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated cost or net realizable value. Included in inventories are all direct development costs. We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories and charge the interest to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. This period increased in 2001 due to the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated cost, unless they are determined to be impaired, in which case these inventories are measured at fair value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory adjustments may be required. Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis or on a relative sales value basis as cost of sales. Under the specific identification basis, units are assigned an average cost by project based on actual costs to date plus the estimated cost of completion. Units costed using the relative sales value basis are assigned cost based on the sales value of the unit in relation to the total estimated sales value of the project. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued): Goodwill and Intangible Assets: Goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed by management for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $467 million at the end of 2001, which represented 8% of total assets. The majority of these assets resulted from the acquisition of Del Webb in 2001. Del Webb has a long history of operating success and profitability, has well recognized brand names and holds a significant position in the active adult market which should continue in the future. The integration of Del Webb should enable the combined businesses to accelerate the pace of land absorptions, enhance the visibility of the Del Webb and Sun City brand names and obtain the synergies of enhanced purchasing leverage, complementary product offerings and combined operations in the future. Changes in strategy and or market conditions could impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our long term debt to the extent long term rates decline. The following tables set forth, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, our long term debt obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value ($000s omitted).

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) PMC, operating as a mortgage banker, is also subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed upon terms (i.e., commits to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2001 and 2000, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float. We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to the Federal Funds rate and (ii) hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments with off balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in long term mortgage rates of plus 50, 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results. Our aggregate net equity investment in Mexico approximated $61.1 million at December 31, 2001. This investment, which is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk, could devalue by as much as $10 million in 2002, assuming a hypothetical 18% annualized devaluation of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar during 2002. Our aggregate net investment in Argentina approximated $20.1 million at December 31, 2001. This investment is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. It is unclear at this time how the Argentine financial and currency markets will be affected in 2002 as a result of the Argentine governments decision to de link the valuation of the Argentine peso from the U. S. dollar. It is therefore unclear what effect this may have on the continuing value of our investment in Argentina. SPECIAL NOTES CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS As a cautionary note, except for the historical information contained herein, certain matters discussed in Item 7., Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such matters involve risks and uncertainties, including: our exposure to certain market risks, changes in economic conditions, tax and interest rates, increases in raw material and labor costs, issues and timing surrounding land entitlement and development, weather conditions, government regulations and environmental matters, as well as, general competitive factors, that may cause actual results to differ materially; and our ability to integrate the recently acquired business operations of Del Webb Corporation, including Del Webbs activities, management and corporate culture, with our own, and our ability to develop and manage large scale active adult communities which differ from our historical homebuilding business. 28 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding Operations (continued): Domestic Homebuilding (continued): Net new orders increased for the thirteenth consecutive year to an all time record of 26,116 units in 2001, a 32% increase over 2000 order levels. This increase is primarily due to the inclusion of Del Webbs operations, which contributed 5,968 units, including an acquired backlog of 3,823 units. Order growth in the Central and West groups offset by softer performance in the Northeast and Midwest groups contributed to a 2% increase in 2000 orders over 1999 levels. Unit settlements in 2001 also hit a record setting high, to 22,915 units with the majority of the increase due to the inclusion of Del Webbs operations, which contributed 2,797 units. Unit settlement activity in 2000 increased 1% over 1999 levels reflecting strong performance in the Southeast, Central and West groups offset by a decline in the Northeast. The average home sales price increased from $187,000 in 1999 to $206,000 in 2000 and to $225,000 in the current year. Changes in average selling price reflect a number of factors, including price increases, the mix of product closed during a period and the number of options purchased by customers. 2001 benefited from increased product prices, improved product mix and the inclusion of Del Webb product offerings, which had an average selling price of $264,000. Ending backlog, which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed, jumped 58% to 8,678 homes, including 3,171 Del Webb units, while the dollar value was up 62% to $2.1 billion at December 31, 2001. Unit backlog at December 31, 2000, was slightly higher than that noted at the end of 1999 while the dollar value was up 11%. Overall, strong demand supported by a favorable interest rate environment and the addition of Del Webbs operations drove increased order activity and record levels of backlog. The following table presents a summary of pre tax income for our Domestic Homebuilding operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Home sale revenue (settlements) $ 5,145,526 $ 4,083,816 $ 3,655,775 Land sale revenue 129,134 84,700 33,480 Home cost of sales (4,118,442 ) (3,315,106 ) (3,003,504 ) Land cost of sales (97,941 ) (56,250 ) (25,697 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (482,128 ) (365,704 ) (314,463 ) Interest (36,006 ) (28,019 ) (25,187 ) Other expense, net (16,851 ) (14,403 ) (9,381 ) $ 523,292 $ 389,034 $ 311,023 Average sales price $ 225 $ 206 $ 187 We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories and charge the interest to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. 18 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding Operations (continued): Domestic Homebuilding (continued): Gross profit margins in 2001 increased 120 basis points over 2000 to 20.0%, including the effect of purchase accounting associated with the Del Webb merger. Excluding the effect of purchase accounting, gross margins in 2001 would have been 20.2%. Gross profit margins in 2000 increased to 18.8%, up 100 basis points over 1999. Factors that contributed to this favorable trend include strong customer demand, positive home pricing, the benefits of leverage buy purchasing activities and effective production and inventory management. Land sales increased over each of the prior three years representing our land development core competency which includes development and entitlement of certain land positions for sale primarily to other homebuilders, as well as to retail and commercial establishments. Revenues and their related gains/losses may vary significantly between periods, depending on the timing of future land sales. We continue to rationalize certain existing land positions to ensure the most effective use of invested capital. For the year ended December 31, 2001, selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA), as a percentage of home settlement revenues, increased 42 basis points to 9.37% after increasing 35 basis points to 8.95% in 2000. Higher startup costs for new communities, increased compensation related costs, local market advertising expenses and the inclusion of Del Webbs operations are the primary reasons for the increase in 2001. The increase in 2000 reflects higher sales and marketing expenses, and startup costs associated with the opening of new communities. Other expense, net increased to $16,851,000 in 2001 as a result of increased land inventory valuation reserves for certain land positions and amortization of tradenames and trademarks acquired in the merger with Del Webb. The increase from 1999 to 2000 represents an increase in various market level non operational expenditures. Our Domestic Homebuilding operations controlled approximately 116,000 and 74,900 lots, of which approximately 81,200 and 40,800 lots were owned, and approximately 34,800 and 34,100 lots were controlled through option agreements at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Domestic Homebuilding inventory at December 31, 2001, was approximately $3.7 billion of which $2.8 billion is related to land and land development. At December 31, 2000, inventory was approximately $1.8 billion of which $1.3 billion was related to land and land development. Included in other assets is approximately $223.5 million in land held for disposition as of December 31, 2001, as compared to $88.3 million in the prior year. International Homebuilding: International Homebuilding operations are primarily conducted through subsidiaries of Pulte International Corporation (International) in Mexico, Puerto Rico and Argentina. Mexico Internationals 100% owned subsidiary, Pulte International Mexico, Inc., conducts its operations primarily through five joint ventures located throughout Mexico. Its net investment in these joint ventures approximated $47.7 million at December 31, 2001. The largest of these ventures, Condak Pulte S. De R.L. De C.V. (Condak Pulte), is based in Cuidad Juarez. Condak Pulte is currently developing communities in Juarez, Chihuahua, Nuevo Laredo, Monterrey, Reynosa, Saltillo and Matamoros, under agreements with Delphi Automotive Systems, Gigante, S.A. de C.V. and Centro Comerciales Soriana, S.A. De C. V. As of December 31, 2001, Internationals net investment in Condak Pulte approximated $38.9 million. Desarrollos Residenciales Turisticos, S.A. de C.V., another of its joint ventures in Mexico, is constructing primarily social interest housing in Central Mexico. Current development plans for this venture include housing projects in the Bajio region surrounding Mexico City, targeting the cities of Celaya, Leon, Puebla, Queretaro, San Jose du Iturbide and San Juan del Rio. At December 31, 2001, Internationals net investment in this joint venture approximated $7.2 million. Effective January 1, 2002, Pulte International reorganized its structure within Mexico to create a single company, Pulte Mexico, which ranks as one of the largest builders in the country. The new operating structure will facilitate growth, enable operating leverage and improve efficiencies through standardized systems and procedures. The new company, which combines several entities, including Condak Pulte and DRT, will be consolidated into our financial statements. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding Operations (continued): International Homebuilding (continued): Puerto Rico Operations in Puerto Rico are primarily conducted through Internationals 100% owned subsidiary, Pulte International Caribbean Corporation. Desarrolladores Urbanos (Canovanas), S.E., its Puerto Rican joint venture, is developing 121 acres located in Metropolitan San Juan. At December 31, 2001, its net investment in this joint venture approximated $3.8 million. Argentina Operations in Argentina are conducted through Pulte SRL, Internationals 100% owned Argentine subsidiary which recorded its first closings during the second quarter of 2001. The following table presents selected financial data for Pultes International Homebuilding operations for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Revenues $ 35,169 $ 27,159 $ 21,941 Cost of sales (30,937 ) (24,611 ) (20,337 ) Selling, general and administrative expense (11,820 ) (5,621 ) (4,588 ) Other income, net 66 967 2,522 Equity in income of Mexico operations 5,138 5,455 6,000 Pre tax income (loss) $ (2,384 ) $ 3,349 $ 5,538 Unit settlements: Pulte 221 264 262 Pulte affiliated entities 7,258 7,718 6,512 7,479 7,982 6,774 Increased revenues in 2001 are due to the opening of operations in Argentina and a higher average selling price for our Puerto Rican operations. The higher average selling price in Puerto Rico, which results from concentrating more in middle market housing than in social interest housing, was offset by a decrease in closings from 264 in 2000 to 176 in 2001. Increased revenues in 2000 from 1999 are also attributable to this shift in focus. Results in 1999 benefited from a $2,400,000 land sale gain. SGA expense increased $6,199,000 in 2001 as a result of the start up of the Argentine operations. The Argentine operations recorded a $463,000 foreign currency transaction loss in 2001 as a result of the Argentine governments decision to de link the valuation of the Argentine peso from the U. S. dollar. We also recorded a foreign currency translation loss of $14,110,000, net of income taxes of $8,833,000, as a component of other comprehensive income in 2001. It is unclear at this time how the Argentine financial and currency markets will be affected in 2002. It is also unclear how the current economic situation may affect customer homebuying attitudes and the homebuilding business in general. In 2001, the Mexican operations were affected by changes in government lending practices, which slowed mortgage funding, resulting in lower closings than in 2000. It is anticipated that the rate of mortgage funding in Mexico will accelerate in 2002, which should increase the pace of closings over what was experienced in 2001. Our Mexican joint venture operations recorded 7,718 closings in 2000, representing a 19% increase over comparable 1999 results. Our share of pre tax income of $5,455,000 for 2000 for the Mexican joint ventures was slightly lower than the $6,000,000 recorded in 1999 as earnings in 1999 included currency gains of $1,702,000 versus currency losses of $78,000 for 2000. Currency losses in Mexico amounted to $378,000 in 2001. Eliminating the impact of the currency gains and losses, operating income for our Mexican operations increased by approximately 29% in 2000. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Financial Services Operations: We conduct our financial services operations principally through Pulte Mortgage Corporation (PMC), our mortgage banking subsidiary and during 1999, through Pulte Financial Companies, Inc. (PFCI). Pre tax income of our financial services operations is as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Pre tax income: Mortgage banking $ 28,331 $ 19,009 $ 19,017 Financing activities 1,811 Pre tax income $ 28,331 $ 19,009 $ 20,828 Mortgage Banking: Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Total originations: Loans 19,018 13,415 13,728 Principal $ 2,937,100 $ 1,957,300 $ 1,908,200 Originations for Pulte customers: Loans 13,786 11,109 10,858 Principal $ 2,131,000 $ 1,697,600 $ 1,558,400 We sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts. Due to the short period of time the servicing rights are held, usually three to four months, we do not amortize the servicing asset. Since the servicing rights are recorded at the value in the servicing sales contracts, there are no impairment issues related to these assets. We also originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various credit arrangements, and then sell such mortgage loans to outside investors. Mortgage origination principal volume for the year ended December 31, 2001, increased 50% over 2000, which benefited from an increase in the capture rate of 400 basis points to 60%, an increased average loan size and the inclusion of Del Webbs mortgage operations, which accounted for approximately 13% of the increase. Origination unit volume increased 42% due to the same factors. Mortgage origination principal volume in 2000 increased 3% over 1999, due to increases in year to date unit sales and higher average selling prices realized in our Domestic Homebuilding operations. However, the number of loans for 2000 was down 2% from 1999 levels due to competitive market conditions and rising mortgage interest rates during the last six months of 1999 and first three quarters of 2000. Our home buying customers continue to account for the majority of total loan production, representing 79% of total PMC unit production for 2001, compared with 83% in 2000 and 79% in 1999. Refinancings represented 10% of total loan production in 2001, compared with 2% in 2000 and 4% during 1999. At December 31, 2001, loan application backlog increased 54% to $827 million as compared to $536 million and $499 million at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. 21 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Financial Services Operations (continued): Mortgage Banking (continued): Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2001, increased 49% to $28.3 million, due to increases in volume, capture rate and secondary marketing gains. The addition of Del Webbs mortgage operations for the last five months of 2001 contributed approximately 8% of this increase. Pricing and marketing gains increased $17.4 million, or 71%, from the same period in 2000, primarily due to a consistent drop in interest rates throughout 2001. As compared with 2000, net interest income increased $3.1 million to $5.0 million during 2001 due to increased production and a steeper yield curve as a result of the drop in interest rates during 2001. Offsetting these gains was an increase in SGA expenses of $10 million as a result of increased headcount and other related costs due to the increase in volume during 2001. Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2000, was unchanged from 1999, as increases in origination fees and other income were offset by decreases in pricing and marketing gains and net interest income. During 2000, origination fees increased $1.6 million, or 23%, over the prior year due primarily to an increase in brokered loans. Pricing and marketing gains decreased $3.6 million, or 13%, from the same period in 1999, primarily due to competitive market conditions for much of 2000. As compared with 1999, net interest income decreased 17% to $1.8 million during 2000 as a result of a drop in funded production and a higher cost of funds due to a new warehouse line that became effective March 31, 2000. During 2000, we recognized increased equity income from our minority interest in a Mexican mortgage banking company, and also recognized income from mortgage reinsurance operations. Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, requires companies to recognize all of their derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship, and further, on the type of hedging relationship. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company must designate the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. We hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed mortgage loans with derivative financial instruments. For the year ended December 31, 2001, we did not recognize any net gains or losses related to the ineffective portion of the hedging instrument excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We also did not recognize any gains or losses during 2001, for cash flow hedges that were discontinued because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur. At December 31, 2001, we expect to reclassify $592,000, net of taxes, of net losses on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next twelve months from sales of closed mortgage loans. Financing Activities: Our secured financing operations, which were conducted by a limited purpose subsidiary of PFCI, ceased operations during 1999. During the first quarter of 1999, we recognized a net gain of approximately $1.7 million in connection with the sale of its remaining mortgage backed securities portfolio. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Corporate: Corporate is a non operating business segment whose primary purpose is to support the operations of our subsidiaries as the internal source of financing, to develop and implement strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies, and to provide the administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity. As a result, the corporate segments operating results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve. The following table presents this segments results of operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Net interest expense $ 34,261 $ 28,987 $ 22,824 Other corporate expenses, net 23,191 27,309 28,160 Loss before income taxes $ 57,452 $ 56,296 $ 50,984 An increase in net interest expense offset by a decrease in other corporate expenses, net, resulted in a 2% increase in the net loss for the Corporate segment. The increase in the corporate net interest spread, which is net of interest capitalized into inventory, is attributable to a higher debt balance as a result of the Del Webb merger and the issuance in February 2001 of $200 million and in August 2001 of $500 million in Senior Notes, primarily for use in repaying certain indebtedness acquired from Del Webb (see Del Webb Merger). The decrease in other corporate expenses, net in 2001 is primarily due to the effect of the write down of a commercial land position in 2000. The increase in 2000 of the pre tax loss to $56.3 million was primarily a result of an increase in net interest expense. Increases in net interest expense were attributed to higher average use of our unsecured revolving credit facility in addition to the April 2000 issuance of $175 million Senior Notes. Interest incurred for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, excluding interest incurred by our financial services operations, was approximately $116.9, $62.8 and $49.5 million, respectively. Corporate net interest expense is net of amounts capitalized into homebuilding inventories. Interest is amortized to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. Interest in inventory at December 31, 2001, increased primarily as a result of higher levels of indebtedness and the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Information related to Corporate interest capitalized into inventory is as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Interest in inventory at beginning of year $ 24,202 $ 19,092 $ 16,356 Interest capitalized 80,399 33,129 27,923 Interest expensed (36,006 ) (28,019 ) (25,187 ) Interest in inventory at end of year $ 68,595 $ 24,202 $ 19,092 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources: Continuing Operations: Our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2001, was $418,796,000 as higher net income was offset by increases in inventory and residential mortgage loans available for sale over 2000 and the resolution of the First Heights litigation. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2001 increased primarily due to the net cash acquired from Del Webb. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $297,131,000 as proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes of $200 million and $500 million, and increased borrowings under the revolving credit arrangements, were offset by the repayment of debt acquired from Del Webb (see Del Webb Merger). Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2000, amounted to $23,322,000. Increases in inventory, other assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities during 2000 were less than during 1999, and were offset by a larger increase in residential mortgage loans available for sale. Net cash used in investing activities was $5,185,000 for 2000. The effects of PFCIs sale of the underlying collateral of its mortgage backed securities portfolio and the purchase of BREs interest in the net assets of our active adult joint venture are reflected in 1999. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2000, was $114,051,000, as compared to a use of cash of $87,642,000 in 1999. These increased cash flows primarily reflect our issuance of $175 million Senior Notes in April 2000 and issuance of common stock pursuant to our employee stock option plans, offset by stock repurchases. We finance homebuilding land acquisition, development and construction activities from internally generated funds and existing credit agreements. We had $110 million outstanding under our $560 million unsecured revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2001. PMC provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available through various committed and uncommitted credit arrangements which, at December 31, 2001, amounted to $450 million, an amount deemed adequate to cover foreseeable needs. There were approximately $410 million of borrowings outstanding under the PMC arrangements at December 31, 2001. Mortgage loans originated by PMC are subsequently sold. We anticipate that there will be adequate mortgage financing available for purchasers of our homes. In February 2001, we sold $200 million of 8 1/8% Senior Notes, due 2011 from an active $500 million shelf registration. The net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes were used to repay short term borrowings under our revolving bank credit arrangements and for general corporate purposes. In August 2001, we sold in a private placement, $500 million of 7 7/8% Senior Notes due in 2011 and subsequently filed an S 4 Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in December 2001. Net proceeds received from the sale were used to repay certain indebtedness acquired in the Del Webb transaction, to pay certain expenses associated with that transaction and for general corporate purposes. Our income tax liabilities are affected by a number of factors. In 2001, our effective tax rate was 38.50% compared to 38.50% in 2000 and 37.75% in 1999. Our lower effective income tax rate in 1999 resulted from a lower effective state tax rate and the favorable resolution of various state income tax matters. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2002 will be approximately 39%. At December 31, 2001, we had cash and equivalents of $72.1 million and total long term indebtedness of $1.7 billion. Our total long term indebtedness includes $1.4 billion of unsecured Senior Notes, $368.6 million of unsecured Senior Subordinated Notes, other limited recourse debt of $15 million and other non recourse short term notes payable of $60.7 million. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): Continuing Operations (continued): The following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2001: Payments Due by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 After 2006 Contractual obligations: Guarantor short term borrowings $ 110,000 $ 110,000 $ $ $ Non guarantor short term borrowings 413,675 413,675 Long term indebtedness 1,737,869 3,147 395,606 198,339 1,140,777 Operating leases 102,423 30,505 33,618 17,673 20,627 Total contractual obligations $ 2,363,967 $ 557,327 $ 429,224 $ 216,012 $ 1,161,404 The following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2001: Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 After 2006 Other commercial commitments: Guarantor revolving credit facilities $ 560,000 $ $ $ 560,000 $ Non guarantor revolving credit facilities 450,000 225,000 225,000 Standby letters of credit 125,617 107,841 16,825 951 Total commercial commitments $ 1,135,617 $ 332,841 $ 241,825 $ 560,951 $ Standby letters of credit and performance bonds are used to guarantee our performance under various contracts, principally in connection with the development of our projects. The expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related project. If the obligations related to the project are ongoing, annual extensions are granted on a year to year basis. Performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These bonds, which approximated $775 million at December 31, 2001, are typically outstanding over a period that approximates 3 5 years. In the normal course of business, we acquire rights under options or option type agreements to purchase land to be used in homebuilding operations at future dates. These rights, which may be cancelled at our discretion, may extend over several years and are typically secured by small deposits. Further, these rights are frequently extended or renegotiated to better match the needs of our homebuilding operations. The total purchase price applicable to approved land under option for use by our homebuilding operations at future dates approximated $1.1 billion at December 31, 2001, which represented approximately 35,000 lots. In addition, there were approximately 25,000 lots valued at $644 million under option at December 31, 2001, pending approval, that are under review and evaluation for future use by our homebuilding operations. Sources of our working capital at December 31, 2001, include our cash and equivalents, our $560 million committed unsecured revolving credit facilities and PMCs $450 million revolving credit facilities. Our debt to total capitalization, excluding our non guarantor asset secured borrowings, was 44.8% as of December 31, 2001. We expect to manage our debt to total capitalization to the 40% level by the end of 2002. It is our intent to exercise, over time, the early call provisions of the Senior Subordinated Notes issued by Del Webb, as allowed under these notes. We routinely monitor current operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate the use of available financial sources, including securities offerings. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): Del Webb Merger: On July 31, 2001, we merged with Del Webb Corporation as discussed in Note 3 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. At closing, we paid off and cancelled Del Webbs revolving credit facility, which had a balance outstanding of approximately $300 million at closing. Under the terms of Del Webbs $100 million, 9 3/4%, due 2003, Senior Subordinated Notes, we exercised our option to redeem the entire bond issuance at par during the third quarter of 2001. Under the terms of Del Webbs other Senior Subordinated Notes, we were required, as a result of the change in control, to offer to purchase four series of its Senior Subordinated Notes. As of December 31, 2001, we had repurchased, through tender offers and open market purchases, $127 million of these Notes. Under the terms of Del Webbs $150 million 9 3/4%, due 2008, Senior Subordinated Notes, we exercised our optional right to redeem the remaining outstanding balance of $122 million at the price stipulated in the indenture by placing with the trustee as of December 31, 2001, sufficient proceeds to satisfy a January 15, 2002, final payoff. Inflation: We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation also increases our financing, labor and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices. To date, inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies: The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements, giving due regard to materiality. Inventory valuation: Our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated cost or net realizable value. Included in inventories are all direct development costs. We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories and charge the interest to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. This period increased in 2001 due to the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated cost, unless they are determined to be impaired, in which case these inventories are measured at fair value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory adjustments may be required. Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis or on a relative sales value basis as cost of sales. Under the specific identification basis, units are assigned an average cost by project based on actual costs to date plus the estimated cost of completion. Units costed using the relative sales value basis are assigned cost based on the sales value of the unit in relation to the total estimated sales value of the project. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued): Goodwill and Intangible Assets: Goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed by management for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $467 million at the end of 2001, which represented 8% of total assets. The majority of these assets resulted from the acquisition of Del Webb in 2001. Del Webb has a long history of operating success and profitability, has well recognized brand names and holds a significant position in the active adult market which should continue in the future. The integration of Del Webb should enable the combined businesses to accelerate the pace of land absorptions, enhance the visibility of the Del Webb and Sun City brand names and obtain the synergies of enhanced purchasing leverage, complementary product offerings and combined operations in the future. Changes in strategy and or market conditions could impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our long term debt to the extent long term rates decline. The following tables set forth, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, our long term debt obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value ($000s omitted).

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) PMC, operating as a mortgage banker, is also subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed upon terms (i.e., commits to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2001 and 2000, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float. We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to the Federal Funds rate and (ii) hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments with off balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in long term mortgage rates of plus 50, 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results. Our aggregate net equity investment in Mexico approximated $61.1 million at December 31, 2001. This investment, which is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk, could devalue by as much as $10 million in 2002, assuming a hypothetical 18% annualized devaluation of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar during 2002. Our aggregate net investment in Argentina approximated $20.1 million at December 31, 2001. This investment is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. It is unclear at this time how the Argentine financial and currency markets will be affected in 2002 as a result of the Argentine governments decision to de link the valuation of the Argentine peso from the U. S. dollar. It is therefore unclear what effect this may have on the continuing value of our investment in Argentina. SPECIAL NOTES CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS As a cautionary note, except for the historical information contained herein, certain matters discussed in Item 7., Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such matters involve risks and uncertainties, including: our exposure to certain market risks, changes in economic conditions, tax and interest rates, increases in raw material and labor costs, issues and timing surrounding land entitlement and development, weather conditions, government regulations and environmental matters, as well as, general competitive factors, that may cause actual results to differ materially; and our ability to integrate the recently acquired business operations of Del Webb Corporation, including Del Webbs activities, management and corporate culture, with our own, and our ability to develop and manage large scale active adult communities which differ from our historical homebuilding business. 28 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding Operations (continued): Domestic Homebuilding (continued): Gross profit margins in 2001 increased 120 basis points over 2000 to 20.0%, including the effect of purchase accounting associated with the Del Webb merger. Excluding the effect of purchase accounting, gross margins in 2001 would have been 20.2%. Gross profit margins in 2000 increased to 18.8%, up 100 basis points over 1999. Factors that contributed to this favorable trend include strong customer demand, positive home pricing, the benefits of leverage buy purchasing activities and effective production and inventory management. Land sales increased over each of the prior three years representing our land development core competency which includes development and entitlement of certain land positions for sale primarily to other homebuilders, as well as to retail and commercial establishments. Revenues and their related gains/losses may vary significantly between periods, depending on the timing of future land sales. We continue to rationalize certain existing land positions to ensure the most effective use of invested capital. For the year ended December 31, 2001, selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA), as a percentage of home settlement revenues, increased 42 basis points to 9.37% after increasing 35 basis points to 8.95% in 2000. Higher startup costs for new communities, increased compensation related costs, local market advertising expenses and the inclusion of Del Webbs operations are the primary reasons for the increase in 2001. The increase in 2000 reflects higher sales and marketing expenses, and startup costs associated with the opening of new communities. Other expense, net increased to $16,851,000 in 2001 as a result of increased land inventory valuation reserves for certain land positions and amortization of tradenames and trademarks acquired in the merger with Del Webb. The increase from 1999 to 2000 represents an increase in various market level non operational expenditures. Our Domestic Homebuilding operations controlled approximately 116,000 and 74,900 lots, of which approximately 81,200 and 40,800 lots were owned, and approximately 34,800 and 34,100 lots were controlled through option agreements at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Domestic Homebuilding inventory at December 31, 2001, was approximately $3.7 billion of which $2.8 billion is related to land and land development. At December 31, 2000, inventory was approximately $1.8 billion of which $1.3 billion was related to land and land development. Included in other assets is approximately $223.5 million in land held for disposition as of December 31, 2001, as compared to $88.3 million in the prior year. International Homebuilding: International Homebuilding operations are primarily conducted through subsidiaries of Pulte International Corporation (International) in Mexico, Puerto Rico and Argentina. Mexico Internationals 100% owned subsidiary, Pulte International Mexico, Inc., conducts its operations primarily through five joint ventures located throughout Mexico. Its net investment in these joint ventures approximated $47.7 million at December 31, 2001. The largest of these ventures, Condak Pulte S. De R.L. De C.V. (Condak Pulte), is based in Cuidad Juarez. Condak Pulte is currently developing communities in Juarez, Chihuahua, Nuevo Laredo, Monterrey, Reynosa, Saltillo and Matamoros, under agreements with Delphi Automotive Systems, Gigante, S.A. de C.V. and Centro Comerciales Soriana, S.A. De C. V. As of December 31, 2001, Internationals net investment in Condak Pulte approximated $38.9 million. Desarrollos Residenciales Turisticos, S.A. de C.V., another of its joint ventures in Mexico, is constructing primarily social interest housing in Central Mexico. Current development plans for this venture include housing projects in the Bajio region surrounding Mexico City, targeting the cities of Celaya, Leon, Puebla, Queretaro, San Jose du Iturbide and San Juan del Rio. At December 31, 2001, Internationals net investment in this joint venture approximated $7.2 million. Effective January 1, 2002, Pulte International reorganized its structure within Mexico to create a single company, Pulte Mexico, which ranks as one of the largest builders in the country. The new operating structure will facilitate growth, enable operating leverage and improve efficiencies through standardized systems and procedures. The new company, which combines several entities, including Condak Pulte and DRT, will be consolidated into our financial statements. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding Operations (continued): International Homebuilding (continued): Puerto Rico Operations in Puerto Rico are primarily conducted through Internationals 100% owned subsidiary, Pulte International Caribbean Corporation. Desarrolladores Urbanos (Canovanas), S.E., its Puerto Rican joint venture, is developing 121 acres located in Metropolitan San Juan. At December 31, 2001, its net investment in this joint venture approximated $3.8 million. Argentina Operations in Argentina are conducted through Pulte SRL, Internationals 100% owned Argentine subsidiary which recorded its first closings during the second quarter of 2001. The following table presents selected financial data for Pultes International Homebuilding operations for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Revenues $ 35,169 $ 27,159 $ 21,941 Cost of sales (30,937 ) (24,611 ) (20,337 ) Selling, general and administrative expense (11,820 ) (5,621 ) (4,588 ) Other income, net 66 967 2,522 Equity in income of Mexico operations 5,138 5,455 6,000 Pre tax income (loss) $ (2,384 ) $ 3,349 $ 5,538 Unit settlements: Pulte 221 264 262 Pulte affiliated entities 7,258 7,718 6,512 7,479 7,982 6,774 Increased revenues in 2001 are due to the opening of operations in Argentina and a higher average selling price for our Puerto Rican operations. The higher average selling price in Puerto Rico, which results from concentrating more in middle market housing than in social interest housing, was offset by a decrease in closings from 264 in 2000 to 176 in 2001. Increased revenues in 2000 from 1999 are also attributable to this shift in focus. Results in 1999 benefited from a $2,400,000 land sale gain. SGA expense increased $6,199,000 in 2001 as a result of the start up of the Argentine operations. The Argentine operations recorded a $463,000 foreign currency transaction loss in 2001 as a result of the Argentine governments decision to de link the valuation of the Argentine peso from the U. S. dollar. We also recorded a foreign currency translation loss of $14,110,000, net of income taxes of $8,833,000, as a component of other comprehensive income in 2001. It is unclear at this time how the Argentine financial and currency markets will be affected in 2002. It is also unclear how the current economic situation may affect customer homebuying attitudes and the homebuilding business in general. In 2001, the Mexican operations were affected by changes in government lending practices, which slowed mortgage funding, resulting in lower closings than in 2000. It is anticipated that the rate of mortgage funding in Mexico will accelerate in 2002, which should increase the pace of closings over what was experienced in 2001. Our Mexican joint venture operations recorded 7,718 closings in 2000, representing a 19% increase over comparable 1999 results. Our share of pre tax income of $5,455,000 for 2000 for the Mexican joint ventures was slightly lower than the $6,000,000 recorded in 1999 as earnings in 1999 included currency gains of $1,702,000 versus currency losses of $78,000 for 2000. Currency losses in Mexico amounted to $378,000 in 2001. Eliminating the impact of the currency gains and losses, operating income for our Mexican operations increased by approximately 29% in 2000. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Financial Services Operations: We conduct our financial services operations principally through Pulte Mortgage Corporation (PMC), our mortgage banking subsidiary and during 1999, through Pulte Financial Companies, Inc. (PFCI). Pre tax income of our financial services operations is as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Pre tax income: Mortgage banking $ 28,331 $ 19,009 $ 19,017 Financing activities 1,811 Pre tax income $ 28,331 $ 19,009 $ 20,828 Mortgage Banking: Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Total originations: Loans 19,018 13,415 13,728 Principal $ 2,937,100 $ 1,957,300 $ 1,908,200 Originations for Pulte customers: Loans 13,786 11,109 10,858 Principal $ 2,131,000 $ 1,697,600 $ 1,558,400 We sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts. Due to the short period of time the servicing rights are held, usually three to four months, we do not amortize the servicing asset. Since the servicing rights are recorded at the value in the servicing sales contracts, there are no impairment issues related to these assets. We also originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various credit arrangements, and then sell such mortgage loans to outside investors. Mortgage origination principal volume for the year ended December 31, 2001, increased 50% over 2000, which benefited from an increase in the capture rate of 400 basis points to 60%, an increased average loan size and the inclusion of Del Webbs mortgage operations, which accounted for approximately 13% of the increase. Origination unit volume increased 42% due to the same factors. Mortgage origination principal volume in 2000 increased 3% over 1999, due to increases in year to date unit sales and higher average selling prices realized in our Domestic Homebuilding operations. However, the number of loans for 2000 was down 2% from 1999 levels due to competitive market conditions and rising mortgage interest rates during the last six months of 1999 and first three quarters of 2000. Our home buying customers continue to account for the majority of total loan production, representing 79% of total PMC unit production for 2001, compared with 83% in 2000 and 79% in 1999. Refinancings represented 10% of total loan production in 2001, compared with 2% in 2000 and 4% during 1999. At December 31, 2001, loan application backlog increased 54% to $827 million as compared to $536 million and $499 million at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. 21 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Financial Services Operations (continued): Mortgage Banking (continued): Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2001, increased 49% to $28.3 million, due to increases in volume, capture rate and secondary marketing gains. The addition of Del Webbs mortgage operations for the last five months of 2001 contributed approximately 8% of this increase. Pricing and marketing gains increased $17.4 million, or 71%, from the same period in 2000, primarily due to a consistent drop in interest rates throughout 2001. As compared with 2000, net interest income increased $3.1 million to $5.0 million during 2001 due to increased production and a steeper yield curve as a result of the drop in interest rates during 2001. Offsetting these gains was an increase in SGA expenses of $10 million as a result of increased headcount and other related costs due to the increase in volume during 2001. Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2000, was unchanged from 1999, as increases in origination fees and other income were offset by decreases in pricing and marketing gains and net interest income. During 2000, origination fees increased $1.6 million, or 23%, over the prior year due primarily to an increase in brokered loans. Pricing and marketing gains decreased $3.6 million, or 13%, from the same period in 1999, primarily due to competitive market conditions for much of 2000. As compared with 1999, net interest income decreased 17% to $1.8 million during 2000 as a result of a drop in funded production and a higher cost of funds due to a new warehouse line that became effective March 31, 2000. During 2000, we recognized increased equity income from our minority interest in a Mexican mortgage banking company, and also recognized income from mortgage reinsurance operations. Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, requires companies to recognize all of their derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship, and further, on the type of hedging relationship. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company must designate the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. We hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed mortgage loans with derivative financial instruments. For the year ended December 31, 2001, we did not recognize any net gains or losses related to the ineffective portion of the hedging instrument excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We also did not recognize any gains or losses during 2001, for cash flow hedges that were discontinued because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur. At December 31, 2001, we expect to reclassify $592,000, net of taxes, of net losses on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next twelve months from sales of closed mortgage loans. Financing Activities: Our secured financing operations, which were conducted by a limited purpose subsidiary of PFCI, ceased operations during 1999. During the first quarter of 1999, we recognized a net gain of approximately $1.7 million in connection with the sale of its remaining mortgage backed securities portfolio. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Corporate: Corporate is a non operating business segment whose primary purpose is to support the operations of our subsidiaries as the internal source of financing, to develop and implement strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies, and to provide the administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity. As a result, the corporate segments operating results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve. The following table presents this segments results of operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Net interest expense $ 34,261 $ 28,987 $ 22,824 Other corporate expenses, net 23,191 27,309 28,160 Loss before income taxes $ 57,452 $ 56,296 $ 50,984 An increase in net interest expense offset by a decrease in other corporate expenses, net, resulted in a 2% increase in the net loss for the Corporate segment. The increase in the corporate net interest spread, which is net of interest capitalized into inventory, is attributable to a higher debt balance as a result of the Del Webb merger and the issuance in February 2001 of $200 million and in August 2001 of $500 million in Senior Notes, primarily for use in repaying certain indebtedness acquired from Del Webb (see Del Webb Merger). The decrease in other corporate expenses, net in 2001 is primarily due to the effect of the write down of a commercial land position in 2000. The increase in 2000 of the pre tax loss to $56.3 million was primarily a result of an increase in net interest expense. Increases in net interest expense were attributed to higher average use of our unsecured revolving credit facility in addition to the April 2000 issuance of $175 million Senior Notes. Interest incurred for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, excluding interest incurred by our financial services operations, was approximately $116.9, $62.8 and $49.5 million, respectively. Corporate net interest expense is net of amounts capitalized into homebuilding inventories. Interest is amortized to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. Interest in inventory at December 31, 2001, increased primarily as a result of higher levels of indebtedness and the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Information related to Corporate interest capitalized into inventory is as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Interest in inventory at beginning of year $ 24,202 $ 19,092 $ 16,356 Interest capitalized 80,399 33,129 27,923 Interest expensed (36,006 ) (28,019 ) (25,187 ) Interest in inventory at end of year $ 68,595 $ 24,202 $ 19,092 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources: Continuing Operations: Our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2001, was $418,796,000 as higher net income was offset by increases in inventory and residential mortgage loans available for sale over 2000 and the resolution of the First Heights litigation. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2001 increased primarily due to the net cash acquired from Del Webb. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $297,131,000 as proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes of $200 million and $500 million, and increased borrowings under the revolving credit arrangements, were offset by the repayment of debt acquired from Del Webb (see Del Webb Merger). Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2000, amounted to $23,322,000. Increases in inventory, other assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities during 2000 were less than during 1999, and were offset by a larger increase in residential mortgage loans available for sale. Net cash used in investing activities was $5,185,000 for 2000. The effects of PFCIs sale of the underlying collateral of its mortgage backed securities portfolio and the purchase of BREs interest in the net assets of our active adult joint venture are reflected in 1999. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2000, was $114,051,000, as compared to a use of cash of $87,642,000 in 1999. These increased cash flows primarily reflect our issuance of $175 million Senior Notes in April 2000 and issuance of common stock pursuant to our employee stock option plans, offset by stock repurchases. We finance homebuilding land acquisition, development and construction activities from internally generated funds and existing credit agreements. We had $110 million outstanding under our $560 million unsecured revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2001. PMC provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available through various committed and uncommitted credit arrangements which, at December 31, 2001, amounted to $450 million, an amount deemed adequate to cover foreseeable needs. There were approximately $410 million of borrowings outstanding under the PMC arrangements at December 31, 2001. Mortgage loans originated by PMC are subsequently sold. We anticipate that there will be adequate mortgage financing available for purchasers of our homes. In February 2001, we sold $200 million of 8 1/8% Senior Notes, due 2011 from an active $500 million shelf registration. The net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes were used to repay short term borrowings under our revolving bank credit arrangements and for general corporate purposes. In August 2001, we sold in a private placement, $500 million of 7 7/8% Senior Notes due in 2011 and subsequently filed an S 4 Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in December 2001. Net proceeds received from the sale were used to repay certain indebtedness acquired in the Del Webb transaction, to pay certain expenses associated with that transaction and for general corporate purposes. Our income tax liabilities are affected by a number of factors. In 2001, our effective tax rate was 38.50% compared to 38.50% in 2000 and 37.75% in 1999. Our lower effective income tax rate in 1999 resulted from a lower effective state tax rate and the favorable resolution of various state income tax matters. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2002 will be approximately 39%. At December 31, 2001, we had cash and equivalents of $72.1 million and total long term indebtedness of $1.7 billion. Our total long term indebtedness includes $1.4 billion of unsecured Senior Notes, $368.6 million of unsecured Senior Subordinated Notes, other limited recourse debt of $15 million and other non recourse short term notes payable of $60.7 million. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): Continuing Operations (continued): The following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2001: Payments Due by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 After 2006 Contractual obligations: Guarantor short term borrowings $ 110,000 $ 110,000 $ $ $ Non guarantor short term borrowings 413,675 413,675 Long term indebtedness 1,737,869 3,147 395,606 198,339 1,140,777 Operating leases 102,423 30,505 33,618 17,673 20,627 Total contractual obligations $ 2,363,967 $ 557,327 $ 429,224 $ 216,012 $ 1,161,404 The following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2001: Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 After 2006 Other commercial commitments: Guarantor revolving credit facilities $ 560,000 $ $ $ 560,000 $ Non guarantor revolving credit facilities 450,000 225,000 225,000 Standby letters of credit 125,617 107,841 16,825 951 Total commercial commitments $ 1,135,617 $ 332,841 $ 241,825 $ 560,951 $ Standby letters of credit and performance bonds are used to guarantee our performance under various contracts, principally in connection with the development of our projects. The expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related project. If the obligations related to the project are ongoing, annual extensions are granted on a year to year basis. Performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These bonds, which approximated $775 million at December 31, 2001, are typically outstanding over a period that approximates 3 5 years. In the normal course of business, we acquire rights under options or option type agreements to purchase land to be used in homebuilding operations at future dates. These rights, which may be cancelled at our discretion, may extend over several years and are typically secured by small deposits. Further, these rights are frequently extended or renegotiated to better match the needs of our homebuilding operations. The total purchase price applicable to approved land under option for use by our homebuilding operations at future dates approximated $1.1 billion at December 31, 2001, which represented approximately 35,000 lots. In addition, there were approximately 25,000 lots valued at $644 million under option at December 31, 2001, pending approval, that are under review and evaluation for future use by our homebuilding operations. Sources of our working capital at December 31, 2001, include our cash and equivalents, our $560 million committed unsecured revolving credit facilities and PMCs $450 million revolving credit facilities. Our debt to total capitalization, excluding our non guarantor asset secured borrowings, was 44.8% as of December 31, 2001. We expect to manage our debt to total capitalization to the 40% level by the end of 2002. It is our intent to exercise, over time, the early call provisions of the Senior Subordinated Notes issued by Del Webb, as allowed under these notes. We routinely monitor current operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate the use of available financial sources, including securities offerings. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): Del Webb Merger: On July 31, 2001, we merged with Del Webb Corporation as discussed in Note 3 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. At closing, we paid off and cancelled Del Webbs revolving credit facility, which had a balance outstanding of approximately $300 million at closing. Under the terms of Del Webbs $100 million, 9 3/4%, due 2003, Senior Subordinated Notes, we exercised our option to redeem the entire bond issuance at par during the third quarter of 2001. Under the terms of Del Webbs other Senior Subordinated Notes, we were required, as a result of the change in control, to offer to purchase four series of its Senior Subordinated Notes. As of December 31, 2001, we had repurchased, through tender offers and open market purchases, $127 million of these Notes. Under the terms of Del Webbs $150 million 9 3/4%, due 2008, Senior Subordinated Notes, we exercised our optional right to redeem the remaining outstanding balance of $122 million at the price stipulated in the indenture by placing with the trustee as of December 31, 2001, sufficient proceeds to satisfy a January 15, 2002, final payoff. Inflation: We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation also increases our financing, labor and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices. To date, inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies: The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements, giving due regard to materiality. Inventory valuation: Our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated cost or net realizable value. Included in inventories are all direct development costs. We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories and charge the interest to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. This period increased in 2001 due to the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated cost, unless they are determined to be impaired, in which case these inventories are measured at fair value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory adjustments may be required. Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis or on a relative sales value basis as cost of sales. Under the specific identification basis, units are assigned an average cost by project based on actual costs to date plus the estimated cost of completion. Units costed using the relative sales value basis are assigned cost based on the sales value of the unit in relation to the total estimated sales value of the project. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued): Goodwill and Intangible Assets: Goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed by management for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $467 million at the end of 2001, which represented 8% of total assets. The majority of these assets resulted from the acquisition of Del Webb in 2001. Del Webb has a long history of operating success and profitability, has well recognized brand names and holds a significant position in the active adult market which should continue in the future. The integration of Del Webb should enable the combined businesses to accelerate the pace of land absorptions, enhance the visibility of the Del Webb and Sun City brand names and obtain the synergies of enhanced purchasing leverage, complementary product offerings and combined operations in the future. Changes in strategy and or market conditions could impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our long term debt to the extent long term rates decline. The following tables set forth, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, our long term debt obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value ($000s omitted). As of December 31, 2001 for the Years ended December 31, There Fair 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 after Total Value Rate sensitive liabilities: Fixed interest rate debt: Pulte Homes, Inc., public debt instruments $ $ 275,000 $ 112,000 $ 125,000 $ 69,810 $ 1,130,887 $ 1,712,697 $ 1,744,726 Average interest rate 8.59 % 8.38 % 7.30 % 9.00 % 8.37 % 8.36 % Pulte Home Corporation, other non recourse debt $ 3,147 $ 6,100 $ 3,000 $ 2,758 $ $ $ 15,005 $ 15,005 Average interest rate 4.48 % 7.78 % 9.00 % 9.00 % 7.56 % As of December 31, 2000 for the Years ended December 31, There Fair 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 after Total Value Rate sensitive liabilities: Fixed interest rate debt: Pulte Homes, Inc., public debt instruments $ $ $ 275,000 $ 112,000 $ 125,000 $ 150,000 $ 662,000 $ 635,855 Average interest rate 8.59 % 8.38 % 7.30 % 7.63 % 8.09 % Pulte Diversified Companies, Inc., unsecured promissory note $ 7,000 $ 7,000 $ 7,000 Average interest rate 8.00 % 8.00 % Pulte Home Corporation, other non recourse debt $ 10,878 $ 428 $ 11,306 $ 11,306 Average interest rate 7.51 % 3.00 % 7.34 % 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) PMC, operating as a mortgage banker, is also subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed upon terms (i.e., commits to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2001 and 2000, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float. We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to the Federal Funds rate and (ii) hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments with off balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in long term mortgage rates of plus 50, 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results. Our aggregate net equity investment in Mexico approximated $61.1 million at December 31, 2001. This investment, which is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk, could devalue by as much as $10 million in 2002, assuming a hypothetical 18% annualized devaluation of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar during 2002. Our aggregate net investment in Argentina approximated $20.1 million at December 31, 2001. This investment is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. It is unclear at this time how the Argentine financial and currency markets will be affected in 2002 as a result of the Argentine governments decision to de link the valuation of the Argentine peso from the U. S. dollar. It is therefore unclear what effect this may have on the continuing value of our investment in Argentina. SPECIAL NOTES CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS As a cautionary note, except for the historical information contained herein, certain matters discussed in Item 7., Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such matters involve risks and uncertainties, including: our exposure to certain market risks, changes in economic conditions, tax and interest rates, increases in raw material and labor costs, issues and timing surrounding land entitlement and development, weather conditions, government regulations and environmental matters, as well as, general competitive factors, that may cause actual results to differ materially; and our ability to integrate the recently acquired business operations of Del Webb Corporation, including Del Webbs activities, management and corporate culture, with our own, and our ability to develop and manage large scale active adult communities which differ from our historical homebuilding business. 28 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding Operations (continued): International Homebuilding (continued): Puerto Rico Operations in Puerto Rico are primarily conducted through Internationals 100% owned subsidiary, Pulte International Caribbean Corporation. Desarrolladores Urbanos (Canovanas), S.E., its Puerto Rican joint venture, is developing 121 acres located in Metropolitan San Juan. At December 31, 2001, its net investment in this joint venture approximated $3.8 million. Argentina Operations in Argentina are conducted through Pulte SRL, Internationals 100% owned Argentine subsidiary which recorded its first closings during the second quarter of 2001. The following table presents selected financial data for Pultes International Homebuilding operations for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Revenues $ 35,169 $ 27,159 $ 21,941 Cost of sales (30,937 ) (24,611 ) (20,337 ) Selling, general and administrative expense (11,820 ) (5,621 ) (4,588 ) Other income, net 66 967 2,522 Equity in income of Mexico operations 5,138 5,455 6,000 Pre tax income (loss) $ (2,384 ) $ 3,349 $ 5,538 Unit settlements: Pulte 221 264 262 Pulte affiliated entities 7,258 7,718 6,512 7,479 7,982 6,774 Increased revenues in 2001 are due to the opening of operations in Argentina and a higher average selling price for our Puerto Rican operations. The higher average selling price in Puerto Rico, which results from concentrating more in middle market housing than in social interest housing, was offset by a decrease in closings from 264 in 2000 to 176 in 2001. Increased revenues in 2000 from 1999 are also attributable to this shift in focus. Results in 1999 benefited from a $2,400,000 land sale gain. SGA expense increased $6,199,000 in 2001 as a result of the start up of the Argentine operations. The Argentine operations recorded a $463,000 foreign currency transaction loss in 2001 as a result of the Argentine governments decision to de link the valuation of the Argentine peso from the U. S. dollar. We also recorded a foreign currency translation loss of $14,110,000, net of income taxes of $8,833,000, as a component of other comprehensive income in 2001. It is unclear at this time how the Argentine financial and currency markets will be affected in 2002. It is also unclear how the current economic situation may affect customer homebuying attitudes and the homebuilding business in general. In 2001, the Mexican operations were affected by changes in government lending practices, which slowed mortgage funding, resulting in lower closings than in 2000. It is anticipated that the rate of mortgage funding in Mexico will accelerate in 2002, which should increase the pace of closings over what was experienced in 2001. Our Mexican joint venture operations recorded 7,718 closings in 2000, representing a 19% increase over comparable 1999 results. Our share of pre tax income of $5,455,000 for 2000 for the Mexican joint ventures was slightly lower than the $6,000,000 recorded in 1999 as earnings in 1999 included currency gains of $1,702,000 versus currency losses of $78,000 for 2000. Currency losses in Mexico amounted to $378,000 in 2001. Eliminating the impact of the currency gains and losses, operating income for our Mexican operations increased by approximately 29% in 2000. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Financial Services Operations: We conduct our financial services operations principally through Pulte Mortgage Corporation (PMC), our mortgage banking subsidiary and during 1999, through Pulte Financial Companies, Inc. (PFCI). Pre tax income of our financial services operations is as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Pre tax income: Mortgage banking $ 28,331 $ 19,009 $ 19,017 Financing activities 1,811 Pre tax income $ 28,331 $ 19,009 $ 20,828 Mortgage Banking: Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Total originations: Loans 19,018 13,415 13,728 Principal $ 2,937,100 $ 1,957,300 $ 1,908,200 Originations for Pulte customers: Loans 13,786 11,109 10,858 Principal $ 2,131,000 $ 1,697,600 $ 1,558,400 We sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts. Due to the short period of time the servicing rights are held, usually three to four months, we do not amortize the servicing asset. Since the servicing rights are recorded at the value in the servicing sales contracts, there are no impairment issues related to these assets. We also originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various credit arrangements, and then sell such mortgage loans to outside investors. Mortgage origination principal volume for the year ended December 31, 2001, increased 50% over 2000, which benefited from an increase in the capture rate of 400 basis points to 60%, an increased average loan size and the inclusion of Del Webbs mortgage operations, which accounted for approximately 13% of the increase. Origination unit volume increased 42% due to the same factors. Mortgage origination principal volume in 2000 increased 3% over 1999, due to increases in year to date unit sales and higher average selling prices realized in our Domestic Homebuilding operations. However, the number of loans for 2000 was down 2% from 1999 levels due to competitive market conditions and rising mortgage interest rates during the last six months of 1999 and first three quarters of 2000. Our home buying customers continue to account for the majority of total loan production, representing 79% of total PMC unit production for 2001, compared with 83% in 2000 and 79% in 1999. Refinancings represented 10% of total loan production in 2001, compared with 2% in 2000 and 4% during 1999. At December 31, 2001, loan application backlog increased 54% to $827 million as compared to $536 million and $499 million at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. 21 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Financial Services Operations (continued): Mortgage Banking (continued): Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2001, increased 49% to $28.3 million, due to increases in volume, capture rate and secondary marketing gains. The addition of Del Webbs mortgage operations for the last five months of 2001 contributed approximately 8% of this increase. Pricing and marketing gains increased $17.4 million, or 71%, from the same period in 2000, primarily due to a consistent drop in interest rates throughout 2001. As compared with 2000, net interest income increased $3.1 million to $5.0 million during 2001 due to increased production and a steeper yield curve as a result of the drop in interest rates during 2001. Offsetting these gains was an increase in SGA expenses of $10 million as a result of increased headcount and other related costs due to the increase in volume during 2001. Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2000, was unchanged from 1999, as increases in origination fees and other income were offset by decreases in pricing and marketing gains and net interest income. During 2000, origination fees increased $1.6 million, or 23%, over the prior year due primarily to an increase in brokered loans. Pricing and marketing gains decreased $3.6 million, or 13%, from the same period in 1999, primarily due to competitive market conditions for much of 2000. As compared with 1999, net interest income decreased 17% to $1.8 million during 2000 as a result of a drop in funded production and a higher cost of funds due to a new warehouse line that became effective March 31, 2000. During 2000, we recognized increased equity income from our minority interest in a Mexican mortgage banking company, and also recognized income from mortgage reinsurance operations. Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, requires companies to recognize all of their derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship, and further, on the type of hedging relationship. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company must designate the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. We hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed mortgage loans with derivative financial instruments. For the year ended December 31, 2001, we did not recognize any net gains or losses related to the ineffective portion of the hedging instrument excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We also did not recognize any gains or losses during 2001, for cash flow hedges that were discontinued because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur. At December 31, 2001, we expect to reclassify $592,000, net of taxes, of net losses on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next twelve months from sales of closed mortgage loans. Financing Activities: Our secured financing operations, which were conducted by a limited purpose subsidiary of PFCI, ceased operations during 1999. During the first quarter of 1999, we recognized a net gain of approximately $1.7 million in connection with the sale of its remaining mortgage backed securities portfolio. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Corporate: Corporate is a non operating business segment whose primary purpose is to support the operations of our subsidiaries as the internal source of financing, to develop and implement strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies, and to provide the administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity. As a result, the corporate segments operating results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve. The following table presents this segments results of operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Net interest expense $ 34,261 $ 28,987 $ 22,824 Other corporate expenses, net 23,191 27,309 28,160 Loss before income taxes $ 57,452 $ 56,296 $ 50,984 An increase in net interest expense offset by a decrease in other corporate expenses, net, resulted in a 2% increase in the net loss for the Corporate segment. The increase in the corporate net interest spread, which is net of interest capitalized into inventory, is attributable to a higher debt balance as a result of the Del Webb merger and the issuance in February 2001 of $200 million and in August 2001 of $500 million in Senior Notes, primarily for use in repaying certain indebtedness acquired from Del Webb (see Del Webb Merger). The decrease in other corporate expenses, net in 2001 is primarily due to the effect of the write down of a commercial land position in 2000. The increase in 2000 of the pre tax loss to $56.3 million was primarily a result of an increase in net interest expense. Increases in net interest expense were attributed to higher average use of our unsecured revolving credit facility in addition to the April 2000 issuance of $175 million Senior Notes. Interest incurred for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, excluding interest incurred by our financial services operations, was approximately $116.9, $62.8 and $49.5 million, respectively. Corporate net interest expense is net of amounts capitalized into homebuilding inventories. Interest is amortized to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. Interest in inventory at December 31, 2001, increased primarily as a result of higher levels of indebtedness and the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Information related to Corporate interest capitalized into inventory is as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Interest in inventory at beginning of year $ 24,202 $ 19,092 $ 16,356 Interest capitalized 80,399 33,129 27,923 Interest expensed (36,006 ) (28,019 ) (25,187 ) Interest in inventory at end of year $ 68,595 $ 24,202 $ 19,092 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources: Continuing Operations: Our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2001, was $418,796,000 as higher net income was offset by increases in inventory and residential mortgage loans available for sale over 2000 and the resolution of the First Heights litigation. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2001 increased primarily due to the net cash acquired from Del Webb. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $297,131,000 as proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes of $200 million and $500 million, and increased borrowings under the revolving credit arrangements, were offset by the repayment of debt acquired from Del Webb (see Del Webb Merger). Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2000, amounted to $23,322,000. Increases in inventory, other assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities during 2000 were less than during 1999, and were offset by a larger increase in residential mortgage loans available for sale. Net cash used in investing activities was $5,185,000 for 2000. The effects of PFCIs sale of the underlying collateral of its mortgage backed securities portfolio and the purchase of BREs interest in the net assets of our active adult joint venture are reflected in 1999. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2000, was $114,051,000, as compared to a use of cash of $87,642,000 in 1999. These increased cash flows primarily reflect our issuance of $175 million Senior Notes in April 2000 and issuance of common stock pursuant to our employee stock option plans, offset by stock repurchases. We finance homebuilding land acquisition, development and construction activities from internally generated funds and existing credit agreements. We had $110 million outstanding under our $560 million unsecured revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2001. PMC provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available through various committed and uncommitted credit arrangements which, at December 31, 2001, amounted to $450 million, an amount deemed adequate to cover foreseeable needs. There were approximately $410 million of borrowings outstanding under the PMC arrangements at December 31, 2001. Mortgage loans originated by PMC are subsequently sold. We anticipate that there will be adequate mortgage financing available for purchasers of our homes. In February 2001, we sold $200 million of 8 1/8% Senior Notes, due 2011 from an active $500 million shelf registration. The net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes were used to repay short term borrowings under our revolving bank credit arrangements and for general corporate purposes. In August 2001, we sold in a private placement, $500 million of 7 7/8% Senior Notes due in 2011 and subsequently filed an S 4 Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in December 2001. Net proceeds received from the sale were used to repay certain indebtedness acquired in the Del Webb transaction, to pay certain expenses associated with that transaction and for general corporate purposes. Our income tax liabilities are affected by a number of factors. In 2001, our effective tax rate was 38.50% compared to 38.50% in 2000 and 37.75% in 1999. Our lower effective income tax rate in 1999 resulted from a lower effective state tax rate and the favorable resolution of various state income tax matters. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2002 will be approximately 39%. At December 31, 2001, we had cash and equivalents of $72.1 million and total long term indebtedness of $1.7 billion. Our total long term indebtedness includes $1.4 billion of unsecured Senior Notes, $368.6 million of unsecured Senior Subordinated Notes, other limited recourse debt of $15 million and other non recourse short term notes payable of $60.7 million. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): Continuing Operations (continued): The following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2001: Payments Due by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 After 2006 Contractual obligations: Guarantor short term borrowings $ 110,000 $ 110,000 $ $ $ Non guarantor short term borrowings 413,675 413,675 Long term indebtedness 1,737,869 3,147 395,606 198,339 1,140,777 Operating leases 102,423 30,505 33,618 17,673 20,627 Total contractual obligations $ 2,363,967 $ 557,327 $ 429,224 $ 216,012 $ 1,161,404 The following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2001: Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 After 2006 Other commercial commitments: Guarantor revolving credit facilities $ 560,000 $ $ $ 560,000 $ Non guarantor revolving credit facilities 450,000 225,000 225,000 Standby letters of credit 125,617 107,841 16,825 951 Total commercial commitments $ 1,135,617 $ 332,841 $ 241,825 $ 560,951 $ Standby letters of credit and performance bonds are used to guarantee our performance under various contracts, principally in connection with the development of our projects. The expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related project. If the obligations related to the project are ongoing, annual extensions are granted on a year to year basis. Performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These bonds, which approximated $775 million at December 31, 2001, are typically outstanding over a period that approximates 3 5 years. In the normal course of business, we acquire rights under options or option type agreements to purchase land to be used in homebuilding operations at future dates. These rights, which may be cancelled at our discretion, may extend over several years and are typically secured by small deposits. Further, these rights are frequently extended or renegotiated to better match the needs of our homebuilding operations. The total purchase price applicable to approved land under option for use by our homebuilding operations at future dates approximated $1.1 billion at December 31, 2001, which represented approximately 35,000 lots. In addition, there were approximately 25,000 lots valued at $644 million under option at December 31, 2001, pending approval, that are under review and evaluation for future use by our homebuilding operations. Sources of our working capital at December 31, 2001, include our cash and equivalents, our $560 million committed unsecured revolving credit facilities and PMCs $450 million revolving credit facilities. Our debt to total capitalization, excluding our non guarantor asset secured borrowings, was 44.8% as of December 31, 2001. We expect to manage our debt to total capitalization to the 40% level by the end of 2002. It is our intent to exercise, over time, the early call provisions of the Senior Subordinated Notes issued by Del Webb, as allowed under these notes. We routinely monitor current operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate the use of available financial sources, including securities offerings. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): Del Webb Merger: On July 31, 2001, we merged with Del Webb Corporation as discussed in Note 3 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. At closing, we paid off and cancelled Del Webbs revolving credit facility, which had a balance outstanding of approximately $300 million at closing. Under the terms of Del Webbs $100 million, 9 3/4%, due 2003, Senior Subordinated Notes, we exercised our option to redeem the entire bond issuance at par during the third quarter of 2001. Under the terms of Del Webbs other Senior Subordinated Notes, we were required, as a result of the change in control, to offer to purchase four series of its Senior Subordinated Notes. As of December 31, 2001, we had repurchased, through tender offers and open market purchases, $127 million of these Notes. Under the terms of Del Webbs $150 million 9 3/4%, due 2008, Senior Subordinated Notes, we exercised our optional right to redeem the remaining outstanding balance of $122 million at the price stipulated in the indenture by placing with the trustee as of December 31, 2001, sufficient proceeds to satisfy a January 15, 2002, final payoff. Inflation: We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation also increases our financing, labor and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices. To date, inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies: The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements, giving due regard to materiality. Inventory valuation: Our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated cost or net realizable value. Included in inventories are all direct development costs. We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories and charge the interest to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. This period increased in 2001 due to the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated cost, unless they are determined to be impaired, in which case these inventories are measured at fair value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory adjustments may be required. Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis or on a relative sales value basis as cost of sales. Under the specific identification basis, units are assigned an average cost by project based on actual costs to date plus the estimated cost of completion. Units costed using the relative sales value basis are assigned cost based on the sales value of the unit in relation to the total estimated sales value of the project. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued): Goodwill and Intangible Assets: Goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed by management for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $467 million at the end of 2001, which represented 8% of total assets. The majority of these assets resulted from the acquisition of Del Webb in 2001. Del Webb has a long history of operating success and profitability, has well recognized brand names and holds a significant position in the active adult market which should continue in the future. The integration of Del Webb should enable the combined businesses to accelerate the pace of land absorptions, enhance the visibility of the Del Webb and Sun City brand names and obtain the synergies of enhanced purchasing leverage, complementary product offerings and combined operations in the future. Changes in strategy and or market conditions could impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our long term debt to the extent long term rates decline. The following tables set forth, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, our long term debt obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value ($000s omitted).

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) PMC, operating as a mortgage banker, is also subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed upon terms (i.e., commits to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2001 and 2000, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float. We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to the Federal Funds rate and (ii) hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments with off balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in long term mortgage rates of plus 50, 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results. Our aggregate net equity investment in Mexico approximated $61.1 million at December 31, 2001. This investment, which is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk, could devalue by as much as $10 million in 2002, assuming a hypothetical 18% annualized devaluation of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar during 2002. Our aggregate net investment in Argentina approximated $20.1 million at December 31, 2001. This investment is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. It is unclear at this time how the Argentine financial and currency markets will be affected in 2002 as a result of the Argentine governments decision to de link the valuation of the Argentine peso from the U. S. dollar. It is therefore unclear what effect this may have on the continuing value of our investment in Argentina. SPECIAL NOTES CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS As a cautionary note, except for the historical information contained herein, certain matters discussed in Item 7., Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such matters involve risks and uncertainties, including: our exposure to certain market risks, changes in economic conditions, tax and interest rates, increases in raw material and labor costs, issues and timing surrounding land entitlement and development, weather conditions, government regulations and environmental matters, as well as, general competitive factors, that may cause actual results to differ materially; and our ability to integrate the recently acquired business operations of Del Webb Corporation, including Del Webbs activities, management and corporate culture, with our own, and our ability to develop and manage large scale active adult communities which differ from our historical homebuilding business. 28 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Financial Services Operations: We conduct our financial services operations principally through Pulte Mortgage Corporation (PMC), our mortgage banking subsidiary and during 1999, through Pulte Financial Companies, Inc. (PFCI). Pre tax income of our financial services operations is as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Pre tax income: Mortgage banking $ 28,331 $ 19,009 $ 19,017 Financing activities 1,811 Pre tax income $ 28,331 $ 19,009 $ 20,828 Mortgage Banking: Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Total originations: Loans 19,018 13,415 13,728 Principal $ 2,937,100 $ 1,957,300 $ 1,908,200 Originations for Pulte customers: Loans 13,786 11,109 10,858 Principal $ 2,131,000 $ 1,697,600 $ 1,558,400 We sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts. Due to the short period of time the servicing rights are held, usually three to four months, we do not amortize the servicing asset. Since the servicing rights are recorded at the value in the servicing sales contracts, there are no impairment issues related to these assets. We also originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various credit arrangements, and then sell such mortgage loans to outside investors. Mortgage origination principal volume for the year ended December 31, 2001, increased 50% over 2000, which benefited from an increase in the capture rate of 400 basis points to 60%, an increased average loan size and the inclusion of Del Webbs mortgage operations, which accounted for approximately 13% of the increase. Origination unit volume increased 42% due to the same factors. Mortgage origination principal volume in 2000 increased 3% over 1999, due to increases in year to date unit sales and higher average selling prices realized in our Domestic Homebuilding operations. However, the number of loans for 2000 was down 2% from 1999 levels due to competitive market conditions and rising mortgage interest rates during the last six months of 1999 and first three quarters of 2000. Our home buying customers continue to account for the majority of total loan production, representing 79% of total PMC unit production for 2001, compared with 83% in 2000 and 79% in 1999. Refinancings represented 10% of total loan production in 2001, compared with 2% in 2000 and 4% during 1999. At December 31, 2001, loan application backlog increased 54% to $827 million as compared to $536 million and $499 million at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. 21 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Financial Services Operations (continued): Mortgage Banking (continued): Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2001, increased 49% to $28.3 million, due to increases in volume, capture rate and secondary marketing gains. The addition of Del Webbs mortgage operations for the last five months of 2001 contributed approximately 8% of this increase. Pricing and marketing gains increased $17.4 million, or 71%, from the same period in 2000, primarily due to a consistent drop in interest rates throughout 2001. As compared with 2000, net interest income increased $3.1 million to $5.0 million during 2001 due to increased production and a steeper yield curve as a result of the drop in interest rates during 2001. Offsetting these gains was an increase in SGA expenses of $10 million as a result of increased headcount and other related costs due to the increase in volume during 2001. Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2000, was unchanged from 1999, as increases in origination fees and other income were offset by decreases in pricing and marketing gains and net interest income. During 2000, origination fees increased $1.6 million, or 23%, over the prior year due primarily to an increase in brokered loans. Pricing and marketing gains decreased $3.6 million, or 13%, from the same period in 1999, primarily due to competitive market conditions for much of 2000. As compared with 1999, net interest income decreased 17% to $1.8 million during 2000 as a result of a drop in funded production and a higher cost of funds due to a new warehouse line that became effective March 31, 2000. During 2000, we recognized increased equity income from our minority interest in a Mexican mortgage banking company, and also recognized income from mortgage reinsurance operations. Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, requires companies to recognize all of their derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship, and further, on the type of hedging relationship. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company must designate the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. We hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed mortgage loans with derivative financial instruments. For the year ended December 31, 2001, we did not recognize any net gains or losses related to the ineffective portion of the hedging instrument excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We also did not recognize any gains or losses during 2001, for cash flow hedges that were discontinued because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur. At December 31, 2001, we expect to reclassify $592,000, net of taxes, of net losses on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next twelve months from sales of closed mortgage loans. Financing Activities: Our secured financing operations, which were conducted by a limited purpose subsidiary of PFCI, ceased operations during 1999. During the first quarter of 1999, we recognized a net gain of approximately $1.7 million in connection with the sale of its remaining mortgage backed securities portfolio. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Corporate: Corporate is a non operating business segment whose primary purpose is to support the operations of our subsidiaries as the internal source of financing, to develop and implement strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies, and to provide the administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity. As a result, the corporate segments operating results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve. The following table presents this segments results of operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Net interest expense $ 34,261 $ 28,987 $ 22,824 Other corporate expenses, net 23,191 27,309 28,160 Loss before income taxes $ 57,452 $ 56,296 $ 50,984 An increase in net interest expense offset by a decrease in other corporate expenses, net, resulted in a 2% increase in the net loss for the Corporate segment. The increase in the corporate net interest spread, which is net of interest capitalized into inventory, is attributable to a higher debt balance as a result of the Del Webb merger and the issuance in February 2001 of $200 million and in August 2001 of $500 million in Senior Notes, primarily for use in repaying certain indebtedness acquired from Del Webb (see Del Webb Merger). The decrease in other corporate expenses, net in 2001 is primarily due to the effect of the write down of a commercial land position in 2000. The increase in 2000 of the pre tax loss to $56.3 million was primarily a result of an increase in net interest expense. Increases in net interest expense were attributed to higher average use of our unsecured revolving credit facility in addition to the April 2000 issuance of $175 million Senior Notes. Interest incurred for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, excluding interest incurred by our financial services operations, was approximately $116.9, $62.8 and $49.5 million, respectively. Corporate net interest expense is net of amounts capitalized into homebuilding inventories. Interest is amortized to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. Interest in inventory at December 31, 2001, increased primarily as a result of higher levels of indebtedness and the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Information related to Corporate interest capitalized into inventory is as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Interest in inventory at beginning of year $ 24,202 $ 19,092 $ 16,356 Interest capitalized 80,399 33,129 27,923 Interest expensed (36,006 ) (28,019 ) (25,187 ) Interest in inventory at end of year $ 68,595 $ 24,202 $ 19,092 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources: Continuing Operations: Our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2001, was $418,796,000 as higher net income was offset by increases in inventory and residential mortgage loans available for sale over 2000 and the resolution of the First Heights litigation. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2001 increased primarily due to the net cash acquired from Del Webb. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $297,131,000 as proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes of $200 million and $500 million, and increased borrowings under the revolving credit arrangements, were offset by the repayment of debt acquired from Del Webb (see Del Webb Merger). Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2000, amounted to $23,322,000. Increases in inventory, other assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities during 2000 were less than during 1999, and were offset by a larger increase in residential mortgage loans available for sale. Net cash used in investing activities was $5,185,000 for 2000. The effects of PFCIs sale of the underlying collateral of its mortgage backed securities portfolio and the purchase of BREs interest in the net assets of our active adult joint venture are reflected in 1999. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2000, was $114,051,000, as compared to a use of cash of $87,642,000 in 1999. These increased cash flows primarily reflect our issuance of $175 million Senior Notes in April 2000 and issuance of common stock pursuant to our employee stock option plans, offset by stock repurchases. We finance homebuilding land acquisition, development and construction activities from internally generated funds and existing credit agreements. We had $110 million outstanding under our $560 million unsecured revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2001. PMC provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available through various committed and uncommitted credit arrangements which, at December 31, 2001, amounted to $450 million, an amount deemed adequate to cover foreseeable needs. There were approximately $410 million of borrowings outstanding under the PMC arrangements at December 31, 2001. Mortgage loans originated by PMC are subsequently sold. We anticipate that there will be adequate mortgage financing available for purchasers of our homes. In February 2001, we sold $200 million of 8 1/8% Senior Notes, due 2011 from an active $500 million shelf registration. The net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes were used to repay short term borrowings under our revolving bank credit arrangements and for general corporate purposes. In August 2001, we sold in a private placement, $500 million of 7 7/8% Senior Notes due in 2011 and subsequently filed an S 4 Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in December 2001. Net proceeds received from the sale were used to repay certain indebtedness acquired in the Del Webb transaction, to pay certain expenses associated with that transaction and for general corporate purposes. Our income tax liabilities are affected by a number of factors. In 2001, our effective tax rate was 38.50% compared to 38.50% in 2000 and 37.75% in 1999. Our lower effective income tax rate in 1999 resulted from a lower effective state tax rate and the favorable resolution of various state income tax matters. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2002 will be approximately 39%. At December 31, 2001, we had cash and equivalents of $72.1 million and total long term indebtedness of $1.7 billion. Our total long term indebtedness includes $1.4 billion of unsecured Senior Notes, $368.6 million of unsecured Senior Subordinated Notes, other limited recourse debt of $15 million and other non recourse short term notes payable of $60.7 million. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related project. If the obligations related to the project are ongoing, annual extensions are granted on a year to year basis. Performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These bonds, which approximated $775 million at December 31, 2001, are typically outstanding over a period that approximates 3 5 years. In the normal course of business, we acquire rights under options or option type agreements to purchase land to be used in homebuilding operations at future dates. These rights, which may be cancelled at our discretion, may extend over several years and are typically secured by small deposits. Further, these rights are frequently extended or renegotiated to better match the needs of our homebuilding operations. The total purchase price applicable to approved land under option for use by our homebuilding operations at future dates approximated $1.1 billion at December 31, 2001, which represented approximately 35,000 lots. In addition, there were approximately 25,000 lots valued at $644 million under option at December 31, 2001, pending approval, that are under review and evaluation for future use by our homebuilding operations. Sources of our working capital at December 31, 2001, include our cash and equivalents, our $560 million committed unsecured revolving credit facilities and PMCs $450 million revolving credit facilities. Our debt to total capitalization, excluding our non guarantor asset secured borrowings, was 44.8% as of December 31, 2001. We expect to manage our debt to total capitalization to the 40% level by the end of 2002. It is our intent to exercise, over time, the early call provisions of the Senior Subordinated Notes issued by Del Webb, as allowed under these notes. We routinely monitor current operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate the use of available financial sources, including securities offerings. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): Del Webb Merger: On July 31, 2001, we merged with Del Webb Corporation as discussed in Note 3 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. At closing, we paid off and cancelled Del Webbs revolving credit facility, which had a balance outstanding of approximately $300 million at closing. Under the terms of Del Webbs $100 million, 9 3/4%, due 2003, Senior Subordinated Notes, we exercised our option to redeem the entire bond issuance at par during the third quarter of 2001. Under the terms of Del Webbs other Senior Subordinated Notes, we were required, as a result of the change in control, to offer to purchase four series of its Senior Subordinated Notes. As of December 31, 2001, we had repurchased, through tender offers and open market purchases, $127 million of these Notes. Under the terms of Del Webbs $150 million 9 3/4%, due 2008, Senior Subordinated Notes, we exercised our optional right to redeem the remaining outstanding balance of $122 million at the price stipulated in the indenture by placing with the trustee as of December 31, 2001, sufficient proceeds to satisfy a January 15, 2002, final payoff. Inflation: We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation also increases our financing, labor and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices. To date, inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies: The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements, giving due regard to materiality. Inventory valuation: Our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated cost or net realizable value. Included in inventories are all direct development costs. We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories and charge the interest to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. This period increased in 2001 due to the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated cost, unless they are determined to be impaired, in which case these inventories are measured at fair value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory adjustments may be required. Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis or on a relative sales value basis as cost of sales. Under the specific identification basis, units are assigned an average cost by project based on actual costs to date plus the estimated cost of completion. Units costed using the relative sales value basis are assigned cost based on the sales value of the unit in relation to the total estimated sales value of the project. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued): Goodwill and Intangible Assets: Goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed by management for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $467 million at the end of 2001, which represented 8% of total assets. The majority of these assets resulted from the acquisition of Del Webb in 2001. Del Webb has a long history of operating success and profitability, has well recognized brand names and holds a significant position in the active adult market which should continue in the future. The integration of Del Webb should enable the combined businesses to accelerate the pace of land absorptions, enhance the visibility of the Del Webb and Sun City brand names and obtain the synergies of enhanced purchasing leverage, complementary product offerings and combined operations in the future. Changes in strategy and or market conditions could impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our long term debt to the extent long term rates decline. The following tables set forth, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, our long term debt obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value ($000s omitted).

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) PMC, operating as a mortgage banker, is also subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed upon terms (i.e., commits to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2001 and 2000, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float. We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to the Federal Funds rate and (ii) hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments with off balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in long term mortgage rates of plus 50, 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results. Our aggregate net equity investment in Mexico approximated $61.1 million at December 31, 2001. This investment, which is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk, could devalue by as much as $10 million in 2002, assuming a hypothetical 18% annualized devaluation of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar during 2002. Our aggregate net investment in Argentina approximated $20.1 million at December 31, 2001. This investment is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. It is unclear at this time how the Argentine financial and currency markets will be affected in 2002 as a result of the Argentine governments decision to de link the valuation of the Argentine peso from the U. S. dollar. It is therefore unclear what effect this may have on the continuing value of our investment in Argentina. SPECIAL NOTES CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS As a cautionary note, except for the historical information contained herein, certain matters discussed in Item 7., Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such matters involve risks and uncertainties, including: our exposure to certain market risks, changes in economic conditions, tax and interest rates, increases in raw material and labor costs, issues and timing surrounding land entitlement and development, weather conditions, government regulations and environmental matters, as well as, general competitive factors, that may cause actual results to differ materially; and our ability to integrate the recently acquired business operations of Del Webb Corporation, including Del Webbs activities, management and corporate culture, with our own, and our ability to develop and manage large scale active adult communities which differ from our historical homebuilding business. 28 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Financial Services Operations (continued): Mortgage Banking (continued): Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2001, increased 49% to $28.3 million, due to increases in volume, capture rate and secondary marketing gains. The addition of Del Webbs mortgage operations for the last five months of 2001 contributed approximately 8% of this increase. Pricing and marketing gains increased $17.4 million, or 71%, from the same period in 2000, primarily due to a consistent drop in interest rates throughout 2001. As compared with 2000, net interest income increased $3.1 million to $5.0 million during 2001 due to increased production and a steeper yield curve as a result of the drop in interest rates during 2001. Offsetting these gains was an increase in SGA expenses of $10 million as a result of increased headcount and other related costs due to the increase in volume during 2001. Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2000, was unchanged from 1999, as increases in origination fees and other income were offset by decreases in pricing and marketing gains and net interest income. During 2000, origination fees increased $1.6 million, or 23%, over the prior year due primarily to an increase in brokered loans. Pricing and marketing gains decreased $3.6 million, or 13%, from the same period in 1999, primarily due to competitive market conditions for much of 2000. As compared with 1999, net interest income decreased 17% to $1.8 million during 2000 as a result of a drop in funded production and a higher cost of funds due to a new warehouse line that became effective March 31, 2000. During 2000, we recognized increased equity income from our minority interest in a Mexican mortgage banking company, and also recognized income from mortgage reinsurance operations. Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, requires companies to recognize all of their derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship, and further, on the type of hedging relationship. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company must designate the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. We hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed mortgage loans with derivative financial instruments. For the year ended December 31, 2001, we did not recognize any net gains or losses related to the ineffective portion of the hedging instrument excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We also did not recognize any gains or losses during 2001, for cash flow hedges that were discontinued because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur. At December 31, 2001, we expect to reclassify $592,000, net of taxes, of net losses on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next twelve months from sales of closed mortgage loans. Financing Activities: Our secured financing operations, which were conducted by a limited purpose subsidiary of PFCI, ceased operations during 1999. During the first quarter of 1999, we recognized a net gain of approximately $1.7 million in connection with the sale of its remaining mortgage backed securities portfolio. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Corporate: Corporate is a non operating business segment whose primary purpose is to support the operations of our subsidiaries as the internal source of financing, to develop and implement strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies, and to provide the administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity. As a result, the corporate segments operating results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve. The following table presents this segments results of operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Net interest expense $ 34,261 $ 28,987 $ 22,824 Other corporate expenses, net 23,191 27,309 28,160 Loss before income taxes $ 57,452 $ 56,296 $ 50,984 An increase in net interest expense offset by a decrease in other corporate expenses, net, resulted in a 2% increase in the net loss for the Corporate segment. The increase in the corporate net interest spread, which is net of interest capitalized into inventory, is attributable to a higher debt balance as a result of the Del Webb merger and the issuance in February 2001 of $200 million and in August 2001 of $500 million in Senior Notes, primarily for use in repaying certain indebtedness acquired from Del Webb (see Del Webb Merger). The decrease in other corporate expenses, net in 2001 is primarily due to the effect of the write down of a commercial land position in 2000. The increase in 2000 of the pre tax loss to $56.3 million was primarily a result of an increase in net interest expense. Increases in net interest expense were attributed to higher average use of our unsecured revolving credit facility in addition to the April 2000 issuance of $175 million Senior Notes. Interest incurred for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, excluding interest incurred by our financial services operations, was approximately $116.9, $62.8 and $49.5 million, respectively. Corporate net interest expense is net of amounts capitalized into homebuilding inventories. Interest is amortized to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. Interest in inventory at December 31, 2001, increased primarily as a result of higher levels of indebtedness and the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Information related to Corporate interest capitalized into inventory is as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Interest in inventory at beginning of year $ 24,202 $ 19,092 $ 16,356 Interest capitalized 80,399 33,129 27,923 Interest expensed (36,006 ) (28,019 ) (25,187 ) Interest in inventory at end of year $ 68,595 $ 24,202 $ 19,092 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources: Continuing Operations: Our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2001, was $418,796,000 as higher net income was offset by increases in inventory and residential mortgage loans available for sale over 2000 and the resolution of the First Heights litigation. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2001 increased primarily due to the net cash acquired from Del Webb. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $297,131,000 as proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes of $200 million and $500 million, and increased borrowings under the revolving credit arrangements, were offset by the repayment of debt acquired from Del Webb (see Del Webb Merger). Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2000, amounted to $23,322,000. Increases in inventory, other assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities during 2000 were less than during 1999, and were offset by a larger increase in residential mortgage loans available for sale. Net cash used in investing activities was $5,185,000 for 2000. The effects of PFCIs sale of the underlying collateral of its mortgage backed securities portfolio and the purchase of BREs interest in the net assets of our active adult joint venture are reflected in 1999. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2000, was $114,051,000, as compared to a use of cash of $87,642,000 in 1999. These increased cash flows primarily reflect our issuance of $175 million Senior Notes in April 2000 and issuance of common stock pursuant to our employee stock option plans, offset by stock repurchases. We finance homebuilding land acquisition, development and construction activities from internally generated funds and existing credit agreements. We had $110 million outstanding under our $560 million unsecured revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2001. PMC provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available through various committed and uncommitted credit arrangements which, at December 31, 2001, amounted to $450 million, an amount deemed adequate to cover foreseeable needs. There were approximately $410 million of borrowings outstanding under the PMC arrangements at December 31, 2001. Mortgage loans originated by PMC are subsequently sold. We anticipate that there will be adequate mortgage financing available for purchasers of our homes. In February 2001, we sold $200 million of 8 1/8% Senior Notes, due 2011 from an active $500 million shelf registration. The net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes were used to repay short term borrowings under our revolving bank credit arrangements and for general corporate purposes. In August 2001, we sold in a private placement, $500 million of 7 7/8% Senior Notes due in 2011 and subsequently filed an S 4 Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in December 2001. Net proceeds received from the sale were used to repay certain indebtedness acquired in the Del Webb transaction, to pay certain expenses associated with that transaction and for general corporate purposes. Our income tax liabilities are affected by a number of factors. In 2001, our effective tax rate was 38.50% compared to 38.50% in 2000 and 37.75% in 1999. Our lower effective income tax rate in 1999 resulted from a lower effective state tax rate and the favorable resolution of various state income tax matters. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2002 will be approximately 39%. At December 31, 2001, we had cash and equivalents of $72.1 million and total long term indebtedness of $1.7 billion. Our total long term indebtedness includes $1.4 billion of unsecured Senior Notes, $368.6 million of unsecured Senior Subordinated Notes, other limited recourse debt of $15 million and other non recourse short term notes payable of $60.7 million. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related project. If the obligations related to the project are ongoing, annual extensions are granted on a year to year basis. Performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These bonds, which approximated $775 million at December 31, 2001, are typically outstanding over a period that approximates 3 5 years. In the normal course of business, we acquire rights under options or option type agreements to purchase land to be used in homebuilding operations at future dates. These rights, which may be cancelled at our discretion, may extend over several years and are typically secured by small deposits. Further, these rights are frequently extended or renegotiated to better match the needs of our homebuilding operations. The total purchase price applicable to approved land under option for use by our homebuilding operations at future dates approximated $1.1 billion at December 31, 2001, which represented approximately 35,000 lots. In addition, there were approximately 25,000 lots valued at $644 million under option at December 31, 2001, pending approval, that are under review and evaluation for future use by our homebuilding operations. Sources of our working capital at December 31, 2001, include our cash and equivalents, our $560 million committed unsecured revolving credit facilities and PMCs $450 million revolving credit facilities. Our debt to total capitalization, excluding our non guarantor asset secured borrowings, was 44.8% as of December 31, 2001. We expect to manage our debt to total capitalization to the 40% level by the end of 2002. It is our intent to exercise, over time, the early call provisions of the Senior Subordinated Notes issued by Del Webb, as allowed under these notes. We routinely monitor current operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate the use of available financial sources, including securities offerings. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): Del Webb Merger: On July 31, 2001, we merged with Del Webb Corporation as discussed in Note 3 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. At closing, we paid off and cancelled Del Webbs revolving credit facility, which had a balance outstanding of approximately $300 million at closing. Under the terms of Del Webbs $100 million, 9 3/4%, due 2003, Senior Subordinated Notes, we exercised our option to redeem the entire bond issuance at par during the third quarter of 2001. Under the terms of Del Webbs other Senior Subordinated Notes, we were required, as a result of the change in control, to offer to purchase four series of its Senior Subordinated Notes. As of December 31, 2001, we had repurchased, through tender offers and open market purchases, $127 million of these Notes. Under the terms of Del Webbs $150 million 9 3/4%, due 2008, Senior Subordinated Notes, we exercised our optional right to redeem the remaining outstanding balance of $122 million at the price stipulated in the indenture by placing with the trustee as of December 31, 2001, sufficient proceeds to satisfy a January 15, 2002, final payoff. Inflation: We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation also increases our financing, labor and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices. To date, inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies: The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements, giving due regard to materiality. Inventory valuation: Our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated cost or net realizable value. Included in inventories are all direct development costs. We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories and charge the interest to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. This period increased in 2001 due to the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated cost, unless they are determined to be impaired, in which case these inventories are measured at fair value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory adjustments may be required. Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis or on a relative sales value basis as cost of sales. Under the specific identification basis, units are assigned an average cost by project based on actual costs to date plus the estimated cost of completion. Units costed using the relative sales value basis are assigned cost based on the sales value of the unit in relation to the total estimated sales value of the project. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued): Goodwill and Intangible Assets: Goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed by management for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $467 million at the end of 2001, which represented 8% of total assets. The majority of these assets resulted from the acquisition of Del Webb in 2001. Del Webb has a long history of operating success and profitability, has well recognized brand names and holds a significant position in the active adult market which should continue in the future. The integration of Del Webb should enable the combined businesses to accelerate the pace of land absorptions, enhance the visibility of the Del Webb and Sun City brand names and obtain the synergies of enhanced purchasing leverage, complementary product offerings and combined operations in the future. Changes in strategy and or market conditions could impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our long term debt to the extent long term rates decline.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) PMC, operating as a mortgage banker, is also subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed upon terms (i.e., commits to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2001 and 2000, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float. We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to the Federal Funds rate and (ii) hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments with off balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in long term mortgage rates of plus 50, 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results. Our aggregate net equity investment in Mexico approximated $61.1 million at December 31, 2001. This investment, which is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk, could devalue by as much as $10 million in 2002, assuming a hypothetical 18% annualized devaluation of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar during 2002. Our aggregate net investment in Argentina approximated $20.1 million at December 31, 2001. This investment is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. It is unclear at this time how the Argentine financial and currency markets will be affected in 2002 as a result of the Argentine governments decision to de link the valuation of the Argentine peso from the U. S. dollar. It is therefore unclear what effect this may have on the continuing value of our investment in Argentina. SPECIAL NOTES CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS As a cautionary note, except for the historical information contained herein, certain matters discussed in Item 7., Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such matters involve risks and uncertainties, including: our exposure to certain market risks, changes in economic conditions, tax and interest rates, increases in raw material and labor costs, issues and timing surrounding land entitlement and development, weather conditions, government regulations and environmental matters, as well as, general competitive factors, that may cause actual results to differ materially; and our ability to integrate the recently acquired business operations of Del Webb Corporation, including Del Webbs activities, management and corporate culture, with our own, and our ability to develop and manage large scale active adult communities which differ from our historical homebuilding business. 28 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Corporate: Corporate is a non operating business segment whose primary purpose is to support the operations of our subsidiaries as the internal source of financing, to develop and implement strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies, and to provide the administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity. As a result, the corporate segments operating results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve. The following table presents this segments results of operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Net interest expense $ 34,261 $ 28,987 $ 22,824 Other corporate expenses, net 23,191 27,309 28,160 Loss before income taxes $ 57,452 $ 56,296 $ 50,984 An increase in net interest expense offset by a decrease in other corporate expenses, net, resulted in a 2% increase in the net loss for the Corporate segment. The increase in the corporate net interest spread, which is net of interest capitalized into inventory, is attributable to a higher debt balance as a result of the Del Webb merger and the issuance in February 2001 of $200 million and in August 2001 of $500 million in Senior Notes, primarily for use in repaying certain indebtedness acquired from Del Webb (see Del Webb Merger). The decrease in other corporate expenses, net in 2001 is primarily due to the effect of the write down of a commercial land position in 2000. The increase in 2000 of the pre tax loss to $56.3 million was primarily a result of an increase in net interest expense. Increases in net interest expense were attributed to higher average use of our unsecured revolving credit facility in addition to the April 2000 issuance of $175 million Senior Notes. Interest incurred for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, excluding interest incurred by our financial services operations, was approximately $116.9, $62.8 and $49.5 million, respectively. Corporate net interest expense is net of amounts capitalized into homebuilding inventories. Interest is amortized to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. Interest in inventory at December 31, 2001, increased primarily as a result of higher levels of indebtedness and the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Information related to Corporate interest capitalized into inventory is as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Interest in inventory at beginning of year $ 24,202 $ 19,092 $ 16,356 Interest capitalized 80,399 33,129 27,923 Interest expensed (36,006 ) (28,019 ) (25,187 ) Interest in inventory at end of year $ 68,595 $ 24,202 $ 19,092 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources: Continuing Operations: Our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2001, was $418,796,000 as higher net income was offset by increases in inventory and residential mortgage loans available for sale over 2000 and the resolution of the First Heights litigation. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2001 increased primarily due to the net cash acquired from Del Webb. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $297,131,000 as proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes of $200 million and $500 million, and increased borrowings under the revolving credit arrangements, were offset by the repayment of debt acquired from Del Webb (see Del Webb Merger). Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2000, amounted to $23,322,000. Increases in inventory, other assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities during 2000 were less than during 1999, and were offset by a larger increase in residential mortgage loans available for sale. Net cash used in investing activities was $5,185,000 for 2000. The effects of PFCIs sale of the underlying collateral of its mortgage backed securities portfolio and the purchase of BREs interest in the net assets of our active adult joint venture are reflected in 1999. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2000, was $114,051,000, as compared to a use of cash of $87,642,000 in 1999. These increased cash flows primarily reflect our issuance of $175 million Senior Notes in April 2000 and issuance of common stock pursuant to our employee stock option plans, offset by stock repurchases. We finance homebuilding land acquisition, development and construction activities from internally generated funds and existing credit agreements. We had $110 million outstanding under our $560 million unsecured revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2001. PMC provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available through various committed and uncommitted credit arrangements which, at December 31, 2001, amounted to $450 million, an amount deemed adequate to cover foreseeable needs. There were approximately $410 million of borrowings outstanding under the PMC arrangements at December 31, 2001. Mortgage loans originated by PMC are subsequently sold. We anticipate that there will be adequate mortgage financing available for purchasers of our homes. In February 2001, we sold $200 million of 8 1/8% Senior Notes, due 2011 from an active $500 million shelf registration. The net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes were used to repay short term borrowings under our revolving bank credit arrangements and for general corporate purposes. In August 2001, we sold in a private placement, $500 million of 7 7/8% Senior Notes due in 2011 and subsequently filed an S 4 Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in December 2001. Net proceeds received from the sale were used to repay certain indebtedness acquired in the Del Webb transaction, to pay certain expenses associated with that transaction and for general corporate purposes. Our income tax liabilities are affected by a number of factors. In 2001, our effective tax rate was 38.50% compared to 38.50% in 2000 and 37.75% in 1999. Our lower effective income tax rate in 1999 resulted from a lower effective state tax rate and the favorable resolution of various state income tax matters. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2002 will be approximately 39%. At December 31, 2001, we had cash and equivalents of $72.1 million and total long term indebtedness of $1.7 billion. Our total long term indebtedness includes $1.4 billion of unsecured Senior Notes, $368.6 million of unsecured Senior Subordinated Notes, other limited recourse debt of $15 million and other non recourse short term notes payable of $60.7 million. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): Continuing Operations (continued): The following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2001: Payments Due by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 After 2006 Contractual obligations: Guarantor short term borrowings $ 110,000 $ 110,000 $ $ $ Non guarantor short term borrowings 413,675 413,675 Long term indebtedness 1,737,869 3,147 395,606 198,339 1,140,777 Operating leases 102,423 30,505 33,618 17,673 20,627 Total contractual obligations $ 2,363,967 $ 557,327 $ 429,224 $ 216,012 $ 1,161,404 The following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2001: Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 After 2006 Other commercial commitments: Guarantor revolving credit facilities $ 560,000 $ $ $ 560,000 $ Non guarantor revolving credit facilities 450,000 225,000 225,000 Standby letters of credit 125,617 107,841 16,825 951 Total commercial commitments $ 1,135,617 $ 332,841 $ 241,825 $ 560,951 $ Standby letters of credit and performance bonds are used to guarantee our performance under various contracts, principally in connection with the development of our projects. The expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related project. If the obligations related to the project are ongoing, annual extensions are granted on a year to year basis. Performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These bonds, which approximated $775 million at December 31, 2001, are typically outstanding over a period that approximates 3 5 years. In the normal course of business, we acquire rights under options or option type agreements to purchase land to be used in homebuilding operations at future dates. These rights, which may be cancelled at our discretion, may extend over several years and are typically secured by small deposits. Further, these rights are frequently extended or renegotiated to better match the needs of our homebuilding operations. The total purchase price applicable to approved land under option for use by our homebuilding operations at future dates approximated $1.1 billion at December 31, 2001, which represented approximately 35,000 lots. In addition, there were approximately 25,000 lots valued at $644 million under option at December 31, 2001, pending approval, that are under review and evaluation for future use by our homebuilding operations. Sources of our working capital at December 31, 2001, include our cash and equivalents, our $560 million committed unsecured revolving credit facilities and PMCs $450 million revolving credit facilities. Our debt to total capitalization, excluding our non guarantor asset secured borrowings, was 44.8% as of December 31, 2001. We expect to manage our debt to total capitalization to the 40% level by the end of 2002. It is our intent to exercise, over time, the early call provisions of the Senior Subordinated Notes issued by Del Webb, as allowed under these notes. We routinely monitor current operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate the use of available financial sources, including securities offerings. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): Del Webb Merger: On July 31, 2001, we merged with Del Webb Corporation as discussed in Note 3 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. At closing, we paid off and cancelled Del Webbs revolving credit facility, which had a balance outstanding of approximately $300 million at closing. Under the terms of Del Webbs $100 million, 9 3/4%, due 2003, Senior Subordinated Notes, we exercised our option to redeem the entire bond issuance at par during the third quarter of 2001. Under the terms of Del Webbs other Senior Subordinated Notes, we were required, as a result of the change in control, to offer to purchase four series of its Senior Subordinated Notes. As of December 31, 2001, we had repurchased, through tender offers and open market purchases, $127 million of these Notes. Under the terms of Del Webbs $150 million 9 3/4%, due 2008, Senior Subordinated Notes, we exercised our optional right to redeem the remaining outstanding balance of $122 million at the price stipulated in the indenture by placing with the trustee as of December 31, 2001, sufficient proceeds to satisfy a January 15, 2002, final payoff. Inflation: We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation also increases our financing, labor and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices. To date, inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies: The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements, giving due regard to materiality. Inventory valuation: Our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated cost or net realizable value. Included in inventories are all direct development costs. We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories and charge the interest to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. This period increased in 2001 due to the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated cost, unless they are determined to be impaired, in which case these inventories are measured at fair value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory adjustments may be required. Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis or on a relative sales value basis as cost of sales. Under the specific identification basis, units are assigned an average cost by project based on actual costs to date plus the estimated cost of completion. Units costed using the relative sales value basis are assigned cost based on the sales value of the unit in relation to the total estimated sales value of the project. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued): Goodwill and Intangible Assets: Goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed by management for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $467 million at the end of 2001, which represented 8% of total assets. The majority of these assets resulted from the acquisition of Del Webb in 2001. Del Webb has a long history of operating success and profitability, has well recognized brand names and holds a significant position in the active adult market which should continue in the future. The integration of Del Webb should enable the combined businesses to accelerate the pace of land absorptions, enhance the visibility of the Del Webb and Sun City brand names and obtain the synergies of enhanced purchasing leverage, complementary product offerings and combined operations in the future. Changes in strategy and or market conditions could impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our long term debt to the extent long term rates decline. The following tables set forth, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, our long term debt obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value ($000s omitted).

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) PMC, operating as a mortgage banker, is also subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed upon terms (i.e., commits to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2001 and 2000, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float. We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to the Federal Funds rate and (ii) hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments with off balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in long term mortgage rates of plus 50, 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results. Our aggregate net equity investment in Mexico approximated $61.1 million at December 31, 2001. This investment, which is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk, could devalue by as much as $10 million in 2002, assuming a hypothetical 18% annualized devaluation of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar during 2002. Our aggregate net investment in Argentina approximated $20.1 million at December 31, 2001. This investment is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. It is unclear at this time how the Argentine financial and currency markets will be affected in 2002 as a result of the Argentine governments decision to de link the valuation of the Argentine peso from the U. S. dollar. It is therefore unclear what effect this may have on the continuing value of our investment in Argentina. SPECIAL NOTES CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS As a cautionary note, except for the historical information contained herein, certain matters discussed in Item 7., Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such matters involve risks and uncertainties, including: our exposure to certain market risks, changes in economic conditions, tax and interest rates, increases in raw material and labor costs, issues and timing surrounding land entitlement and development, weather conditions, government regulations and environmental matters, as well as, general competitive factors, that may cause actual results to differ materially; and our ability to integrate the recently acquired business operations of Del Webb Corporation, including Del Webbs activities, management and corporate culture, with our own, and our ability to develop and manage large scale active adult communities which differ from our historical homebuilding business. 28 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources: Continuing Operations: Our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2001, was $418,796,000 as higher net income was offset by increases in inventory and residential mortgage loans available for sale over 2000 and the resolution of the First Heights litigation. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2001 increased primarily due to the net cash acquired from Del Webb. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $297,131,000 as proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes of $200 million and $500 million, and increased borrowings under the revolving credit arrangements, were offset by the repayment of debt acquired from Del Webb (see Del Webb Merger). Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2000, amounted to $23,322,000. Increases in inventory, other assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities during 2000 were less than during 1999, and were offset by a larger increase in residential mortgage loans available for sale. Net cash used in investing activities was $5,185,000 for 2000. The effects of PFCIs sale of the underlying collateral of its mortgage backed securities portfolio and the purchase of BREs interest in the net assets of our active adult joint venture are reflected in 1999. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2000, was $114,051,000, as compared to a use of cash of $87,642,000 in 1999. These increased cash flows primarily reflect our issuance of $175 million Senior Notes in April 2000 and issuance of common stock pursuant to our employee stock option plans, offset by stock repurchases. We finance homebuilding land acquisition, development and construction activities from internally generated funds and existing credit agreements. We had $110 million outstanding under our $560 million unsecured revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2001. PMC provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available through various committed and uncommitted credit arrangements which, at December 31, 2001, amounted to $450 million, an amount deemed adequate to cover foreseeable needs. There were approximately $410 million of borrowings outstanding under the PMC arrangements at December 31, 2001. Mortgage loans originated by PMC are subsequently sold. We anticipate that there will be adequate mortgage financing available for purchasers of our homes. In February 2001, we sold $200 million of 8 1/8% Senior Notes, due 2011 from an active $500 million shelf registration. The net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes were used to repay short term borrowings under our revolving bank credit arrangements and for general corporate purposes. In August 2001, we sold in a private placement, $500 million of 7 7/8% Senior Notes due in 2011 and subsequently filed an S 4 Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in December 2001. Net proceeds received from the sale were used to repay certain indebtedness acquired in the Del Webb transaction, to pay certain expenses associated with that transaction and for general corporate purposes. Our income tax liabilities are affected by a number of factors. In 2001, our effective tax rate was 38.50% compared to 38.50% in 2000 and 37.75% in 1999. Our lower effective income tax rate in 1999 resulted from a lower effective state tax rate and the favorable resolution of various state income tax matters. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2002 will be approximately 39%. At December 31, 2001, we had cash and equivalents of $72.1 million and total long term indebtedness of $1.7 billion. Our total long term indebtedness includes $1.4 billion of unsecured Senior Notes, $368.6 million of unsecured Senior Subordinated Notes, other limited recourse debt of $15 million and other non recourse short term notes payable of $60.7 million. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

If the obligations related to the project are ongoing, annual extensions are granted on a year to year basis. Performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These bonds, which approximated $775 million at December 31, 2001, are typically outstanding over a period that approximates 3 5 years. In the normal course of business, we acquire rights under options or option type agreements to purchase land to be used in homebuilding operations at future dates. These rights, which may be cancelled at our discretion, may extend over several years and are typically secured by small deposits. Further, these rights are frequently extended or renegotiated to better match the needs of our homebuilding operations. The total purchase price applicable to approved land under option for use by our homebuilding operations at future dates approximated $1.1 billion at December 31, 2001, which represented approximately 35,000 lots. In addition, there were approximately 25,000 lots valued at $644 million under option at December 31, 2001, pending approval, that are under review and evaluation for future use by our homebuilding operations. Sources of our working capital at December 31, 2001, include our cash and equivalents, our $560 million committed unsecured revolving credit facilities and PMCs $450 million revolving credit facilities. Our debt to total capitalization, excluding our non guarantor asset secured borrowings, was 44.8% as of December 31, 2001. We expect to manage our debt to total capitalization to the 40% level by the end of 2002. It is our intent to exercise, over time, the early call provisions of the Senior Subordinated Notes issued by Del Webb, as allowed under these notes. We routinely monitor current operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate the use of available financial sources, including securities offerings. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): Del Webb Merger: On July 31, 2001, we merged with Del Webb Corporation as discussed in Note 3 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. At closing, we paid off and cancelled Del Webbs revolving credit facility, which had a balance outstanding of approximately $300 million at closing. Under the terms of Del Webbs $100 million, 9 3/4%, due 2003, Senior Subordinated Notes, we exercised our option to redeem the entire bond issuance at par during the third quarter of 2001. Under the terms of Del Webbs other Senior Subordinated Notes, we were required, as a result of the change in control, to offer to purchase four series of its Senior Subordinated Notes. As of December 31, 2001, we had repurchased, through tender offers and open market purchases, $127 million of these Notes. Under the terms of Del Webbs $150 million 9 3/4%, due 2008, Senior Subordinated Notes, we exercised our optional right to redeem the remaining outstanding balance of $122 million at the price stipulated in the indenture by placing with the trustee as of December 31, 2001, sufficient proceeds to satisfy a January 15, 2002, final payoff. Inflation: We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation also increases our financing, labor and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices. To date, inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies: The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements, giving due regard to materiality. Inventory valuation: Our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated cost or net realizable value. Included in inventories are all direct development costs. We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories and charge the interest to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. This period increased in 2001 due to the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated cost, unless they are determined to be impaired, in which case these inventories are measured at fair value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory adjustments may be required. Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis or on a relative sales value basis as cost of sales. Under the specific identification basis, units are assigned an average cost by project based on actual costs to date plus the estimated cost of completion. Units costed using the relative sales value basis are assigned cost based on the sales value of the unit in relation to the total estimated sales value of the project. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued): Goodwill and Intangible Assets: Goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed by management for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $467 million at the end of 2001, which represented 8% of total assets. The majority of these assets resulted from the acquisition of Del Webb in 2001. Del Webb has a long history of operating success and profitability, has well recognized brand names and holds a significant position in the active adult market which should continue in the future. The integration of Del Webb should enable the combined businesses to accelerate the pace of land absorptions, enhance the visibility of the Del Webb and Sun City brand names and obtain the synergies of enhanced purchasing leverage, complementary product offerings and combined operations in the future. Changes in strategy and or market conditions could impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our long term debt to the extent long term rates decline. The following tables set forth, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, our long term debt obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value ($000s omitted).

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) PMC, operating as a mortgage banker, is also subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed upon terms (i.e., commits to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2001 and 2000, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float. We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to the Federal Funds rate and (ii) hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments with off balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in long term mortgage rates of plus 50, 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results. Our aggregate net equity investment in Mexico approximated $61.1 million at December 31, 2001. This investment, which is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk, could devalue by as much as $10 million in 2002, assuming a hypothetical 18% annualized devaluation of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar during 2002. Our aggregate net investment in Argentina approximated $20.1 million at December 31, 2001. This investment is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. It is unclear at this time how the Argentine financial and currency markets will be affected in 2002 as a result of the Argentine governments decision to de link the valuation of the Argentine peso from the U. S. dollar. It is therefore unclear what effect this may have on the continuing value of our investment in Argentina.

Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed upon terms (i.e., commits to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2001 and 2000, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days.

Our aggregate net equity investment in Mexico approximated $61.1 million at December 31, 2001. This investment, which is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk, could devalue by as much as $10 million in 2002, assuming a hypothetical 18% annualized devaluation of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar during 2002. Our aggregate net investment in Argentina approximated $20.1 million at December 31, 2001. This investment is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. It is unclear at this time how the Argentine financial and currency markets will be affected in 2002 as a result of the Argentine governments decision to de link the valuation of the Argentine peso from the U. S. dollar. It is therefore unclear what effect this may have on the continuing value of our investment in Argentina.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) PMC, operating as a mortgage banker, is also subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed upon terms (i.e., commits to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2001 and 2000, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float. We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to the Federal Funds rate and (ii) hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments with off balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in long term mortgage rates of plus 50, 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results. Our aggregate net equity investment in Mexico approximated $61.1 million at December 31, 2001. This investment, which is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk, could devalue by as much as $10 million in 2002, assuming a hypothetical 18% annualized devaluation of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar during 2002. Our aggregate net investment in Argentina approximated $20.1 million at December 31, 2001. This investment is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. It is unclear at this time how the Argentine financial and currency markets will be affected in 2002 as a result of the Argentine governments decision to de link the valuation of the Argentine peso from the U. S. dollar. It is therefore unclear what effect this may have on the continuing value of our investment in Argentina. SPECIAL NOTES CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS As a cautionary note, except for the historical information contained herein, certain matters discussed in Item 7., Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such matters involve risks and uncertainties, including: our exposure to certain market risks, changes in economic conditions, tax and interest rates, increases in raw material and labor costs, issues and timing surrounding land entitlement and development, weather conditions, government regulations and environmental matters, as well as, general competitive factors, that may cause actual results to differ materially; and our ability to integrate the recently acquired business operations of Del Webb Corporation, including Del Webbs activities, management and corporate culture, with our own, and our ability to develop and manage large scale active adult communities which differ from our historical homebuilding business. 28 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued): Goodwill and Intangible Assets: Goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed by management for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $467 million at the end of 2001, which represented 8% of total assets. The majority of these assets resulted from the acquisition of Del Webb in 2001. Del Webb has a long history of operating success and profitability, has well recognized brand names and holds a significant position in the active adult market which should continue in the future. The integration of Del Webb should enable the combined businesses to accelerate the pace of land absorptions, enhance the visibility of the Del Webb and Sun City brand names and obtain the synergies of enhanced purchasing leverage, complementary product offerings and combined operations in the future. Changes in strategy and or market conditions could impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances. ITEM 7A.
