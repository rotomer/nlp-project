ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview: A summary of our operating results by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 is as follows ($000s omitted, except per share data): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Pre tax income (loss): Homebuilding $ 724,067 $ 512,291 $ 386,604 Financial Services 66,723 36,948 24,788 Corporate (61,968 ) (57,452 ) (56,296 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes 728,822 491,787 355,096 Income taxes 284,221 189,362 136,712 Income from continuing operations 444,601 302,425 218,384 Income (loss) from discontinued operations 9,044 (1,032 ) (29,871 ) Net income $ 453,645 $ 301,393 $ 188,513 Per share data assuming dilution: Income from continuing operations $ 7.20 $ 6.01 $ 5.18 Income (loss) from discontinued operations .15 (.02 ) (.71 ) Net income $ 7.35 $ 5.99 $ 4.47 A comparison of pre tax income (loss), for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 is as follows: Continued strong demand for new housing, the addition and expansion of the Del Webb operations, coupled with our ability to effectively manage selling pace and price drove pre tax income of our homebuilding business segment to increase 41% in 2002 and 33% in 2001. Domestic average unit selling price increased by 8% in 2002 and 9% in 2001. Additionally, domestic gross margin percentages were up 30 basis points in 2002 principally as a result of purchase accounting adjustments recorded in 2001. Compared to 2000, our 2001 domestic gross margins increased 110 basis points as a result of several factors including an increase in the average selling price and leveraged purchasing initiatives partially offset by purchase accounting adjustments. Pre tax income of our financial services business segment increased 81% in 2002 and 49% in 2001 as a result of increased volume, a favorable interest rate environment, effective leverage of overhead costs and the addition and expansion of Del Webb mortgage operations. Pre tax loss of our corporate business segment increased 8% in 2002 to $62.0 million principally from higher interest costs, related to an increase in debt levels to support the growth of the business. In 2001, our pre tax loss increased $1.2 million to $57.5 million as the increase in net interest expense was partially offset by lower Corporate expenditures. During the third quarter of 2002, we recorded an after tax gain of approximately $10 million in discontinued operations. The gain related to the recognition of income tax benefits resulting from the favorable resolution of certain tax matters associated with the thrift operations we discontinued in 1994. 14 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding: Our Homebuilding segment consists of the following operations: We conduct our Domestic Homebuilding operations in 44 markets, located throughout 25 states. Domestic Homebuilding offers a broad product line to meet the needs of the first time, first and second move up, and active adult homebuyers. We conduct our International Homebuilding operations through subsidiaries of Pulte International Corporation (International) in Mexico, Puerto Rico and Argentina. International Homebuilding product offerings focus on the demand of first time buyers and middle to upper income consumer groups. We also have agreements in place with multi national corporations to provide employee housing in Mexico. Certain operating data relating to our homebuilding operations and Pulte affiliated joint ventures are as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Pulte Homebuilding settlement revenues: Domestic $ 6,991,614 $ 5,145,526 $ 4,083,816 International 196,074 35,169 27,159 Total Pulte $ 7,187,688 $ 5,180,695 $ 4,110,975 Pulte affiliate international homebuilding settlement revenues $ 40,723 $ 180,621 $ 148,798 Total Pulte/Pulte affiliate homebuilding settlement revenues $ 7,228,411 $ 5,361,316 $ 4,259,773 Pulte Homebuilding settlement units: Domestic 28,903 22,915 19,799 International 6,525 221 264 Total Pulte 35,428 23,136 20,063 Pulte affiliate international homebuilding settlement units 1,022 7,258 7,718 Total Pulte/Pulte affiliate homebuilding settlement units 36,450 30,394 27,781 15 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding (continued): Domestic Homebuilding: The Domestic Homebuilding operations represent our core business. We conduct our operations in 44 markets, located throughout 25 states, and are presented geographically as follows: Northeast: Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia Southeast: Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee Midwest: Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio Central: Colorado, Texas West: Arizona, California, Nevada The greater Phoenix market accounted for 10% of Domestic Homebuilding settlement revenues, 11% of settlement units and 11% of net new orders in 2002. The metropolitan Atlanta market accounted for 10% of unit settlements in 2000. No other individual market represented more than 10% of total Domestic Homebuilding settlement revenues, settlement units or net new orders during the three years ended December 31, 2002. The following table presents selected unit information for our Domestic Homebuilding operations: Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Unit settlements: Northeast 2,440 2,014 2,000 Southeast 8,271 8,126 7,820 Midwest 4,458 3,288 2,903 Central 4,588 3,982 3,622 West 9,146 5,505 3,454 28,903 22,915 19,799 Net new orders units: Northeast 2,738 2,035 1,970 Southeast 8,651 8,544 7,815 Midwest 4,684 3,756 2,818 Central 4,590 4,071 3,644 West 10,167 7,710 3,597 30,830 26,116 19,844 Net new orders dollars ($000s omitted) $ 7,731,000 $ 5,926,000 $ 4,211,000 Backlog at December 31 units: Northeast 1,129 831 810 Southeast 2,939 2,559 2,141 Midwest 1,601 1,375 907 Central 905 903 814 West 4,031 3,010 805 10,605 8,678 5,477 Backlog at December 31 dollars ($000s omitted) $ 2,857,000 $ 2,118,000 $ 1,307,000 16 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding (continued): Domestic Homebuilding (continued): Unit settlements in 2002 reached a record high, increasing 26% to 28,903 units. A full year of the Del Webb operations combined with strong sales in the Midwest drove the increase. 2001 unit settlements increased 16% to 22,915 units, principally from the addition of the Del Webb operations. The average selling price for our homes increased from $206,000 in 2000 to $225,000 in 2001 and to $242,000 in the current year. Changes in average selling price reflect a number of factors, including price increases, the mix of product closed during a period and the number of options purchased by customers. Both 2002 and 2001 benefited from increased product prices, improved product mix and the inclusion of Del Webb product offerings, which had an average selling price higher than our traditional offerings. Ending backlog, which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed, climbed 22% to 10,605 homes. The dollar value of our ending backlog was up 35% to $2.9 billion at December 31, 2002. Unit and dollar backlog at December 31, 2001, increased 58% and 62%, respectively, to 8,678 homes valued at $2.1 billion. Overall, strong demand supported by a favorable interest rate environment and the addition of Del Webb operations drove increased order activity and record levels of backlog. The following table presents a summary of pre tax income for our Domestic Homebuilding operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Home sale revenue (settlements) $ 6,991,614 $ 5,145,526 $ 4,083,816 Land sale revenue 176,301 129,134 84,700 Home cost of sales (5,589,465 ) (4,127,059 ) (3,320,885 ) Land cost of sales (123,306 ) (97,941 ) (56,250 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (664,469 ) (482,128 ) (365,704 ) Interest (48,697 ) (36,006 ) (28,019 ) Other expense, net (22,968 ) (16,851 ) (14,403 ) Pre tax income $ 719,010 $ 514,675 $ 383,255 Average sales price $ 242 $ 225 $ 206 We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories and charge the interest to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. Gross profit margins from home sales in 2002 increased 30 basis points over 2001 to 20.1%, including the effect of purchase accounting associated with the Del Webb merger. Excluding the effect of purchase accounting adjustments in both years, gross margins would have been 20.1% in 2002 and 20.0% in 2001. Gross profit margins in 2001 increased 110 basis points to 19.8% including purchase accounting adjustments and 130 basis points excluding purchase accounting adjustments over 2000 gross margins. Factors that contributed to this favorable trend include strong customer demand, positive home pricing, the benefits of leverage buy purchasing activities and effective production and inventory management. Land sales increased in each of the prior three years, demonstrating our competency in purchasing, developing and entitling certain land positions for sale primarily to other homebuilders, as well as to retail and commercial establishments. Revenues and their related gains/losses may vary significantly between periods, depending on the timing of such sales. We continue to rationalize certain existing land positions to ensure the most effective use of invested capital. For the year ended December 31, 2002, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of home settlement revenues, increased 13 basis points to 9.50% after increasing 42 basis points to 9.37% in 2001. Higher startup costs for new communities and increased compensation related costs partially offset by a reduction in costs associated with the Del Webb operations contributed to the change in 2002. The increase in 2001 reflects higher startup costs for new communities, increased compensation related costs, local market advertising expenses and the inclusion of Del Webb operations. 17 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding (continued): Domestic Homebuilding (continued): Interest expense increased $12.7 million to $48.7 million in 2002 and $8.0 million to $36.0 million in 2001. The increases are a result of an increase in debt levels necessary to support the growth of the business. Other expense, net increased to $23.0 million in 2002 primarily as a result of income from certain non operating investments recorded in 2001. The increase from 2000 to 2001 represents an increase in land inventory valuation reserves for certain land positions and amortization of tradenames and trademarks acquired in the merger with Del Webb. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, our Domestic Homebuilding operations controlled approximately 176,800 and 141,100 lots, respectively. Approximately 84,300 and 81,200 lots were owned, and approximately 43,800 and 34,800 lots under option agreements approved for purchase at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In addition, there were approximately 48,700 lots under option agreements at December 31, 2002, pending approval, that are under review and evaluation for future use by our Domestic Homebuilding operations. This compared to 25,100 lots at December 31, 2001. Domestic Homebuilding inventory at December 31, 2002, was approximately $4.1 billion, of which $3.2 billion related to land and land development. At December 31, 2001, inventory was approximately $3.8 billion, of which $2.8 billion related to land and land development. Included in other assets is approximately $218.8 million in land held for disposition as of December 31, 2002, as compared to $223.5 million in the prior year. International Homebuilding: Our International Homebuilding operations are primarily conducted through subsidiaries of International in Mexico, Puerto Rico and Argentina. Mexico Effective January 1, 2002, International reorganized its structure within Mexico to create a single company, Pulte Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V. (Pulte Mexico), which ranks as one of the largest builders in the country. Prior to the reorganization, these operations were conducted primarily through five joint ventures throughout Mexico. Under the new ownership structure, which combines the largest of these entities, we own 63.8% of Pulte Mexico and have consolidated Pulte Mexico into our financial statements. The new operating structure facilitates growth, enables operating leverage and improves efficiencies through standardized systems and procedures. Puerto Rico Operations in Puerto Rico are conducted through Internationals 100% owned subsidiary, Pulte International Caribbean Corporation and three joint ventures. Argentina Operations in Argentina, which are based in the greater Buenos Aires area, are conducted through Pulte SRL, Internationals 100% owned Argentine subsidiary. 18 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding (continued): International Homebuilding (continued): The following table presents selected financial data for our International Homebuilding operations for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Revenues $ 196,074 $ 35,169 $ 27,159 Cost of sales (157,056 ) (30,937 ) (24,611 ) Selling, general and administrative expense (35,029 ) (11,820 ) (5,621 ) Other income (expense), net (1,610 ) 66 967 Minority interest (1,801 ) Equity in income of joint ventures 4,479 5,138 5,455 Pre tax income (loss) $ 5,057 $ (2,384 ) $ 3,349 Unit settlements: Pulte 6,525 221 264 Pulte affiliated entities 1,022 7,258 7,718 7,547 7,479 7,982 Unit settlements for Pulte and Pulte affiliated entities in 2002 were relatively flat as compared to 2001 and down in 2001 when compared to 2000, as declines in Puerto Rico and Mexico were only partially offset by settlements in Argentina, which approached 200 in 2002. Settlements in Mexico were 7,166 in 2002 compared to 7,158 in 2001 and 7,718 in 2000. Activity in Mexico continues to be slowed by the impact of changes made in 2001 and 2002 to local lending practices and the lack of alternative funding sources. Increased revenues in 2002 are due to consolidation of the operations in Mexico for eleven months of 2002, a full year of operations in Argentina, which had only begun recognizing its first closings in June of 2001, partially offset by a decline in Puerto Rico. Revenues from our operations in Mexico were $158.1 million in 2002. Our operations in Argentina contributed $25.9 million compared to $9.5 million in the prior year. Revenues in Puerto Rico were down to $12.1 million from $25.5 million. The consolidation of Mexico also had a positive effect on gross margins, which rose to 19.9% in 2002 from 12.0% in 2001 and 9.4% in 2000. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues declined as a result of a reduction in start up costs associated with our operations in Argentina. Equity in income of joint ventures in 2002 represents one month of the joint venture operations in Mexico and our joint venture located in Canovanas, Puerto Rico, which had its first closings during the third quarter of 2001. Our operations in Argentina recorded transaction losses of $208,000 and $463,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, as the value of the Argentine peso continued to fluctuate following the Argentine governments decision to de link its valuation from the U.S. Dollar. We also recorded a foreign currency translation loss of $12.8 million, as a component of cumulative other comprehensive income during 2002. It remains unclear at this time how the financial and currency markets in Argentina will be impacted in 2003 or how the current economic situation may affect customer home buying attitudes and the homebuilding business in general. At December 31, 2002, our investment, net of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments, in Argentina approximated $13.1 million. Our operations in Mexico have also been affected by a strengthening dollar to the Mexican peso where transaction losses of $483,000, $378,000 and $78,000 were recorded in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. At December 31, 2002, our investment, net of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments, in Mexico approximated $61.1 million. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Financial Services: We conduct our financial services business, which includes mortgage and title operations, through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries. We sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts. Due to the short period of time the servicing rights are held, usually three to four months, we do not amortize the servicing asset. Since the servicing rights are recorded at the value in the servicing sales contracts, there are no impairment issues related to these assets. We also originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various credit arrangements, and then sell such mortgage loans to outside investors. The following table presents mortgage origination data for our Financial Services operations: Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Total originations: Loans 23,074 19,018 13,415 Principal ($000s omitted) $ 3,771,000 $ 2,937,100 $ 1,957,300 Originations for Pulte customers: Loans 19,537 15,402 11,109 Principal ($000s omitted) $ 3,176,500 $ 2,385,500 $ 1,697,600 Mortgage origination unit and principal volume for the year ended December 31, 2002, increased 21% and 28%, respectively, over 2001. This growth can be attributed to an increase in the capture rate of 390 basis points to 77.6% and the inclusion of Del Webb mortgage operations for a full year. Our capture rate represents loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percent of total loan opportunities, excluding cash settlements, from our homebuilding business. Mortgage origination principal volume in 2001 increased 50% over 2000, due to an increase in the capture rate of 950 basis points to 73.7%, an increased average loan size and the inclusion of Del Webb mortgage operations, which accounted for approximately 13% of the increase. Origination unit volume increased 42% due to the same factors. Our home buying customers continue to account for the majority of total loan production, representing 85% of total Pulte Mortgage unit production for 2002, compared with 81% in 2001 and 83% in 2000. Refinancings represented 8% of total loan production in 2002, compared with 10% in 2001 and 2% during 2000. At December 31, 2002, loan application backlog increased 66% to $1.4 billion as compared to $827 million and $536 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2002, increased 81% to $66.7 million, as a result of increased volume, a favorable interest rate environment, effective leverage of overhead costs and the inclusion of Del Webb mortgage operations for a full year. Gains from the sale of mortgages increased $20.4 million, or 49%, from the same period in 2001. As compared with 2001, net interest income increased $6.3 million to $11.3 million during 2002 due to increased production and a steeper yield curve as a result of the drop in interest rates during 2002. Title income grew 42% contributing $12.2 million to pre tax income for the year. Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2001, increased 49% to $36.9 million, due to increases in volume, capture rate and secondary marketing gains. The addition of Del Webb mortgage operations for the last five months of 2001 contributed approximately 8% of this increase. Pricing and marketing gains increased $17.4 million, or 71%, from the same period in 2000, primarily due to a consistent drop in interest rates throughout 2001. As compared with 2000, net interest income increased $3.1 million to $5.0 million during 2001 due to increased production and a steeper yield curve as a result of the drop in interest rates during 2001. Offsetting these gains was an increase in SGA expenses of $10 million as a result of increased headcount and other related costs due to the increase in volume during 2001. Income from our title operations increased 48% to $8.6 million in 2001, further fueling the growth in our financial services business. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Financial Services (continued): We hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed mortgage loans with derivative financial instruments. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we did not recognize any net gains or losses related to the ineffective portion of the hedging instrument excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We also did not recognize any gains or losses during 2002, for cash flow hedges that were discontinued because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur. At December 31, 2002, we expect to reclassify $1.3 million, net of taxes, of net losses on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next twelve months from sales of closed mortgage loans. Corporate: Corporate is a non operating business segment whose primary purpose is to support the operations of our subsidiaries as the internal source of financing, to develop and implement strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies, and to provide the administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity. As a result, the corporate segments operating results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve. The following table presents this segments results of operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Net interest expense $ 38,214 $ 34,261 $ 28,987 Other corporate expenses, net 23,754 23,191 27,309 Loss before income taxes $ 61,968 $ 57,452 $ 56,296 Interest expense, net of interest capitalized into inventory, increased 12% to $38.2 million in 2002 and 18% to $34.3 million in 2001. This trend is a result of an increase in debt levels necessary to support our growth. Interest incurred for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, excluding interest incurred by our financial services operations, was approximately $162.5, $116.9 and $62.8 million, respectively. Other corporate expense, net over the two year period ended December 31, 2002, was relatively flat, as higher compensation related costs were offset by income from the sale and adjustment to fair value of various non operating parcels of commercial land held for sale. The decrease in other corporate expenses, net in 2001 when compared to 2000 is primarily due to the write down of commercial land held for sale in 2000. Interest capitalized into inventory is charged to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. Interest in inventory at December 31, 2002, increased primarily as a result of higher levels of indebtedness and the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Information related to Corporate interest capitalized into inventory is as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Interest in inventory at beginning of year $ 68,595 $ 24,202 $ 19,092 Interest capitalized 123,086 80,399 33,129 Interest expensed (48,697 ) (36,006 ) (28,019 ) Interest in inventory at end of year $ 142,984 $ 68,595 $ 24,202 21 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources: Our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2002, amounted to $162.2 million. The increase in net income was aided by the realization of certain tax benefits and an increase in accrued liabilities, while inventories continued to build to support the growth of the business. Net cash provided by investing activities was $4.6 million for 2002. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002, was $374.2 million, reflecting proceeds from the $300 million senior notes issued in June 2002, proceeds from borrowings under our various credit facilities and proceeds from employee stock option exercises, offset by the repayment of debt, dividends paid and stock repurchases. Our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2001, was $418.8 million as higher net income was offset by increases in inventory and residential mortgage loans available for sale over 2000 and the resolution of the First Heights litigation. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2001 increased primarily due to the net cash acquired from Del Webb. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $297.1 million as proceeds from the issuance of senior notes of $200 million and $500 million, and increased borrowings under the revolving credit arrangements were offset by the repayment of higher rate debt acquired from Del Webb. We finance our homebuilding land acquisitions, development and construction activities from internally generated funds and existing credit agreements. We had no borrowings under our $570 million unsecured revolving credit facility at December 31, 2002. Pulte Mortgage provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available pursuant to various committed and uncommitted credit arrangements totaling $600 million, an amount deemed adequate to cover foreseeable needs. There were approximately $560 million of borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2002 under the $600 million Pulte Mortgage arrangements. Mortgage loans originated by Pulte Mortgage are subsequently sold to outside investors. We anticipate that there will be adequate mortgage financing available for purchasers of our homes. In June 2002, we sold $300 million of 7.875% senior notes, due 2032, from our $1 billion shelf registration. Cash provided by operations, combined with the net proceeds from this sale of senior notes, were used to call, redeem and repurchase approximately $103 million of Del Webb senior subordinated notes and to repay short term borrowings under our revolving bank credit arrangements. In October 2002, our operating entity in Argentina entered into a $3 million revolving credit facility in order to provide an additional financial resource to support the operations. Pulte Homes, Inc has guaranteed the credit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2002. In October 2002, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan of up to $100 million. Shares will be purchased from time to time on the open market, depending on market conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we repurchased 100,000 shares for approximately $4.3 million. Our income tax liabilities are affected by a number of factors. In 2002, our effective tax rate was 39.0% compared to 38.5% in 2001 and 2000. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2003 will be approximately 39.0%. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): At December 31, 2002, we had cash and equivalents of $613.2 million, $1.7 billion of unsecured senior notes and $260.7 million of unsecured senior subordinated notes. Other financing includes limited recourse collateralized financing totaling $145.5 million. The following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2002: Payments Due by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After 2007 Contractual obligations: Limited recourse collateralized financing $ 145,526 $ 59,563 $ 72,659 $ 10,478 $ 2,826 Non guarantor short term borrowings 559,621 559,621 Senior notes and subordinated notes 1,907,976 275,000 237,000 1,395,976 Operating leases 117,620 31,481 39,243 22,633 24,263 Total contractual obligations $ 2,730,743 $ 925,665 $ 348,902 $ 33,111 $ 1,423,065 The following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2002: Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After 2007 Other commercial commitments: Guarantor revolving credit facilities $ 570,000 $ $ 570,000 $ $ Non guarantor revolving credit facilities 600,000 275,000 325,000 Standby letters of credit 150,955 138,803 12,152 Total commercial commitments $ 1,320,955 $ 413,803 $ 907,152 $ $ Standby letters of credit and performance bonds are used to guarantee our performance under various contracts, principally in connection with the development of our projects. The expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related project. If the obligations related to the project are ongoing, annual extensions are granted on a year to year basis. Performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These bonds, which approximated $954 million at December 31, 2002, are typically outstanding over a period that approximates 3 5 years. In the normal course of business, we acquire rights under options or option type agreements to purchase land to be used in homebuilding operations at future dates. These rights, which may be cancelled at our discretion, may extend over several years and are typically secured by small deposits. Further, these rights are frequently extended or renegotiated to better match the needs of our homebuilding operations. The total purchase price applicable to approved land under option for use by our homebuilding operations at future dates approximated $1.5 billion at December 31, 2002, which represented approximately 43,800 lots. In addition, there were approximately 48,700 lots valued at $982 million under option at December 31, 2002 pending approval, that are under review and evaluation for future use by our homebuilding operations. Sources of our working capital at December 31, 2002, include cash and equivalents, our $570 million committed unsecured revolving credit facility and Pulte Mortgages $600 million revolving credit. Our debt to total capitalization, excluding our collateralized debt, was approximately 41% as of December 31, 2002, and approximately 32% net of cash and equivalents. We expect to maintain our net debt to total capitalization at or below the 40% level. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): In February 2003, we sold $300 million of 6.25% senior notes, due 2013, from the Companys current shelf registration. Proceeds from the sale will be used to retire certain debt coming due or called in 2003. Subsequent to this issuance, we had $400 million remaining available under the current mixed securities shelf registration. Inflation: We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation also increases our financing, labor and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices. To date, inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates: The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements, giving due regard to materiality. The development and selection of the following critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Revenue recognition: Homebuilding Homebuilding revenues are recorded when the sales of homes are completed and ownership has transferred to the customer. Unfunded settlements are deposits in transit on homes for which the sale was completed. We do not engage in arrangements whereby we have ongoing relationships with our homebuyers that require us to repurchase our homes or provide homebuyers with the right of return. Financial Services Mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors. Servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance and are credited to income when the related mortgage payments are received. Loan origination fees, commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred as an adjustment to the cost of the related mortgage loan until such loan is sold. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold. Inventory valuation: Our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated cost or net realizable value. Included in inventories are all direct development costs. We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories and charge the interest to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. This period increased in 2001 due to the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated cost, unless they are determined to be impaired, in which case these inventories are measured at fair value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory adjustments may be required. Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis. Under the specific identification basis, cost of sales includes the construction cost of the home, an average lot cost by project based on land acquisition and development costs, and closing costs and commissions. Construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home, plus an accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid, based on an analysis of budgeted construction cost. This accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared to the amount accrued, and adjustments are made if needed. Total project land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared to actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete. Adjustments to estimated total project land acquisition and development costs for the project affect the amount of future lots costed. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued): Residential mortgage loans available for sale: Residential mortgage loans available for sale are stated at the lower of aggregate cost or market value. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold. We hedge our residential mortgage loans available for sale. Gains and losses from closed commitments and futures contracts are matched against the related gains and losses on the sale of mortgage loans. Goodwill and intangible assets: We have identified significant intangible assets and generated significant goodwill, most recently as a result of the Del Webb merger in 2001. Intangible assets, primarily trademarks and tradenames, were valued by independent appraisers and advisors using proven valuation procedures and are amortized over their estimated useful life. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing. The carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use. If our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly, intangible assets and goodwill may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material. If we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets, long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment, we measure impairment based on one of two methods. For assets related to ongoing operations we plan to continue, we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists and then measure impairment using discounted cash flows. For assets to be disposed of, we assess the fair value of the asset based on current market conditions for similar assets. For goodwill, we assess fair value by measuring discounted cash flows of our reporting units and measure impairment as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded book value. The estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control. Changes in these estimates could result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and material charges to the results of operations. Investments in unconsolidated entities: We participate in a number of joint ventures with independent third parties in which we have less than a controlling interest. These joint ventures purchase, develop and or sell land and homes in the United States, Mexico and Puerto Rico. We recognize our share of profits from the sale of lots and homes to other buyers. We do not recognize profits from lots we purchase, but instead defer those profits until the related homes are sold. At December 31, 2002, we had approximately $49.0 million invested in these joint ventures. Under certain arrangements, future capital contributions may be necessary to maintain our ownership in the joint venture. We have not guaranteed any of the outstanding debt of the joint ventures at December 31, 2002, which approximated $103.2 million. We also own 22.2% of the capital stock of a mortgage banking company in Mexico. At December 31, 2002, our investment in this entity was approximately $15.8 million. We do not have any purchase or investment commitments to this entity. Furthermore, we have not guaranteed any of the indebtedness of this entity, which approximated $1.2 billion at December 31, 2002. These investments are accounted for on the equity method. Allowance for warranties: Home purchasers are provided with warranties against certain building defects. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary geographically. Most warranties cover different aspects of the homes construction and operating systems for a period of up to ten years. We estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim. We periodically assesses the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. Although we have not made significant adjustments to the accrual in the past, actual warranty cost in the future could differ from our current estimate. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our rate sensitive financing to the extent long term rates decline. The following tables set forth, as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, our rate sensitive financing obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value ($000s omitted).

Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed upon terms (i.e., commit to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2002 and 2001, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float. We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to the Federal Funds rate and (ii) hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments with off balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in long term mortgage rates of plus 50, 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results. Our aggregate net investments exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk include our operations in Mexico which approximated $61.1 million, our mortgage banking joint venture investment in Mexico which approximated $15.8 million and our operations in Argentina which approximated $13.1 million. 26 Table of Contents SPECIAL NOTES CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS As a cautionary note, except for the historical information contained herein, certain matters discussed in Item 7., Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding: Our Homebuilding segment consists of the following operations: We conduct our Domestic Homebuilding operations in 44 markets, located throughout 25 states. Domestic Homebuilding offers a broad product line to meet the needs of the first time, first and second move up, and active adult homebuyers. We conduct our International Homebuilding operations through subsidiaries of Pulte International Corporation (International) in Mexico, Puerto Rico and Argentina. International Homebuilding product offerings focus on the demand of first time buyers and middle to upper income consumer groups. We also have agreements in place with multi national corporations to provide employee housing in Mexico. Certain operating data relating to our homebuilding operations and Pulte affiliated joint ventures are as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Pulte Homebuilding settlement revenues: Domestic $ 6,991,614 $ 5,145,526 $ 4,083,816 International 196,074 35,169 27,159 Total Pulte $ 7,187,688 $ 5,180,695 $ 4,110,975 Pulte affiliate international homebuilding settlement revenues $ 40,723 $ 180,621 $ 148,798 Total Pulte/Pulte affiliate homebuilding settlement revenues $ 7,228,411 $ 5,361,316 $ 4,259,773 Pulte Homebuilding settlement units: Domestic 28,903 22,915 19,799 International 6,525 221 264 Total Pulte 35,428 23,136 20,063 Pulte affiliate international homebuilding settlement units 1,022 7,258 7,718 Total Pulte/Pulte affiliate homebuilding settlement units 36,450 30,394 27,781 15 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding (continued): Domestic Homebuilding: The Domestic Homebuilding operations represent our core business. We conduct our operations in 44 markets, located throughout 25 states, and are presented geographically as follows: Northeast: Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia Southeast: Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee Midwest: Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio Central: Colorado, Texas West: Arizona, California, Nevada The greater Phoenix market accounted for 10% of Domestic Homebuilding settlement revenues, 11% of settlement units and 11% of net new orders in 2002. The metropolitan Atlanta market accounted for 10% of unit settlements in 2000. No other individual market represented more than 10% of total Domestic Homebuilding settlement revenues, settlement units or net new orders during the three years ended December 31, 2002. The following table presents selected unit information for our Domestic Homebuilding operations: Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Unit settlements: Northeast 2,440 2,014 2,000 Southeast 8,271 8,126 7,820 Midwest 4,458 3,288 2,903 Central 4,588 3,982 3,622 West 9,146 5,505 3,454 28,903 22,915 19,799 Net new orders units: Northeast 2,738 2,035 1,970 Southeast 8,651 8,544 7,815 Midwest 4,684 3,756 2,818 Central 4,590 4,071 3,644 West 10,167 7,710 3,597 30,830 26,116 19,844 Net new orders dollars ($000s omitted) $ 7,731,000 $ 5,926,000 $ 4,211,000 Backlog at December 31 units: Northeast 1,129 831 810 Southeast 2,939 2,559 2,141 Midwest 1,601 1,375 907 Central 905 903 814 West 4,031 3,010 805 10,605 8,678 5,477 Backlog at December 31 dollars ($000s omitted) $ 2,857,000 $ 2,118,000 $ 1,307,000 16 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding (continued): Domestic Homebuilding (continued): Unit settlements in 2002 reached a record high, increasing 26% to 28,903 units. A full year of the Del Webb operations combined with strong sales in the Midwest drove the increase. 2001 unit settlements increased 16% to 22,915 units, principally from the addition of the Del Webb operations. The average selling price for our homes increased from $206,000 in 2000 to $225,000 in 2001 and to $242,000 in the current year. Changes in average selling price reflect a number of factors, including price increases, the mix of product closed during a period and the number of options purchased by customers. Both 2002 and 2001 benefited from increased product prices, improved product mix and the inclusion of Del Webb product offerings, which had an average selling price higher than our traditional offerings. Ending backlog, which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed, climbed 22% to 10,605 homes. The dollar value of our ending backlog was up 35% to $2.9 billion at December 31, 2002. Unit and dollar backlog at December 31, 2001, increased 58% and 62%, respectively, to 8,678 homes valued at $2.1 billion. Overall, strong demand supported by a favorable interest rate environment and the addition of Del Webb operations drove increased order activity and record levels of backlog. The following table presents a summary of pre tax income for our Domestic Homebuilding operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Home sale revenue (settlements) $ 6,991,614 $ 5,145,526 $ 4,083,816 Land sale revenue 176,301 129,134 84,700 Home cost of sales (5,589,465 ) (4,127,059 ) (3,320,885 ) Land cost of sales (123,306 ) (97,941 ) (56,250 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (664,469 ) (482,128 ) (365,704 ) Interest (48,697 ) (36,006 ) (28,019 ) Other expense, net (22,968 ) (16,851 ) (14,403 ) Pre tax income $ 719,010 $ 514,675 $ 383,255 Average sales price $ 242 $ 225 $ 206 We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories and charge the interest to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. Gross profit margins from home sales in 2002 increased 30 basis points over 2001 to 20.1%, including the effect of purchase accounting associated with the Del Webb merger. Excluding the effect of purchase accounting adjustments in both years, gross margins would have been 20.1% in 2002 and 20.0% in 2001. Gross profit margins in 2001 increased 110 basis points to 19.8% including purchase accounting adjustments and 130 basis points excluding purchase accounting adjustments over 2000 gross margins. Factors that contributed to this favorable trend include strong customer demand, positive home pricing, the benefits of leverage buy purchasing activities and effective production and inventory management. Land sales increased in each of the prior three years, demonstrating our competency in purchasing, developing and entitling certain land positions for sale primarily to other homebuilders, as well as to retail and commercial establishments. Revenues and their related gains/losses may vary significantly between periods, depending on the timing of such sales. We continue to rationalize certain existing land positions to ensure the most effective use of invested capital. For the year ended December 31, 2002, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of home settlement revenues, increased 13 basis points to 9.50% after increasing 42 basis points to 9.37% in 2001. Higher startup costs for new communities and increased compensation related costs partially offset by a reduction in costs associated with the Del Webb operations contributed to the change in 2002. The increase in 2001 reflects higher startup costs for new communities, increased compensation related costs, local market advertising expenses and the inclusion of Del Webb operations. 17 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding (continued): Domestic Homebuilding (continued): Interest expense increased $12.7 million to $48.7 million in 2002 and $8.0 million to $36.0 million in 2001. The increases are a result of an increase in debt levels necessary to support the growth of the business. Other expense, net increased to $23.0 million in 2002 primarily as a result of income from certain non operating investments recorded in 2001. The increase from 2000 to 2001 represents an increase in land inventory valuation reserves for certain land positions and amortization of tradenames and trademarks acquired in the merger with Del Webb. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, our Domestic Homebuilding operations controlled approximately 176,800 and 141,100 lots, respectively. Approximately 84,300 and 81,200 lots were owned, and approximately 43,800 and 34,800 lots under option agreements approved for purchase at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In addition, there were approximately 48,700 lots under option agreements at December 31, 2002, pending approval, that are under review and evaluation for future use by our Domestic Homebuilding operations. This compared to 25,100 lots at December 31, 2001. Domestic Homebuilding inventory at December 31, 2002, was approximately $4.1 billion, of which $3.2 billion related to land and land development. At December 31, 2001, inventory was approximately $3.8 billion, of which $2.8 billion related to land and land development. Included in other assets is approximately $218.8 million in land held for disposition as of December 31, 2002, as compared to $223.5 million in the prior year. International Homebuilding: Our International Homebuilding operations are primarily conducted through subsidiaries of International in Mexico, Puerto Rico and Argentina. Mexico Effective January 1, 2002, International reorganized its structure within Mexico to create a single company, Pulte Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V. (Pulte Mexico), which ranks as one of the largest builders in the country. Prior to the reorganization, these operations were conducted primarily through five joint ventures throughout Mexico. Under the new ownership structure, which combines the largest of these entities, we own 63.8% of Pulte Mexico and have consolidated Pulte Mexico into our financial statements. The new operating structure facilitates growth, enables operating leverage and improves efficiencies through standardized systems and procedures. Puerto Rico Operations in Puerto Rico are conducted through Internationals 100% owned subsidiary, Pulte International Caribbean Corporation and three joint ventures. Argentina Operations in Argentina, which are based in the greater Buenos Aires area, are conducted through Pulte SRL, Internationals 100% owned Argentine subsidiary. 18 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding (continued): International Homebuilding (continued): The following table presents selected financial data for our International Homebuilding operations for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Revenues $ 196,074 $ 35,169 $ 27,159 Cost of sales (157,056 ) (30,937 ) (24,611 ) Selling, general and administrative expense (35,029 ) (11,820 ) (5,621 ) Other income (expense), net (1,610 ) 66 967 Minority interest (1,801 ) Equity in income of joint ventures 4,479 5,138 5,455 Pre tax income (loss) $ 5,057 $ (2,384 ) $ 3,349 Unit settlements: Pulte 6,525 221 264 Pulte affiliated entities 1,022 7,258 7,718 7,547 7,479 7,982 Unit settlements for Pulte and Pulte affiliated entities in 2002 were relatively flat as compared to 2001 and down in 2001 when compared to 2000, as declines in Puerto Rico and Mexico were only partially offset by settlements in Argentina, which approached 200 in 2002. Settlements in Mexico were 7,166 in 2002 compared to 7,158 in 2001 and 7,718 in 2000. Activity in Mexico continues to be slowed by the impact of changes made in 2001 and 2002 to local lending practices and the lack of alternative funding sources. Increased revenues in 2002 are due to consolidation of the operations in Mexico for eleven months of 2002, a full year of operations in Argentina, which had only begun recognizing its first closings in June of 2001, partially offset by a decline in Puerto Rico. Revenues from our operations in Mexico were $158.1 million in 2002. Our operations in Argentina contributed $25.9 million compared to $9.5 million in the prior year. Revenues in Puerto Rico were down to $12.1 million from $25.5 million. The consolidation of Mexico also had a positive effect on gross margins, which rose to 19.9% in 2002 from 12.0% in 2001 and 9.4% in 2000. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues declined as a result of a reduction in start up costs associated with our operations in Argentina. Equity in income of joint ventures in 2002 represents one month of the joint venture operations in Mexico and our joint venture located in Canovanas, Puerto Rico, which had its first closings during the third quarter of 2001. Our operations in Argentina recorded transaction losses of $208,000 and $463,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, as the value of the Argentine peso continued to fluctuate following the Argentine governments decision to de link its valuation from the U.S. Dollar. We also recorded a foreign currency translation loss of $12.8 million, as a component of cumulative other comprehensive income during 2002. It remains unclear at this time how the financial and currency markets in Argentina will be impacted in 2003 or how the current economic situation may affect customer home buying attitudes and the homebuilding business in general. At December 31, 2002, our investment, net of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments, in Argentina approximated $13.1 million. Our operations in Mexico have also been affected by a strengthening dollar to the Mexican peso where transaction losses of $483,000, $378,000 and $78,000 were recorded in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. At December 31, 2002, our investment, net of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments, in Mexico approximated $61.1 million. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Financial Services: We conduct our financial services business, which includes mortgage and title operations, through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries. We sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts. Due to the short period of time the servicing rights are held, usually three to four months, we do not amortize the servicing asset. Since the servicing rights are recorded at the value in the servicing sales contracts, there are no impairment issues related to these assets. We also originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various credit arrangements, and then sell such mortgage loans to outside investors. The following table presents mortgage origination data for our Financial Services operations: Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Total originations: Loans 23,074 19,018 13,415 Principal ($000s omitted) $ 3,771,000 $ 2,937,100 $ 1,957,300 Originations for Pulte customers: Loans 19,537 15,402 11,109 Principal ($000s omitted) $ 3,176,500 $ 2,385,500 $ 1,697,600 Mortgage origination unit and principal volume for the year ended December 31, 2002, increased 21% and 28%, respectively, over 2001. This growth can be attributed to an increase in the capture rate of 390 basis points to 77.6% and the inclusion of Del Webb mortgage operations for a full year. Our capture rate represents loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percent of total loan opportunities, excluding cash settlements, from our homebuilding business. Mortgage origination principal volume in 2001 increased 50% over 2000, due to an increase in the capture rate of 950 basis points to 73.7%, an increased average loan size and the inclusion of Del Webb mortgage operations, which accounted for approximately 13% of the increase. Origination unit volume increased 42% due to the same factors. Our home buying customers continue to account for the majority of total loan production, representing 85% of total Pulte Mortgage unit production for 2002, compared with 81% in 2001 and 83% in 2000. Refinancings represented 8% of total loan production in 2002, compared with 10% in 2001 and 2% during 2000. At December 31, 2002, loan application backlog increased 66% to $1.4 billion as compared to $827 million and $536 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2002, increased 81% to $66.7 million, as a result of increased volume, a favorable interest rate environment, effective leverage of overhead costs and the inclusion of Del Webb mortgage operations for a full year. Gains from the sale of mortgages increased $20.4 million, or 49%, from the same period in 2001. As compared with 2001, net interest income increased $6.3 million to $11.3 million during 2002 due to increased production and a steeper yield curve as a result of the drop in interest rates during 2002. Title income grew 42% contributing $12.2 million to pre tax income for the year. Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2001, increased 49% to $36.9 million, due to increases in volume, capture rate and secondary marketing gains. The addition of Del Webb mortgage operations for the last five months of 2001 contributed approximately 8% of this increase. Pricing and marketing gains increased $17.4 million, or 71%, from the same period in 2000, primarily due to a consistent drop in interest rates throughout 2001. As compared with 2000, net interest income increased $3.1 million to $5.0 million during 2001 due to increased production and a steeper yield curve as a result of the drop in interest rates during 2001. Offsetting these gains was an increase in SGA expenses of $10 million as a result of increased headcount and other related costs due to the increase in volume during 2001. Income from our title operations increased 48% to $8.6 million in 2001, further fueling the growth in our financial services business. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Financial Services (continued): We hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed mortgage loans with derivative financial instruments. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we did not recognize any net gains or losses related to the ineffective portion of the hedging instrument excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We also did not recognize any gains or losses during 2002, for cash flow hedges that were discontinued because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur. At December 31, 2002, we expect to reclassify $1.3 million, net of taxes, of net losses on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next twelve months from sales of closed mortgage loans. Corporate: Corporate is a non operating business segment whose primary purpose is to support the operations of our subsidiaries as the internal source of financing, to develop and implement strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies, and to provide the administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity. As a result, the corporate segments operating results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve. The following table presents this segments results of operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Net interest expense $ 38,214 $ 34,261 $ 28,987 Other corporate expenses, net 23,754 23,191 27,309 Loss before income taxes $ 61,968 $ 57,452 $ 56,296 Interest expense, net of interest capitalized into inventory, increased 12% to $38.2 million in 2002 and 18% to $34.3 million in 2001. This trend is a result of an increase in debt levels necessary to support our growth. Interest incurred for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, excluding interest incurred by our financial services operations, was approximately $162.5, $116.9 and $62.8 million, respectively. Other corporate expense, net over the two year period ended December 31, 2002, was relatively flat, as higher compensation related costs were offset by income from the sale and adjustment to fair value of various non operating parcels of commercial land held for sale. The decrease in other corporate expenses, net in 2001 when compared to 2000 is primarily due to the write down of commercial land held for sale in 2000. Interest capitalized into inventory is charged to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. Interest in inventory at December 31, 2002, increased primarily as a result of higher levels of indebtedness and the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Information related to Corporate interest capitalized into inventory is as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Interest in inventory at beginning of year $ 68,595 $ 24,202 $ 19,092 Interest capitalized 123,086 80,399 33,129 Interest expensed (48,697 ) (36,006 ) (28,019 ) Interest in inventory at end of year $ 142,984 $ 68,595 $ 24,202 21 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources: Our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2002, amounted to $162.2 million. The increase in net income was aided by the realization of certain tax benefits and an increase in accrued liabilities, while inventories continued to build to support the growth of the business. Net cash provided by investing activities was $4.6 million for 2002. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002, was $374.2 million, reflecting proceeds from the $300 million senior notes issued in June 2002, proceeds from borrowings under our various credit facilities and proceeds from employee stock option exercises, offset by the repayment of debt, dividends paid and stock repurchases. Our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2001, was $418.8 million as higher net income was offset by increases in inventory and residential mortgage loans available for sale over 2000 and the resolution of the First Heights litigation. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2001 increased primarily due to the net cash acquired from Del Webb. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $297.1 million as proceeds from the issuance of senior notes of $200 million and $500 million, and increased borrowings under the revolving credit arrangements were offset by the repayment of higher rate debt acquired from Del Webb. We finance our homebuilding land acquisitions, development and construction activities from internally generated funds and existing credit agreements. We had no borrowings under our $570 million unsecured revolving credit facility at December 31, 2002. Pulte Mortgage provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available pursuant to various committed and uncommitted credit arrangements totaling $600 million, an amount deemed adequate to cover foreseeable needs. There were approximately $560 million of borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2002 under the $600 million Pulte Mortgage arrangements. Mortgage loans originated by Pulte Mortgage are subsequently sold to outside investors. We anticipate that there will be adequate mortgage financing available for purchasers of our homes. In June 2002, we sold $300 million of 7.875% senior notes, due 2032, from our $1 billion shelf registration. Cash provided by operations, combined with the net proceeds from this sale of senior notes, were used to call, redeem and repurchase approximately $103 million of Del Webb senior subordinated notes and to repay short term borrowings under our revolving bank credit arrangements. In October 2002, our operating entity in Argentina entered into a $3 million revolving credit facility in order to provide an additional financial resource to support the operations. Pulte Homes, Inc has guaranteed the credit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2002. In October 2002, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan of up to $100 million. Shares will be purchased from time to time on the open market, depending on market conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we repurchased 100,000 shares for approximately $4.3 million. Our income tax liabilities are affected by a number of factors. In 2002, our effective tax rate was 39.0% compared to 38.5% in 2001 and 2000. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2003 will be approximately 39.0%. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): At December 31, 2002, we had cash and equivalents of $613.2 million, $1.7 billion of unsecured senior notes and $260.7 million of unsecured senior subordinated notes. Other financing includes limited recourse collateralized financing totaling $145.5 million. The following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2002: Payments Due by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After 2007 Contractual obligations: Limited recourse collateralized financing $ 145,526 $ 59,563 $ 72,659 $ 10,478 $ 2,826 Non guarantor short term borrowings 559,621 559,621 Senior notes and subordinated notes 1,907,976 275,000 237,000 1,395,976 Operating leases 117,620 31,481 39,243 22,633 24,263 Total contractual obligations $ 2,730,743 $ 925,665 $ 348,902 $ 33,111 $ 1,423,065 The following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2002: Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After 2007 Other commercial commitments: Guarantor revolving credit facilities $ 570,000 $ $ 570,000 $ $ Non guarantor revolving credit facilities 600,000 275,000 325,000 Standby letters of credit 150,955 138,803 12,152 Total commercial commitments $ 1,320,955 $ 413,803 $ 907,152 $ $ Standby letters of credit and performance bonds are used to guarantee our performance under various contracts, principally in connection with the development of our projects. The expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related project. If the obligations related to the project are ongoing, annual extensions are granted on a year to year basis. Performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These bonds, which approximated $954 million at December 31, 2002, are typically outstanding over a period that approximates 3 5 years. In the normal course of business, we acquire rights under options or option type agreements to purchase land to be used in homebuilding operations at future dates. These rights, which may be cancelled at our discretion, may extend over several years and are typically secured by small deposits. Further, these rights are frequently extended or renegotiated to better match the needs of our homebuilding operations. The total purchase price applicable to approved land under option for use by our homebuilding operations at future dates approximated $1.5 billion at December 31, 2002, which represented approximately 43,800 lots. In addition, there were approximately 48,700 lots valued at $982 million under option at December 31, 2002 pending approval, that are under review and evaluation for future use by our homebuilding operations. Sources of our working capital at December 31, 2002, include cash and equivalents, our $570 million committed unsecured revolving credit facility and Pulte Mortgages $600 million revolving credit. Our debt to total capitalization, excluding our collateralized debt, was approximately 41% as of December 31, 2002, and approximately 32% net of cash and equivalents. We expect to maintain our net debt to total capitalization at or below the 40% level. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): In February 2003, we sold $300 million of 6.25% senior notes, due 2013, from the Companys current shelf registration. Proceeds from the sale will be used to retire certain debt coming due or called in 2003. Subsequent to this issuance, we had $400 million remaining available under the current mixed securities shelf registration. Inflation: We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation also increases our financing, labor and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices. To date, inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates: The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements, giving due regard to materiality. The development and selection of the following critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Revenue recognition: Homebuilding Homebuilding revenues are recorded when the sales of homes are completed and ownership has transferred to the customer. Unfunded settlements are deposits in transit on homes for which the sale was completed. We do not engage in arrangements whereby we have ongoing relationships with our homebuyers that require us to repurchase our homes or provide homebuyers with the right of return. Financial Services Mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors. Servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance and are credited to income when the related mortgage payments are received. Loan origination fees, commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred as an adjustment to the cost of the related mortgage loan until such loan is sold. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold. Inventory valuation: Our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated cost or net realizable value. Included in inventories are all direct development costs. We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories and charge the interest to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. This period increased in 2001 due to the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated cost, unless they are determined to be impaired, in which case these inventories are measured at fair value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory adjustments may be required. Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis. Under the specific identification basis, cost of sales includes the construction cost of the home, an average lot cost by project based on land acquisition and development costs, and closing costs and commissions. Construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home, plus an accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid, based on an analysis of budgeted construction cost. This accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared to the amount accrued, and adjustments are made if needed. Total project land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared to actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete. Adjustments to estimated total project land acquisition and development costs for the project affect the amount of future lots costed. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued): Residential mortgage loans available for sale: Residential mortgage loans available for sale are stated at the lower of aggregate cost or market value. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold. We hedge our residential mortgage loans available for sale. Gains and losses from closed commitments and futures contracts are matched against the related gains and losses on the sale of mortgage loans. Goodwill and intangible assets: We have identified significant intangible assets and generated significant goodwill, most recently as a result of the Del Webb merger in 2001. Intangible assets, primarily trademarks and tradenames, were valued by independent appraisers and advisors using proven valuation procedures and are amortized over their estimated useful life. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing. The carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use. If our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly, intangible assets and goodwill may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material. If we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets, long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment, we measure impairment based on one of two methods. For assets related to ongoing operations we plan to continue, we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists and then measure impairment using discounted cash flows. For assets to be disposed of, we assess the fair value of the asset based on current market conditions for similar assets. For goodwill, we assess fair value by measuring discounted cash flows of our reporting units and measure impairment as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded book value. The estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control. Changes in these estimates could result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and material charges to the results of operations. Investments in unconsolidated entities: We participate in a number of joint ventures with independent third parties in which we have less than a controlling interest. These joint ventures purchase, develop and or sell land and homes in the United States, Mexico and Puerto Rico. We recognize our share of profits from the sale of lots and homes to other buyers. We do not recognize profits from lots we purchase, but instead defer those profits until the related homes are sold. At December 31, 2002, we had approximately $49.0 million invested in these joint ventures. Under certain arrangements, future capital contributions may be necessary to maintain our ownership in the joint venture. We have not guaranteed any of the outstanding debt of the joint ventures at December 31, 2002, which approximated $103.2 million. We also own 22.2% of the capital stock of a mortgage banking company in Mexico. At December 31, 2002, our investment in this entity was approximately $15.8 million. We do not have any purchase or investment commitments to this entity. Furthermore, we have not guaranteed any of the indebtedness of this entity, which approximated $1.2 billion at December 31, 2002. These investments are accounted for on the equity method. Allowance for warranties: Home purchasers are provided with warranties against certain building defects. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary geographically. Most warranties cover different aspects of the homes construction and operating systems for a period of up to ten years. We estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim. We periodically assesses the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. Although we have not made significant adjustments to the accrual in the past, actual warranty cost in the future could differ from our current estimate. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our rate sensitive financing to the extent long term rates decline. The following tables set forth, as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, our rate sensitive financing obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value ($000s omitted). As of December 31, 2002 for the Years ended December 31, There Fair 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 after Total Value Rate sensitive liabilities: Fixed interest rate debt: Senior notes and subordinated notes $ 275,000 $ 112,000 $ 125,000 $ $ $ 1,395,976 $ 1,907,976 $ 2,006,173 Average interest rate 8.59 % 8.38 % 7.30 % 8.46 % 8.23 % Limited recourse collateralized financing $ 59,563 $ 41,528 $ 31,131 $ 9,128 $ 1,350 $ 2,826 $ 145,526 $ 145,526 Average interest rate 5.27 % 5.53 % 6.12 % 2.16 % 4.00 % 4.00 % 5.30 % As of December 31, 2001 for the Years ended December 31, There Fair 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 after Total Value Rate sensitive liabilities: Fixed interest rate debt: Senior notes and subordinated notes $ $ 275,000 $ 112,000 $ 125,000 $ 69,810 $ 1,130,887 $ 1,712,697 $ 1,744,726 Average interest rate 8.59 % 8.38 % 7.30 % 9.00 % 8.37 % 8.36 % Limited recourse collateralized financing $ 17,556 $ 7,531 $ 4,446 $ 5,894 $ 1,350 $ 2,826 $ 39,603 $ 39,603 Average interest rate 6.42 % 6.96 % 7.20 % 5.06 % 4.00 % 4.00 % 6.15 % Pulte Mortgage, operating as a mortgage banker, is also subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed upon terms (i.e., commit to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2002 and 2001, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float. We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to the Federal Funds rate and (ii) hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments with off balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in long term mortgage rates of plus 50, 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results. Our aggregate net investments exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk include our operations in Mexico which approximated $61.1 million, our mortgage banking joint venture investment in Mexico which approximated $15.8 million and our operations in Argentina which approximated $13.1 million. 26 Table of Contents SPECIAL NOTES CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS As a cautionary note, except for the historical information contained herein, certain matters discussed in Item 7., Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding (continued): Domestic Homebuilding: The Domestic Homebuilding operations represent our core business. We conduct our operations in 44 markets, located throughout 25 states, and are presented geographically as follows: Northeast: Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia Southeast: Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee Midwest: Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio Central: Colorado, Texas West: Arizona, California, Nevada The greater Phoenix market accounted for 10% of Domestic Homebuilding settlement revenues, 11% of settlement units and 11% of net new orders in 2002. The metropolitan Atlanta market accounted for 10% of unit settlements in 2000. No other individual market represented more than 10% of total Domestic Homebuilding settlement revenues, settlement units or net new orders during the three years ended December 31, 2002. The following table presents selected unit information for our Domestic Homebuilding operations: Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Unit settlements: Northeast 2,440 2,014 2,000 Southeast 8,271 8,126 7,820 Midwest 4,458 3,288 2,903 Central 4,588 3,982 3,622 West 9,146 5,505 3,454 28,903 22,915 19,799 Net new orders units: Northeast 2,738 2,035 1,970 Southeast 8,651 8,544 7,815 Midwest 4,684 3,756 2,818 Central 4,590 4,071 3,644 West 10,167 7,710 3,597 30,830 26,116 19,844 Net new orders dollars ($000s omitted) $ 7,731,000 $ 5,926,000 $ 4,211,000 Backlog at December 31 units: Northeast 1,129 831 810 Southeast 2,939 2,559 2,141 Midwest 1,601 1,375 907 Central 905 903 814 West 4,031 3,010 805 10,605 8,678 5,477 Backlog at December 31 dollars ($000s omitted) $ 2,857,000 $ 2,118,000 $ 1,307,000 16 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding (continued): Domestic Homebuilding (continued): Unit settlements in 2002 reached a record high, increasing 26% to 28,903 units. A full year of the Del Webb operations combined with strong sales in the Midwest drove the increase. 2001 unit settlements increased 16% to 22,915 units, principally from the addition of the Del Webb operations. The average selling price for our homes increased from $206,000 in 2000 to $225,000 in 2001 and to $242,000 in the current year. Changes in average selling price reflect a number of factors, including price increases, the mix of product closed during a period and the number of options purchased by customers. Both 2002 and 2001 benefited from increased product prices, improved product mix and the inclusion of Del Webb product offerings, which had an average selling price higher than our traditional offerings. Ending backlog, which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed, climbed 22% to 10,605 homes. The dollar value of our ending backlog was up 35% to $2.9 billion at December 31, 2002. Unit and dollar backlog at December 31, 2001, increased 58% and 62%, respectively, to 8,678 homes valued at $2.1 billion. Overall, strong demand supported by a favorable interest rate environment and the addition of Del Webb operations drove increased order activity and record levels of backlog. The following table presents a summary of pre tax income for our Domestic Homebuilding operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Home sale revenue (settlements) $ 6,991,614 $ 5,145,526 $ 4,083,816 Land sale revenue 176,301 129,134 84,700 Home cost of sales (5,589,465 ) (4,127,059 ) (3,320,885 ) Land cost of sales (123,306 ) (97,941 ) (56,250 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (664,469 ) (482,128 ) (365,704 ) Interest (48,697 ) (36,006 ) (28,019 ) Other expense, net (22,968 ) (16,851 ) (14,403 ) Pre tax income $ 719,010 $ 514,675 $ 383,255 Average sales price $ 242 $ 225 $ 206 We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories and charge the interest to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. Gross profit margins from home sales in 2002 increased 30 basis points over 2001 to 20.1%, including the effect of purchase accounting associated with the Del Webb merger. Excluding the effect of purchase accounting adjustments in both years, gross margins would have been 20.1% in 2002 and 20.0% in 2001. Gross profit margins in 2001 increased 110 basis points to 19.8% including purchase accounting adjustments and 130 basis points excluding purchase accounting adjustments over 2000 gross margins. Factors that contributed to this favorable trend include strong customer demand, positive home pricing, the benefits of leverage buy purchasing activities and effective production and inventory management. Land sales increased in each of the prior three years, demonstrating our competency in purchasing, developing and entitling certain land positions for sale primarily to other homebuilders, as well as to retail and commercial establishments. Revenues and their related gains/losses may vary significantly between periods, depending on the timing of such sales. We continue to rationalize certain existing land positions to ensure the most effective use of invested capital. For the year ended December 31, 2002, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of home settlement revenues, increased 13 basis points to 9.50% after increasing 42 basis points to 9.37% in 2001. Higher startup costs for new communities and increased compensation related costs partially offset by a reduction in costs associated with the Del Webb operations contributed to the change in 2002. The increase in 2001 reflects higher startup costs for new communities, increased compensation related costs, local market advertising expenses and the inclusion of Del Webb operations. 17 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding (continued): Domestic Homebuilding (continued): Interest expense increased $12.7 million to $48.7 million in 2002 and $8.0 million to $36.0 million in 2001. The increases are a result of an increase in debt levels necessary to support the growth of the business. Other expense, net increased to $23.0 million in 2002 primarily as a result of income from certain non operating investments recorded in 2001. The increase from 2000 to 2001 represents an increase in land inventory valuation reserves for certain land positions and amortization of tradenames and trademarks acquired in the merger with Del Webb. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, our Domestic Homebuilding operations controlled approximately 176,800 and 141,100 lots, respectively. Approximately 84,300 and 81,200 lots were owned, and approximately 43,800 and 34,800 lots under option agreements approved for purchase at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In addition, there were approximately 48,700 lots under option agreements at December 31, 2002, pending approval, that are under review and evaluation for future use by our Domestic Homebuilding operations. This compared to 25,100 lots at December 31, 2001. Domestic Homebuilding inventory at December 31, 2002, was approximately $4.1 billion, of which $3.2 billion related to land and land development. At December 31, 2001, inventory was approximately $3.8 billion, of which $2.8 billion related to land and land development. Included in other assets is approximately $218.8 million in land held for disposition as of December 31, 2002, as compared to $223.5 million in the prior year. International Homebuilding: Our International Homebuilding operations are primarily conducted through subsidiaries of International in Mexico, Puerto Rico and Argentina. Mexico Effective January 1, 2002, International reorganized its structure within Mexico to create a single company, Pulte Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V. (Pulte Mexico), which ranks as one of the largest builders in the country. Prior to the reorganization, these operations were conducted primarily through five joint ventures throughout Mexico. Under the new ownership structure, which combines the largest of these entities, we own 63.8% of Pulte Mexico and have consolidated Pulte Mexico into our financial statements. The new operating structure facilitates growth, enables operating leverage and improves efficiencies through standardized systems and procedures. Puerto Rico Operations in Puerto Rico are conducted through Internationals 100% owned subsidiary, Pulte International Caribbean Corporation and three joint ventures. Argentina Operations in Argentina, which are based in the greater Buenos Aires area, are conducted through Pulte SRL, Internationals 100% owned Argentine subsidiary. 18 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding (continued): International Homebuilding (continued): The following table presents selected financial data for our International Homebuilding operations for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Revenues $ 196,074 $ 35,169 $ 27,159 Cost of sales (157,056 ) (30,937 ) (24,611 ) Selling, general and administrative expense (35,029 ) (11,820 ) (5,621 ) Other income (expense), net (1,610 ) 66 967 Minority interest (1,801 ) Equity in income of joint ventures 4,479 5,138 5,455 Pre tax income (loss) $ 5,057 $ (2,384 ) $ 3,349 Unit settlements: Pulte 6,525 221 264 Pulte affiliated entities 1,022 7,258 7,718 7,547 7,479 7,982 Unit settlements for Pulte and Pulte affiliated entities in 2002 were relatively flat as compared to 2001 and down in 2001 when compared to 2000, as declines in Puerto Rico and Mexico were only partially offset by settlements in Argentina, which approached 200 in 2002. Settlements in Mexico were 7,166 in 2002 compared to 7,158 in 2001 and 7,718 in 2000. Activity in Mexico continues to be slowed by the impact of changes made in 2001 and 2002 to local lending practices and the lack of alternative funding sources. Increased revenues in 2002 are due to consolidation of the operations in Mexico for eleven months of 2002, a full year of operations in Argentina, which had only begun recognizing its first closings in June of 2001, partially offset by a decline in Puerto Rico. Revenues from our operations in Mexico were $158.1 million in 2002. Our operations in Argentina contributed $25.9 million compared to $9.5 million in the prior year. Revenues in Puerto Rico were down to $12.1 million from $25.5 million. The consolidation of Mexico also had a positive effect on gross margins, which rose to 19.9% in 2002 from 12.0% in 2001 and 9.4% in 2000. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues declined as a result of a reduction in start up costs associated with our operations in Argentina. Equity in income of joint ventures in 2002 represents one month of the joint venture operations in Mexico and our joint venture located in Canovanas, Puerto Rico, which had its first closings during the third quarter of 2001. Our operations in Argentina recorded transaction losses of $208,000 and $463,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, as the value of the Argentine peso continued to fluctuate following the Argentine governments decision to de link its valuation from the U.S. Dollar. We also recorded a foreign currency translation loss of $12.8 million, as a component of cumulative other comprehensive income during 2002. It remains unclear at this time how the financial and currency markets in Argentina will be impacted in 2003 or how the current economic situation may affect customer home buying attitudes and the homebuilding business in general. At December 31, 2002, our investment, net of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments, in Argentina approximated $13.1 million. Our operations in Mexico have also been affected by a strengthening dollar to the Mexican peso where transaction losses of $483,000, $378,000 and $78,000 were recorded in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. At December 31, 2002, our investment, net of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments, in Mexico approximated $61.1 million. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Financial Services: We conduct our financial services business, which includes mortgage and title operations, through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries. We sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts. Due to the short period of time the servicing rights are held, usually three to four months, we do not amortize the servicing asset. Since the servicing rights are recorded at the value in the servicing sales contracts, there are no impairment issues related to these assets. We also originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various credit arrangements, and then sell such mortgage loans to outside investors. The following table presents mortgage origination data for our Financial Services operations: Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Total originations: Loans 23,074 19,018 13,415 Principal ($000s omitted) $ 3,771,000 $ 2,937,100 $ 1,957,300 Originations for Pulte customers: Loans 19,537 15,402 11,109 Principal ($000s omitted) $ 3,176,500 $ 2,385,500 $ 1,697,600 Mortgage origination unit and principal volume for the year ended December 31, 2002, increased 21% and 28%, respectively, over 2001. This growth can be attributed to an increase in the capture rate of 390 basis points to 77.6% and the inclusion of Del Webb mortgage operations for a full year. Our capture rate represents loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percent of total loan opportunities, excluding cash settlements, from our homebuilding business. Mortgage origination principal volume in 2001 increased 50% over 2000, due to an increase in the capture rate of 950 basis points to 73.7%, an increased average loan size and the inclusion of Del Webb mortgage operations, which accounted for approximately 13% of the increase. Origination unit volume increased 42% due to the same factors. Our home buying customers continue to account for the majority of total loan production, representing 85% of total Pulte Mortgage unit production for 2002, compared with 81% in 2001 and 83% in 2000. Refinancings represented 8% of total loan production in 2002, compared with 10% in 2001 and 2% during 2000. At December 31, 2002, loan application backlog increased 66% to $1.4 billion as compared to $827 million and $536 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2002, increased 81% to $66.7 million, as a result of increased volume, a favorable interest rate environment, effective leverage of overhead costs and the inclusion of Del Webb mortgage operations for a full year. Gains from the sale of mortgages increased $20.4 million, or 49%, from the same period in 2001. As compared with 2001, net interest income increased $6.3 million to $11.3 million during 2002 due to increased production and a steeper yield curve as a result of the drop in interest rates during 2002. Title income grew 42% contributing $12.2 million to pre tax income for the year. Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2001, increased 49% to $36.9 million, due to increases in volume, capture rate and secondary marketing gains. The addition of Del Webb mortgage operations for the last five months of 2001 contributed approximately 8% of this increase. Pricing and marketing gains increased $17.4 million, or 71%, from the same period in 2000, primarily due to a consistent drop in interest rates throughout 2001. As compared with 2000, net interest income increased $3.1 million to $5.0 million during 2001 due to increased production and a steeper yield curve as a result of the drop in interest rates during 2001. Offsetting these gains was an increase in SGA expenses of $10 million as a result of increased headcount and other related costs due to the increase in volume during 2001. Income from our title operations increased 48% to $8.6 million in 2001, further fueling the growth in our financial services business. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Financial Services (continued): We hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed mortgage loans with derivative financial instruments. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we did not recognize any net gains or losses related to the ineffective portion of the hedging instrument excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We also did not recognize any gains or losses during 2002, for cash flow hedges that were discontinued because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur. At December 31, 2002, we expect to reclassify $1.3 million, net of taxes, of net losses on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next twelve months from sales of closed mortgage loans. Corporate: Corporate is a non operating business segment whose primary purpose is to support the operations of our subsidiaries as the internal source of financing, to develop and implement strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies, and to provide the administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity. As a result, the corporate segments operating results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve. The following table presents this segments results of operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Net interest expense $ 38,214 $ 34,261 $ 28,987 Other corporate expenses, net 23,754 23,191 27,309 Loss before income taxes $ 61,968 $ 57,452 $ 56,296 Interest expense, net of interest capitalized into inventory, increased 12% to $38.2 million in 2002 and 18% to $34.3 million in 2001. This trend is a result of an increase in debt levels necessary to support our growth. Interest incurred for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, excluding interest incurred by our financial services operations, was approximately $162.5, $116.9 and $62.8 million, respectively. Other corporate expense, net over the two year period ended December 31, 2002, was relatively flat, as higher compensation related costs were offset by income from the sale and adjustment to fair value of various non operating parcels of commercial land held for sale. The decrease in other corporate expenses, net in 2001 when compared to 2000 is primarily due to the write down of commercial land held for sale in 2000. Interest capitalized into inventory is charged to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. Interest in inventory at December 31, 2002, increased primarily as a result of higher levels of indebtedness and the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Information related to Corporate interest capitalized into inventory is as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Interest in inventory at beginning of year $ 68,595 $ 24,202 $ 19,092 Interest capitalized 123,086 80,399 33,129 Interest expensed (48,697 ) (36,006 ) (28,019 ) Interest in inventory at end of year $ 142,984 $ 68,595 $ 24,202 21 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources: Our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2002, amounted to $162.2 million. The increase in net income was aided by the realization of certain tax benefits and an increase in accrued liabilities, while inventories continued to build to support the growth of the business. Net cash provided by investing activities was $4.6 million for 2002. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002, was $374.2 million, reflecting proceeds from the $300 million senior notes issued in June 2002, proceeds from borrowings under our various credit facilities and proceeds from employee stock option exercises, offset by the repayment of debt, dividends paid and stock repurchases. Our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2001, was $418.8 million as higher net income was offset by increases in inventory and residential mortgage loans available for sale over 2000 and the resolution of the First Heights litigation. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2001 increased primarily due to the net cash acquired from Del Webb. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $297.1 million as proceeds from the issuance of senior notes of $200 million and $500 million, and increased borrowings under the revolving credit arrangements were offset by the repayment of higher rate debt acquired from Del Webb. We finance our homebuilding land acquisitions, development and construction activities from internally generated funds and existing credit agreements. We had no borrowings under our $570 million unsecured revolving credit facility at December 31, 2002. Pulte Mortgage provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available pursuant to various committed and uncommitted credit arrangements totaling $600 million, an amount deemed adequate to cover foreseeable needs. There were approximately $560 million of borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2002 under the $600 million Pulte Mortgage arrangements. Mortgage loans originated by Pulte Mortgage are subsequently sold to outside investors. We anticipate that there will be adequate mortgage financing available for purchasers of our homes. In June 2002, we sold $300 million of 7.875% senior notes, due 2032, from our $1 billion shelf registration. Cash provided by operations, combined with the net proceeds from this sale of senior notes, were used to call, redeem and repurchase approximately $103 million of Del Webb senior subordinated notes and to repay short term borrowings under our revolving bank credit arrangements. In October 2002, our operating entity in Argentina entered into a $3 million revolving credit facility in order to provide an additional financial resource to support the operations. Pulte Homes, Inc has guaranteed the credit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2002. In October 2002, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan of up to $100 million. Shares will be purchased from time to time on the open market, depending on market conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we repurchased 100,000 shares for approximately $4.3 million. Our income tax liabilities are affected by a number of factors. In 2002, our effective tax rate was 39.0% compared to 38.5% in 2001 and 2000. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2003 will be approximately 39.0%. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): At December 31, 2002, we had cash and equivalents of $613.2 million, $1.7 billion of unsecured senior notes and $260.7 million of unsecured senior subordinated notes. Other financing includes limited recourse collateralized financing totaling $145.5 million. The following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2002: Payments Due by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After 2007 Contractual obligations: Limited recourse collateralized financing $ 145,526 $ 59,563 $ 72,659 $ 10,478 $ 2,826 Non guarantor short term borrowings 559,621 559,621 Senior notes and subordinated notes 1,907,976 275,000 237,000 1,395,976 Operating leases 117,620 31,481 39,243 22,633 24,263 Total contractual obligations $ 2,730,743 $ 925,665 $ 348,902 $ 33,111 $ 1,423,065 The following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2002: Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After 2007 Other commercial commitments: Guarantor revolving credit facilities $ 570,000 $ $ 570,000 $ $ Non guarantor revolving credit facilities 600,000 275,000 325,000 Standby letters of credit 150,955 138,803 12,152 Total commercial commitments $ 1,320,955 $ 413,803 $ 907,152 $ $ Standby letters of credit and performance bonds are used to guarantee our performance under various contracts, principally in connection with the development of our projects. The expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related project. If the obligations related to the project are ongoing, annual extensions are granted on a year to year basis. Performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These bonds, which approximated $954 million at December 31, 2002, are typically outstanding over a period that approximates 3 5 years. In the normal course of business, we acquire rights under options or option type agreements to purchase land to be used in homebuilding operations at future dates. These rights, which may be cancelled at our discretion, may extend over several years and are typically secured by small deposits. Further, these rights are frequently extended or renegotiated to better match the needs of our homebuilding operations. The total purchase price applicable to approved land under option for use by our homebuilding operations at future dates approximated $1.5 billion at December 31, 2002, which represented approximately 43,800 lots. In addition, there were approximately 48,700 lots valued at $982 million under option at December 31, 2002 pending approval, that are under review and evaluation for future use by our homebuilding operations. Sources of our working capital at December 31, 2002, include cash and equivalents, our $570 million committed unsecured revolving credit facility and Pulte Mortgages $600 million revolving credit. Our debt to total capitalization, excluding our collateralized debt, was approximately 41% as of December 31, 2002, and approximately 32% net of cash and equivalents. We expect to maintain our net debt to total capitalization at or below the 40% level. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): In February 2003, we sold $300 million of 6.25% senior notes, due 2013, from the Companys current shelf registration. Proceeds from the sale will be used to retire certain debt coming due or called in 2003. Subsequent to this issuance, we had $400 million remaining available under the current mixed securities shelf registration. Inflation: We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation also increases our financing, labor and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices. To date, inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates: The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements, giving due regard to materiality. The development and selection of the following critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Revenue recognition: Homebuilding Homebuilding revenues are recorded when the sales of homes are completed and ownership has transferred to the customer. Unfunded settlements are deposits in transit on homes for which the sale was completed. We do not engage in arrangements whereby we have ongoing relationships with our homebuyers that require us to repurchase our homes or provide homebuyers with the right of return. Financial Services Mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors. Servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance and are credited to income when the related mortgage payments are received. Loan origination fees, commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred as an adjustment to the cost of the related mortgage loan until such loan is sold. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold. Inventory valuation: Our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated cost or net realizable value. Included in inventories are all direct development costs. We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories and charge the interest to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. This period increased in 2001 due to the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated cost, unless they are determined to be impaired, in which case these inventories are measured at fair value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory adjustments may be required. Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis. Under the specific identification basis, cost of sales includes the construction cost of the home, an average lot cost by project based on land acquisition and development costs, and closing costs and commissions. Construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home, plus an accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid, based on an analysis of budgeted construction cost. This accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared to the amount accrued, and adjustments are made if needed. Total project land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared to actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete. Adjustments to estimated total project land acquisition and development costs for the project affect the amount of future lots costed. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued): Residential mortgage loans available for sale: Residential mortgage loans available for sale are stated at the lower of aggregate cost or market value. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold. We hedge our residential mortgage loans available for sale. Gains and losses from closed commitments and futures contracts are matched against the related gains and losses on the sale of mortgage loans. Goodwill and intangible assets: We have identified significant intangible assets and generated significant goodwill, most recently as a result of the Del Webb merger in 2001. Intangible assets, primarily trademarks and tradenames, were valued by independent appraisers and advisors using proven valuation procedures and are amortized over their estimated useful life. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing. The carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use. If our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly, intangible assets and goodwill may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material. If we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets, long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment, we measure impairment based on one of two methods. For assets related to ongoing operations we plan to continue, we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists and then measure impairment using discounted cash flows. For assets to be disposed of, we assess the fair value of the asset based on current market conditions for similar assets. For goodwill, we assess fair value by measuring discounted cash flows of our reporting units and measure impairment as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded book value. The estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control. Changes in these estimates could result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and material charges to the results of operations. Investments in unconsolidated entities: We participate in a number of joint ventures with independent third parties in which we have less than a controlling interest. These joint ventures purchase, develop and or sell land and homes in the United States, Mexico and Puerto Rico. We recognize our share of profits from the sale of lots and homes to other buyers. We do not recognize profits from lots we purchase, but instead defer those profits until the related homes are sold. At December 31, 2002, we had approximately $49.0 million invested in these joint ventures. Under certain arrangements, future capital contributions may be necessary to maintain our ownership in the joint venture. We have not guaranteed any of the outstanding debt of the joint ventures at December 31, 2002, which approximated $103.2 million. We also own 22.2% of the capital stock of a mortgage banking company in Mexico. At December 31, 2002, our investment in this entity was approximately $15.8 million. We do not have any purchase or investment commitments to this entity. Furthermore, we have not guaranteed any of the indebtedness of this entity, which approximated $1.2 billion at December 31, 2002. These investments are accounted for on the equity method. Allowance for warranties: Home purchasers are provided with warranties against certain building defects. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary geographically. Most warranties cover different aspects of the homes construction and operating systems for a period of up to ten years. We estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim. We periodically assesses the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. Although we have not made significant adjustments to the accrual in the past, actual warranty cost in the future could differ from our current estimate. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our rate sensitive financing to the extent long term rates decline. The following tables set forth, as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, our rate sensitive financing obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value ($000s omitted).

Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed upon terms (i.e., commit to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2002 and 2001, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float. We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to the Federal Funds rate and (ii) hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments with off balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in long term mortgage rates of plus 50, 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results. Our aggregate net investments exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk include our operations in Mexico which approximated $61.1 million, our mortgage banking joint venture investment in Mexico which approximated $15.8 million and our operations in Argentina which approximated $13.1 million. 26 Table of Contents SPECIAL NOTES CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS As a cautionary note, except for the historical information contained herein, certain matters discussed in Item 7., Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding (continued): Domestic Homebuilding (continued): Unit settlements in 2002 reached a record high, increasing 26% to 28,903 units. A full year of the Del Webb operations combined with strong sales in the Midwest drove the increase. 2001 unit settlements increased 16% to 22,915 units, principally from the addition of the Del Webb operations. The average selling price for our homes increased from $206,000 in 2000 to $225,000 in 2001 and to $242,000 in the current year. Changes in average selling price reflect a number of factors, including price increases, the mix of product closed during a period and the number of options purchased by customers. Both 2002 and 2001 benefited from increased product prices, improved product mix and the inclusion of Del Webb product offerings, which had an average selling price higher than our traditional offerings. Ending backlog, which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed, climbed 22% to 10,605 homes. The dollar value of our ending backlog was up 35% to $2.9 billion at December 31, 2002. Unit and dollar backlog at December 31, 2001, increased 58% and 62%, respectively, to 8,678 homes valued at $2.1 billion. Overall, strong demand supported by a favorable interest rate environment and the addition of Del Webb operations drove increased order activity and record levels of backlog. The following table presents a summary of pre tax income for our Domestic Homebuilding operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Home sale revenue (settlements) $ 6,991,614 $ 5,145,526 $ 4,083,816 Land sale revenue 176,301 129,134 84,700 Home cost of sales (5,589,465 ) (4,127,059 ) (3,320,885 ) Land cost of sales (123,306 ) (97,941 ) (56,250 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (664,469 ) (482,128 ) (365,704 ) Interest (48,697 ) (36,006 ) (28,019 ) Other expense, net (22,968 ) (16,851 ) (14,403 ) Pre tax income $ 719,010 $ 514,675 $ 383,255 Average sales price $ 242 $ 225 $ 206 We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories and charge the interest to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. Gross profit margins from home sales in 2002 increased 30 basis points over 2001 to 20.1%, including the effect of purchase accounting associated with the Del Webb merger. Excluding the effect of purchase accounting adjustments in both years, gross margins would have been 20.1% in 2002 and 20.0% in 2001. Gross profit margins in 2001 increased 110 basis points to 19.8% including purchase accounting adjustments and 130 basis points excluding purchase accounting adjustments over 2000 gross margins. Factors that contributed to this favorable trend include strong customer demand, positive home pricing, the benefits of leverage buy purchasing activities and effective production and inventory management. Land sales increased in each of the prior three years, demonstrating our competency in purchasing, developing and entitling certain land positions for sale primarily to other homebuilders, as well as to retail and commercial establishments. Revenues and their related gains/losses may vary significantly between periods, depending on the timing of such sales. We continue to rationalize certain existing land positions to ensure the most effective use of invested capital. For the year ended December 31, 2002, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of home settlement revenues, increased 13 basis points to 9.50% after increasing 42 basis points to 9.37% in 2001. Higher startup costs for new communities and increased compensation related costs partially offset by a reduction in costs associated with the Del Webb operations contributed to the change in 2002. The increase in 2001 reflects higher startup costs for new communities, increased compensation related costs, local market advertising expenses and the inclusion of Del Webb operations. 17 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding (continued): Domestic Homebuilding (continued): Interest expense increased $12.7 million to $48.7 million in 2002 and $8.0 million to $36.0 million in 2001. The increases are a result of an increase in debt levels necessary to support the growth of the business. Other expense, net increased to $23.0 million in 2002 primarily as a result of income from certain non operating investments recorded in 2001. The increase from 2000 to 2001 represents an increase in land inventory valuation reserves for certain land positions and amortization of tradenames and trademarks acquired in the merger with Del Webb. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, our Domestic Homebuilding operations controlled approximately 176,800 and 141,100 lots, respectively. Approximately 84,300 and 81,200 lots were owned, and approximately 43,800 and 34,800 lots under option agreements approved for purchase at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In addition, there were approximately 48,700 lots under option agreements at December 31, 2002, pending approval, that are under review and evaluation for future use by our Domestic Homebuilding operations. This compared to 25,100 lots at December 31, 2001. Domestic Homebuilding inventory at December 31, 2002, was approximately $4.1 billion, of which $3.2 billion related to land and land development. At December 31, 2001, inventory was approximately $3.8 billion, of which $2.8 billion related to land and land development. Included in other assets is approximately $218.8 million in land held for disposition as of December 31, 2002, as compared to $223.5 million in the prior year. International Homebuilding: Our International Homebuilding operations are primarily conducted through subsidiaries of International in Mexico, Puerto Rico and Argentina. Mexico Effective January 1, 2002, International reorganized its structure within Mexico to create a single company, Pulte Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V. (Pulte Mexico), which ranks as one of the largest builders in the country. Prior to the reorganization, these operations were conducted primarily through five joint ventures throughout Mexico. Under the new ownership structure, which combines the largest of these entities, we own 63.8% of Pulte Mexico and have consolidated Pulte Mexico into our financial statements. The new operating structure facilitates growth, enables operating leverage and improves efficiencies through standardized systems and procedures. Puerto Rico Operations in Puerto Rico are conducted through Internationals 100% owned subsidiary, Pulte International Caribbean Corporation and three joint ventures. Argentina Operations in Argentina, which are based in the greater Buenos Aires area, are conducted through Pulte SRL, Internationals 100% owned Argentine subsidiary. 18 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding (continued): International Homebuilding (continued): The following table presents selected financial data for our International Homebuilding operations for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Revenues $ 196,074 $ 35,169 $ 27,159 Cost of sales (157,056 ) (30,937 ) (24,611 ) Selling, general and administrative expense (35,029 ) (11,820 ) (5,621 ) Other income (expense), net (1,610 ) 66 967 Minority interest (1,801 ) Equity in income of joint ventures 4,479 5,138 5,455 Pre tax income (loss) $ 5,057 $ (2,384 ) $ 3,349 Unit settlements: Pulte 6,525 221 264 Pulte affiliated entities 1,022 7,258 7,718 7,547 7,479 7,982 Unit settlements for Pulte and Pulte affiliated entities in 2002 were relatively flat as compared to 2001 and down in 2001 when compared to 2000, as declines in Puerto Rico and Mexico were only partially offset by settlements in Argentina, which approached 200 in 2002. Settlements in Mexico were 7,166 in 2002 compared to 7,158 in 2001 and 7,718 in 2000. Activity in Mexico continues to be slowed by the impact of changes made in 2001 and 2002 to local lending practices and the lack of alternative funding sources. Increased revenues in 2002 are due to consolidation of the operations in Mexico for eleven months of 2002, a full year of operations in Argentina, which had only begun recognizing its first closings in June of 2001, partially offset by a decline in Puerto Rico. Revenues from our operations in Mexico were $158.1 million in 2002. Our operations in Argentina contributed $25.9 million compared to $9.5 million in the prior year. Revenues in Puerto Rico were down to $12.1 million from $25.5 million. The consolidation of Mexico also had a positive effect on gross margins, which rose to 19.9% in 2002 from 12.0% in 2001 and 9.4% in 2000. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues declined as a result of a reduction in start up costs associated with our operations in Argentina. Equity in income of joint ventures in 2002 represents one month of the joint venture operations in Mexico and our joint venture located in Canovanas, Puerto Rico, which had its first closings during the third quarter of 2001. Our operations in Argentina recorded transaction losses of $208,000 and $463,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, as the value of the Argentine peso continued to fluctuate following the Argentine governments decision to de link its valuation from the U.S. Dollar. We also recorded a foreign currency translation loss of $12.8 million, as a component of cumulative other comprehensive income during 2002. It remains unclear at this time how the financial and currency markets in Argentina will be impacted in 2003 or how the current economic situation may affect customer home buying attitudes and the homebuilding business in general. At December 31, 2002, our investment, net of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments, in Argentina approximated $13.1 million. Our operations in Mexico have also been affected by a strengthening dollar to the Mexican peso where transaction losses of $483,000, $378,000 and $78,000 were recorded in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. At December 31, 2002, our investment, net of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments, in Mexico approximated $61.1 million. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Financial Services: We conduct our financial services business, which includes mortgage and title operations, through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries. We sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts. Due to the short period of time the servicing rights are held, usually three to four months, we do not amortize the servicing asset. Since the servicing rights are recorded at the value in the servicing sales contracts, there are no impairment issues related to these assets. We also originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various credit arrangements, and then sell such mortgage loans to outside investors. The following table presents mortgage origination data for our Financial Services operations: Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Total originations: Loans 23,074 19,018 13,415 Principal ($000s omitted) $ 3,771,000 $ 2,937,100 $ 1,957,300 Originations for Pulte customers: Loans 19,537 15,402 11,109 Principal ($000s omitted) $ 3,176,500 $ 2,385,500 $ 1,697,600 Mortgage origination unit and principal volume for the year ended December 31, 2002, increased 21% and 28%, respectively, over 2001. This growth can be attributed to an increase in the capture rate of 390 basis points to 77.6% and the inclusion of Del Webb mortgage operations for a full year. Our capture rate represents loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percent of total loan opportunities, excluding cash settlements, from our homebuilding business. Mortgage origination principal volume in 2001 increased 50% over 2000, due to an increase in the capture rate of 950 basis points to 73.7%, an increased average loan size and the inclusion of Del Webb mortgage operations, which accounted for approximately 13% of the increase. Origination unit volume increased 42% due to the same factors. Our home buying customers continue to account for the majority of total loan production, representing 85% of total Pulte Mortgage unit production for 2002, compared with 81% in 2001 and 83% in 2000. Refinancings represented 8% of total loan production in 2002, compared with 10% in 2001 and 2% during 2000. At December 31, 2002, loan application backlog increased 66% to $1.4 billion as compared to $827 million and $536 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2002, increased 81% to $66.7 million, as a result of increased volume, a favorable interest rate environment, effective leverage of overhead costs and the inclusion of Del Webb mortgage operations for a full year. Gains from the sale of mortgages increased $20.4 million, or 49%, from the same period in 2001. As compared with 2001, net interest income increased $6.3 million to $11.3 million during 2002 due to increased production and a steeper yield curve as a result of the drop in interest rates during 2002. Title income grew 42% contributing $12.2 million to pre tax income for the year. Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2001, increased 49% to $36.9 million, due to increases in volume, capture rate and secondary marketing gains. The addition of Del Webb mortgage operations for the last five months of 2001 contributed approximately 8% of this increase. Pricing and marketing gains increased $17.4 million, or 71%, from the same period in 2000, primarily due to a consistent drop in interest rates throughout 2001. As compared with 2000, net interest income increased $3.1 million to $5.0 million during 2001 due to increased production and a steeper yield curve as a result of the drop in interest rates during 2001. Offsetting these gains was an increase in SGA expenses of $10 million as a result of increased headcount and other related costs due to the increase in volume during 2001. Income from our title operations increased 48% to $8.6 million in 2001, further fueling the growth in our financial services business. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Financial Services (continued): We hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed mortgage loans with derivative financial instruments. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we did not recognize any net gains or losses related to the ineffective portion of the hedging instrument excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We also did not recognize any gains or losses during 2002, for cash flow hedges that were discontinued because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur. At December 31, 2002, we expect to reclassify $1.3 million, net of taxes, of net losses on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next twelve months from sales of closed mortgage loans. Corporate: Corporate is a non operating business segment whose primary purpose is to support the operations of our subsidiaries as the internal source of financing, to develop and implement strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies, and to provide the administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity. As a result, the corporate segments operating results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve. The following table presents this segments results of operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Net interest expense $ 38,214 $ 34,261 $ 28,987 Other corporate expenses, net 23,754 23,191 27,309 Loss before income taxes $ 61,968 $ 57,452 $ 56,296 Interest expense, net of interest capitalized into inventory, increased 12% to $38.2 million in 2002 and 18% to $34.3 million in 2001. This trend is a result of an increase in debt levels necessary to support our growth. Interest incurred for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, excluding interest incurred by our financial services operations, was approximately $162.5, $116.9 and $62.8 million, respectively. Other corporate expense, net over the two year period ended December 31, 2002, was relatively flat, as higher compensation related costs were offset by income from the sale and adjustment to fair value of various non operating parcels of commercial land held for sale. The decrease in other corporate expenses, net in 2001 when compared to 2000 is primarily due to the write down of commercial land held for sale in 2000. Interest capitalized into inventory is charged to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. Interest in inventory at December 31, 2002, increased primarily as a result of higher levels of indebtedness and the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Information related to Corporate interest capitalized into inventory is as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Interest in inventory at beginning of year $ 68,595 $ 24,202 $ 19,092 Interest capitalized 123,086 80,399 33,129 Interest expensed (48,697 ) (36,006 ) (28,019 ) Interest in inventory at end of year $ 142,984 $ 68,595 $ 24,202 21 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources: Our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2002, amounted to $162.2 million. The increase in net income was aided by the realization of certain tax benefits and an increase in accrued liabilities, while inventories continued to build to support the growth of the business. Net cash provided by investing activities was $4.6 million for 2002. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002, was $374.2 million, reflecting proceeds from the $300 million senior notes issued in June 2002, proceeds from borrowings under our various credit facilities and proceeds from employee stock option exercises, offset by the repayment of debt, dividends paid and stock repurchases. Our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2001, was $418.8 million as higher net income was offset by increases in inventory and residential mortgage loans available for sale over 2000 and the resolution of the First Heights litigation. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2001 increased primarily due to the net cash acquired from Del Webb. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $297.1 million as proceeds from the issuance of senior notes of $200 million and $500 million, and increased borrowings under the revolving credit arrangements were offset by the repayment of higher rate debt acquired from Del Webb. We finance our homebuilding land acquisitions, development and construction activities from internally generated funds and existing credit agreements. We had no borrowings under our $570 million unsecured revolving credit facility at December 31, 2002. Pulte Mortgage provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available pursuant to various committed and uncommitted credit arrangements totaling $600 million, an amount deemed adequate to cover foreseeable needs. There were approximately $560 million of borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2002 under the $600 million Pulte Mortgage arrangements. Mortgage loans originated by Pulte Mortgage are subsequently sold to outside investors. We anticipate that there will be adequate mortgage financing available for purchasers of our homes. In June 2002, we sold $300 million of 7.875% senior notes, due 2032, from our $1 billion shelf registration. Cash provided by operations, combined with the net proceeds from this sale of senior notes, were used to call, redeem and repurchase approximately $103 million of Del Webb senior subordinated notes and to repay short term borrowings under our revolving bank credit arrangements. In October 2002, our operating entity in Argentina entered into a $3 million revolving credit facility in order to provide an additional financial resource to support the operations. Pulte Homes, Inc has guaranteed the credit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2002. In October 2002, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan of up to $100 million. Shares will be purchased from time to time on the open market, depending on market conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we repurchased 100,000 shares for approximately $4.3 million. Our income tax liabilities are affected by a number of factors. In 2002, our effective tax rate was 39.0% compared to 38.5% in 2001 and 2000. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2003 will be approximately 39.0%. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): At December 31, 2002, we had cash and equivalents of $613.2 million, $1.7 billion of unsecured senior notes and $260.7 million of unsecured senior subordinated notes. Other financing includes limited recourse collateralized financing totaling $145.5 million. The following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2002: Payments Due by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After 2007 Contractual obligations: Limited recourse collateralized financing $ 145,526 $ 59,563 $ 72,659 $ 10,478 $ 2,826 Non guarantor short term borrowings 559,621 559,621 Senior notes and subordinated notes 1,907,976 275,000 237,000 1,395,976 Operating leases 117,620 31,481 39,243 22,633 24,263 Total contractual obligations $ 2,730,743 $ 925,665 $ 348,902 $ 33,111 $ 1,423,065 The following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2002: Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After 2007 Other commercial commitments: Guarantor revolving credit facilities $ 570,000 $ $ 570,000 $ $ Non guarantor revolving credit facilities 600,000 275,000 325,000 Standby letters of credit 150,955 138,803 12,152 Total commercial commitments $ 1,320,955 $ 413,803 $ 907,152 $ $ Standby letters of credit and performance bonds are used to guarantee our performance under various contracts, principally in connection with the development of our projects. The expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related project. If the obligations related to the project are ongoing, annual extensions are granted on a year to year basis. Performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These bonds, which approximated $954 million at December 31, 2002, are typically outstanding over a period that approximates 3 5 years. In the normal course of business, we acquire rights under options or option type agreements to purchase land to be used in homebuilding operations at future dates. These rights, which may be cancelled at our discretion, may extend over several years and are typically secured by small deposits. Further, these rights are frequently extended or renegotiated to better match the needs of our homebuilding operations. The total purchase price applicable to approved land under option for use by our homebuilding operations at future dates approximated $1.5 billion at December 31, 2002, which represented approximately 43,800 lots. In addition, there were approximately 48,700 lots valued at $982 million under option at December 31, 2002 pending approval, that are under review and evaluation for future use by our homebuilding operations. Sources of our working capital at December 31, 2002, include cash and equivalents, our $570 million committed unsecured revolving credit facility and Pulte Mortgages $600 million revolving credit. Our debt to total capitalization, excluding our collateralized debt, was approximately 41% as of December 31, 2002, and approximately 32% net of cash and equivalents. We expect to maintain our net debt to total capitalization at or below the 40% level. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): In February 2003, we sold $300 million of 6.25% senior notes, due 2013, from the Companys current shelf registration. Proceeds from the sale will be used to retire certain debt coming due or called in 2003. Subsequent to this issuance, we had $400 million remaining available under the current mixed securities shelf registration. Inflation: We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation also increases our financing, labor and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices. To date, inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates: The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements, giving due regard to materiality. The development and selection of the following critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Revenue recognition: Homebuilding Homebuilding revenues are recorded when the sales of homes are completed and ownership has transferred to the customer. Unfunded settlements are deposits in transit on homes for which the sale was completed. We do not engage in arrangements whereby we have ongoing relationships with our homebuyers that require us to repurchase our homes or provide homebuyers with the right of return. Financial Services Mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors. Servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance and are credited to income when the related mortgage payments are received. Loan origination fees, commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred as an adjustment to the cost of the related mortgage loan until such loan is sold. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold. Inventory valuation: Our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated cost or net realizable value. Included in inventories are all direct development costs. We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories and charge the interest to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. This period increased in 2001 due to the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated cost, unless they are determined to be impaired, in which case these inventories are measured at fair value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory adjustments may be required. Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis. Under the specific identification basis, cost of sales includes the construction cost of the home, an average lot cost by project based on land acquisition and development costs, and closing costs and commissions. Construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home, plus an accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid, based on an analysis of budgeted construction cost. This accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared to the amount accrued, and adjustments are made if needed. Total project land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared to actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete. Adjustments to estimated total project land acquisition and development costs for the project affect the amount of future lots costed. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued): Residential mortgage loans available for sale: Residential mortgage loans available for sale are stated at the lower of aggregate cost or market value. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold. We hedge our residential mortgage loans available for sale. Gains and losses from closed commitments and futures contracts are matched against the related gains and losses on the sale of mortgage loans. Goodwill and intangible assets: We have identified significant intangible assets and generated significant goodwill, most recently as a result of the Del Webb merger in 2001. Intangible assets, primarily trademarks and tradenames, were valued by independent appraisers and advisors using proven valuation procedures and are amortized over their estimated useful life. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing. The carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use. If our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly, intangible assets and goodwill may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material. If we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets, long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment, we measure impairment based on one of two methods. For assets related to ongoing operations we plan to continue, we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists and then measure impairment using discounted cash flows. For assets to be disposed of, we assess the fair value of the asset based on current market conditions for similar assets. For goodwill, we assess fair value by measuring discounted cash flows of our reporting units and measure impairment as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded book value. The estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control. Changes in these estimates could result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and material charges to the results of operations. Investments in unconsolidated entities: We participate in a number of joint ventures with independent third parties in which we have less than a controlling interest. These joint ventures purchase, develop and or sell land and homes in the United States, Mexico and Puerto Rico. We recognize our share of profits from the sale of lots and homes to other buyers. We do not recognize profits from lots we purchase, but instead defer those profits until the related homes are sold. At December 31, 2002, we had approximately $49.0 million invested in these joint ventures. Under certain arrangements, future capital contributions may be necessary to maintain our ownership in the joint venture. We have not guaranteed any of the outstanding debt of the joint ventures at December 31, 2002, which approximated $103.2 million. We also own 22.2% of the capital stock of a mortgage banking company in Mexico. At December 31, 2002, our investment in this entity was approximately $15.8 million. We do not have any purchase or investment commitments to this entity. Furthermore, we have not guaranteed any of the indebtedness of this entity, which approximated $1.2 billion at December 31, 2002. These investments are accounted for on the equity method. Allowance for warranties: Home purchasers are provided with warranties against certain building defects. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary geographically. Most warranties cover different aspects of the homes construction and operating systems for a period of up to ten years. We estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim. We periodically assesses the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. Although we have not made significant adjustments to the accrual in the past, actual warranty cost in the future could differ from our current estimate. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our rate sensitive financing to the extent long term rates decline. The following tables set forth, as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, our rate sensitive financing obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value ($000s omitted). As of December 31, 2002 for the Years ended December 31, There Fair 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 after Total Value Rate sensitive liabilities: Fixed interest rate debt: Senior notes and subordinated notes $ 275,000 $ 112,000 $ 125,000 $ $ $ 1,395,976 $ 1,907,976 $ 2,006,173 Average interest rate 8.59 % 8.38 % 7.30 % 8.46 % 8.23 % Limited recourse collateralized financing $ 59,563 $ 41,528 $ 31,131 $ 9,128 $ 1,350 $ 2,826 $ 145,526 $ 145,526 Average interest rate 5.27 % 5.53 % 6.12 % 2.16 % 4.00 % 4.00 % 5.30 % As of December 31, 2001 for the Years ended December 31, There Fair 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 after Total Value Rate sensitive liabilities: Fixed interest rate debt: Senior notes and subordinated notes $ $ 275,000 $ 112,000 $ 125,000 $ 69,810 $ 1,130,887 $ 1,712,697 $ 1,744,726 Average interest rate 8.59 % 8.38 % 7.30 % 9.00 % 8.37 % 8.36 % Limited recourse collateralized financing $ 17,556 $ 7,531 $ 4,446 $ 5,894 $ 1,350 $ 2,826 $ 39,603 $ 39,603 Average interest rate 6.42 % 6.96 % 7.20 % 5.06 % 4.00 % 4.00 % 6.15 % Pulte Mortgage, operating as a mortgage banker, is also subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed upon terms (i.e., commit to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2002 and 2001, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float. We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to the Federal Funds rate and (ii) hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments with off balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in long term mortgage rates of plus 50, 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results. Our aggregate net investments exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk include our operations in Mexico which approximated $61.1 million, our mortgage banking joint venture investment in Mexico which approximated $15.8 million and our operations in Argentina which approximated $13.1 million. 26 Table of Contents SPECIAL NOTES CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS As a cautionary note, except for the historical information contained herein, certain matters discussed in Item 7., Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding (continued): Domestic Homebuilding (continued): Interest expense increased $12.7 million to $48.7 million in 2002 and $8.0 million to $36.0 million in 2001. The increases are a result of an increase in debt levels necessary to support the growth of the business. Other expense, net increased to $23.0 million in 2002 primarily as a result of income from certain non operating investments recorded in 2001. The increase from 2000 to 2001 represents an increase in land inventory valuation reserves for certain land positions and amortization of tradenames and trademarks acquired in the merger with Del Webb. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, our Domestic Homebuilding operations controlled approximately 176,800 and 141,100 lots, respectively. Approximately 84,300 and 81,200 lots were owned, and approximately 43,800 and 34,800 lots under option agreements approved for purchase at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In addition, there were approximately 48,700 lots under option agreements at December 31, 2002, pending approval, that are under review and evaluation for future use by our Domestic Homebuilding operations. This compared to 25,100 lots at December 31, 2001. Domestic Homebuilding inventory at December 31, 2002, was approximately $4.1 billion, of which $3.2 billion related to land and land development. At December 31, 2001, inventory was approximately $3.8 billion, of which $2.8 billion related to land and land development. Included in other assets is approximately $218.8 million in land held for disposition as of December 31, 2002, as compared to $223.5 million in the prior year. International Homebuilding: Our International Homebuilding operations are primarily conducted through subsidiaries of International in Mexico, Puerto Rico and Argentina. Mexico Effective January 1, 2002, International reorganized its structure within Mexico to create a single company, Pulte Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V. (Pulte Mexico), which ranks as one of the largest builders in the country. Prior to the reorganization, these operations were conducted primarily through five joint ventures throughout Mexico. Under the new ownership structure, which combines the largest of these entities, we own 63.8% of Pulte Mexico and have consolidated Pulte Mexico into our financial statements. The new operating structure facilitates growth, enables operating leverage and improves efficiencies through standardized systems and procedures. Puerto Rico Operations in Puerto Rico are conducted through Internationals 100% owned subsidiary, Pulte International Caribbean Corporation and three joint ventures. Argentina Operations in Argentina, which are based in the greater Buenos Aires area, are conducted through Pulte SRL, Internationals 100% owned Argentine subsidiary. 18 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding (continued): International Homebuilding (continued): The following table presents selected financial data for our International Homebuilding operations for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Revenues $ 196,074 $ 35,169 $ 27,159 Cost of sales (157,056 ) (30,937 ) (24,611 ) Selling, general and administrative expense (35,029 ) (11,820 ) (5,621 ) Other income (expense), net (1,610 ) 66 967 Minority interest (1,801 ) Equity in income of joint ventures 4,479 5,138 5,455 Pre tax income (loss) $ 5,057 $ (2,384 ) $ 3,349 Unit settlements: Pulte 6,525 221 264 Pulte affiliated entities 1,022 7,258 7,718 7,547 7,479 7,982 Unit settlements for Pulte and Pulte affiliated entities in 2002 were relatively flat as compared to 2001 and down in 2001 when compared to 2000, as declines in Puerto Rico and Mexico were only partially offset by settlements in Argentina, which approached 200 in 2002. Settlements in Mexico were 7,166 in 2002 compared to 7,158 in 2001 and 7,718 in 2000. Activity in Mexico continues to be slowed by the impact of changes made in 2001 and 2002 to local lending practices and the lack of alternative funding sources. Increased revenues in 2002 are due to consolidation of the operations in Mexico for eleven months of 2002, a full year of operations in Argentina, which had only begun recognizing its first closings in June of 2001, partially offset by a decline in Puerto Rico. Revenues from our operations in Mexico were $158.1 million in 2002. Our operations in Argentina contributed $25.9 million compared to $9.5 million in the prior year. Revenues in Puerto Rico were down to $12.1 million from $25.5 million. The consolidation of Mexico also had a positive effect on gross margins, which rose to 19.9% in 2002 from 12.0% in 2001 and 9.4% in 2000. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues declined as a result of a reduction in start up costs associated with our operations in Argentina. Equity in income of joint ventures in 2002 represents one month of the joint venture operations in Mexico and our joint venture located in Canovanas, Puerto Rico, which had its first closings during the third quarter of 2001. Our operations in Argentina recorded transaction losses of $208,000 and $463,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, as the value of the Argentine peso continued to fluctuate following the Argentine governments decision to de link its valuation from the U.S. Dollar. We also recorded a foreign currency translation loss of $12.8 million, as a component of cumulative other comprehensive income during 2002. It remains unclear at this time how the financial and currency markets in Argentina will be impacted in 2003 or how the current economic situation may affect customer home buying attitudes and the homebuilding business in general. At December 31, 2002, our investment, net of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments, in Argentina approximated $13.1 million. Our operations in Mexico have also been affected by a strengthening dollar to the Mexican peso where transaction losses of $483,000, $378,000 and $78,000 were recorded in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. At December 31, 2002, our investment, net of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments, in Mexico approximated $61.1 million. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Financial Services: We conduct our financial services business, which includes mortgage and title operations, through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries. We sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts. Due to the short period of time the servicing rights are held, usually three to four months, we do not amortize the servicing asset. Since the servicing rights are recorded at the value in the servicing sales contracts, there are no impairment issues related to these assets. We also originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various credit arrangements, and then sell such mortgage loans to outside investors. The following table presents mortgage origination data for our Financial Services operations: Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Total originations: Loans 23,074 19,018 13,415 Principal ($000s omitted) $ 3,771,000 $ 2,937,100 $ 1,957,300 Originations for Pulte customers: Loans 19,537 15,402 11,109 Principal ($000s omitted) $ 3,176,500 $ 2,385,500 $ 1,697,600 Mortgage origination unit and principal volume for the year ended December 31, 2002, increased 21% and 28%, respectively, over 2001. This growth can be attributed to an increase in the capture rate of 390 basis points to 77.6% and the inclusion of Del Webb mortgage operations for a full year. Our capture rate represents loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percent of total loan opportunities, excluding cash settlements, from our homebuilding business. Mortgage origination principal volume in 2001 increased 50% over 2000, due to an increase in the capture rate of 950 basis points to 73.7%, an increased average loan size and the inclusion of Del Webb mortgage operations, which accounted for approximately 13% of the increase. Origination unit volume increased 42% due to the same factors. Our home buying customers continue to account for the majority of total loan production, representing 85% of total Pulte Mortgage unit production for 2002, compared with 81% in 2001 and 83% in 2000. Refinancings represented 8% of total loan production in 2002, compared with 10% in 2001 and 2% during 2000. At December 31, 2002, loan application backlog increased 66% to $1.4 billion as compared to $827 million and $536 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2002, increased 81% to $66.7 million, as a result of increased volume, a favorable interest rate environment, effective leverage of overhead costs and the inclusion of Del Webb mortgage operations for a full year. Gains from the sale of mortgages increased $20.4 million, or 49%, from the same period in 2001. As compared with 2001, net interest income increased $6.3 million to $11.3 million during 2002 due to increased production and a steeper yield curve as a result of the drop in interest rates during 2002. Title income grew 42% contributing $12.2 million to pre tax income for the year. Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2001, increased 49% to $36.9 million, due to increases in volume, capture rate and secondary marketing gains. The addition of Del Webb mortgage operations for the last five months of 2001 contributed approximately 8% of this increase. Pricing and marketing gains increased $17.4 million, or 71%, from the same period in 2000, primarily due to a consistent drop in interest rates throughout 2001. As compared with 2000, net interest income increased $3.1 million to $5.0 million during 2001 due to increased production and a steeper yield curve as a result of the drop in interest rates during 2001. Offsetting these gains was an increase in SGA expenses of $10 million as a result of increased headcount and other related costs due to the increase in volume during 2001. Income from our title operations increased 48% to $8.6 million in 2001, further fueling the growth in our financial services business. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Financial Services (continued): We hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed mortgage loans with derivative financial instruments. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we did not recognize any net gains or losses related to the ineffective portion of the hedging instrument excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We also did not recognize any gains or losses during 2002, for cash flow hedges that were discontinued because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur. At December 31, 2002, we expect to reclassify $1.3 million, net of taxes, of net losses on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next twelve months from sales of closed mortgage loans. Corporate: Corporate is a non operating business segment whose primary purpose is to support the operations of our subsidiaries as the internal source of financing, to develop and implement strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies, and to provide the administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity. As a result, the corporate segments operating results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve. The following table presents this segments results of operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Net interest expense $ 38,214 $ 34,261 $ 28,987 Other corporate expenses, net 23,754 23,191 27,309 Loss before income taxes $ 61,968 $ 57,452 $ 56,296 Interest expense, net of interest capitalized into inventory, increased 12% to $38.2 million in 2002 and 18% to $34.3 million in 2001. This trend is a result of an increase in debt levels necessary to support our growth. Interest incurred for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, excluding interest incurred by our financial services operations, was approximately $162.5, $116.9 and $62.8 million, respectively. Other corporate expense, net over the two year period ended December 31, 2002, was relatively flat, as higher compensation related costs were offset by income from the sale and adjustment to fair value of various non operating parcels of commercial land held for sale. The decrease in other corporate expenses, net in 2001 when compared to 2000 is primarily due to the write down of commercial land held for sale in 2000. Interest capitalized into inventory is charged to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. Interest in inventory at December 31, 2002, increased primarily as a result of higher levels of indebtedness and the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Information related to Corporate interest capitalized into inventory is as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Interest in inventory at beginning of year $ 68,595 $ 24,202 $ 19,092 Interest capitalized 123,086 80,399 33,129 Interest expensed (48,697 ) (36,006 ) (28,019 ) Interest in inventory at end of year $ 142,984 $ 68,595 $ 24,202 21 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources: Our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2002, amounted to $162.2 million. The increase in net income was aided by the realization of certain tax benefits and an increase in accrued liabilities, while inventories continued to build to support the growth of the business. Net cash provided by investing activities was $4.6 million for 2002. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002, was $374.2 million, reflecting proceeds from the $300 million senior notes issued in June 2002, proceeds from borrowings under our various credit facilities and proceeds from employee stock option exercises, offset by the repayment of debt, dividends paid and stock repurchases. Our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2001, was $418.8 million as higher net income was offset by increases in inventory and residential mortgage loans available for sale over 2000 and the resolution of the First Heights litigation. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2001 increased primarily due to the net cash acquired from Del Webb. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $297.1 million as proceeds from the issuance of senior notes of $200 million and $500 million, and increased borrowings under the revolving credit arrangements were offset by the repayment of higher rate debt acquired from Del Webb. We finance our homebuilding land acquisitions, development and construction activities from internally generated funds and existing credit agreements. We had no borrowings under our $570 million unsecured revolving credit facility at December 31, 2002. Pulte Mortgage provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available pursuant to various committed and uncommitted credit arrangements totaling $600 million, an amount deemed adequate to cover foreseeable needs. There were approximately $560 million of borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2002 under the $600 million Pulte Mortgage arrangements. Mortgage loans originated by Pulte Mortgage are subsequently sold to outside investors. We anticipate that there will be adequate mortgage financing available for purchasers of our homes. In June 2002, we sold $300 million of 7.875% senior notes, due 2032, from our $1 billion shelf registration. Cash provided by operations, combined with the net proceeds from this sale of senior notes, were used to call, redeem and repurchase approximately $103 million of Del Webb senior subordinated notes and to repay short term borrowings under our revolving bank credit arrangements. In October 2002, our operating entity in Argentina entered into a $3 million revolving credit facility in order to provide an additional financial resource to support the operations. Pulte Homes, Inc has guaranteed the credit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2002. In October 2002, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan of up to $100 million. Shares will be purchased from time to time on the open market, depending on market conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we repurchased 100,000 shares for approximately $4.3 million. Our income tax liabilities are affected by a number of factors. In 2002, our effective tax rate was 39.0% compared to 38.5% in 2001 and 2000. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2003 will be approximately 39.0%. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): At December 31, 2002, we had cash and equivalents of $613.2 million, $1.7 billion of unsecured senior notes and $260.7 million of unsecured senior subordinated notes. Other financing includes limited recourse collateralized financing totaling $145.5 million. The following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2002: Payments Due by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After 2007 Contractual obligations: Limited recourse collateralized financing $ 145,526 $ 59,563 $ 72,659 $ 10,478 $ 2,826 Non guarantor short term borrowings 559,621 559,621 Senior notes and subordinated notes 1,907,976 275,000 237,000 1,395,976 Operating leases 117,620 31,481 39,243 22,633 24,263 Total contractual obligations $ 2,730,743 $ 925,665 $ 348,902 $ 33,111 $ 1,423,065 The following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2002: Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After 2007 Other commercial commitments: Guarantor revolving credit facilities $ 570,000 $ $ 570,000 $ $ Non guarantor revolving credit facilities 600,000 275,000 325,000 Standby letters of credit 150,955 138,803 12,152 Total commercial commitments $ 1,320,955 $ 413,803 $ 907,152 $ $ Standby letters of credit and performance bonds are used to guarantee our performance under various contracts, principally in connection with the development of our projects. The expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related project. If the obligations related to the project are ongoing, annual extensions are granted on a year to year basis. Performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These bonds, which approximated $954 million at December 31, 2002, are typically outstanding over a period that approximates 3 5 years. In the normal course of business, we acquire rights under options or option type agreements to purchase land to be used in homebuilding operations at future dates. These rights, which may be cancelled at our discretion, may extend over several years and are typically secured by small deposits. Further, these rights are frequently extended or renegotiated to better match the needs of our homebuilding operations. The total purchase price applicable to approved land under option for use by our homebuilding operations at future dates approximated $1.5 billion at December 31, 2002, which represented approximately 43,800 lots. In addition, there were approximately 48,700 lots valued at $982 million under option at December 31, 2002 pending approval, that are under review and evaluation for future use by our homebuilding operations. Sources of our working capital at December 31, 2002, include cash and equivalents, our $570 million committed unsecured revolving credit facility and Pulte Mortgages $600 million revolving credit. Our debt to total capitalization, excluding our collateralized debt, was approximately 41% as of December 31, 2002, and approximately 32% net of cash and equivalents. We expect to maintain our net debt to total capitalization at or below the 40% level. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): In February 2003, we sold $300 million of 6.25% senior notes, due 2013, from the Companys current shelf registration. Proceeds from the sale will be used to retire certain debt coming due or called in 2003. Subsequent to this issuance, we had $400 million remaining available under the current mixed securities shelf registration. Inflation: We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation also increases our financing, labor and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices. To date, inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates: The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements, giving due regard to materiality. The development and selection of the following critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Revenue recognition: Homebuilding Homebuilding revenues are recorded when the sales of homes are completed and ownership has transferred to the customer. Unfunded settlements are deposits in transit on homes for which the sale was completed. We do not engage in arrangements whereby we have ongoing relationships with our homebuyers that require us to repurchase our homes or provide homebuyers with the right of return. Financial Services Mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors. Servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance and are credited to income when the related mortgage payments are received. Loan origination fees, commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred as an adjustment to the cost of the related mortgage loan until such loan is sold. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold. Inventory valuation: Our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated cost or net realizable value. Included in inventories are all direct development costs. We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories and charge the interest to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. This period increased in 2001 due to the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated cost, unless they are determined to be impaired, in which case these inventories are measured at fair value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory adjustments may be required. Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis. Under the specific identification basis, cost of sales includes the construction cost of the home, an average lot cost by project based on land acquisition and development costs, and closing costs and commissions. Construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home, plus an accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid, based on an analysis of budgeted construction cost. This accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared to the amount accrued, and adjustments are made if needed. Total project land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared to actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete. Adjustments to estimated total project land acquisition and development costs for the project affect the amount of future lots costed. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued): Residential mortgage loans available for sale: Residential mortgage loans available for sale are stated at the lower of aggregate cost or market value. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold. We hedge our residential mortgage loans available for sale. Gains and losses from closed commitments and futures contracts are matched against the related gains and losses on the sale of mortgage loans. Goodwill and intangible assets: We have identified significant intangible assets and generated significant goodwill, most recently as a result of the Del Webb merger in 2001. Intangible assets, primarily trademarks and tradenames, were valued by independent appraisers and advisors using proven valuation procedures and are amortized over their estimated useful life. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing. The carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use. If our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly, intangible assets and goodwill may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material. If we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets, long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment, we measure impairment based on one of two methods. For assets related to ongoing operations we plan to continue, we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists and then measure impairment using discounted cash flows. For assets to be disposed of, we assess the fair value of the asset based on current market conditions for similar assets. For goodwill, we assess fair value by measuring discounted cash flows of our reporting units and measure impairment as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded book value. The estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control. Changes in these estimates could result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and material charges to the results of operations. Investments in unconsolidated entities: We participate in a number of joint ventures with independent third parties in which we have less than a controlling interest. These joint ventures purchase, develop and or sell land and homes in the United States, Mexico and Puerto Rico. We recognize our share of profits from the sale of lots and homes to other buyers. We do not recognize profits from lots we purchase, but instead defer those profits until the related homes are sold. At December 31, 2002, we had approximately $49.0 million invested in these joint ventures. Under certain arrangements, future capital contributions may be necessary to maintain our ownership in the joint venture. We have not guaranteed any of the outstanding debt of the joint ventures at December 31, 2002, which approximated $103.2 million. We also own 22.2% of the capital stock of a mortgage banking company in Mexico. At December 31, 2002, our investment in this entity was approximately $15.8 million. We do not have any purchase or investment commitments to this entity. Furthermore, we have not guaranteed any of the indebtedness of this entity, which approximated $1.2 billion at December 31, 2002. These investments are accounted for on the equity method. Allowance for warranties: Home purchasers are provided with warranties against certain building defects. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary geographically. Most warranties cover different aspects of the homes construction and operating systems for a period of up to ten years. We estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim. We periodically assesses the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. Although we have not made significant adjustments to the accrual in the past, actual warranty cost in the future could differ from our current estimate. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our rate sensitive financing to the extent long term rates decline. The following tables set forth, as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, our rate sensitive financing obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value ($000s omitted). As of December 31, 2002 for the Years ended December 31, There Fair 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 after Total Value Rate sensitive liabilities: Fixed interest rate debt: Senior notes and subordinated notes $ 275,000 $ 112,000 $ 125,000 $ $ $ 1,395,976 $ 1,907,976 $ 2,006,173 Average interest rate 8.59 % 8.38 % 7.30 % 8.46 % 8.23 % Limited recourse collateralized financing $ 59,563 $ 41,528 $ 31,131 $ 9,128 $ 1,350 $ 2,826 $ 145,526 $ 145,526 Average interest rate 5.27 % 5.53 % 6.12 % 2.16 % 4.00 % 4.00 % 5.30 % As of December 31, 2001 for the Years ended December 31, There Fair 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 after Total Value Rate sensitive liabilities: Fixed interest rate debt: Senior notes and subordinated notes $ $ 275,000 $ 112,000 $ 125,000 $ 69,810 $ 1,130,887 $ 1,712,697 $ 1,744,726 Average interest rate 8.59 % 8.38 % 7.30 % 9.00 % 8.37 % 8.36 % Limited recourse collateralized financing $ 17,556 $ 7,531 $ 4,446 $ 5,894 $ 1,350 $ 2,826 $ 39,603 $ 39,603 Average interest rate 6.42 % 6.96 % 7.20 % 5.06 % 4.00 % 4.00 % 6.15 % Pulte Mortgage, operating as a mortgage banker, is also subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed upon terms (i.e., commit to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2002 and 2001, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float. We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to the Federal Funds rate and (ii) hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments with off balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in long term mortgage rates of plus 50, 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results. Our aggregate net investments exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk include our operations in Mexico which approximated $61.1 million, our mortgage banking joint venture investment in Mexico which approximated $15.8 million and our operations in Argentina which approximated $13.1 million. 26 Table of Contents SPECIAL NOTES CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS As a cautionary note, except for the historical information contained herein, certain matters discussed in Item 7., Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Homebuilding (continued): International Homebuilding (continued): The following table presents selected financial data for our International Homebuilding operations for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Revenues $ 196,074 $ 35,169 $ 27,159 Cost of sales (157,056 ) (30,937 ) (24,611 ) Selling, general and administrative expense (35,029 ) (11,820 ) (5,621 ) Other income (expense), net (1,610 ) 66 967 Minority interest (1,801 ) Equity in income of joint ventures 4,479 5,138 5,455 Pre tax income (loss) $ 5,057 $ (2,384 ) $ 3,349 Unit settlements: Pulte 6,525 221 264 Pulte affiliated entities 1,022 7,258 7,718 7,547 7,479 7,982 Unit settlements for Pulte and Pulte affiliated entities in 2002 were relatively flat as compared to 2001 and down in 2001 when compared to 2000, as declines in Puerto Rico and Mexico were only partially offset by settlements in Argentina, which approached 200 in 2002. Settlements in Mexico were 7,166 in 2002 compared to 7,158 in 2001 and 7,718 in 2000. Activity in Mexico continues to be slowed by the impact of changes made in 2001 and 2002 to local lending practices and the lack of alternative funding sources. Increased revenues in 2002 are due to consolidation of the operations in Mexico for eleven months of 2002, a full year of operations in Argentina, which had only begun recognizing its first closings in June of 2001, partially offset by a decline in Puerto Rico. Revenues from our operations in Mexico were $158.1 million in 2002. Our operations in Argentina contributed $25.9 million compared to $9.5 million in the prior year. Revenues in Puerto Rico were down to $12.1 million from $25.5 million. The consolidation of Mexico also had a positive effect on gross margins, which rose to 19.9% in 2002 from 12.0% in 2001 and 9.4% in 2000. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues declined as a result of a reduction in start up costs associated with our operations in Argentina. Equity in income of joint ventures in 2002 represents one month of the joint venture operations in Mexico and our joint venture located in Canovanas, Puerto Rico, which had its first closings during the third quarter of 2001. Our operations in Argentina recorded transaction losses of $208,000 and $463,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, as the value of the Argentine peso continued to fluctuate following the Argentine governments decision to de link its valuation from the U.S. Dollar. We also recorded a foreign currency translation loss of $12.8 million, as a component of cumulative other comprehensive income during 2002. It remains unclear at this time how the financial and currency markets in Argentina will be impacted in 2003 or how the current economic situation may affect customer home buying attitudes and the homebuilding business in general. At December 31, 2002, our investment, net of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments, in Argentina approximated $13.1 million. Our operations in Mexico have also been affected by a strengthening dollar to the Mexican peso where transaction losses of $483,000, $378,000 and $78,000 were recorded in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. At December 31, 2002, our investment, net of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments, in Mexico approximated $61.1 million. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Financial Services: We conduct our financial services business, which includes mortgage and title operations, through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries. We sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts. Due to the short period of time the servicing rights are held, usually three to four months, we do not amortize the servicing asset. Since the servicing rights are recorded at the value in the servicing sales contracts, there are no impairment issues related to these assets. We also originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various credit arrangements, and then sell such mortgage loans to outside investors. The following table presents mortgage origination data for our Financial Services operations: Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Total originations: Loans 23,074 19,018 13,415 Principal ($000s omitted) $ 3,771,000 $ 2,937,100 $ 1,957,300 Originations for Pulte customers: Loans 19,537 15,402 11,109 Principal ($000s omitted) $ 3,176,500 $ 2,385,500 $ 1,697,600 Mortgage origination unit and principal volume for the year ended December 31, 2002, increased 21% and 28%, respectively, over 2001. This growth can be attributed to an increase in the capture rate of 390 basis points to 77.6% and the inclusion of Del Webb mortgage operations for a full year. Our capture rate represents loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percent of total loan opportunities, excluding cash settlements, from our homebuilding business. Mortgage origination principal volume in 2001 increased 50% over 2000, due to an increase in the capture rate of 950 basis points to 73.7%, an increased average loan size and the inclusion of Del Webb mortgage operations, which accounted for approximately 13% of the increase. Origination unit volume increased 42% due to the same factors. Our home buying customers continue to account for the majority of total loan production, representing 85% of total Pulte Mortgage unit production for 2002, compared with 81% in 2001 and 83% in 2000. Refinancings represented 8% of total loan production in 2002, compared with 10% in 2001 and 2% during 2000. At December 31, 2002, loan application backlog increased 66% to $1.4 billion as compared to $827 million and $536 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2002, increased 81% to $66.7 million, as a result of increased volume, a favorable interest rate environment, effective leverage of overhead costs and the inclusion of Del Webb mortgage operations for a full year. Gains from the sale of mortgages increased $20.4 million, or 49%, from the same period in 2001. As compared with 2001, net interest income increased $6.3 million to $11.3 million during 2002 due to increased production and a steeper yield curve as a result of the drop in interest rates during 2002. Title income grew 42% contributing $12.2 million to pre tax income for the year. Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2001, increased 49% to $36.9 million, due to increases in volume, capture rate and secondary marketing gains. The addition of Del Webb mortgage operations for the last five months of 2001 contributed approximately 8% of this increase. Pricing and marketing gains increased $17.4 million, or 71%, from the same period in 2000, primarily due to a consistent drop in interest rates throughout 2001. As compared with 2000, net interest income increased $3.1 million to $5.0 million during 2001 due to increased production and a steeper yield curve as a result of the drop in interest rates during 2001. Offsetting these gains was an increase in SGA expenses of $10 million as a result of increased headcount and other related costs due to the increase in volume during 2001. Income from our title operations increased 48% to $8.6 million in 2001, further fueling the growth in our financial services business. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Financial Services (continued): We hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed mortgage loans with derivative financial instruments. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we did not recognize any net gains or losses related to the ineffective portion of the hedging instrument excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We also did not recognize any gains or losses during 2002, for cash flow hedges that were discontinued because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur. At December 31, 2002, we expect to reclassify $1.3 million, net of taxes, of net losses on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next twelve months from sales of closed mortgage loans. Corporate: Corporate is a non operating business segment whose primary purpose is to support the operations of our subsidiaries as the internal source of financing, to develop and implement strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies, and to provide the administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity. As a result, the corporate segments operating results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve. The following table presents this segments results of operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Net interest expense $ 38,214 $ 34,261 $ 28,987 Other corporate expenses, net 23,754 23,191 27,309 Loss before income taxes $ 61,968 $ 57,452 $ 56,296 Interest expense, net of interest capitalized into inventory, increased 12% to $38.2 million in 2002 and 18% to $34.3 million in 2001. This trend is a result of an increase in debt levels necessary to support our growth. Interest incurred for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, excluding interest incurred by our financial services operations, was approximately $162.5, $116.9 and $62.8 million, respectively. Other corporate expense, net over the two year period ended December 31, 2002, was relatively flat, as higher compensation related costs were offset by income from the sale and adjustment to fair value of various non operating parcels of commercial land held for sale. The decrease in other corporate expenses, net in 2001 when compared to 2000 is primarily due to the write down of commercial land held for sale in 2000. Interest capitalized into inventory is charged to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. Interest in inventory at December 31, 2002, increased primarily as a result of higher levels of indebtedness and the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Information related to Corporate interest capitalized into inventory is as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Interest in inventory at beginning of year $ 68,595 $ 24,202 $ 19,092 Interest capitalized 123,086 80,399 33,129 Interest expensed (48,697 ) (36,006 ) (28,019 ) Interest in inventory at end of year $ 142,984 $ 68,595 $ 24,202 21 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources: Our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2002, amounted to $162.2 million. The increase in net income was aided by the realization of certain tax benefits and an increase in accrued liabilities, while inventories continued to build to support the growth of the business. Net cash provided by investing activities was $4.6 million for 2002. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002, was $374.2 million, reflecting proceeds from the $300 million senior notes issued in June 2002, proceeds from borrowings under our various credit facilities and proceeds from employee stock option exercises, offset by the repayment of debt, dividends paid and stock repurchases. Our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2001, was $418.8 million as higher net income was offset by increases in inventory and residential mortgage loans available for sale over 2000 and the resolution of the First Heights litigation. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2001 increased primarily due to the net cash acquired from Del Webb. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $297.1 million as proceeds from the issuance of senior notes of $200 million and $500 million, and increased borrowings under the revolving credit arrangements were offset by the repayment of higher rate debt acquired from Del Webb. We finance our homebuilding land acquisitions, development and construction activities from internally generated funds and existing credit agreements. We had no borrowings under our $570 million unsecured revolving credit facility at December 31, 2002. Pulte Mortgage provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available pursuant to various committed and uncommitted credit arrangements totaling $600 million, an amount deemed adequate to cover foreseeable needs. There were approximately $560 million of borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2002 under the $600 million Pulte Mortgage arrangements. Mortgage loans originated by Pulte Mortgage are subsequently sold to outside investors. We anticipate that there will be adequate mortgage financing available for purchasers of our homes. In June 2002, we sold $300 million of 7.875% senior notes, due 2032, from our $1 billion shelf registration. Cash provided by operations, combined with the net proceeds from this sale of senior notes, were used to call, redeem and repurchase approximately $103 million of Del Webb senior subordinated notes and to repay short term borrowings under our revolving bank credit arrangements. In October 2002, our operating entity in Argentina entered into a $3 million revolving credit facility in order to provide an additional financial resource to support the operations. Pulte Homes, Inc has guaranteed the credit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2002. In October 2002, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan of up to $100 million. Shares will be purchased from time to time on the open market, depending on market conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we repurchased 100,000 shares for approximately $4.3 million. Our income tax liabilities are affected by a number of factors. In 2002, our effective tax rate was 39.0% compared to 38.5% in 2001 and 2000. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2003 will be approximately 39.0%. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): At December 31, 2002, we had cash and equivalents of $613.2 million, $1.7 billion of unsecured senior notes and $260.7 million of unsecured senior subordinated notes. Other financing includes limited recourse collateralized financing totaling $145.5 million. The following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2002: Payments Due by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After 2007 Contractual obligations: Limited recourse collateralized financing $ 145,526 $ 59,563 $ 72,659 $ 10,478 $ 2,826 Non guarantor short term borrowings 559,621 559,621 Senior notes and subordinated notes 1,907,976 275,000 237,000 1,395,976 Operating leases 117,620 31,481 39,243 22,633 24,263 Total contractual obligations $ 2,730,743 $ 925,665 $ 348,902 $ 33,111 $ 1,423,065 The following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2002: Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After 2007 Other commercial commitments: Guarantor revolving credit facilities $ 570,000 $ $ 570,000 $ $ Non guarantor revolving credit facilities 600,000 275,000 325,000 Standby letters of credit 150,955 138,803 12,152 Total commercial commitments $ 1,320,955 $ 413,803 $ 907,152 $ $ Standby letters of credit and performance bonds are used to guarantee our performance under various contracts, principally in connection with the development of our projects. The expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related project. If the obligations related to the project are ongoing, annual extensions are granted on a year to year basis. Performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These bonds, which approximated $954 million at December 31, 2002, are typically outstanding over a period that approximates 3 5 years. In the normal course of business, we acquire rights under options or option type agreements to purchase land to be used in homebuilding operations at future dates. These rights, which may be cancelled at our discretion, may extend over several years and are typically secured by small deposits. Further, these rights are frequently extended or renegotiated to better match the needs of our homebuilding operations. The total purchase price applicable to approved land under option for use by our homebuilding operations at future dates approximated $1.5 billion at December 31, 2002, which represented approximately 43,800 lots. In addition, there were approximately 48,700 lots valued at $982 million under option at December 31, 2002 pending approval, that are under review and evaluation for future use by our homebuilding operations. Sources of our working capital at December 31, 2002, include cash and equivalents, our $570 million committed unsecured revolving credit facility and Pulte Mortgages $600 million revolving credit. Our debt to total capitalization, excluding our collateralized debt, was approximately 41% as of December 31, 2002, and approximately 32% net of cash and equivalents. We expect to maintain our net debt to total capitalization at or below the 40% level. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): In February 2003, we sold $300 million of 6.25% senior notes, due 2013, from the Companys current shelf registration. Proceeds from the sale will be used to retire certain debt coming due or called in 2003. Subsequent to this issuance, we had $400 million remaining available under the current mixed securities shelf registration. Inflation: We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation also increases our financing, labor and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices. To date, inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates: The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements, giving due regard to materiality. The development and selection of the following critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Revenue recognition: Homebuilding Homebuilding revenues are recorded when the sales of homes are completed and ownership has transferred to the customer. Unfunded settlements are deposits in transit on homes for which the sale was completed. We do not engage in arrangements whereby we have ongoing relationships with our homebuyers that require us to repurchase our homes or provide homebuyers with the right of return. Financial Services Mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors. Servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance and are credited to income when the related mortgage payments are received. Loan origination fees, commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred as an adjustment to the cost of the related mortgage loan until such loan is sold. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold. Inventory valuation: Our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated cost or net realizable value. Included in inventories are all direct development costs. We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories and charge the interest to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. This period increased in 2001 due to the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated cost, unless they are determined to be impaired, in which case these inventories are measured at fair value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory adjustments may be required. Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis. Under the specific identification basis, cost of sales includes the construction cost of the home, an average lot cost by project based on land acquisition and development costs, and closing costs and commissions. Construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home, plus an accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid, based on an analysis of budgeted construction cost. This accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared to the amount accrued, and adjustments are made if needed. Total project land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared to actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete. Adjustments to estimated total project land acquisition and development costs for the project affect the amount of future lots costed. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued): Residential mortgage loans available for sale: Residential mortgage loans available for sale are stated at the lower of aggregate cost or market value. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold. We hedge our residential mortgage loans available for sale. Gains and losses from closed commitments and futures contracts are matched against the related gains and losses on the sale of mortgage loans. Goodwill and intangible assets: We have identified significant intangible assets and generated significant goodwill, most recently as a result of the Del Webb merger in 2001. Intangible assets, primarily trademarks and tradenames, were valued by independent appraisers and advisors using proven valuation procedures and are amortized over their estimated useful life. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing. The carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use. If our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly, intangible assets and goodwill may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material. If we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets, long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment, we measure impairment based on one of two methods. For assets related to ongoing operations we plan to continue, we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists and then measure impairment using discounted cash flows. For assets to be disposed of, we assess the fair value of the asset based on current market conditions for similar assets. For goodwill, we assess fair value by measuring discounted cash flows of our reporting units and measure impairment as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded book value. The estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control. Changes in these estimates could result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and material charges to the results of operations. Investments in unconsolidated entities: We participate in a number of joint ventures with independent third parties in which we have less than a controlling interest. These joint ventures purchase, develop and or sell land and homes in the United States, Mexico and Puerto Rico. We recognize our share of profits from the sale of lots and homes to other buyers. We do not recognize profits from lots we purchase, but instead defer those profits until the related homes are sold. At December 31, 2002, we had approximately $49.0 million invested in these joint ventures. Under certain arrangements, future capital contributions may be necessary to maintain our ownership in the joint venture. We have not guaranteed any of the outstanding debt of the joint ventures at December 31, 2002, which approximated $103.2 million. We also own 22.2% of the capital stock of a mortgage banking company in Mexico. At December 31, 2002, our investment in this entity was approximately $15.8 million. We do not have any purchase or investment commitments to this entity. Furthermore, we have not guaranteed any of the indebtedness of this entity, which approximated $1.2 billion at December 31, 2002. These investments are accounted for on the equity method. Allowance for warranties: Home purchasers are provided with warranties against certain building defects. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary geographically. Most warranties cover different aspects of the homes construction and operating systems for a period of up to ten years. We estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim. We periodically assesses the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. Although we have not made significant adjustments to the accrual in the past, actual warranty cost in the future could differ from our current estimate. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our rate sensitive financing to the extent long term rates decline. The following tables set forth, as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, our rate sensitive financing obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value ($000s omitted). As of December 31, 2002 for the Years ended December 31, There Fair 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 after Total Value Rate sensitive liabilities: Fixed interest rate debt: Senior notes and subordinated notes $ 275,000 $ 112,000 $ 125,000 $ $ $ 1,395,976 $ 1,907,976 $ 2,006,173 Average interest rate 8.59 % 8.38 % 7.30 % 8.46 % 8.23 % Limited recourse collateralized financing $ 59,563 $ 41,528 $ 31,131 $ 9,128 $ 1,350 $ 2,826 $ 145,526 $ 145,526 Average interest rate 5.27 % 5.53 % 6.12 % 2.16 % 4.00 % 4.00 % 5.30 % As of December 31, 2001 for the Years ended December 31, There Fair 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 after Total Value Rate sensitive liabilities: Fixed interest rate debt: Senior notes and subordinated notes $ $ 275,000 $ 112,000 $ 125,000 $ 69,810 $ 1,130,887 $ 1,712,697 $ 1,744,726 Average interest rate 8.59 % 8.38 % 7.30 % 9.00 % 8.37 % 8.36 % Limited recourse collateralized financing $ 17,556 $ 7,531 $ 4,446 $ 5,894 $ 1,350 $ 2,826 $ 39,603 $ 39,603 Average interest rate 6.42 % 6.96 % 7.20 % 5.06 % 4.00 % 4.00 % 6.15 % Pulte Mortgage, operating as a mortgage banker, is also subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed upon terms (i.e., commit to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2002 and 2001, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float. We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to the Federal Funds rate and (ii) hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments with off balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in long term mortgage rates of plus 50, 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results. Our aggregate net investments exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk include our operations in Mexico which approximated $61.1 million, our mortgage banking joint venture investment in Mexico which approximated $15.8 million and our operations in Argentina which approximated $13.1 million. 26 Table of Contents SPECIAL NOTES CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS As a cautionary note, except for the historical information contained herein, certain matters discussed in Item 7., Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Financial Services: We conduct our financial services business, which includes mortgage and title operations, through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries. We sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts. Due to the short period of time the servicing rights are held, usually three to four months, we do not amortize the servicing asset. Since the servicing rights are recorded at the value in the servicing sales contracts, there are no impairment issues related to these assets. We also originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various credit arrangements, and then sell such mortgage loans to outside investors. The following table presents mortgage origination data for our Financial Services operations: Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Total originations: Loans 23,074 19,018 13,415 Principal ($000s omitted) $ 3,771,000 $ 2,937,100 $ 1,957,300 Originations for Pulte customers: Loans 19,537 15,402 11,109 Principal ($000s omitted) $ 3,176,500 $ 2,385,500 $ 1,697,600 Mortgage origination unit and principal volume for the year ended December 31, 2002, increased 21% and 28%, respectively, over 2001. This growth can be attributed to an increase in the capture rate of 390 basis points to 77.6% and the inclusion of Del Webb mortgage operations for a full year. Our capture rate represents loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percent of total loan opportunities, excluding cash settlements, from our homebuilding business. Mortgage origination principal volume in 2001 increased 50% over 2000, due to an increase in the capture rate of 950 basis points to 73.7%, an increased average loan size and the inclusion of Del Webb mortgage operations, which accounted for approximately 13% of the increase. Origination unit volume increased 42% due to the same factors. Our home buying customers continue to account for the majority of total loan production, representing 85% of total Pulte Mortgage unit production for 2002, compared with 81% in 2001 and 83% in 2000. Refinancings represented 8% of total loan production in 2002, compared with 10% in 2001 and 2% during 2000. At December 31, 2002, loan application backlog increased 66% to $1.4 billion as compared to $827 million and $536 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2002, increased 81% to $66.7 million, as a result of increased volume, a favorable interest rate environment, effective leverage of overhead costs and the inclusion of Del Webb mortgage operations for a full year. Gains from the sale of mortgages increased $20.4 million, or 49%, from the same period in 2001. As compared with 2001, net interest income increased $6.3 million to $11.3 million during 2002 due to increased production and a steeper yield curve as a result of the drop in interest rates during 2002. Title income grew 42% contributing $12.2 million to pre tax income for the year. Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2001, increased 49% to $36.9 million, due to increases in volume, capture rate and secondary marketing gains. The addition of Del Webb mortgage operations for the last five months of 2001 contributed approximately 8% of this increase. Pricing and marketing gains increased $17.4 million, or 71%, from the same period in 2000, primarily due to a consistent drop in interest rates throughout 2001. As compared with 2000, net interest income increased $3.1 million to $5.0 million during 2001 due to increased production and a steeper yield curve as a result of the drop in interest rates during 2001. Offsetting these gains was an increase in SGA expenses of $10 million as a result of increased headcount and other related costs due to the increase in volume during 2001. Income from our title operations increased 48% to $8.6 million in 2001, further fueling the growth in our financial services business. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Financial Services (continued): We hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed mortgage loans with derivative financial instruments. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we did not recognize any net gains or losses related to the ineffective portion of the hedging instrument excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We also did not recognize any gains or losses during 2002, for cash flow hedges that were discontinued because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur. At December 31, 2002, we expect to reclassify $1.3 million, net of taxes, of net losses on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next twelve months from sales of closed mortgage loans. Corporate: Corporate is a non operating business segment whose primary purpose is to support the operations of our subsidiaries as the internal source of financing, to develop and implement strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies, and to provide the administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity. As a result, the corporate segments operating results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve. The following table presents this segments results of operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Net interest expense $ 38,214 $ 34,261 $ 28,987 Other corporate expenses, net 23,754 23,191 27,309 Loss before income taxes $ 61,968 $ 57,452 $ 56,296 Interest expense, net of interest capitalized into inventory, increased 12% to $38.2 million in 2002 and 18% to $34.3 million in 2001. This trend is a result of an increase in debt levels necessary to support our growth. Interest incurred for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, excluding interest incurred by our financial services operations, was approximately $162.5, $116.9 and $62.8 million, respectively. Other corporate expense, net over the two year period ended December 31, 2002, was relatively flat, as higher compensation related costs were offset by income from the sale and adjustment to fair value of various non operating parcels of commercial land held for sale. The decrease in other corporate expenses, net in 2001 when compared to 2000 is primarily due to the write down of commercial land held for sale in 2000. Interest capitalized into inventory is charged to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. Interest in inventory at December 31, 2002, increased primarily as a result of higher levels of indebtedness and the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Information related to Corporate interest capitalized into inventory is as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Interest in inventory at beginning of year $ 68,595 $ 24,202 $ 19,092 Interest capitalized 123,086 80,399 33,129 Interest expensed (48,697 ) (36,006 ) (28,019 ) Interest in inventory at end of year $ 142,984 $ 68,595 $ 24,202 21 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources: Our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2002, amounted to $162.2 million. The increase in net income was aided by the realization of certain tax benefits and an increase in accrued liabilities, while inventories continued to build to support the growth of the business. Net cash provided by investing activities was $4.6 million for 2002. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002, was $374.2 million, reflecting proceeds from the $300 million senior notes issued in June 2002, proceeds from borrowings under our various credit facilities and proceeds from employee stock option exercises, offset by the repayment of debt, dividends paid and stock repurchases. Our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2001, was $418.8 million as higher net income was offset by increases in inventory and residential mortgage loans available for sale over 2000 and the resolution of the First Heights litigation. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2001 increased primarily due to the net cash acquired from Del Webb. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $297.1 million as proceeds from the issuance of senior notes of $200 million and $500 million, and increased borrowings under the revolving credit arrangements were offset by the repayment of higher rate debt acquired from Del Webb. We finance our homebuilding land acquisitions, development and construction activities from internally generated funds and existing credit agreements. We had no borrowings under our $570 million unsecured revolving credit facility at December 31, 2002. Pulte Mortgage provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available pursuant to various committed and uncommitted credit arrangements totaling $600 million, an amount deemed adequate to cover foreseeable needs. There were approximately $560 million of borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2002 under the $600 million Pulte Mortgage arrangements. Mortgage loans originated by Pulte Mortgage are subsequently sold to outside investors. We anticipate that there will be adequate mortgage financing available for purchasers of our homes. In June 2002, we sold $300 million of 7.875% senior notes, due 2032, from our $1 billion shelf registration. Cash provided by operations, combined with the net proceeds from this sale of senior notes, were used to call, redeem and repurchase approximately $103 million of Del Webb senior subordinated notes and to repay short term borrowings under our revolving bank credit arrangements. In October 2002, our operating entity in Argentina entered into a $3 million revolving credit facility in order to provide an additional financial resource to support the operations. Pulte Homes, Inc has guaranteed the credit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2002. In October 2002, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan of up to $100 million. Shares will be purchased from time to time on the open market, depending on market conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we repurchased 100,000 shares for approximately $4.3 million. Our income tax liabilities are affected by a number of factors. In 2002, our effective tax rate was 39.0% compared to 38.5% in 2001 and 2000. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2003 will be approximately 39.0%. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): At December 31, 2002, we had cash and equivalents of $613.2 million, $1.7 billion of unsecured senior notes and $260.7 million of unsecured senior subordinated notes. Other financing includes limited recourse collateralized financing totaling $145.5 million. The following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2002: Payments Due by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After 2007 Contractual obligations: Limited recourse collateralized financing $ 145,526 $ 59,563 $ 72,659 $ 10,478 $ 2,826 Non guarantor short term borrowings 559,621 559,621 Senior notes and subordinated notes 1,907,976 275,000 237,000 1,395,976 Operating leases 117,620 31,481 39,243 22,633 24,263 Total contractual obligations $ 2,730,743 $ 925,665 $ 348,902 $ 33,111 $ 1,423,065 The following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2002: Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After 2007 Other commercial commitments: Guarantor revolving credit facilities $ 570,000 $ $ 570,000 $ $ Non guarantor revolving credit facilities 600,000 275,000 325,000 Standby letters of credit 150,955 138,803 12,152 Total commercial commitments $ 1,320,955 $ 413,803 $ 907,152 $ $ Standby letters of credit and performance bonds are used to guarantee our performance under various contracts, principally in connection with the development of our projects. The expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related project. If the obligations related to the project are ongoing, annual extensions are granted on a year to year basis. Performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These bonds, which approximated $954 million at December 31, 2002, are typically outstanding over a period that approximates 3 5 years. In the normal course of business, we acquire rights under options or option type agreements to purchase land to be used in homebuilding operations at future dates. These rights, which may be cancelled at our discretion, may extend over several years and are typically secured by small deposits. Further, these rights are frequently extended or renegotiated to better match the needs of our homebuilding operations. The total purchase price applicable to approved land under option for use by our homebuilding operations at future dates approximated $1.5 billion at December 31, 2002, which represented approximately 43,800 lots. In addition, there were approximately 48,700 lots valued at $982 million under option at December 31, 2002 pending approval, that are under review and evaluation for future use by our homebuilding operations. Sources of our working capital at December 31, 2002, include cash and equivalents, our $570 million committed unsecured revolving credit facility and Pulte Mortgages $600 million revolving credit. Our debt to total capitalization, excluding our collateralized debt, was approximately 41% as of December 31, 2002, and approximately 32% net of cash and equivalents. We expect to maintain our net debt to total capitalization at or below the 40% level. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): In February 2003, we sold $300 million of 6.25% senior notes, due 2013, from the Companys current shelf registration. Proceeds from the sale will be used to retire certain debt coming due or called in 2003. Subsequent to this issuance, we had $400 million remaining available under the current mixed securities shelf registration. Inflation: We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation also increases our financing, labor and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices. To date, inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates: The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements, giving due regard to materiality. The development and selection of the following critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Revenue recognition: Homebuilding Homebuilding revenues are recorded when the sales of homes are completed and ownership has transferred to the customer. Unfunded settlements are deposits in transit on homes for which the sale was completed. We do not engage in arrangements whereby we have ongoing relationships with our homebuyers that require us to repurchase our homes or provide homebuyers with the right of return. Financial Services Mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors. Servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance and are credited to income when the related mortgage payments are received. Loan origination fees, commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred as an adjustment to the cost of the related mortgage loan until such loan is sold. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold. Inventory valuation: Our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated cost or net realizable value. Included in inventories are all direct development costs. We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories and charge the interest to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. This period increased in 2001 due to the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated cost, unless they are determined to be impaired, in which case these inventories are measured at fair value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory adjustments may be required. Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis. Under the specific identification basis, cost of sales includes the construction cost of the home, an average lot cost by project based on land acquisition and development costs, and closing costs and commissions. Construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home, plus an accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid, based on an analysis of budgeted construction cost. This accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared to the amount accrued, and adjustments are made if needed. Total project land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared to actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete. Adjustments to estimated total project land acquisition and development costs for the project affect the amount of future lots costed. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued): Residential mortgage loans available for sale: Residential mortgage loans available for sale are stated at the lower of aggregate cost or market value. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold. We hedge our residential mortgage loans available for sale. Gains and losses from closed commitments and futures contracts are matched against the related gains and losses on the sale of mortgage loans. Goodwill and intangible assets: We have identified significant intangible assets and generated significant goodwill, most recently as a result of the Del Webb merger in 2001. Intangible assets, primarily trademarks and tradenames, were valued by independent appraisers and advisors using proven valuation procedures and are amortized over their estimated useful life. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing. The carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use. If our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly, intangible assets and goodwill may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material. If we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets, long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment, we measure impairment based on one of two methods. For assets related to ongoing operations we plan to continue, we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists and then measure impairment using discounted cash flows. For assets to be disposed of, we assess the fair value of the asset based on current market conditions for similar assets. For goodwill, we assess fair value by measuring discounted cash flows of our reporting units and measure impairment as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded book value. The estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control. Changes in these estimates could result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and material charges to the results of operations. Investments in unconsolidated entities: We participate in a number of joint ventures with independent third parties in which we have less than a controlling interest. These joint ventures purchase, develop and or sell land and homes in the United States, Mexico and Puerto Rico. We recognize our share of profits from the sale of lots and homes to other buyers. We do not recognize profits from lots we purchase, but instead defer those profits until the related homes are sold. At December 31, 2002, we had approximately $49.0 million invested in these joint ventures. Under certain arrangements, future capital contributions may be necessary to maintain our ownership in the joint venture. We have not guaranteed any of the outstanding debt of the joint ventures at December 31, 2002, which approximated $103.2 million. We also own 22.2% of the capital stock of a mortgage banking company in Mexico. At December 31, 2002, our investment in this entity was approximately $15.8 million. We do not have any purchase or investment commitments to this entity. Furthermore, we have not guaranteed any of the indebtedness of this entity, which approximated $1.2 billion at December 31, 2002. These investments are accounted for on the equity method. Allowance for warranties: Home purchasers are provided with warranties against certain building defects. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary geographically. Most warranties cover different aspects of the homes construction and operating systems for a period of up to ten years. We estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim. We periodically assesses the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. Although we have not made significant adjustments to the accrual in the past, actual warranty cost in the future could differ from our current estimate. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our rate sensitive financing to the extent long term rates decline. The following tables set forth, as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, our rate sensitive financing obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value ($000s omitted).

Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed upon terms (i.e., commit to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2002 and 2001, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float. We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to the Federal Funds rate and (ii) hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments with off balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in long term mortgage rates of plus 50, 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results. Our aggregate net investments exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk include our operations in Mexico which approximated $61.1 million, our mortgage banking joint venture investment in Mexico which approximated $15.8 million and our operations in Argentina which approximated $13.1 million. 26 Table of Contents SPECIAL NOTES CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS As a cautionary note, except for the historical information contained herein, certain matters discussed in Item 7., Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Financial Services (continued): We hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed mortgage loans with derivative financial instruments. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we did not recognize any net gains or losses related to the ineffective portion of the hedging instrument excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We also did not recognize any gains or losses during 2002, for cash flow hedges that were discontinued because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur. At December 31, 2002, we expect to reclassify $1.3 million, net of taxes, of net losses on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next twelve months from sales of closed mortgage loans. Corporate: Corporate is a non operating business segment whose primary purpose is to support the operations of our subsidiaries as the internal source of financing, to develop and implement strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies, and to provide the administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity. As a result, the corporate segments operating results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve. The following table presents this segments results of operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Net interest expense $ 38,214 $ 34,261 $ 28,987 Other corporate expenses, net 23,754 23,191 27,309 Loss before income taxes $ 61,968 $ 57,452 $ 56,296 Interest expense, net of interest capitalized into inventory, increased 12% to $38.2 million in 2002 and 18% to $34.3 million in 2001. This trend is a result of an increase in debt levels necessary to support our growth. Interest incurred for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, excluding interest incurred by our financial services operations, was approximately $162.5, $116.9 and $62.8 million, respectively. Other corporate expense, net over the two year period ended December 31, 2002, was relatively flat, as higher compensation related costs were offset by income from the sale and adjustment to fair value of various non operating parcels of commercial land held for sale. The decrease in other corporate expenses, net in 2001 when compared to 2000 is primarily due to the write down of commercial land held for sale in 2000. Interest capitalized into inventory is charged to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. Interest in inventory at December 31, 2002, increased primarily as a result of higher levels of indebtedness and the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Information related to Corporate interest capitalized into inventory is as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Interest in inventory at beginning of year $ 68,595 $ 24,202 $ 19,092 Interest capitalized 123,086 80,399 33,129 Interest expensed (48,697 ) (36,006 ) (28,019 ) Interest in inventory at end of year $ 142,984 $ 68,595 $ 24,202 21 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources: Our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2002, amounted to $162.2 million. The increase in net income was aided by the realization of certain tax benefits and an increase in accrued liabilities, while inventories continued to build to support the growth of the business. Net cash provided by investing activities was $4.6 million for 2002. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002, was $374.2 million, reflecting proceeds from the $300 million senior notes issued in June 2002, proceeds from borrowings under our various credit facilities and proceeds from employee stock option exercises, offset by the repayment of debt, dividends paid and stock repurchases. Our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2001, was $418.8 million as higher net income was offset by increases in inventory and residential mortgage loans available for sale over 2000 and the resolution of the First Heights litigation. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2001 increased primarily due to the net cash acquired from Del Webb. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $297.1 million as proceeds from the issuance of senior notes of $200 million and $500 million, and increased borrowings under the revolving credit arrangements were offset by the repayment of higher rate debt acquired from Del Webb. We finance our homebuilding land acquisitions, development and construction activities from internally generated funds and existing credit agreements. We had no borrowings under our $570 million unsecured revolving credit facility at December 31, 2002. Pulte Mortgage provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available pursuant to various committed and uncommitted credit arrangements totaling $600 million, an amount deemed adequate to cover foreseeable needs. There were approximately $560 million of borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2002 under the $600 million Pulte Mortgage arrangements. Mortgage loans originated by Pulte Mortgage are subsequently sold to outside investors. We anticipate that there will be adequate mortgage financing available for purchasers of our homes. In June 2002, we sold $300 million of 7.875% senior notes, due 2032, from our $1 billion shelf registration. Cash provided by operations, combined with the net proceeds from this sale of senior notes, were used to call, redeem and repurchase approximately $103 million of Del Webb senior subordinated notes and to repay short term borrowings under our revolving bank credit arrangements. In October 2002, our operating entity in Argentina entered into a $3 million revolving credit facility in order to provide an additional financial resource to support the operations. Pulte Homes, Inc has guaranteed the credit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2002. In October 2002, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan of up to $100 million. Shares will be purchased from time to time on the open market, depending on market conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we repurchased 100,000 shares for approximately $4.3 million. Our income tax liabilities are affected by a number of factors. In 2002, our effective tax rate was 39.0% compared to 38.5% in 2001 and 2000. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2003 will be approximately 39.0%. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): At December 31, 2002, we had cash and equivalents of $613.2 million, $1.7 billion of unsecured senior notes and $260.7 million of unsecured senior subordinated notes. Other financing includes limited recourse collateralized financing totaling $145.5 million. The following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2002: Payments Due by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After 2007 Contractual obligations: Limited recourse collateralized financing $ 145,526 $ 59,563 $ 72,659 $ 10,478 $ 2,826 Non guarantor short term borrowings 559,621 559,621 Senior notes and subordinated notes 1,907,976 275,000 237,000 1,395,976 Operating leases 117,620 31,481 39,243 22,633 24,263 Total contractual obligations $ 2,730,743 $ 925,665 $ 348,902 $ 33,111 $ 1,423,065 The following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2002: Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After 2007 Other commercial commitments: Guarantor revolving credit facilities $ 570,000 $ $ 570,000 $ $ Non guarantor revolving credit facilities 600,000 275,000 325,000 Standby letters of credit 150,955 138,803 12,152 Total commercial commitments $ 1,320,955 $ 413,803 $ 907,152 $ $ Standby letters of credit and performance bonds are used to guarantee our performance under various contracts, principally in connection with the development of our projects. The expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related project. If the obligations related to the project are ongoing, annual extensions are granted on a year to year basis. Performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These bonds, which approximated $954 million at December 31, 2002, are typically outstanding over a period that approximates 3 5 years. In the normal course of business, we acquire rights under options or option type agreements to purchase land to be used in homebuilding operations at future dates. These rights, which may be cancelled at our discretion, may extend over several years and are typically secured by small deposits. Further, these rights are frequently extended or renegotiated to better match the needs of our homebuilding operations. The total purchase price applicable to approved land under option for use by our homebuilding operations at future dates approximated $1.5 billion at December 31, 2002, which represented approximately 43,800 lots. In addition, there were approximately 48,700 lots valued at $982 million under option at December 31, 2002 pending approval, that are under review and evaluation for future use by our homebuilding operations. Sources of our working capital at December 31, 2002, include cash and equivalents, our $570 million committed unsecured revolving credit facility and Pulte Mortgages $600 million revolving credit. Our debt to total capitalization, excluding our collateralized debt, was approximately 41% as of December 31, 2002, and approximately 32% net of cash and equivalents. We expect to maintain our net debt to total capitalization at or below the 40% level. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): In February 2003, we sold $300 million of 6.25% senior notes, due 2013, from the Companys current shelf registration. Proceeds from the sale will be used to retire certain debt coming due or called in 2003. Subsequent to this issuance, we had $400 million remaining available under the current mixed securities shelf registration. Inflation: We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation also increases our financing, labor and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices. To date, inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates: The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements, giving due regard to materiality. The development and selection of the following critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Under the specific identification basis, cost of sales includes the construction cost of the home, an average lot cost by project based on land acquisition and development costs, and closing costs and commissions. Construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home, plus an accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid, based on an analysis of budgeted construction cost. This accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared to the amount accrued, and adjustments are made if needed. Total project land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared to actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete. Adjustments to estimated total project land acquisition and development costs for the project affect the amount of future lots costed. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed upon terms (i.e., commit to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2002 and 2001, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float. We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to the Federal Funds rate and (ii) hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments with off balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in long term mortgage rates of plus 50, 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results. Our aggregate net investments exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk include our operations in Mexico which approximated $61.1 million, our mortgage banking joint venture investment in Mexico which approximated $15.8 million and our operations in Argentina which approximated $13.1 million. 26 Table of Contents SPECIAL NOTES CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS As a cautionary note, except for the historical information contained herein, certain matters discussed in Item 7., Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources: Our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2002, amounted to $162.2 million. The increase in net income was aided by the realization of certain tax benefits and an increase in accrued liabilities, while inventories continued to build to support the growth of the business. Net cash provided by investing activities was $4.6 million for 2002. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002, was $374.2 million, reflecting proceeds from the $300 million senior notes issued in June 2002, proceeds from borrowings under our various credit facilities and proceeds from employee stock option exercises, offset by the repayment of debt, dividends paid and stock repurchases. Our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2001, was $418.8 million as higher net income was offset by increases in inventory and residential mortgage loans available for sale over 2000 and the resolution of the First Heights litigation. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2001 increased primarily due to the net cash acquired from Del Webb. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $297.1 million as proceeds from the issuance of senior notes of $200 million and $500 million, and increased borrowings under the revolving credit arrangements were offset by the repayment of higher rate debt acquired from Del Webb. We finance our homebuilding land acquisitions, development and construction activities from internally generated funds and existing credit agreements. We had no borrowings under our $570 million unsecured revolving credit facility at December 31, 2002. Pulte Mortgage provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available pursuant to various committed and uncommitted credit arrangements totaling $600 million, an amount deemed adequate to cover foreseeable needs. There were approximately $560 million of borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2002 under the $600 million Pulte Mortgage arrangements. Mortgage loans originated by Pulte Mortgage are subsequently sold to outside investors. We anticipate that there will be adequate mortgage financing available for purchasers of our homes. In June 2002, we sold $300 million of 7.875% senior notes, due 2032, from our $1 billion shelf registration. Cash provided by operations, combined with the net proceeds from this sale of senior notes, were used to call, redeem and repurchase approximately $103 million of Del Webb senior subordinated notes and to repay short term borrowings under our revolving bank credit arrangements. In October 2002, our operating entity in Argentina entered into a $3 million revolving credit facility in order to provide an additional financial resource to support the operations. Pulte Homes, Inc has guaranteed the credit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2002. In October 2002, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan of up to $100 million. Shares will be purchased from time to time on the open market, depending on market conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we repurchased 100,000 shares for approximately $4.3 million. Our income tax liabilities are affected by a number of factors. In 2002, our effective tax rate was 39.0% compared to 38.5% in 2001 and 2000. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2003 will be approximately 39.0%. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): At December 31, 2002, we had cash and equivalents of $613.2 million, $1.7 billion of unsecured senior notes and $260.7 million of unsecured senior subordinated notes. Other financing includes limited recourse collateralized financing totaling $145.5 million. The following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2002: Payments Due by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After 2007 Contractual obligations: Limited recourse collateralized financing $ 145,526 $ 59,563 $ 72,659 $ 10,478 $ 2,826 Non guarantor short term borrowings 559,621 559,621 Senior notes and subordinated notes 1,907,976 275,000 237,000 1,395,976 Operating leases 117,620 31,481 39,243 22,633 24,263 Total contractual obligations $ 2,730,743 $ 925,665 $ 348,902 $ 33,111 $ 1,423,065 The following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2002: Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After 2007 Other commercial commitments: Guarantor revolving credit facilities $ 570,000 $ $ 570,000 $ $ Non guarantor revolving credit facilities 600,000 275,000 325,000 Standby letters of credit 150,955 138,803 12,152 Total commercial commitments $ 1,320,955 $ 413,803 $ 907,152 $ $ Standby letters of credit and performance bonds are used to guarantee our performance under various contracts, principally in connection with the development of our projects. The expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related project. If the obligations related to the project are ongoing, annual extensions are granted on a year to year basis. Performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These bonds, which approximated $954 million at December 31, 2002, are typically outstanding over a period that approximates 3 5 years. In the normal course of business, we acquire rights under options or option type agreements to purchase land to be used in homebuilding operations at future dates. These rights, which may be cancelled at our discretion, may extend over several years and are typically secured by small deposits. Further, these rights are frequently extended or renegotiated to better match the needs of our homebuilding operations. The total purchase price applicable to approved land under option for use by our homebuilding operations at future dates approximated $1.5 billion at December 31, 2002, which represented approximately 43,800 lots. In addition, there were approximately 48,700 lots valued at $982 million under option at December 31, 2002 pending approval, that are under review and evaluation for future use by our homebuilding operations. Sources of our working capital at December 31, 2002, include cash and equivalents, our $570 million committed unsecured revolving credit facility and Pulte Mortgages $600 million revolving credit. Our debt to total capitalization, excluding our collateralized debt, was approximately 41% as of December 31, 2002, and approximately 32% net of cash and equivalents. We expect to maintain our net debt to total capitalization at or below the 40% level. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): In February 2003, we sold $300 million of 6.25% senior notes, due 2013, from the Companys current shelf registration. Proceeds from the sale will be used to retire certain debt coming due or called in 2003. Subsequent to this issuance, we had $400 million remaining available under the current mixed securities shelf registration. Inflation: We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation also increases our financing, labor and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices. To date, inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates: The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements, giving due regard to materiality. The development and selection of the following critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Revenue recognition: Homebuilding Homebuilding revenues are recorded when the sales of homes are completed and ownership has transferred to the customer. Unfunded settlements are deposits in transit on homes for which the sale was completed. We do not engage in arrangements whereby we have ongoing relationships with our homebuyers that require us to repurchase our homes or provide homebuyers with the right of return. Financial Services Mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors. Servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance and are credited to income when the related mortgage payments are received. Loan origination fees, commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred as an adjustment to the cost of the related mortgage loan until such loan is sold. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold. Inventory valuation: Our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated cost or net realizable value. Included in inventories are all direct development costs. We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories and charge the interest to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. This period increased in 2001 due to the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated cost, unless they are determined to be impaired, in which case these inventories are measured at fair value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory adjustments may be required. Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis. Under the specific identification basis, cost of sales includes the construction cost of the home, an average lot cost by project based on land acquisition and development costs, and closing costs and commissions. Construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home, plus an accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid, based on an analysis of budgeted construction cost. This accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared to the amount accrued, and adjustments are made if needed. Total project land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared to actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete. Adjustments to estimated total project land acquisition and development costs for the project affect the amount of future lots costed. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued): Residential mortgage loans available for sale: Residential mortgage loans available for sale are stated at the lower of aggregate cost or market value. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold. We hedge our residential mortgage loans available for sale. Gains and losses from closed commitments and futures contracts are matched against the related gains and losses on the sale of mortgage loans. Goodwill and intangible assets: We have identified significant intangible assets and generated significant goodwill, most recently as a result of the Del Webb merger in 2001. Intangible assets, primarily trademarks and tradenames, were valued by independent appraisers and advisors using proven valuation procedures and are amortized over their estimated useful life. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing. The carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use. If our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly, intangible assets and goodwill may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material. If we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets, long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment, we measure impairment based on one of two methods. For assets related to ongoing operations we plan to continue, we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists and then measure impairment using discounted cash flows. For assets to be disposed of, we assess the fair value of the asset based on current market conditions for similar assets. For goodwill, we assess fair value by measuring discounted cash flows of our reporting units and measure impairment as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded book value. The estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control. Changes in these estimates could result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and material charges to the results of operations. Investments in unconsolidated entities: We participate in a number of joint ventures with independent third parties in which we have less than a controlling interest. These joint ventures purchase, develop and or sell land and homes in the United States, Mexico and Puerto Rico. We recognize our share of profits from the sale of lots and homes to other buyers. We do not recognize profits from lots we purchase, but instead defer those profits until the related homes are sold. At December 31, 2002, we had approximately $49.0 million invested in these joint ventures. Under certain arrangements, future capital contributions may be necessary to maintain our ownership in the joint venture. We have not guaranteed any of the outstanding debt of the joint ventures at December 31, 2002, which approximated $103.2 million. We also own 22.2% of the capital stock of a mortgage banking company in Mexico. At December 31, 2002, our investment in this entity was approximately $15.8 million. We do not have any purchase or investment commitments to this entity. Furthermore, we have not guaranteed any of the indebtedness of this entity, which approximated $1.2 billion at December 31, 2002. These investments are accounted for on the equity method. Allowance for warranties: Home purchasers are provided with warranties against certain building defects. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary geographically. Most warranties cover different aspects of the homes construction and operating systems for a period of up to ten years. We estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim. We periodically assesses the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. Although we have not made significant adjustments to the accrual in the past, actual warranty cost in the future could differ from our current estimate. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our rate sensitive financing to the extent long term rates decline. The following tables set forth, as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, our rate sensitive financing obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value ($000s omitted).

Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed upon terms (i.e., commit to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2002 and 2001, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float. We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to the Federal Funds rate and (ii) hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments with off balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in long term mortgage rates of plus 50, 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results. Our aggregate net investments exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk include our operations in Mexico which approximated $61.1 million, our mortgage banking joint venture investment in Mexico which approximated $15.8 million and our operations in Argentina which approximated $13.1 million. 26 Table of Contents SPECIAL NOTES CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS As a cautionary note, except for the historical information contained herein, certain matters discussed in Item 7., Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued): Residential mortgage loans available for sale: Residential mortgage loans available for sale are stated at the lower of aggregate cost or market value. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold. We hedge our residential mortgage loans available for sale. Gains and losses from closed commitments and futures contracts are matched against the related gains and losses on the sale of mortgage loans. Goodwill and intangible assets: We have identified significant intangible assets and generated significant goodwill, most recently as a result of the Del Webb merger in 2001. Intangible assets, primarily trademarks and tradenames, were valued by independent appraisers and advisors using proven valuation procedures and are amortized over their estimated useful life. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing. The carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use. If our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly, intangible assets and goodwill may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material. If we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets, long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment, we measure impairment based on one of two methods. For assets related to ongoing operations we plan to continue, we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists and then measure impairment using discounted cash flows. For assets to be disposed of, we assess the fair value of the asset based on current market conditions for similar assets. For goodwill, we assess fair value by measuring discounted cash flows of our reporting units and measure impairment as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded book value. The estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control. Changes in these estimates could result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and material charges to the results of operations. Investments in unconsolidated entities: We participate in a number of joint ventures with independent third parties in which we have less than a controlling interest. These joint ventures purchase, develop and or sell land and homes in the United States, Mexico and Puerto Rico. We recognize our share of profits from the sale of lots and homes to other buyers. We do not recognize profits from lots we purchase, but instead defer those profits until the related homes are sold. At December 31, 2002, we had approximately $49.0 million invested in these joint ventures. Under certain arrangements, future capital contributions may be necessary to maintain our ownership in the joint venture. We have not guaranteed any of the outstanding debt of the joint ventures at December 31, 2002, which approximated $103.2 million. We also own 22.2% of the capital stock of a mortgage banking company in Mexico. At December 31, 2002, our investment in this entity was approximately $15.8 million. We do not have any purchase or investment commitments to this entity. Furthermore, we have not guaranteed any of the indebtedness of this entity, which approximated $1.2 billion at December 31, 2002. These investments are accounted for on the equity method. Allowance for warranties: Home purchasers are provided with warranties against certain building defects. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary geographically. Most warranties cover different aspects of the homes construction and operating systems for a period of up to ten years. We estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim. We periodically assesses the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. Although we have not made significant adjustments to the accrual in the past, actual warranty cost in the future could differ from our current estimate. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our rate sensitive financing to the extent long term rates decline. The following tables set forth, as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, our rate sensitive financing obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value ($000s omitted).

Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed upon terms (i.e., commit to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2002 and 2001, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float. We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to the Federal Funds rate and (ii) hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments with off balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in long term mortgage rates of plus 50, 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results. Our aggregate net investments exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk include our operations in Mexico which approximated $61.1 million, our mortgage banking joint venture investment in Mexico which approximated $15.8 million and our operations in Argentina which approximated $13.1 million. 26 Table of Contents SPECIAL NOTES CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS As a cautionary note, except for the historical information contained herein, certain matters discussed in Item 7., Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward looking statements involve known risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from our future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. Such factors include, among other things, (1) general economic and business conditions; (2) interest rate changes and the availability of mortgage financing; (3) the relative stability of debt and equity markets; (4) competition; (5) the availability and cost of land and other raw materials used in our homebuilding operations; (6) the availability and cost of insurance covering risks associated with our business; (7) shortages and the cost of labor; (8) weather related slowdowns; (9) slow growth initiatives and or local building moratoria; (10) governmental regulation, including the interpretation of tax, labor and environmental laws; (11) changes in consumer confidence and preferences; (12) required accounting changes; (13) terrorist acts and other acts of war; and (14) other factors over which we have little or no control. 27 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued): In February 2003, we sold $300 million of 6.25% senior notes, due 2013, from the Companys current shelf registration. Proceeds from the sale will be used to retire certain debt coming due or called in 2003. Subsequent to this issuance, we had $400 million remaining available under the current mixed securities shelf registration. Inflation: We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation also increases our financing, labor and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices. To date, inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates: The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements, giving due regard to materiality. The development and selection of the following critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Revenue recognition: Homebuilding Homebuilding revenues are recorded when the sales of homes are completed and ownership has transferred to the customer. Unfunded settlements are deposits in transit on homes for which the sale was completed. We do not engage in arrangements whereby we have ongoing relationships with our homebuyers that require us to repurchase our homes or provide homebuyers with the right of return. Financial Services Mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors. Servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance and are credited to income when the related mortgage payments are received. Loan origination fees, commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred as an adjustment to the cost of the related mortgage loan until such loan is sold. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold. Inventory valuation: Our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated cost or net realizable value. Included in inventories are all direct development costs. We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories and charge the interest to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. This period increased in 2001 due to the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated cost, unless they are determined to be impaired, in which case these inventories are measured at fair value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory adjustments may be required. Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis. Under the specific identification basis, cost of sales includes the construction cost of the home, an average lot cost by project based on land acquisition and development costs, and closing costs and commissions. Construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home, plus an accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid, based on an analysis of budgeted construction cost. This accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared to the amount accrued, and adjustments are made if needed. Total project land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared to actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete. Adjustments to estimated total project land acquisition and development costs for the project affect the amount of future lots costed. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7.
