ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview A summary of our operating results by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 is as follows ($000s omitted, except per share data): Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Pre tax income (loss): Homebuilding $ 1,002,161 $ 724,067 $ 512,291 Financial Services 68,846 66,723 36,948 Corporate (75,351 ) (61,968 ) (57,452 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes 995,656 728,822 491,787 Income taxes 378,334 284,221 189,362 Income from continuing operations 617,322 444,601 302,425 Income (loss) from discontinued operations 7,312 9,044 (1,032 ) Net income $ 624,634 $ 453,645 $ 301,393 Per share data assuming dilution: Income from continuing operations $ 4.91 $ 3.60 $ 3.00 Income (loss) from discontinued operations .06 .07 (.01 ) Net income $ 4.97 $ 3.67 $ 2.99 A comparison of pre tax income (loss), for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 is as follows: Continued strong demand for new housing, the addition and expansion of the Del Webb branded communities, coupled with our ability to effectively manage selling price and pace through our unique segmentation strategy drove pre tax income of our homebuilding business segment to increase 38% in 2003 and 41% in 2002. Domestic average unit selling price increased by 7% in 2003 and 8% in 2002. Additionally, domestic gross margin percentages from home sales were up 120 basis points in 2003 principally as a result of product price increases and market and product mix shifts. Compared to 2001, our 2002 domestic gross margin percentages were up 30 basis points principally as a result of purchase accounting adjustments recorded in 2001. Pre tax income of our financial services business segment increased 3% in 2003 and 81% in 2002. The increase in 2003 was primarily driven by an increase in loan originations and a higher capture rate tempered by a less favorable interest rate environment during the last half of the year. The 2002 increase was a result of increased volume, a favorable interest rate environment, effective leverage of overhead costs and the addition of Del Webb mortgage operations. Pre tax loss of our non operating corporate segment increased 22% in 2003 to $75.4 million principally from higher compensation related costs. The pre tax loss in 2002 increased 8% as a result of higher interest costs, related to an increase in debt levels to support the growth of the business. During the third quarter of 2003 and 2002, we recorded non cash, after tax gains of $7.9 million and $10.0 million, respectively, related to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters relating to our thrift operation, which we discontinued in 1994. 13 Table of Contents Homebuilding Our Homebuilding segment consists of the following operations: Domestic Homebuilding We conduct our Domestic Homebuilding operations in 44 markets located throughout 27 states. Domestic Homebuilding offers a broad product line to meet the needs of the first time, first and second move up, and active adult homebuyers. International Homebuilding We conduct our International Homebuilding operations through subsidiaries of Pulte International Corporation (International) in Mexico, Puerto Rico and Argentina. International Homebuilding product offerings focus on the demand of first time buyers and middle to upper income consumer groups. We are currently in the process of evaluating various long term strategic alternatives with regard to our International operations. Certain operating data relating to our homebuilding operations are as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Homebuilding settlement revenues: Domestic $ 8,482,341 $ 6,991,614 $ 5,145,526 International 228,137 196,074 35,169 Total $ 8,710,478 $ 7,187,688 $ 5,180,695 Homebuilding settlement units: Domestic 32,693 28,903 22,915 International 7,120 6,525 221 Total 39,813 35,428 23,136 Note: Homebuilding revenues of affiliates, not included in the table above, for the years ended December 31, 2003 through 2001 were $32,511, $40,723, and $180,621, respectively. Homebuilding unit settlements of affiliates, not included in the table above, for the years ended December 31, 2003 through 2001 were 149, 1,022, and 7,258, respectively. Domestic Homebuilding The Domestic Homebuilding operations represent our core business. We conduct our operations in 44 markets, located throughout 27 states, presented geographically as follows: Northeast: Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Virginia Southeast: Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee Midwest: Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio Central: Colorado, Texas, New Mexico West: Arizona, California, Nevada The greater Phoenix market accounted for 11% of Domestic Homebuilding settlement revenues, 12% of settlement units and 14% of net new orders in 2003. The Las Vegas market accounted for 10% of net new orders in 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the greater Phoenix market accounted for 10% of Domestic Homebuilding settlement revenues, 11% of settlement units and 11% of net new orders. No other individual markets represented more than 10% of total Domestic Homebuilding settlement revenues, settlement units or net new orders during the three years ended December 31, 2003. 14 Table of Contents Homebuilding (continued) Domestic Homebuilding (continued) The following table presents selected unit information for our Domestic Homebuilding operations: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Unit settlements: Northeast 2,692 2,440 2,014 Southeast 8,234 8,271 8,126 Midwest 4,936 4,458 3,288 Central 5,283 4,588 3,982 West 11,548 9,146 5,505 32,693 28,903 22,915 Net new orders units (a): Northeast 3,098 2,738 1,905 Southeast 9,021 8,651 8,111 Midwest 4,736 4,684 3,515 Central 5,125 4,590 3,817 West 13,009 10,167 4,815 34,989 30,830 22,163 Net new orders dollars ($000s omitted) (a) $ 9,555,000 $ 7,731,000 $ 4,855,000 Backlog at December 31 units: Northeast 1,535 1,129 831 Southeast 3,726 2,939 2,559 Midwest 1,401 1,601 1,375 Central 1,156 905 903 West 6,134 4,031 3,010 13,952 10,605 8,678 Backlog at December 31 dollars ($000s omitted) $ 4,147,000 $ 2,857,000 $ 2,118,000 (a) Net new orders for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2001, do not include 1,051 units and 3,953 units, respectively, of acquired backlog and related dollars. Unit settlements in 2003 reached a record high, increasing 13% to 32,693 units. The increase in 2003 can be attributed to continued strong demand for new housing and an increase in the active communities to 535 from 460. Unit settlements in 2002 increased 26% to 28,903 units, principally from the inclusion of a full year of Del Webb operations combined with strong sales in the Midwest. The average selling price for our homes increased from $225,000 in 2001 to $242,000 in 2002 and to $259,000 in the current year. Changes in average selling price reflect a number of factors, including price increases, the mix of product closed during a period and the number of options purchased by customers. Both 2003 and 2002 benefited from increased product prices and improved product mix. Ending backlog, which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed, climbed 32% to 13,952 homes. The dollar value of our ending backlog was up 45% to $4.1 billion at December 31, 2003. Unit and dollar backlog at December 31, 2002, increased 22% and 35%, respectively, to 10,605 homes valued at $2.9 billion. Overall, strong demand supported by a favorable interest rate environment and an increase in the number of active communities drove increased order activity and record levels of backlog. 15 Table of Contents Homebuilding (continued) Domestic Homebuilding (continued) The following table presents a summary of pre tax income for our Domestic Homebuilding operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Home sale revenue (settlements) $ 8,482,341 $ 6,991,614 $ 5,145,526 Land sale revenue 219,320 176,301 129,134 Home cost of sales* (6,731,834 ) (5,638,162 ) (4,163,065 ) Land cost of sales (153,415 ) (123,306 ) (97,941 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (820,951 ) (664,469 ) (482,128 ) Other income (expense), net 3,361 (22,968 ) (16,851 ) Pre tax income $ 998,822 $ 719,010 $ 514,675 Average sales price $ 259 $ 242 $ 225 * Domestic homebuilding interest expense, which represents the amortization of capitalized interest, has been reclassified to home cost of sales. Gross profit margins from home sales in 2003 increased 120 basis points over 2002 to 20.6%. Gross profit margins in 2002 increased 30 basis points to 19.4%. Factors that contributed to this favorable trend include strong customer demand, positive home pricing, the benefits of leverage buy purchasing activities and effective production and inventory management. In addition, 2001 gross profit margins were negatively impacted 20 basis points as a result of purchase accounting adjustments. Land sales increased in each of the prior three years, demonstrating our competency in purchasing, developing and entitling certain land positions for sale primarily to other homebuilders, as well as to retail and commercial establishments. Revenues and their related gains/losses may vary significantly between periods, depending on the timing of such sales. We continue to rationalize certain existing land positions to ensure the most effective use of invested capital. Included in other assets is approximately $251.2 million in land held for disposition as of December 31, 2003, as compared to $218.8 million in the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2003, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of home settlement revenues, increased 20 basis points to 9.7% after increasing 10 basis points to 9.5% in 2002. The increase in 2003 is principally attributable to costs associated with the realignment of our field operations and organizations to meet the challenge and opportunity for future growth. Higher startup costs for new communities and increased compensation related costs partially offset by a reduction in costs associated with the Del Webb operations contributed to the change in 2002. Other income (expense), net totaled income of $3.4 million in 2003 compared to expense of $23.0 million in 2002. This favorable change was principally a result of equity earnings from two Nevada based joint ventures, totaling $28.5 million, related to the sale of commercial and residential properties. Other expense, net of $16.9 million in 2001 benefited from income from certain non operating investments totaling $4.2 million. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, our Domestic Homebuilding operations controlled approximately 256,900 and 176,800 lots, respectively. Approximately 120,400 and 84,300 lots were owned, and approximately 66,000 and 43,800 lots were under option agreements approved for purchase at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In addition, there were approximately 70,500 lots under option agreements at December 31, 2003, pending approval, that are under review and evaluation for future use by our Domestic Homebuilding operations. This compared to 48,700 lots at December 31, 2002. The total purchase price applicable to approved land under option for use by our homebuilding operations at future dates approximated $2.6 billion at December 31, 2003. In addition, total purchase price applicable to land under option pending approval was valued at $2.1 billion at December 31, 2003. Land option agreements, which may be cancelled at our discretion, may extend over several years and are secured by deposits totaling $99.0 million, which are generally non refundable. 16 Table of Contents Homebuilding (continued) International Homebuilding Our International Homebuilding operations are primarily conducted through subsidiaries of International in Mexico, Puerto Rico and Argentina. Effective January 1, 2002, we reorganized the structure of our operations within Mexico to create a single company, Pulte Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V. , which ranks as one of the largest builders in the country. Prior to the reorganization, these operations were conducted primarily through five joint ventures throughout Mexico. Under the new ownership structure, which combines the largest of these entities, we own 63.8% of Pulte Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V. and have consolidated Pulte Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V. into our financial statements. Results for 2002 include joint venture operations for one month and operations as a consolidated entity for eleven months, as the operations in Mexico report on a one month lag. We are currently in the process of evaluating various long term strategic alternatives with regard to our International operations. The following table presents selected financial data for our International Homebuilding operations for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 228,137 $ 196,074 $ 35,169 Cost of sales (183,271 ) (157,056 ) (30,937 ) Selling, general and administrative expense (42,126 ) (35,029 ) (11,820 ) Other income (expense), net (1,485 ) (1,610 ) 66 Minority interest (1,382 ) (1,801 ) Equity in income of joint ventures 3,466 4,479 5,138 Pre tax income (loss) $ 3,339 $ 5,057 $ (2,384 ) Unit settlements: 7,120 6,525 221 Note: Homebuilding unit settlements of affiliates, not included in the table above, for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 were 149, 1,022, and 7,258, respectively. International revenues and unit settlements for 2003 benefited from a full year of results from our operations in Mexico as well as increased sales in both Argentina and Puerto Rico. Our Mexico operations had revenues of $172.3 million and unit settlements of 6,777 for the year ended December 31, 2003. Increased revenues and settlements in 2002 were due to consolidation of the operations in Mexico for eleven months of 2002, a full year of closings in Argentina, which recorded its first closing in June of 2001, partially offset by a decline in Puerto Rico. Our operations in Mexico contributed revenues of $158.1 million and unit settlements of 6,271 units in 2002. Gross profit margins from home sales declined 20 basis points to 19.7% in 2003 compared to 2002, as favorable product and geographic mix shifts in Mexico were offset by less favorable product mix shifts in Puerto Rico and unfavorable sales pace in Argentina. The consolidation of Mexico had a positive effect on 2002 gross margins, increasing to 19.9% from 12.0% in 2001. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue increased by 60 basis points to 18.5% in 2003 from 17.9% in 2002. This increase was driven by additional costs incurred reorganizing our operations in Mexico in an effort to enhance future profitability. Aggressive marketing efforts in Argentina, coupled with limited reorganization costs and a stronger peso, also contributed to the increase. Our operations in Argentina and Mexico are affected by fluctuations in currency rates for those countries. Transaction gains and losses for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, classified as other income (expense), net, were not significant. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, we recorded a foreign currency translation gain of $1.9 million and a loss of $12.8 million, respectively, for Argentina and a translation loss of $5.9 million and a gain of $8.6 million for Mexico, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet. At December 31, 2003, our investment in Argentina and Mexico, net of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments, approximated $13.2 million and $65.8 million, respectively. 17 Table of Contents Financial Services We conduct our financial services business, which includes mortgage and title operations, through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries. We sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts. Due to the short period of time the servicing rights are held, generally less than four months, we do not amortize the servicing asset. Since the servicing rights are recorded based on the value in the servicing sales contracts, there are no impairment issues related to these assets. We also originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various credit arrangements, and then sell such mortgage loans to outside investors. The following table presents mortgage origination data for our Financial Services operations: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Total originations: Loans 28,655 23,074 19,018 Principal ($000s omitted) $ 4,989,500 $ 3,771,000 $ 2,937,100 Originations for Pulte customers: Loans 23,864 19,537 15,402 Principal ($000s omitted) $ 4,179,100 $ 3,176,500 $ 2,385,500 Mortgage origination unit and principal volume for the year ended December 31, 2003, increased 24% and 32%, respectively, over 2002. This growth can be attributed to an increase in the capture rate of 510 basis points to 82.7% combined with the volume increases experienced in our Homebuilding business and an increase in average loan size. Our capture rate represents loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percent of total loan opportunities, excluding cash settlements, from our homebuilding business. Mortgage origination principal volume in 2002 increased 28% over 2001, due to an increase in the capture rate of 390 basis points to 77.6% and the inclusion of Del Webb mortgage operations for a full year. Origination unit volume increased 21% due to the same factors. Our home buying customers continue to account for the majority of total loan production representing 83% of total Pulte Mortgage unit production for 2003, compared with 85% in 2002 and 81% in 2001. Refinancings represented 8% of total loan production in 2003 and 2002, and 10% during 2001. At December 31, 2003, loan application backlog increased 57% to $2.2 billion as compared to $1.4 billion and $0.8 billion at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2003, increased 3% to $68.8 million, as a result of increased volume, partially offset by the impact of a less favorable interest rate environment for selling loans during the last six months of the year and an increase in training, systems, and facilities costs incurred in anticipation of the projected growth of the business. Gains from the sale of mortgages increased $2.0 million, or 3%, from the same period in 2002. As compared with 2002, net interest income increased $3.8 million to $15.1 million during 2003 due to increased production. Income from our title operations was $13.5 million in 2003, an increase of 11% over 2002. Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2002, increased 81% to $66.7 million, as a result of increased volume, a favorable interest rate environment, effective leverage of overhead costs and the inclusion of Del Webb mortgage operations for a full year. Gains from the sale of mortgages increased $20.4 million, or 49%, from the same period in 2001. As compared with 2001, net interest income increased $6.3 million to $11.3 million during 2002 due to increased production and a steeper yield curve as a result of the drop in interest rates during 2002. Title income grew 42% contributing $12.2 million to pre tax income for the year. We hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed mortgage loans with derivative financial instruments. For the year ended December 31, 2003, we did not recognize any net gains or losses related to an ineffective portion of the hedging instrument. We also did not recognize any gains or losses during 2003, for cash flow hedges that were discontinued because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur. At December 31, 2003, we expect to reclassify $0.2 million, net of taxes, of net losses on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next twelve months from sales of closed mortgage loans. 18 Table of Contents Corporate Corporate is a non operating segment that supports the operations of our subsidiaries by acting as the internal source of financing, developing and implementing strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies, and providing the necessary administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity listed on the New York Stock Exchange. As a result, the corporate segments operating results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve. The following table presents this segments results of operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Net interest expense $ 39,364 $ 38,214 $ 34,261 Other corporate expenses, net 35,987 23,754 23,191 Loss before income taxes $ 75,351 $ 61,968 $ 57,452 Interest expense, net of interest capitalized into inventory, increased 3% to $39.4 million in 2003 and 12% to $38.2 million in 2002. This trend is a result of an increase in debt levels necessary to support our growth. Interest incurred for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, excluding interest incurred by our financial services operations, was approximately $179.0 million, $162.5 million and $116.9 million, respectively. Other corporate expense, net in 2003 increased $12.2 million principally as a result of higher compensation related costs. Over the two year period ended December 31, 2002, other corporate expenses, net were relatively flat, as higher compensation related costs were offset by income from the sale and adjustment to fair value of various non operating parcels of commercial land held for sale. Interest capitalized into inventory is charged to home cost of sales based on the cyclical timing of our unit settlements, over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. Interest in inventory, has increased primarily as a result of higher levels of indebtedness and the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Information related to Corporate interest capitalized into inventory is as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Interest in inventory at beginning of year $ 142,984 $ 68,595 $ 24,202 Interest capitalized 136,308 123,086 80,399 Interest expensed (78,708 ) (48,697 ) (36,006 ) Interest in inventory at end of year $ 200,584 $ 142,984 $ 68,595 Discontinued Operations During the third quarter of 2003 and 2002, we recorded non cash, after tax gains of $7.9 million and $10.0 million, respectively, related to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters relating to our thrift operation, First Heights Bank, fsb (First Heights), which we discontinued in 1994. In September 2003, the United States Court of Federal Claims issued final judgment that Pulte Homes, Inc., Pulte Diversified Companies, Inc. and First Heights (collectively, the Pulte Parties) had been damaged by approximately $48.7 million as a result of the United States governments breach of contract with them. The final judgment follows the Courts August 17, 2001 ruling that the United States breached the contract related to the Pulte Parties 1988 acquisition of five savings and loan associations by enacting Section 13224 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. The United States government and the Pulte Parties filed Notices of Appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in October 2003. Accordingly, any gain related to this litigation will be recognized only upon final resolution. 19 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 totaled $301.8 million. The increase in net income was offset by significant investments in land necessary to support the continued growth of the business. Net cash used in investing activities was $34.1 million for 2003. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003, was $128.9 million, reflecting proceeds from the $300 million senior notes issued in February and the $400 million senior notes issued in May and proceeds from employee stock option exercises, offset by the repayment of debt, dividends paid and stock repurchases. Our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2002, was $148.8 million. The increase in net income was aided by the realization of certain tax benefits and an increase in accrued liabilities, while inventories continued to build to support the growth of the business. Net cash provided by investing activities was $21.5 million for 2002. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002, was $374.0 million, reflecting proceeds from the $300 million senior notes issued in June 2002, proceeds from borrowings under our various credit facilities and proceeds from employee stock option exercises, offset by the repayment of debt, dividends paid and stock repurchases. We finance our homebuilding land acquisitions, development and construction activities from internally generated funds and existing credit agreements. Effective October 1, 2003, we replaced our $570 million revolving credit facility with an $850 million facility that includes the capacity to issue letters of credit up to $500 million. This new credit facility expires October 1, 2008. We had no borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility at December 31, 2003. Pulte Mortgage provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available pursuant to various committed and uncommitted credit arrangements. Pulte Mortgage has committed credit arrangements of $860 million comprised of a $310 million bank revolving credit facility and a $550 million annual asset backed commercial paper program. There were approximately $479.3 million of borrowings outstanding under existing Pulte Mortgage arrangements at December 31, 2003. Mortgage loans originated by Pulte Mortgage are subsequently sold to outside investors. We anticipate that there will be adequate mortgage financing available for purchasers of our homes. In February 2003, we sold $300 million of 6.25% unsecured senior notes, due 2013. Proceeds from this issuance were used to retire our $175 million 9.5% senior notes that matured on April 1, 2003 and redeem the remaining outstanding principal balance of approximately $155 million of Del Webbs $200 million 9.375% senior subordinated notes due 2009 that were called for redemption in March at a price equal to 104.688% of the principal amount. In May 2003, we sold $400 million of 6.375% unsecured senior notes, due 2033. Proceeds from this issuance were used for general corporate purposes and to retire our $100 million 7% senior notes that matured on December 15, 2003. In December 2003, we increased our dividend 150% to $.05 per share from $.02 per share. Pursuant to our $100 million share repurchase program, we repurchased 790,800 common shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $18.2 million during 2003 and 200,000 common shares for approximately $4.3 million in 2002. At December 31, 2003, we had remaining authorization to purchase common stock aggregating $77.5 million. Our income tax liability and related effective tax rate are affected by a number of factors. In 2003, our effective tax rate was 38.0% compared to 39.0% in 2002 and 38.5% in 2001. The reduction in the effective tax rate for 2003 is principally due to a lower expected effective state income tax rate for 2003 and the shareholders approval of our new Senior Management Annual Incentive Plan, which will allow for full tax deductibility of Plan payments under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Service Code. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2004 will be approximately 38%. At December 31, 2003, we had cash and equivalents of $404.1 million, $2.1 billion of unsecured senior notes and $77.3 million of unsecured senior subordinated notes. Other financing includes limited recourse collateralized financing totaling $83.3 million. Sources of our working capital at December 31, 2003, include cash and equivalents, our $850 million committed unsecured revolving credit facility and Pulte Mortgages $860 million revolving credit facilities. Our debt to total capitalization, excluding our collateralized debt, was 38.4% as of December 31, 2003, and 33.6% net of cash and equivalents. We expect to maintain our net debt to total capitalization at or below the 40% level. In January 2004, we sold $500 million of 5.25% senior notes, due 2014. Proceeds from the sale will be used to retire the Del Webb 10.25% subordinated debentures called for redemption and for general corporate purposes including continued investment in our business. 20 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Inflation We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation also increases our financing, labor and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices. To date, inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003: Payments Due by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 After 2008 Contractual obligations: Long term debt (a) $ 4,394,051 $ 346,369 $ 403,778 $ 269,652 $ 3,374,252 Capital lease obligations Operating lease obligations 126,403 32,590 44,057 26,355 23,401 Purchase obligations Other long term liabilities (b) 91,223 32,849 50,806 5,314 2,254 Total contractual obligations $ 4,611,677 $ 411,808 $ 498,641 $ 301,321 $ 3,399,907 (a) Represents our senior notes and subordinated notes and related interest payments (b) Represents our limited recourse collateralized financing arrangements and related interest payments The following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2003: Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 After 2008 Other commercial commitments: Guarantor revolving credit facilities (a) $ 850,000 $ $ $ 850,000 $ Non guarantor revolving credit facilities 860,000 860,000 Other credit facilities 3,000 3,000 Standby letters of credit (b) 57,844 56,890 954 Total commercial commitments $ 1,770,844 $ 59,890 $ 860,954 $ 850,000 $ (a) Includes capacity to issue up to $500 million in standby letters of credit of which $157.4 million was outstanding at December 31, 2003. (b) Excludes standby letters of credit issued under the Guarantor revolving credit facilities. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We use standby letters of credit and performance bonds to guarantee our performance under various contracts, principally in connection with the development of our projects. The expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related projects. If the obligations related to a project are ongoing, annual extensions of the letters of credit are typically granted on a year to year basis. At December 31, 2003, we had outstanding letters of credit of $215.2 million. Performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These bonds, which approximated $1.2 billion at December 31, 2003, are typically outstanding over a period that approximates 3 5 years. We do not believe that we will be required to draw upon any such letters of credit or performance bonds. 21 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements (continued) In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land option or option type agreements in order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future. At December 31, 2003, these agreements totaled approximately $4.7 billion. Pursuant to these land option agreements, we provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future, usually at predetermined prices. If the entity holding the land under option is a variable interest entity, our deposit represents a variable interest in that entity. At December 31, 2003, we consolidated certain variable interest entities with assets totaling $73.3 million. We currently do not have any non consolidated special purpose entity arrangements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements, giving due regard to materiality. The development and selection of the following critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Revenue recognition Homebuilding Homebuilding revenues are recorded when the sales of homes are completed and ownership has transferred to the customer. Unfunded settlements are deposits in transit on homes for which the sale was completed. We do not engage in arrangements whereby we have ongoing relationships with our homebuyers that require us to repurchase our homes or provide homebuyers with the right of return. Financial Services Mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors. Servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance and are credited to income when the related mortgage payments are received. Loan origination fees, commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred as an adjustment to the cost of the related mortgage loan until such loan is sold. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold. Interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold. Inventory valuation Our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated costs or net realizable value. Included in inventories are all direct development costs. Inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated cost, unless they are determined to be impaired, in which case these inventories are measured at fair value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory adjustments may be required. We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories. Interest capitalized each quarter is identified as a separate layer in our capitalized interest balance sheet pool. Each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development. Interest expense is allocated to the quarters over the amortization period based on the historical relationship of unit settlements in a quarter compared to annual unit settlements. This period increased in 2001, due to the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle, and could change in the future as the mix of communities change. Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis. Under the specific identification basis, cost of sales includes the construction cost of the home, an average lot cost by project based on land acquisition and development costs, and closing costs and commissions. Construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home, plus an accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid, based on an analysis of budgeted construction cost. This accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared to the amount accrued, and adjustments are made if needed. Total project land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared to actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete. Adjustments to estimated total project land acquisition and development costs for the project affect the amount of future lots costed. 22 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Residential mortgage loans available for sale Residential mortgage loans available for sale are stated at the lower of aggregate cost or market value. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold. We hedge our residential mortgage loans available for sale. Gains and losses from closed commitments and futures contracts are matched against the related gains and losses on the sale of mortgage loans. Goodwill and intangible assets We have identified significant intangible assets and generated significant goodwill, most recently as a result of the Del Webb merger in 2001. Intangible assets, primarily trademarks and tradenames, were valued using proven valuation procedures and are amortized over their estimated useful life. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing. The carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use. If our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly, intangible assets and goodwill may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material. If we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets, long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment, we measure impairment based on one of three methods. For assets related to ongoing operations, we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists and then measure impairment using discounted cash flows. For assets to be disposed of, we assess the fair value of the asset based on current market conditions for similar assets. For goodwill, we assess fair value by measuring discounted cash flows of our reporting units and measure impairment as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded book value. The estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control. Changes in these estimates could result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and material charges to the results of operations. Allowance for warranties Home purchasers are provided with warranties against certain building defects. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary geographically. Most warranties cover different aspects of the homes construction and operating systems for a period of up to ten years. We estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim. We periodically assess the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. Although we have not made significant adjustments to the accrual in the past, actual warranty cost in the future could differ from our current estimate. Stock based compensation We currently have several stock based employee compensation plans. Effective January 1, 2003 we adopted the preferable fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. We selected the prospective method of adoption as permitted by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. Under the prospective method, we will recognize compensation expense based on the fair value provisions of SFAS No. 123 for all new stock option grants effective January 1, 2003. Grants made prior to January 1, 2003 will continue to be accounted for under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations. With the exception of certain variable stock option grants, no stock based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income for grants made prior to January 1, 2003, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of each option grant. The Black Scholes model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, risk free interest rates and expected lives. These assumptions reflect managements best estimates, but these items involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of our control. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, stock based compensation expense could have been materially impacted. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions in future periods, stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future periods. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our rate sensitive financing to the extent long term rates decline. The following tables set forth, as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, our rate sensitive financing obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value ($000s omitted). As of December 31, 2003 for the Years ended December 31, There Fair 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 after Total Value Rate sensitive liabilities: Fixed interest rate debt: Senior notes and subordinated notes $ 185,503 $ 125,000 $ $ $ $ 1,848,563 $ 2,159,066 $ 2,387,945 Average interest rate 9.12 % 7.0 % 7.29 % 7.45 % Limited recourse collateralized financing $ 29,259 $ 33,865 $ 13,267 $ 2,367 $ 2,354 $ 2,143 $ 83,255 $ 83,255 Average interest rate 2.52 % 6.00 % 3.50 % 5.09 % 5.24 % 4.78 % 4.31 % As of December 31, 2002 for the Years ended December 31, There Fair 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 after Total Value Rate sensitive liabilities: Fixed interest rate debt: Senior notes and subordinated notes $ 275,000 $ 112,000 $ 125,000 $ $ $ 1,395,976 $ 1,907,976 $ 2,006,173 Average interest rate 8.59 % 8.38 % 7.3 % 8.46 % 8.23 % Limited recourse collateralized financing $ 59,563 $ 41,528 $ 31,131 $ 9,128 $ 1,350 $ 2,826 $ 145,526 $ 145,526 Average interest rate 5.27 % 5.53 % 6.12 % 2.16 % 4.00 % 4.00 % 5.30 % Pulte Mortgage, operating as a mortgage banker, is also subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed upon terms (i.e., commit to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2003 and 2002, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float. We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to the Federal Funds rate and (ii) hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments. These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in long term mortgage rates of plus 50, 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results. Our aggregate net investments exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk include our operations in Mexico which approximated $65.8 million, our mortgage banking joint venture investment in Mexico which approximated $17.5 million and our operations in Argentina which approximated $13.2 million. 24 Table of Contents SPECIAL NOTES CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS As a cautionary note, except for the historical information contained herein, certain matters discussed in Item 7., Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
