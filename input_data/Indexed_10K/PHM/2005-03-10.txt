ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview A summary of our operating results by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 is as follows ($000s omitted, except per share data): Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Pre tax income (loss): Homebuilding $ 1,643,793 $ 1,005,124 $ 724,369 Financial Services 47,429 68,846 66,723 Corporate (90,685 ) (75,351 ) (61,968 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes 1,600,537 998,619 729,124 Income taxes 602,529 379,376 284,339 Income from continuing operations 998,008 619,243 444,785 Income (loss) from discontinued operations (11,467 ) 5,391 8,860 Net income $ 986,541 $ 624,634 $ 453,645 Per share data assuming dilution: Income from continuing operations $ 7.67 $ 4.93 $ 3.60 Income (loss) from discontinued operations (.09 ) .04 .07 Net income $ 7.58 $ 4.97 $ 3.67 Key financial highlights and events for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 are as follows: Homebuilding Operations Continued strong demand for new homes in many of our markets, market share gains, geographic and product mix shifts, average unit selling price increases and benefits from the ongoing initiatives to simplify processes and leverage construction costs throughout the operations contributed to increases in pre tax income of our homebuilding business segment. Pre tax income increased 64% for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared with the same period in the prior year. Pre tax income increased 39% in 2003, compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. Domestic homebuilding settlement gross margin percentages were up approximately 200 basis points to 22.6% for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 120 basis points to 20.6% for the year ended December 31, 2003, respectively, compared with the same periods in the prior years. Units in backlog increased to a record 15,916 units, valued at $5.2 billion at December 31, 2004, compared with 13,952 units, valued at $4.1 billion at December 31, 2003. There were 10,605 units in backlog at December 31, 2002 valued at $2.9 billion. The increase in backlog is primarily attributed to continued strong demand for new homes in many of our markets. During the third quarter of 2004, we were impacted by hurricanes in the southeastern United States. In addition, during October 2004, we lowered pricing in Las Vegas to better align pricing in our communities with the market. In January 2005, we sold all of our Argentina operations. At December 31, 2004, the Argentina operations have been classified as held for sale and presented as discontinued operations. 13 Table of Contents Overview (continued) Financial Services Operations Mortgage origination units, origination principal and our capture rate increased during 2004 compared with 2003, and during 2003 compared with 2002. Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2004 decreased 31% compared with 2003 due to a shift in our product mix, starting in the second half of 2003, toward adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) versus fixed rate mortgages due to changes in customer mortgage product preference. Pre tax income of our financial services business segment increased 3% from 2002 in 2003, driven by an increase in loan originations and a higher capture rate tempered by product mix changes and a less favorable interest rate environment during the last half of the year. Corporate Pre tax loss of our non operating Corporate segment increased 20% in 2004 to $90.7 million and in 2003, pre tax loss increased 22% from 2002. During 2004, net interest expense increased due to higher debt levels as a result of our growth. Other corporate expenses, net in 2004 were impacted by increased charitable contributions expense. In addition, income recognized during 2003 and 2002 from the sale and adjustment to fair value of various non operating parcels of commercial land held for sale did not recur in 2004, resulting in higher net expense. During 2003, other corporate expenses, net increased due principally to higher compensation related costs. Homebuilding Operations Our Homebuilding segment consists of the following operations: Domestic Homebuilding We conduct our Domestic Homebuilding operations in 45 markets located throughout 27 states. Domestic Homebuilding offers a broad product line to meet the needs of the first time, first and second move up, and active adult homebuyers. International Homebuilding We conduct our International Homebuilding operations through subsidiaries of International Corporation (International) in Mexico and Puerto Rico. International focuses on the demand of first time buyers and middle to upper income consumer groups. We are currently in the process of evaluating various long term strategic alternatives with regard to our International operations. Certain operating data relating to our homebuilding operations are as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Homebuilding settlement revenues: Domestic $ 11,094,617 $ 8,482,341 $ 6,991,614 International 196,740 191,125 170,195 Total $ 11,291,357 $ 8,673,466 $ 7,161,809 Homebuilding settlement units: Domestic 38,612 32,693 28,903 International 7,713 6,889 6,334 Total 46,325 39,582 35,237 Note: Homebuilding revenues of affiliates, not included in the table above, for the years ended December 31, 2004 through 2002 were $72,126, $32,511, and $40,723, respectively. Homebuilding unit settlements of affiliates, not included in the table above, for the years ended December 31, 2004 through 2002 were 250, 149, and 1,022, respectively. 14 Table of Contents Homebuilding Operations (continued) Domestic Homebuilding The Domestic Homebuilding operations represent our core business. We conduct our operations in 45 markets, located throughout 27 states, presented geographically as follows: Northeast: Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia Southeast: Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee Midwest: Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio Central: Colorado, New Mexico, Texas West: Arizona, California, Nevada The following table presents selected unit information for our Domestic Homebuilding operations: Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Unit settlements: Northeast 3,249 2,692 2,440 Southeast 9,362 8,234 8,271 Midwest 5,520 4,936 4,458 Central 6,066 5,283 4,588 West 14,415 11,548 9,146 38,612 32,693 28,903 Net new orders units (a): Northeast 3,197 3,098 2,738 Southeast 10,941 9,021 8,651 Midwest 5,396 4,736 4,684 Central 5,987 5,125 4,590 West 15,055 13,009 10,167 40,576 34,989 30,830 Net new orders dollars ($000s omitted) (a) $ 12,101,000 $ 9,555,000 $ 7,731,000 Backlog at December 31 units: Northeast 1,483 1,535 1,129 Southeast 5,305 3,726 2,939 Midwest 1,277 1,401 1,601 Central 1,077 1,156 905 West 6,774 6,134 4,031 15,916 13,952 10,605 Backlog at December 31 dollars ($000s omitted) $ 5,154,000 $ 4,147,000 $ 2,857,000 (a) Net new orders for the year ended December 31, 2003 do not include 1,051 units of acquired backlog and the related dollars. Continued strong demand for new homes, supported by a favorable interest rate environment, an increase in the number of active communities and market share expansion, drove increases in net new orders, unit settlements and unit backlog. Net new orders increased 16% to a record 40,576 units, for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net new orders for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased 13% to 34,989 units compared with 30,830 units for the year ended December 31, 2002 Home settlements set a record for the year ended December 31, 2004 at 38,612 units, an increase of 18% over the same period in 2003. In 2003, home settlements also reached a record high, increasing 13% to 32,693 units. Active communities increased from 460 in 2002 to 535 in 2003 to 626 in 2004. 15 Table of Contents Homebuilding Operations (continued) Changes in average selling price reflect a number of factors, including price increases, the mix of product closed during a period and the number of options purchased by customers. The average selling price for our homes increased 11% for the year ended December 31, 2004, to $287,000 compared with 2003 and increased to $259,000 in 2003 from $242,000 in 2002. The most significant price increases for both 2004 and 2003 were in the West, Northeast and Florida in the Southeast geographic areas. Ending backlog, which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed, grew to a record 15,916 units at December 31, 2004 compared with 13,952 units at December 31, 2003 and 10,605 units at December 31, 2002. The dollar value of our backlog was up 24% to $5.2 billion at December 31, 2004, compared with $4.1 billion at December 31, 2003 and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2002. Our most significant increases at December 31, 2004, occurred in the Southeast and West, which had unit increases of 42% and 10% respectively. At December 31, 2003, compared with December 31, 2002, strong demand resulted in significant increases in backlog for all geographic areas of the country except the Midwest. As announced on October 4, 2004, we lowered pricing in Las Vegas to better align pricing in our communities with pricing in the market. This action was in response to a period of slow sign ups and increased cancellation rates, which we attributed to our then above market pricing. However, since the price reductions took effect in October of 2004, our communities in Las Vegas have experienced improved traffic and new order activity. Las Vegas backlog totaled 883 units, with a value of $379 million at December 31, 2004, which represented 6% and 7% of total domestic homebuilding units and dollars, respectively. At December 31, 2003, Las Vegas backlog totaled 1,770 units, with a value of $627.6 million, which represented 13% and 15% of total domestic homebuilding units and dollars, respectively. During August and September of 2004 four hurricanes occurred throughout Florida and the southeastern areas of the United States. We sustained minimal property damage, but did experience delayed home settlements and incurred additional overhead expenses related to lost workdays and cleanup efforts undertaken as a result of the hurricanes. Further, the impact of the storms delayed the opening of several new communities and resulted in shortages of building materials in some Florida markets. The West contributed the largest portion of our operating activities, compared with the other geographic areas in the domestic homebuilding operations, representing 37% of unit net new orders and unit settlements for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared with 35% of settlements and 37% of net new orders during 2003, and 32% of settlements and 33% of net new orders during 2002. The West contributed the largest portion of our backlog, compared with other geographic areas in the domestic homebuilding operations, representing 43%, 44% and 38% of the total domestic homebuilding backlog units at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The following table presents markets that represent 10% or more of unit new orders, unit settlements, and settlement revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Unit net new orders: Phoenix 16 % 14 % 11 % Las Vegas * 10 % * Unit settlements: Phoenix 14 % 12 % 11 % Las Vegas * * * Settlement revenues: Phoenix 12 % 11 % 10 % Las Vegas 12 % * * * Represents less than 10%. 16 Table of Contents Homebuilding Operations (continued) At December 31, 2004 and 2003, our Domestic Homebuilding operations controlled approximately 343,400 and 256,900 lots, respectively. Approximately 158,000 and 120,400 lots were owned, and approximately 125,800 and 66,000 lots were under option agreements approved for purchase at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In addition, there were approximately 59,600 lots under option agreements at December 31, 2004, pending approval, that are under review and evaluation for future use by our Domestic Homebuilding operations. This compared to 70,500 lots at December 31, 2003. The total purchase price applicable to approved land under option for use by our homebuilding operations at future dates approximated $4.1 billion at December 31, 2004. In addition, total purchase price applicable to land under option pending approval was valued at $2.4 billion at December 31, 2004. Land option agreements, which may be cancelled at our discretion, may extend over several years and are secured by deposits and advanced costs totaling $327.6 million, which are generally non refundable. The following table presents a summary of pre tax income for our Domestic Homebuilding operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Home sale revenue (settlements) $ 11,094,617 $ 8,482,341 $ 6,991,614 Land sale revenue 305,391 219,320 176,301 Home cost of sales* (8,583,551 ) (6,731,834 ) (5,638,162 ) Land cost of sales (205,589 ) (153,415 ) (123,306 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (973,629 ) (820,951 ) (664,469 ) Equity income 47,203 29,045 2,265 Other income (expense), net (51,027 ) (25,684 ) (25,233 ) Pre tax income $ 1,633,415 $ 998,822 $ 719,010 Average sales price $ 287 $ 259 $ 242 * Domestic homebuilding interest expense, which represents the amortization of capitalized interest, is included as part of homebuilding cost of sales. Homebuilding gross profit margins from home sales in 2004 increased 200 basis points over 2003 to 22.6%, and in 2003 increased 120 basis points to 20.6% compared with 2002. The increases are due to strong consumer demand, positive home pricing, favorable shifts in product and geographic mix, the benefits of leverage buy purchasing activities and effective production and inventory management. We consider land acquisition one of our core competencies. We acquire land primarily for the construction of our homes for sale to homebuyers. We will often sell select parcels of land within or adjacent to our communities to retail and commercial establishments. We also will, on occasion, sell lots within our communities to other homebuilders. Gross profits from land sales were $99.8 million and $65.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, representing increases of $33.9 million and $12.9 million, respectively, from the previous years totals. Revenues and their related gains/losses may vary significantly between periods, depending on the timing of land sales. We continue to evaluate our existing land positions to ensure the most effective use of capital. Included in other assets is approximately $230.1 million in land held for disposition as of December 31, 2004, as compared to $251.2 million and $218.8 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2004, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of home settlement revenues, decreased 90 basis points to 8.8% compared with 2003 after increasing 20 basis points to 9.7% in 2003 compared with 2002. The improvement in 2004 can be attributed to greater leverage as a result of volume increases and the favorable pricing environment for our homes. The increase in 2003 is principally attributable to costs associated with the realignment of our field operations and organizations to meet the challenge and opportunity for future growth. Equity income for 2004 includes earnings from our 50% investment in a joint venture that supplies and installs basic building components and operating systems, acquired in January 2004, and two Nevada based joint ventures, related to the sale of commercial and residential properties. Equity income for 2003 primarily includes earnings from the two Nevada based joint ventures. Other income (expense), net includes the write off of deposits and pre acquisition costs resulting from decisions not to pursue certain land acquisitions and options, insurance related expenses and settlements and other non operating expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the increase in expense is due to larger write offs of deposit and pre acquisition costs, as we continue to evaluate potential land acquitions for the most effective use of capital. 17 Table of Contents Homebuilding Operations (continued) International Homebuilding Our International Homebuilding operations are primarily conducted through subsidiaries of International in Mexico and Puerto Rico. The following table presents selected financial data for our International Homebuilding operations for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 ($000s omitted)*: Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Revenues $ 196,740 $ 191,125 $ 170,195 Cost of sales (158,972 ) (152,445 ) (136,745 ) Selling, general and administrative expense (28,459 ) (34,259 ) (29,512 ) Other income (expense), net (2,362 ) (203 ) (1,257 ) Minority interest (3,242 ) (1,382 ) (1,801 ) Equity in income of joint ventures 6,673 3,466 4,479 Pre tax income $ 10,378 $ 6,302 $ 5,359 Unit settlements: 7,713 6,889 6,334 Note: Homebuilding unit settlements of affiliates, not included in the table above, for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 were 250, 149, and 1,022, respectively. * In January 2005, the Company sold all of its Argentina operations. At December 31, 2004, the Argentina operations have been classified as held for sale and presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements (see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). International unit settlements for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, increased 12% and 9%, respectively. International revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 increased 3% and 12%, respectively, over the prior year periods. Revenues increased for both years primarily due to increased unit closings in Mexico. Our operations in Puerto Rico have experienced decreased unit closings and revenue as more of our business there has shifted to joint venture affiliates. The higher proportion of unit settlements derived from Mexico, coupled with a higher percentage of those closings coming from economic housing, which is the lowest price point served in Mexico, had a negative impact on gross margins in 2004 compared with 2003. Gross margins decreased approximately 100 basis points to 19.2% for the year ended December 31, 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2003, gross margins were 20.2%, an increase of 50 basis points compared with 2002, due to favorable product and geographic mix shifts in Mexico. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue decreased by 340 basis points to 14.5% in 2004 from 17.9% in 2003 and 17.3% in 2002. The increase from 2002 to 2003 was driven primarily by reorganization costs incurred during the restructuring of our operations in Mexico in an effort to enhance future profitability while the improvement in 2004 reflects the benefits of the restructuring actions. Our operations in Mexico are affected by fluctuations in currency rates for that country. Transaction gains and losses for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, classified as other income (expense), net, were not significant. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, we recorded a foreign currency translation gain of $781 thousand and a loss of $5.9 million, respectively, for Mexico, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded a foreign currency translation gain of $8.6 million for Mexico. At December 31, 2004, our investment in Puerto Rico and Mexico, net of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments, approximated $28.8 million, and $72.2 million, respectively. 18 Table of Contents Financial Services Operations We conduct our financial services business, which includes mortgage and title operations, through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries. We sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts. Due to the short period of time the servicing rights are held, generally less than four months, we do not amortize the servicing asset. Since the servicing rights are recorded based on the value in the servicing sales contracts, there are no impairment issues related to these assets. We also originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various credit arrangements, and then sell such mortgage loans to outside investors. The following table presents mortgage origination data for our Financial Services operations: Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Total originations: Loans 35,232 28,655 23,074 Principal ($000s omitted) $ 6,739,200 $ 4,989,500 $ 3,771,000 Originations for Pulte customers: Loans 32,471 23,864 19,537 Principal ($000s omitted) $ 6,299,200 $ 4,179,100 $ 3,176,500 Pre tax income of our financial services operations was $47.4 million, $68.8 million and $66.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Mortgage origination unit and principal volume for the year ended December 31, 2004, increased 23% and 35%, respectively, over 2003. Mortgage origination unit and principal volume for the year ended December 31, 2003, increased 24% and 32%, respectively, over 2002. This growth can be attributed to increases in the capture rate of 510 basis points to 87.8% in 2004 and 510 basis points to 82.7% in 2003, combined with the volume increases experienced in our homebuilding business and an increase in average loan size. Our capture rate represents loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percent of total loan opportunities, excluding cash settlements, from our homebuilding business. Our domestic homebuilding customers continue to account for the majority of total loan production, representing 92% of Pulte Mortgage unit production for 2004, compared with 83% in 2003 and 85% in 2002. Adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) represented 43% of total funded origination dollars and 42% of total funded origination units for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared with 24% and 22%, respectively, in 2003 and 16% and 13%, respectively, in 2002. Refinancings represented 3% of total loan production in 2004, compared with 8% in both 2003 and 2002. At December 31, 2004, loan application backlog was $3.5 billion, compared with $2.2 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Pre tax income decreased 31% for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared with 2003, as increased volume was offset by changes in product mix to ARMs, which generally have a lower profit per loan than fixed rate products. The shift to ARMs is attributable to customer mortgage product preference. In addition, in 2004, 36% of total originations were brokered loans, which are less profitable to us, compared with 16% in 2003. Mortgage origination fees increased to $20.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared with $7.5 million in 2003, due to the increase in brokered loans. Gains from the sale of mortgages during 2004 decreased $14.1 million, or 22%, from $64.4 million in 2003, and net interest income decreased $5.5 million, to $9.7 million during 2004 as compared with $15.1 million in 2003. These decreases were due to the product mix shifts and an unfavorable interest rate environment in 2004 compared with 2003. Income from our title operations was $17.6 million in 2004, an increase of 30% over 2003. Our minority interest in Su Casita, a Mexican mortgage banking company, contributed income of $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared with $4.4 million in 2003. Selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2004, increased 41% to $57.5 million compared with 2003 due to increased origination volume. Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2003, increased 3% to $68.8 million, as a result of increased volume, partially offset by a less favorable interest rate environment for selling loans during the last six months of the year and an increase in training, systems, and facilities costs incurred in anticipation of the projected growth of the business. Gains from the sale of mortgages increased $2.0 million, or 3%, from the same period in 2002. As compared with 2002, net interest income increased $3.8 million to $15.1 million during 2003 due to increased production. Title income grew 11% contributing $13.5 million to pre tax income for the year. 19 Table of Contents Financial Services Operations (continued) We hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed mortgage loans with derivative financial instruments. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we did not recognize any material net gains or losses related to an ineffective portion of the hedging instrument. We also did not recognize any material net gains or losses during 2004 for cash flow hedges that were discontinued because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur. At December 31, 2004, we expect to reclassify $138 thousand, net of taxes, of net gains on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next twelve months from sales of closed mortgage loans. Corporate Corporate is a non operating segment that supports the operations of our subsidiaries by acting as the internal source of financing, developing and implementing strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies, and providing the necessary administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity listed on the New York Stock Exchange. As a result, the corporate segments operating results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve. The following table presents this segments results of operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Net interest expense $ 47,372 $ 39,364 $ 38,214 Other corporate expenses, net 43,313 35,987 23,754 Loss before income taxes $ 90,685 $ 75,351 $ 61,968 Interest expense, net of interest capitalized into inventory, increased 20% to $47.4 million in 2004 and 3% to $39.4 million in 2003. This trend is a result of an increase in debt levels necessary to support our growth. Interest incurred for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, excluding interest incurred by our financial services operations, was approximately $205.2 million, $179 million and $162.5 million, respectively. The increase in other corporate expenses, net for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared with the prior year was partially due to increased charitable contributions. Additionally, during 2003 and 2002, we recognized income from the sale and adjustment to fair value of various non operating parcels of commercial land held for sale. Other corporate expense, net in 2003 increased $12.2 million compared with 2002 principally as a result of higher compensation related costs. Interest capitalized into inventory is charged to home cost of sales based on the cyclical timing of our unit settlements, over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. Interest in inventory, has increased primarily as a result of higher levels of indebtedness and the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle. Information related to Corporate interest capitalized into inventory is as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Interest in inventory at beginning of year $ 200,584 $ 142,984 $ 68,595 Interest capitalized 156,056 136,308 123,086 Interest expensed (133,049 ) (78,708 ) (48,697 ) Interest in inventory at end of year $ 223,591 $ 200,584 $ 142,984 20 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations First Heights During the third quarter of 2004, 2003 and 2002, we recorded non cash, after tax gains of $10.8 million, $7.9 million and $10 million, respectively, related to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters relating to our thrift operation, First Heights Bank, fsb (First Heights), which we discontinued in 1994. In September 2003, the United States Court of Federal Claims issued final judgment that Pulte Homes, Inc., Pulte Diversified Companies, Inc. and First Heights (collectively, the Pulte Parties) had been damaged by approximately $48.7 million as a result of the United States governments breach of contract with them. The final judgment follows the Courts August 17, 2001 ruling that the United States breached the contract related to the Pulte Parties 1988 acquisition of five savings and loan associations by enacting Section 13224 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. The United States government and the Pulte Parties filed Notices of Appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in October 2003. Accordingly, any gain related to this litigation will be recognized only upon final resolution. Argentina In January 2005, we sold all of our Argentina operations to an Argentine company involved in residential and commercial real estate development. The disposition of these operations was the chosen action to improve our overall returns. At December 31, 2004, the Argentina operations have been classified as held for sale and presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. Previously, the Argentina operations were included in the Homebuilding segment. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, discontinued Argentine operations reported pre tax losses of $1.4 million, $1.9 million, and $200 thousand, respectively. In addition, we recognized a pre tax loss of $33.2 million ($20.6 million after tax) on the write down of the Argentina operations to fair value less costs to sell. Our operations in Argentina are affected by fluctuations in currency rates. At December 31, 2004, foreign currency translation losses of $25.1 million, which were previously recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet, were recognized in the income statement in connection with the classification of these operations as held for sale. These were included in the pre tax loss of $33.2 million on the write down to fair value. For the year ended December 31, 2003, we recorded a foreign currency translation gain of $1.9 million for Argentina, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet. Total assets to be disposed of at December 31, 2004 were $15.4 million, consisting primarily of cash and inventories. Total liabilities to be disposed of at December 31, 2004 were $13.7 million and consisted primarily of accounts payable and other accrued liabilities. 21 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources We finance our homebuilding land acquisitions, development and construction activities from internally generated funds and existing credit agreements. At December 31, 2004, we had cash and equivalents of $314.6 million and $2.9 billion of senior notes outstanding. Other financing included limited recourse collateralized financing totaling $81.9 million. Sources of our working capital include our cash and equivalents, our $1.31 billion committed unsecured revolving credit facility and Pulte Mortgages $940 million committed credit arrangements. Our debt to total capitalization, excluding our collateralized debt, was approximately 38.8% at December 31, 2004, and approximately 36% net of cash and equivalents. We routinely monitor current operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate the use of available financing sources, including securities offerings. Pulte Mortgage provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available pursuant to various committed and uncommitted credit arrangements. At December 31, 2004, Pulte Mortgage had committed credit arrangements of $940 million comprised of a $390 million bank revolving credit facility and a $550 million annual asset backed commercial paper program. Our income tax liability and related effective tax rate are affected by a number of factors. In 2004, our effective tax rate was 37.65% compared to 38% in 2003 and 39% in 2002. The reduction in the effective tax rate for 2004 was principally due to the favorable resolution of certain state tax matters. The reduction in the effective tax rate during 2003 was principally due to a lower than expected effective state income tax rate for 2003 and the shareholders approval of our new Senior Management Annual Incentive Plan, which allows full tax deductibility of Plan payments under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Service Code. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2005 will be approximately 38%. Our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2004, amounted to $698.3 million, compared with $331.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increases in net income for both years were offset primarily by significant investments in land necessary to support the continued growth of the business. Our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2002, was $158.8 million. The increase in net income was aided by the realization of certain tax benefits and an increase in accrued liabilities, while inventories continued to build to support the growth of the business. Cash used in investing activities was $198.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared with $4.3 million in the prior year. The change in net cash used in investing activities primarily relates to our investments in unconsolidated entities. During January 2004, we invested $35 million for a 50% ownership interest in an entity that supplies and installs basic building components and operating systems. During 2004, we invested approximately $117.8 million in three new joint ventures that develop and or sell land within the United States. Also, we contributed $44.2 million of additional capital contributions to and received $66.1 million in distributions from our unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2004. Further, we incurred approximately $75.2 million in capital expenditures to support the growth of our business. Net cash provided by investing activities was $12.1 million in 2002. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $809.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Cash inflows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 are primarily attributed to proceeds received from our $500 million, 5.25% senior notes issued in January 2004 and our $400 million, 4.875% senior notes issued in July 2004, and $44 million of cash received from the exercise of stock options. Cash outflows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily relate to the repayment of our $112 million, 8.375% senior notes in August 2004, redemption of the remaining $77 million of Del Webb 10.25% senior subordinated notes in February 2004, approximately $25.4 million of cash dividends paid to our shareholders, $44.9 million used to repay borrowings, and $14.7 million used to repurchase our common stock. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003, was $128.9 million, reflecting proceeds from the $300 million senior notes issued in February and the $400 million senior notes issued in May and proceeds from employee stock option exercises, offset by the repayment of debt, dividends paid and stock repurchases. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002, was $374 million, reflecting proceeds from the $300 million senior notes issued in June 2002, proceeds from borrowings under our various credit facilities and proceeds from employee stock option exercises, offset by the repayment of debt, dividends paid and stock repurchases. 22 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Our $125 million, 7.3% unsecured senior notes are due in 2005. We anticipate repaying these notes in 2005 by issuing new unsecured senior notes and or using cash provided by operations. In September 2004, we restructured and amended the 5 year unsecured revolving credit facility, increasing the borrowing availability from $850 million to $1.31 billion, extending the maturity date from September 30, 2008 to September 15, 2009, with pricing more favorable to the Company. The credit facility includes an uncommitted accordion feature, under which the credit facility may be increased to $1.5 billion. The Company has the capacity to issue letters of credit up to $750 million. Borrowing availability is reduced by the amount of letters of credit outstanding. The credit facility contains restrictive covenants, the most restrictive of which requires the Company not to exceed a debt to total capitalization ratio of 50% as defined in the agreement. We had no outstanding borrowings under this unsecured revolving credit facility at December 31, 2004. In September 2004, Pulte Mortgage amended its commercial paper conduit, which increased a sub limit for eligible collateral, eliminated the $50 million quarterly accordion feature, and made pricing more favorable to Pulte Mortgage. The commercial paper conduit is a $550 million committed line of credit. We had outstanding borrowings of $525 million under the commercial paper conduit at December 31, 2004. In July 2004, we expanded the capacity on Pulte Mortgages revolving credit facility from $355 million to $390 million. The revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants, the most restrictive of which requires Pulte Mortgage to maintain a minimum tangible net worth of $30 million and adjusted liabilities cannot exceed 12 times adjusted net worth. There were approximately $91.2 million of borrowings outstanding under Pulte Mortgages revolving credit facility at December 31, 2004. Mortgage loans originated by Pulte Mortgage are subsequently sold to outside investors. We anticipate that there will be adequate mortgage financing available for purchasers of our homes. In July 2004, we sold $400 million of 4.875% senior notes, which mature on July 15, 2009 and are guaranteed by Pulte Homes, Inc. and certain of its 100% owned subsidiaries. These notes are unsecured and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. Proceeds from this offering were used for the repayment of expiring notes due on August 15, 2004 of approximately $112 million and for general corporate purposes, including continued investment in our business. In January 2004, we sold $500 million of 5.25% senior notes, which mature on January 15, 2014 and are guaranteed by Pulte Homes, Inc. and certain of its 100% owned subsidiaries. These notes are unsecured and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. Proceeds from the sale were used to retire the $77 million outstanding Del Webb 10.25% senior subordinated notes and for general corporate purposes, including continued investment in our business. At December 31, 2004, we had $600 million remaining under our current mixed security shelf registration. Subsequent to December 31, 2004, we sold $350 million of 5.2% senior notes, which mature on February 15, 2015, and $300 million of 6% senior notes, which mature on February 15, 2035, which are guaranteed by Pulte Homes, Inc. and certain of its 100% owned subsidiaries. These notes are unsecured and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. Proceeds from the sale were used to repay the indebtedness of our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including continued investment in our business. At December 31, 2004, we had remaining authorization to purchase common stock aggregating $62.8 million, pursuant to our $100 million share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2004, we have repurchased a total of 1,256,400 shares for a total of $37.2 million. In December 2003, we increased our dividend 150% to $.05 per share from $.02 per share, effective for the fourth quarter of 2003. There was no change to our dividend rate during 2004. Inflation We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation also increases our financing, labor and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices. To date, inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. 23 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004: Payments Due by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 After 2009 Contractual obligations: Long term debt (a) $ 5,293,170 $ 314,556 $ 360,860 $ 760,860 $ 3,856,894 Capital lease obligations Operating lease obligations 214,240 46,337 70,964 53,318 43,621 Purchase obligations Other long term liabilities (b) 84,463 61,881 18,879 3,703 Total contractual obligations $ 5,591,873 $ 422,774 $ 450,703 $ 817,881 $ 3,900,515 (a) Represents our senior notes and subordinated notes and related interest payments (b) Represents our limited recourse collateralized financing arrangements and related interest payments The following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2004: Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 After 2009 Other commercial commitments: Guarantor revolving credit facilities (a) $ 1,310,000 $ $ $ 1,310,000 $ Non guarantor revolving credit facilities 940,000 940,000 Other credit facilities 5,050 5,050 Standby letters of credit (b) 40,268 13,417 26,851 Total commercial commitments $ 2,295,318 $ 18,467 $ 966,851 $ 1,310,000 $ (a) Includes capacity to issue up to $750 million in standby letters of credit of which $316.1 million was outstanding at December 31, 2004. (b) Excludes standby letters of credit issued under the Guarantor revolving credit facilities. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We use standby letters of credit and performance bonds to guarantee our performance under various contracts, principally in connection with the development of our projects. The expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related projects. If the obligations related to a project are ongoing, annual extensions of the letters of credit are typically granted on a year to year basis. At December 31, 2004, we had outstanding letters of credit of $356 million. Performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These bonds, which approximated $1.49 billion at December 31, 2004, are typically outstanding over a period that approximates 3 5 years. We do not believe that we will be required to draw upon any such letters of credit or performance bonds. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land option or option type agreements in order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future. At December 31, 2004, these agreements totaled approximately $6.5 billion. Pursuant to these land option agreements, we provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future, usually at predetermined prices. If the entity holding the land under option is a variable interest entity, our deposit represents a variable interest in that entity. At December 31, 2004, we consolidated certain variable interest entities with assets totaling $106.4 million. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, our unconsolidated joint ventures had outstanding debt of $58.1 million and $72.6 million, respectively. We have not guaranteed any of this outstanding indebtedness. 24 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these consolidated financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements, giving due regard to materiality. The development and selection of the following critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Revenue recognition Homebuilding Homebuilding revenues are recorded when the sales of homes are completed and ownership has transferred to the customer. Unfunded settlements are deposits in transit on homes for which the sale was completed. We do not engage in arrangements whereby we have ongoing relationships with our homebuyers that require us to repurchase our homes or provide homebuyers with the right of return. Financial Services Mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors. Servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance, or a contracted set fee in the case of certain sub servicing, and are credited to income when related mortgage payments are received. Loan origination fees, commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred as an adjustment to the cost of the related mortgage loan until such loan is sold. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold. Interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold. Inventory valuation Our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated costs or net realizable value. Included in inventories are all direct development costs. Inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated cost, unless they are determined to be impaired, in which case these inventories are measured at fair value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory adjustments may be required. We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories. Interest capitalized each quarter is identified as a separate layer in our capitalized interest balance sheet pool. Each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development. Interest expense is allocated to the quarters over the amortization period based on the cyclical timing of unit settlements. Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis. Under the specific identification basis, cost of sales includes the construction cost of the home, an average lot cost by project based on land acquisition and development costs, and closing costs and commissions. Construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home, plus an accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid, based on an analysis of budgeted construction cost. This accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared to the amount accrued, and adjustments are made if needed. Total project land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared to actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete. Adjustments to estimated total project land acquisition and development costs for the project affect the amount of future lots costed. 25 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Residential mortgage loans available for sale Residential mortgage loans available for sale are stated at the lower of aggregate cost or market value. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold. We hedge our residential mortgage loans available for sale. Gains and losses from closed commitments and futures contracts are matched against the related gains and losses on the sale of mortgage loans. Goodwill and intangible assets We have recorded certain intangible assets and goodwill, most recently as a result of the Del Webb merger in 2001. Intangible assets, primarily trademarks and tradenames, were valued using proven valuation procedures and are amortized over their estimated useful life. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing. The carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use. If our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly, intangible assets and goodwill may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material. If we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets, long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment, we measure impairment based on one of three methods. For assets related to ongoing operations, we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists and then measure impairment using discounted cash flows. For assets to be disposed of, we assess the fair value of the asset based on current market conditions for similar assets. For goodwill, we assess fair value by measuring discounted cash flows of our reporting units and measure impairment as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded book value. The estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control. Changes in these estimates could result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and material charges to the results of operations. Allowance for warranties Home purchasers are provided with warranties against certain building defects. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary geographically. Most warranties cover different aspects of the homes construction and operating systems for a period of up to ten years. We estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim. We periodically assess the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. Although we have not made significant adjustments to the accrual in the past, actual warranty cost in the future could differ from our current estimate. Insurance The Company has, and requires the majority of its subcontractors to have general liability and workers compensation insurance. These insurance policies protect the Company against a portion of its risk of loss from claims, subject to certain self insured retentions, deductibles, and other coverage limits. The Company reserves for costs to cover its self insured and deductible amount under those policies and for any costs of claims and lawsuits in excess of its coverage limits or not covered by such policies, based on an analysis of the Companys historical claims, which includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. The Companys total reserves for such items were $115.6 million and $81.1 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Expenses related to such claims were approximately $58.4 million, $40.9 million, and $25.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Stock based compensation We currently have several stock based employee compensation plans. Effective January 1, 2003 we adopted the preferable fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. We selected the prospective method of adoption as permitted by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. Under the prospective method, we recognize compensation expense on an accelerated basis over the vesting period based on the fair value provisions of SFAS No. 123. Grants made prior to January 1, 2003 continue to be accounted for under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations. With the exception of certain variable stock option grants, no stock based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income for grants made prior to January 1, 2003, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant. 26 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Stock based compensation (continued) We use the Black Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of each option grant. The Black Scholes model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, risk free interest rates and expected lives. These assumptions reflect managements best estimates, but these items involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of our control. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, stock based compensation expense could have been materially impacted. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions in future periods, stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future periods. On December 15, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, which amends SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. SFAS No. 123(R) requires that all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, be accounted for at fair value. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition. Under SFAS No. 123(R), we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments, the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption. We previously adopted the fair value based method of accounting for share based payments under SFAS No. 123 effective January 1, 2003 using the prospective method described in SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. Currently, we use the Black Scholes model to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees and we are considering the preferred lattice model. Because SFAS No. 123(R) must be applied not only to new awards but to previously granted awards that are not fully vested on the effective date, and because we adopted SFAS No. 123 using the prospective transition method (which applied only to awards granted, modified or settled after the adoption date), compensation cost for some previously granted awards that were not recognized under SFAS No. 123 will be recognized under SFAS No. 123(R). SFAS No. 123(R) also amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows, to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid. As originally issued, SFAS No. 95 required all income tax payments to be classified as operating cash outflows. This statement is effective for fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. We are still evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS No. 123(R). ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our rate sensitive financing to the extent long term rates decline. The following tables set forth, as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, our rate sensitive financing obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value ($000s omitted). As of December 31, 2004 for the Years ended December 31, There Fair 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 after Total Value Rate sensitive liabilities: Fixed interest rate debt: Senior notes and subordinated notes $ 125,000 $ $ $ $ 400,000 $ 2,348,563 $ 2,873,563 $ 3,124,413 Average interest rate 7.3 % 4.88 % 6.86 % 6.6 % Limited recourse collateralized financing $ 60,392 $ 13,309 $ 4,699 $ 2,350 $ 1,113 $ $ 81,863 $ 81,863 Average interest rate 1.48 % 1.97 % 4.17 % 5.25 % 5.25 % 1.87 % 27 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2003 for the Years ended December 31, There Fair 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 after Total Value Rate sensitive liabilities: Fixed interest rate debt: Senior notes and subordinated notes $ 185,503 $ 125,000 $ $ $ $ 1,848,563 $ 2,159,066 $ 2,387,945 Average interest rate 9.12 % 7.0 % 7.29 % 7.45 % Limited recourse collateralized financing $ 29,259 $ 33,865 $ 13,267 $ 2,367 $ 2,354 $ 2,143 $ 83,255 $ 83,255 Average interest rate 2.52 % 6.00 % 3.50 % 5.09 % 5.24 % 4.78 % 4.31 % Pulte Mortgage, operating as a mortgage banker, is also subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed upon terms (i.e., commit to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2004 and 2003, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float. We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to the Federal Funds rate and (ii) hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments. These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in long term mortgage rates of plus 50, 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results. At December 31, 2004, our aggregate net investments exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk include our operations in Mexico, which approximated $72.2 million, and our mortgage banking joint venture investment in Mexico, which approximated $21.1 million.
