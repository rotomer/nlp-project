ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview A summary of our operating results by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 is as follows ($000s omitted, except per share data): Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Pre tax income (loss): Homebuilding $ 2,298,822 $ 1,635,580 $ 1,000,513 Financial Services 70,586 47,429 68,846 Other non operating (92,394 ) (90,685 ) (75,351 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes 2,277,014 1,592,324 994,008 Income taxes 840,126 598,751 376,460 Income from continuing operations 1,436,888 993,573 617,548 Income (loss) from discontinued operations 55,025 (7,032 ) 7,086 Net income $ 1,491,913 $ 986,541 $ 624,634 Per share data assuming dilution: Income from continuing operations $ 5.47 $ 3.82 $ 2.46 Income (loss) from discontinued operations .21 (.03 ) .03 Net income $ 5.68 $ 3.79 $ 2.48 Key financial highlights and events for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 are as follows: Homebuilding Operations Continued strong demand for new homes in many of our markets, market share gains, geographic and product mix shifts, average unit selling price increases and benefits from the ongoing initiatives to simplify processes and leverage construction costs throughout the operations contributed to increases in pre tax income of our homebuilding business segment. Pre tax income increased 41% for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with the same period in the prior year. Pre tax income increased 63% in 2004, compared with the year ended December 31, 2003. Homebuilding settlement gross margin percentages were up approximately 80 basis points to 23.4% for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 200 basis points to 22.6% for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared with the same periods in the prior years. Units in backlog increased to 17,817 units, valued at $6.3 billion at December 31, 2005, compared with 15,916 units, valued at $5.2 billion at December 31, 2004. There were 13,952 units in backlog at December 31, 2003 valued at $4.1 billion. The increase in backlog is primarily attributed to continued strong demand for new homes in many of our markets. In December 2005, we sold substantially all of our Mexico homebuilding operations, as further described in Note 3 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. For 2005 and all prior periods reported, the Mexico operations have been presented as discontinued operations. In January 2005, we sold all of our Argentina operations, as further described in Note 3 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2004, the Argentina operations were classified as held for sale. For 2004 and 2003, the Argentina operations have been presented as discontinued operations. 17 Table of Contents Overview (continued) Financial Services Operations Mortgage origination units, origination principal and our capture rate increased during 2005, 2004 and 2003. Pre tax income of our financial services business segment increased 49% from 2005 to 2004, due to a more favorable product mix to funded, from non funded, originations. Pre tax income for the year ended December 31, 2004 decreased 31% compared with 2003 due to a shift in our product mix, starting in the second half of 2003, toward adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) versus fixed rate mortgages due to changes in customer mortgage product preference. Other non operating Other non operating expenses, net consists of income and expenses related to Corporate services provided to our subsidiaries. During 2005, net interest expense decreased due to an increase in the amount of interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory, as well as an increase in interest income. Other corporate expenses, net increased during 2005 as a result of higher compensation related costs. During 2004, net interest expense increased due to higher debt levels as a result of our growth. Other expenses, net in 2004 were impacted by increased charitable contributions expense. In addition, income recognized during 2003 from the sale and adjustment to fair value of various non operating parcels of commercial land held for sale did not recur in 2004, resulting in higher net expense. 18 Table of Contents Homebuilding Operations The Homebuilding operations represent our core business. Homebuilding offers a broad product line to meet the needs of the first time, first and second move up, and active adult homebuyers. We conduct our operations in 54 markets, located throughout 27 states, presented geographically as follows: Northeast: Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia Southeast: Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee Midwest: Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, Minnesota, Ohio Central: Colorado, New Mexico, Texas West: Arizona, California, Nevada The following table presents selected information for our Homebuilding operations: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Homebuilding settlement revenues $ 14,370,667 $ 11,094,617 $ 8,482,341 Unit settlements: Northeast 3,909 3,249 2,692 Southeast 12,911 9,362 8,234 Midwest 6,121 5,520 4,936 Central 6,829 6,066 5,283 West 15,860 14,415 11,548 45,630 38,612 32,693 Net new orders units (a): Northeast 4,019 3,197 3,098 Southeast 13,271 10,941 9,021 Midwest 6,231 5,396 4,736 Central 7,969 5,987 5,125 West 16,041 15,055 13,009 47,531 40,576 34,989 Net new orders dollars ($000s omitted) (a) $ 15,518,000 $ 12,101,000 $ 9,555,000 Backlog at December 31 units: Northeast 1,593 1,483 1,535 Southeast 5,665 5,305 3,726 Midwest 1,387 1,277 1,401 Central 2,217 1,077 1,156 West 6,955 6,774 6,134 17,817 15,916 13,952 Backlog at December 31 dollars ($000s omitted) $ 6,301,000 $ 5,154,000 $ 4,147,000 (a) Net new orders for the year ended December 31, 2003 do not include 1,051 units of acquired backlog and the related dollars. 19 Table of Contents Homebuilding Operations (continued) Continued strong demand for new homes, an increase in the number of active selling communities and market share expansion, drove increases in net new orders, unit settlements and unit backlog. Net new orders increased 17% to a record 47,531 units for the year ended December 31, 2005. Net new orders for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased 16% to 40,576 units compared with 34,989 units for the year ended December 31, 2003. Home settlements set a record for the year ended December 31, 2005 at 45,630 units, an increase of 18% over the same period in 2004. In 2004, home settlements also reached a record high, increasing 18% to 38,612 units. Active communities increased from 535 in 2003 to 626 in 2004 to 662 in 2005. Changes in average selling price reflect a number of factors, including price increases, the mix of product closed during a period and the number of options purchased by customers. The average selling price for our homes increased 10% for the year ended December 31, 2005, to $315,000 compared with 2004 and increased to $287,000 in 2004 from $259,000 in 2003. The most significant price increases for both 2005 and 2004 were in the West and Northeast geographic areas, and in Florida in the Southeast geographic area. Ending backlog, which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed, grew to a record 17,817 units at December 31, 2005 compared with 15,916 units at December 31, 2004 and 13,952 units at December 31, 2003. The dollar value of our backlog was up 22% to $6.3 billion at December 31, 2005, compared with $5.2 billion at December 31, 2004 and $4.1 billion at December 31, 2003. Our most significant increase in unit backlog at December 31, 2005, occurred in the Central region, which had unit increases of 106%, resulting from increased net new orders. Our most significant increases at December 31, 2004, occurred in the Southeast and West, which had unit increases of 42% and 10% respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we lowered pricing in Las Vegas to better align pricing in our communities with pricing in the market. This action was in response to a period of slow sign ups and increased cancellation rates, which we attributed to our then above market pricing. However, since the price reductions took effect in the fourth quarter of 2004, our communities in Las Vegas have experienced improved traffic and new order activity. The West contributed the largest portion of our operating activities, compared with the other geographic areas in the homebuilding operations, representing 35% of unit settlements and 34% of unit net new orders for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared with 37% of settlements and of net new orders during 2004, and 35% of settlements and 37% of net new orders during 2003. The West also contributed the largest portion of our backlog, compared with other geographic areas in the homebuilding operations, representing 39%, 43% and 44% of the total homebuilding backlog units at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The following table presents markets that represent 10% or more of unit new orders, unit settlements, and settlement revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Unit net new orders: Phoenix 10 % 16 % 14 % Las Vegas * * 10 % Unit settlements: Phoenix 12 % 14 % 12 % Settlement revenues: Phoenix 11 % 12 % 11 % Las Vegas * 12 % * * Represents less than 10%. 20 Table of Contents Homebuilding Operations (continued) The following table presents states that represent 10% or more of unit settlements and settlement revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Unit settlements : Arizona 13 % 16 % 14 % California 13 % 13 % 13 % Florida 19 % 15 % 14 % Texas 11 % 11 % 12 % Settlement revenues: Arizona 13 % 13 % 12 % California 22 % 19 % 19 % Florida 16 % 12 % 11 % Nevada 10 % 12 % 10 % At December 31, 2005 and 2004, our Homebuilding operations controlled approximately 362,600 and 343,400 lots, respectively. Approximately 173,800 and 158,000 lots were owned and approximately 133,400 and 125,800 lots were under option agreements approved for purchase at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In addition, there were approximately 55,400 lots under option agreements at December 31, 2005, pending approval, that are under review and evaluation for future use by our Homebuilding operations. This compared to 59,600 lots at December 31, 2004. The total purchase price applicable to approved land under option for use by our homebuilding operations at future dates approximated $5.7 billion at December 31, 2005. In addition, the total purchase price applicable to land under option pending approval was valued at $1.9 billion at December 31, 2005. Land option agreements, which may be cancelled at our discretion, may extend over several years and are secured by deposits and advanced costs totaling $444.8 million, which are generally non refundable. The following table presents a summary of pre tax income for our Homebuilding operations ($000s omitted): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Home sale revenue (settlements) $ 14,370,667 $ 11,094,617 $ 8,482,341 Land sale revenue 157,569 305,391 219,320 Home cost of sales* (11,005,591 ) (8,583,551 ) (6,731,834 ) Land cost of sales (139,377 ) (205,589 ) (153,415 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (1,107,816 ) (973,629 ) (820,951 ) Equity income 72,604 53,908 32,549 Other income (expense), net (49,234 ) (55,567 ) (27,497 ) Pre tax income $ 2,298,822 $ 1,635,580 $ 1,000,513 Average sales price $ 315 $ 287 $ 259 * Homebuilding interest expense, which represents the amortization of capitalized interest, is included in homebuilding cost of sales. Homebuilding gross profit margins from home sales in 2005 increased 80 basis points over 2004 to 23.4%, and in 2004 increased 200 basis points to 22.6% compared with 2003. The increases are due to strong consumer demand, positive home pricing, favorable shifts in product and geographic mix, the benefits of leverage buy purchasing activities and effective production and inventory management. During the fourth quarter of 2005, homebuilding gross profit margins were 22.3% compared with 22.7% in the same period of 2004. This margin decrease of 40 basis points is attributable primarily to a 4% inflationary increase in land development costs, such as petroleum based products and cement. Under our accounting policies, lot costs are expensed on an average project cost basis. Due to the significant cost increases experienced in the fourth quarter of 2005, we have adjusted our estimates accordingly. Such adjustments impacted the amount of lot costs recognized and will continue to affect lot costs prospectively. 21 Table of Contents Homebuilding Operations (continued) We consider land acquisition one of our core competencies. We acquire land primarily for the construction of our homes for sale to homebuyers. We will often sell select parcels of land within or adjacent to our communities to retail and commercial establishments. We also will, on occasion, sell lots within our communities to other homebuilders. Gross profits from land sales were $18.2 million and $99.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, representing a decrease of $81.6 million and an increase of $33.9 million, respectively, from the previous years total. Revenues and their related gains/losses may vary significantly between periods, depending on the timing of land sales. We continue to evaluate our existing land positions to ensure the most effective use of capital. Included in other assets is approximately $257.7 million in land held for disposition as of December 31, 2005, as compared to $230.1 million and $251.2 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2005, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of home settlement revenues, decreased 110 basis points to 7.7% compared with 2004 after decreasing 90 basis points to 8.8% in 2004 compared with 2003. The conversion improvement in 2005 can be attributed to an increase in average selling prices, our internal initiatives focused on controlling costs and better overhead leverage as a result of volume increases. The improvement in 2004 can be attributed to greater leverage as a result of volume increases and the favorable pricing environment for our homes. Equity income for 2005 and 2004 includes earnings from our 50% investment in a Nevada based joint venture, related to the sale of commercial and residential properties. Also included are earnings from our 50% joint venture that supplies and installs basic building components and operating systems, acquired in January 2004. In January 2006, we exercised our option to purchase the remaining 50% interest in the entity. In 2006, this investment will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and will be consolidated in our financial statements. Other income (expense), net includes the write off of deposits and pre acquisition costs resulting from decisions not to pursue certain land acquisitions and options, insurance related expenses and settlements and other non operating expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the changes in other income (expense), net are due primarily to write offs of deposit and pre acquisition costs. These write offs vary in amount from year to year as we continue to evaluate potential land acquisitions for the most effective use of capital. Financial Services Operations We conduct our financial services business, which includes mortgage and title operations, through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries. We originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various credit arrangements, and then sell such mortgage loans to outside investors. Also, we sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts. Due to the short period of time the servicing rights are held, generally less than four months, we do not amortize the servicing asset. Since the servicing rights are recorded based on the value in the servicing sales contracts, there are no impairment issues related to these assets. The following table presents mortgage origination data for our Financial Services operations: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Total originations: Loans 42,994 35,232 28,655 Principal ($000s omitted) $ 8,528,600 $ 6,739,200 $ 4,989,500 Originations for Pulte customers: Loans 42,302 32,290 23,864 Principal ($000s omitted) $ 8,397,600 $ 6,268,100 $ 4,179,100 Pre tax income of our financial services operations was $70.6 million, $47.4 million, and $68.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 22 Table of Contents Financial Services Operations (continued) Mortgage origination unit and principal volume for the year ended December 31, 2005, increased 22% and 27%, respectively, over 2004. Mortgage origination unit and principal volume for the year ended December 31, 2004, increased 23% and 35%, respectively, over 2003. This growth can be attributed to increases in the capture rate of 140 basis points to 89.2% in 2005 and 510 basis points to 87.8% in 2004, combined with the volume increases experienced in our homebuilding business and an increase in average loan size. Our capture rate represents loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percent of total loan opportunities, excluding cash settlements, from our homebuilding business. Our homebuilding customers continue to account for the majority of total loan production, representing 98% of Pulte Mortgage unit production for 2005, compared with 92% in 2004 and 83% in 2003. Adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) represented 45% of total funded origination dollars and 39% of total funded origination units for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with 43% and 42%, respectively, in 2004 and 24% and 22%, respectively, in 2003. Interest only mortgages, a component of ARMs, represented 65% of ARMs origination dollars and 56% of ARMs origination units for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with 42% and 30% in 2004, and 13% and 8%, respectively, in 2003. Interest only mortgages represented 29%, 18%, and 3%, respectively, of total funded origination dollars for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Refinancings represented 1% of total loan production in 2005, compared with 3% in 2004 and 8% in 2003. Our customers average FICO scores for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 were 741, 737, and 724, respectively. Combined Loan to Value was 81% for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. At December 31, 2005, loan application backlog was $4.2 billion, compared with $3.5 billion and $2.2 billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Pre tax income increased 49% for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with 2004, due to increased volume and a favorable product mix shift to funded, from non funded originations. In 2005, 26% of total origination dollars were from brokered loans, which are less profitable to us, compared with 36% in 2004. Mortgage origination fees of $20.7 million in 2005 were $0.2 million, or 1%, higher than the $20.5 million recorded for the same period in 2004. The 1% increase over the same period in 2004 is due to higher revenues per loan as brokered origination volume decreased 7% in 2005 when compared to 2004. The net gain from sale of mortgages of $81.1 million in 2005 was $30.8 million, or 61%, higher than the $50.3 million recorded for the same period in 2004. This favorable variance was due primarily to an increase in loans available for sale combined with a more favorable interest rate environment in 2005 when compared to 2004. Net interest income in 2005 was $10 million, or 3%, higher than the $9.7 million for the same period in 2004. The increase was due mainly to increased funded origination volume offset by a lower interest rate margin. Income from our title operations was $22.3 million in 2005, an increase of 27% over 2004. Selling, general and administrative expense increased $10 million, or 17%, from 2004, due primarily to an increase in origination volume. Our minority interest in Su Casita, a Mexican mortgage banking company, contributed income from operations of approximately $350 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2005. During February 2005, 25% of our investment in the capital stock of Su Casita was redeemed for a gain of approximately $620 thousand. Our remaining interest of 16.66% was accounted for under the cost method of accounting and therefore no income was recorded for periods subsequent to the sale. Income from Su Casita for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, was $4 million and $4.4 million, respectively. In February 2006, we completed the sale of our remaining investment in Su Casita for approximately $50 million, and realized a pre tax gain of approximately $30 million related to the transaction. Pre tax income decreased 31% for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared with 2003, as increased volume was offset by changes in product mix to ARMs, which generally have a lower profit per loan than fixed rate products. The shift to ARMs is attributable to customer mortgage product preference. In addition, in 2004, 36% of total origination dollars were from brokered loans, which are less profitable to us, compared with 16% in 2003. Mortgage origination fees increased to $20.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared with $7.5 million in 2003, due to the increase in brokered loans. Gains from the sale of mortgages during 2004 decreased $14.1 million, or 22%, from $64.4 million in 2003, and net interest income decreased $5.5 million, to $9.7 million during 2004 as compared with $15.1 million in 2003. These decreases were due to the product mix shifts and an unfavorable interest rate environment in 2004 compared with 2003. Income from our title operations was $17.6 million in 2004, an increase of 30% over 2003. Selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2004, increased 41% to $57.5 million compared with 2003 due to increased origination volume. We hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed mortgage loans with derivative financial instruments. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we did not recognize any material net gains or losses related to an ineffective portion of the hedging instrument. We also did not recognize any material net gains or losses during 2005 for cash flow hedges that were discontinued because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur. At December 31, 2005, we expect to reclassify $18 thousand, net of taxes, of net losses on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next twelve months from sales of closed mortgage loans. 23 Table of Contents Other non operating Other non operating expenses, net consists of income and expenses related to Corporate services provided to our subsidiaries. These expenses are incurred for financing, developing and implementing strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies, and providing the necessary administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Accordingly, these results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve. The following table presents results of operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Net interest expense $ 43,344 $ 47,372 $ 39,364 Other expenses, net 49,050 43,313 35,987 Loss before income taxes $ 92,394 $ 90,685 $ 75,351 Interest expense, net of interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory, decreased 9% to $43.3 million in 2005 and increased 20% to $47.4 million in 2004. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with the prior year, is due to an increase in the amount of interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory as well as an increase in interest income. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared with the prior year, is due to an increase in the debt levels necessary to support our growth. The increase in other expenses, net for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with the prior year was due to higher compensation related costs. Other expenses, net in 2004 increased $7.3 million compared with 2003 partially due to increased charitable contributions. Additionally, during 2004 and 2003 we recognized income from the sale and adjustment to fair value of various non operating parcels of commercial land held for sale. Interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory is charged to home cost of sales based on the cyclical timing of our unit settlements over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. During 2005, interest in homebuilding inventory increased primarily as a result of higher levels of inventory and debt consistent with the growth of our Company. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we increased the amount of interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory. The increase was based on our homebuilding inventory and debt levels and is consistent with the growth of the Company. Information related to Corporate interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory is as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Interest in homebuilding inventory at beginning of year $ 223,591 $ 200,584 $ 142,984 Interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory 185,792 156,056 136,308 Interest expensed to homebuilding cost of sales (179,585 ) (133,049 ) (78,708 ) Interest in homebuilding inventory at end of year $ 229,798 $ 223,591 $ 200,584 Interest incurred* $ 234,024 $ 205,176 $ 178,952 * Interest incurred includes interest on our senior debt, short term borrowings, and other financing arrangements and excludes interest incurred by our financial services operations. 24 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations First Heights In September 2003, the United States Court of Federal Claims issued final judgment that Pulte Homes, Inc., Pulte Diversified Companies, Inc. and First Heights (collectively, the Pulte Parties) had been damaged by approximately $48.7 million as a result of the United States governments breach of contract with them. The final judgment follows the Courts August 17, 2001 ruling that the United States breached the contract related to the Pulte Parties 1988 acquisition of five savings and loan associations by enacting Section 13224 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. The United States government and the Pulte Parties filed Notices of Appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in October 2003. In August 2005, the United States Court of Appeals affirmed the United States Court of Federal Claims judgment, in its entirety, that we had been damaged by approximately $48.7 million as a result of the United States governments breach of contract in connection with the enactment of Section 13224 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. In December 2005, we received payment of the judgment in the amount of $48.7 million, which was recorded as income from discontinued operations. We also recorded non cash, after tax gains of $7.8 million, $10.8 million and $7.9 million, during the third quarter of 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters relating to our former thrift operation, which was discontinued in 1994. Mexico In January 2005, the minority shareholders of Pulte Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V. (Pulte Mexico) exercised a put option under the terms of a reorganization agreement dated as of December 31, 2001, to sell their shares to us, the consummation of which resulted in our owning 100% of Pulte Mexico. In March 2005, we purchased 60% of the minority interest of Pulte Mexico for approximately $18.7 million in cash. In June 2005, we purchased the remaining 40% of the minority interest of Pulte Mexico for approximately $12.5 million in cash. We assigned approximately $17.6 million of the purchase price premium to house and land inventory, which was amortized through cost of sales as homes were sold. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed, of $5.3 million, was recorded as goodwill. In December 2005, we sold substantially all of our Mexico homebuilding operations to a consortium of purchasers involved in residential and commercial real estate development. The disposition of the Mexico homebuilding operations will allow us to invest additional resources in the U.S. housing market. We realized cash of $131.5 million related to the sale. The sale of these operations did not include our investment in the capital stock of a mortgage company in Mexico as well as various non operating entities, which are not considered to be material to our results of operations or our financial position. Revenues of these discontinued operations were $201 million, $185.8 million and $172.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, discontinued Mexico homebuilding operations reported total after tax income (losses) of ($1.5) million, $4.4 million and $1.7 million, respectively. Results of Mexico homebuilding operations, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, resulted in pre tax operating income of $4.6 million, $8.2 million and $4.6 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized a pre tax loss of $6.6 million (after tax loss of $13.1 million) related to the sale of our Mexico homebuilding operations. The pre tax loss on sale includes the accounting recognition of the economic losses related to accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments of $7.6 million, which had previously been reported in other comprehensive income, as well as the write off of $5.3 million of goodwill related to the 2005 acquisition of the minority shareholder interests. At December 31, 2005, the Mexico homebuilding operations have been presented as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Previously, the Mexico homebuilding operations were included in the Homebuilding segment. Certain amounts previously reported in the 2004 and 2003 financial statements and notes thereto were reclassified to conform to the 2005 presentation. Concurrent with the sale of the Mexico homebuilding operations, we elected to repatriate all of our earnings from our Mexico operations in accordance with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Internal Revenue Code Section 965, Temporary Dividends Received Deduction) and recorded $4.8 million of related income taxes, which have been included in the Mexico loss on sale from discontinued operations. 25 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations (continued) Argentina In January 2005, we sold all of our Argentina operations to an Argentine company involved in residential and commercial real estate development. The disposition of these operations was the chosen action to improve our overall returns. At December 31, 2004, the Argentina operations were classified as held for sale and presented as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Previously, the Argentina operations were included in the Homebuilding segment. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, discontinued Argentine operations reported after tax losses of $1.4 million and $1.9 million, respectively. In addition, we recognized a pre tax loss of $33.2 million ($20.6 million after tax) on the write down of the Argentina operations to fair value less costs to sell. At December 31, 2004, foreign currency translation losses of $25.1 million, which were previously recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet, were recognized in the income statement in connection with the classification of these operations as held for sale. These translation losses were included in the overall pre tax loss of $33.2 million on the write down to fair value. For the year ended December 31, 2003, we recorded a foreign currency translation gain of $1.9 million for Argentina as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet. Total assets to be disposed of at December 31, 2004 were $15.4 million, consisting primarily of cash and inventories. Total liabilities to be disposed of at December 31, 2004 were $13.7 million and consisted primarily of accounts payable and other accrued liabilities. Liquidity and Capital Resources We finance our homebuilding land acquisitions, development and construction activities from internally generated funds and existing credit agreements. At December 31, 2005, we had cash and equivalents of $1 billion and $3.4 billion of senior notes outstanding. Other financing included limited recourse collateralized financing totaling $28.6 million. Sources of our working capital include our cash and equivalents, our $1.66 billion committed unsecured revolving credit facility and Pulte Mortgages $990 million committed credit arrangements. Our debt to total capitalization, excluding our collateralized debt, was approximately 36.2% at December 31, 2005, and approximately 28.6% net of cash and equivalents. We routinely monitor current operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate the use of available financing sources, including securities offerings. Pulte Mortgage provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available pursuant to various committed and uncommitted credit arrangements. At December 31, 2005, Pulte Mortgage had committed credit arrangements of $990 million comprised of a $390 million bank revolving credit facility and a $600 million asset backed commercial paper program. The asset backed commercial paper program was temporarily increased to $600 million in December 2005 due to high year end volume. It was reduced back to $550 million in January 2006. Our income tax liability and related effective tax rate are affected by a number of factors. In 2005, our effective tax rate was 36.9% compared to 37.6% in 2004 and 37.9% in 2003. The reduction in the effective tax rate for 2005 was principally due to the new manufacturing deduction established by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The reduction in the effective tax rate for 2004 was principally due to the favorable resolution of certain state tax matters. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2006 will be approximately 37%. Our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2005, amounted to $18.7 million, while net cash used in operating activities was $692.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase from 2004 to 2005 was principally due to an increase in net income, which included $48.7 million of cash income received as a result of a favorable judgment for our former thrift operation. Our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2003, was $336.4 million. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the increases in net income were offset primarily by significant investments in land necessary to support the continued growth of the business. 26 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Cash used in investing activities was $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $198.6 million in the prior year. The change in net cash used in investing activities primarily relates to proceeds from the sale of subsidiaries during 2005 of $142.9 million, increases in distributions from unconsolidated entities of $41.9 million, offset by increases in capital expenditures of $13.7 million. During 2005, we invested approximately $37.3 million in three new joint ventures that develop and or sell land within the United States. Also, we contributed $124.6 million of additional capital contributions to and received $108 million in capital distributions from our unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2005. Further, we incurred approximately $88.9 million in capital expenditures to support the growth of our business. Cash used in investing activities was $198.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared with $4.3 million in the prior year. The change in net cash used in investing activities primarily relates to our investments in unconsolidated entities. During January 2004, we invested $35 million for a 50% ownership interest in an entity that supplies and installs basic building components and operating systems. During 2004, we invested approximately $117.8 million in three new joint ventures that develop and or sell land in the United States. Also, we contributed $44.2 million of additional capital contributions to and received $66.1 million in capital distributions from our unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $700.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Cash inflows from financing activities of $1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005 are primarily attributed to proceeds from our $350 million, 5.2% senior notes and $300 million, 6% senior notes issued in February 2005, proceeds from Pulte Mortgages line of credit of approximately $275.6 million, proceeds from limited recourse collateralized financing arrangements of approximately $46.8 million, and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $31.2 million. Cash outflows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily relate to the repayment of our $125 million, 7.3% senior notes in October 2005, approximately $33.6 million of cash dividends paid to our shareholders, and $143.2 million used to repurchase our common stock. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $809.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Cash inflows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 are primarily attributed to proceeds received from our $500 million, 5.25% senior notes issued in January 2004 and our $400 million, 4.875% senior notes issued in July 2004 and $44 million of cash received from the exercise of stock options. Cash outflows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily relate to the repayment of our $112 million, 8.375% senior notes in August 2004, redemption of the remaining $77 million of Del Webb 10.25% senior subordinated notes in February 2004, approximately $25.4 million of cash dividends paid to our shareholders, $44.9 million used to repay borrowings, and $14.7 million used to repurchase our common stock. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003, was $128.9 million, reflecting proceeds from the $300 million senior notes issued in February and the $400 million senior notes issued in May and proceeds from employee stock option exercises, offset by the repayment of debt, dividends paid and stock repurchases. In February 2005, we sold $350 million of 5.2% senior notes, which mature on February 15, 2015, and $300 million of 6% senior notes, which mature on February 15, 2035, which are guaranteed by us and certain of our 100% owned subsidiaries. These notes are unsecured and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. Proceeds from the sale were used to repay the indebtedness of our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including continued investment in our business. In October 2005, we restructured and amended the 5 year unsecured revolving credit facility, increasing the borrowing availability from $1.38 billion to $1.615 billion, and extending the maturity date from September 2009 to October 2010, with pricing more favorable to us. We subsequently increased the credit facility to $1.66 billion. The credit facility includes an uncommitted accordion feature, under which the credit facility may be increased to $2.25 billion. We have the capacity to issue letters of credit up to $1.125 billion. Borrowing availability is reduced by the amount of letters of credit outstanding. The credit facility contains restrictive covenants, the most restrictive of which requires us not to exceed a debt to total capitalization ratio of 60% as defined in the agreement. Pursuant to the two $100 million stock repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors in October 2002 and 2005 (for a total stock repurchase authorization of $200 million), we have repurchased a total of 6,120,800 shares for $180.5 million. At December 31, 2005, we had remaining authorization to purchase common stock aggregating $19.5 million. In February 2006, our Board of Directors approved an increase to our stock repurchase authorization for an additional $200 million in open market transactions or otherwise. In July 2005, our Board of Directors declared a two for one stock split effected in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend. The additional shares of common stock were distributed on September 1, 2005, to the shareholders of record as of August 15, 2005. In December 2003, we announced a two for one stock split effected in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend. The distribution was made on January 2, 2004. All share and per share amounts have been restated to retroactively reflect the stock splits. 27 Table of Contents Inflation We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation also increases our financing, labor and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices. For the three months ended December 31, 2005, our gross margins have been negatively impacted by approximately 40 basis points due to inflation, compared to the same period in the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2005, inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005: Payments Due by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 After 2010 Contractual obligations: Long term debt (a) $ 6,333,755 $ 216,776 $ 433,552 $ 814,052 $ 4,869,375 Operating lease obligations 231,119 52,392 80,035 55,013 43,679 Other long term liabilities (b) 29,318 18,302 10,006 1,010 Total contractual obligations (c) $ 6,594,192 $ 287,470 $ 523,593 $ 870,075 $ 4,913,054 (a) Represents our senior notes and subordinated notes and related interest payments (b) Represents our limited recourse collateralized financing arrangements and related interest payments (c) We do not have any payments due in connection with capital lease or purchase obligations We are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts (including option contracts) for the purchase, development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business. Option contracts for the purchase of land enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we are ready to build homes on them. This reduces our financial risks associated with long term land holdings. At December 31, 2005, we had agreements to acquire approximately 189,000 homesites through option contracts and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At December 31, 2005 we had $444.8 million of non refundable option deposits and advanced costs related to certain of these agreements. The following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2005: Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 After 2010 Other commercial commitments: Guarantor revolving credit facilities (a) $ 1,660,000 $ $ $ 1,660,000 $ Non guarantor revolving credit facilities (c) 990,000 990,000 Standby letters of credit (b) 39,794 39,794 Total commercial commitments (d) $ 2,689,794 $ 1,029,794 $ $ 1,660,000 $ (a) Includes capacity to issue up to $1.125 billion in standby letters of credit of which $492 million was outstanding at December 31, 2005. (b) Excludes standby letters of credit issued under the Guarantor revolving credit facilities. (c) Includes credit facility of $390 million and $600 million asset backed commercial paper program. The asset backed commercial paper program was temporarily increased to $600 million from $550 million in December 2005 due to high year end volume. It was returned to $550 million in January 2006. (d) Excludes performance and surety bonds of approximately $1.8 billion, which typically do not have stated expiration dates. 28 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We use standby letters of credit and performance bonds to guarantee our performance under various contracts, principally in connection with the development of our projects. The expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related projects. If the obligations related to a project are ongoing, annual extensions of the letters of credit are typically granted on a year to year basis. At December 31, 2005, we had outstanding letters of credit of $531.5 million. Performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These bonds, which approximated $1.79 billion at December 31, 2005, are typically outstanding over a period that approximates 3 5 years. We do not believe that we will be required to draw upon any such letters of credit or performance bonds. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land option or option type agreements in order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future. At December 31, 2005, these agreements totaled approximately $7.6 billion. Pursuant to these land option agreements, we provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future, usually at predetermined prices. If the entity holding the land under option is a variable interest entity, our deposit represents a variable interest in that entity. At December 31, 2005, we consolidated certain variable interest entities with assets totaling $76.7 million. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, aggregate outstanding debt of unconsolidated joint ventures was $882.2 million and $58.1 million, respectively. The increase in debt at December 31, 2005 is a result of the growth in the number of joint venture arrangements as well as increased land development activities for these entities. Our proportionate share of our joint venture debt as of December 31, 2005 was approximately $294 million, for which we provide limited recourse debt guarantees, of approximately $288 million. Accordingly, we may be liable, on a contingent basis, through limited guarantees with respect to a portion of the secured land acquisition and development debt. However, we would not be liable other than in instances of fraud, misrepresentation or other bad faith actions by us, unless the joint venture was unable to perform its contractual borrowing obligations. As of December 31, 2005, we do not anticipate that we will incur any significant costs under these guarantees. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these consolidated financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements, giving due regard to materiality. The development and selection of the following critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Revenue recognition Homebuilding Homebuilding revenues are recorded when the sales of homes are completed and ownership has transferred to the customer. Unfunded settlements are deposits in transit on homes for which the sale was completed. We do not engage in arrangements whereby we have ongoing relationships with our homebuyers that require us to repurchase our homes or provide homebuyers with the right of return. Financial Services Mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors. Servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance, or a contracted set fee in the case of certain sub servicing, and are credited to income when related mortgage payments are received. Loan origination fees, commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred as an adjustment to the cost of the related mortgage loan until such loan is sold. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold. Interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold. Inventory valuation Our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated costs or net realizable value. Included in inventories are all direct development costs. Inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated cost, unless they are determined to be impaired, in which case these inventories are measured at fair value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory adjustments may be required. We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories. Interest capitalized each quarter is identified as a separate layer in our capitalized interest balance sheet pool. Each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development. Interest expense is allocated to the quarters over the amortization period based on the cyclical timing of unit settlements. 29 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Inventory valuation (continued) Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis. Under the specific identification basis, cost of sales includes the construction cost of the home, an average lot cost by project based on land acquisition and development costs, and closing costs and commissions. Construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home, plus an accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid, based on an analysis of budgeted construction cost. This accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared to the amount accrued, and adjustments are made if needed. Total project land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared to actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete. Adjustments to estimated total project land acquisition and development costs for the project affect the amount of future lots costed. Residential mortgage loans available for sale Residential mortgage loans available for sale are stated at the lower of aggregate cost or market value. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold. We hedge our residential mortgage loans available for sale. Gains and losses from closed commitments and futures contracts are matched against the related gains and losses on the sale of mortgage loans. Goodwill and intangible assets We have recorded certain intangible assets and goodwill, most of which relate to the Del Webb merger in 2001. Intangible assets, primarily trademarks and tradenames, were valued using proven valuation procedures and are amortized over their estimated useful life. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing. The carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use. If our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly, intangible assets and goodwill may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material. If we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets, long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment, we measure impairment based on one of three methods. For assets related to ongoing operations, we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists and then measure impairment using discounted cash flows. For assets to be disposed of, we assess the fair value of the asset based on current market conditions for similar assets. For goodwill, we assess fair value by measuring discounted cash flows of our reporting units and measure impairment as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded book value. The estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control. Changes in these estimates could result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and material charges to the results of operations. Allowance for warranties Home purchasers are provided with warranties against certain building defects. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary geographically. Most warranties cover different aspects of the homes construction and operating systems for a period of up to ten years. We estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim. We periodically assess the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. Although we have not made significant adjustments to the accrual in the past, actual warranty cost in the future could differ from our current estimate. Insurance We have, and require the majority of our subcontractors to have, general liability, property, errors and omissions, workers compensation and other business insurance. These insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims, subject to certain self insured retentions, deductibles, and other coverage limits. Through our captive insurance subsidiaries, we reserve for costs to cover our self insured and deductible amounts under those policies and for any costs of claims and lawsuits in excess of our coverage limits or not covered by such policies, based on an analysis of our historical claims, which includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Our total reserves for such items were $153.4 million and $115.6 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Expenses related to such claims were approximately $70.1 million, $58.4 million, and $40.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. 30 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Stock based compensation On December 15, 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, which amends SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. SFAS No. 123(R) requires that all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, be accounted for at fair value. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition. Under SFAS No. 123(R), we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments, the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption. We previously adopted the fair value based method of accounting for share based payments under SFAS No. 123 effective January 1, 2003 using the prospective method described in SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. Currently, the Company uses the Black Scholes option pricing model to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees, and will continue to use this model upon adoption of SFAS 123(R). Because SFAS No. 123(R) must be applied not only to new awards but to previously granted awards that are not fully vested on the effective date, and we adopted SFAS No. 123 using the prospective transition method (which applied only to awards granted, modified or settled after the adoption date), compensation cost for some previously granted awards that was not recognized under SFAS No. 123 will be recognized under SFAS No. 123(R). In addition, our stock option participant agreements provide continued vesting for certain retirement eligible employees who have achieved a predetermined level of service based on their combined age and years of service. We currently recognize the related compensation cost ratably over the nominal vesting period. For awards granted after the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we will record related compensation cost over the period through the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide services to earn the award. Because these amounts are not significant, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. This statement is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2005. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ratified its Emerging Issues Task Force consensus in Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights (Issue 04 5). This guidance states that the general partner in a limited partnership is presumed to control that limited partnership, with limited exceptions. We do not expect the provisions of Issue 04 5 to impact our current accounting treatment for limited partnerships because we are not a general partner. Issue 04 5 is effective June 29, 2005 for new limited partnerships and existing limited partnerships where the partnership agreement has been modified and is otherwise effective for the first fiscal period beginning after December 15, 2005 for all other limited partnerships. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3 (SFAS 154). This Statement replaces APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes, and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements, and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. This Statement requires retrospective application to financial statements of prior periods for changes in accounting principle. This Statement is effective January 1, 2006 and has been determined to have no impact on our results of operations or its financial position. In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position 109 1, Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (FSP 109 1). The American Jobs Creation Act, which was signed into law in October 2004, provides a 3% tax deduction on qualified domestic production activities income for 2005. When fully phased in, the deduction will be 9% of the lesser of qualified production activities income or taxable income. Based on the guidance provided by FSP 109 1, this deduction was accounted for as a special deduction under SFAS No. 109 and reduced tax expense. Tax benefits resulting from the new deduction were recorded during 2005, and resulted in a reduction in our federal income tax rate (see Note 9 to Consolidated Financial Statements). 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our rate sensitive financing to the extent long term rates decline. The following tables set forth, as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, our rate sensitive financing obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value ($000s omitted).

Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed upon terms (i.e., commit to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2005 and 2004, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float. We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to LIBOR and A1/P1 commercial paper rates and (ii) hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments. These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in long term mortgage rates of plus 50, 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results. At December 31, 2005, our aggregate net investments exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk include our remaining non operating investments in Mexico, which approximated $6.2 million, and our mortgage banking joint venture investment in Mexico, which approximated $15.1 million. 32 Table of Contents SPECIAL NOTES CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS As a cautionary note, except for the historical information contained herein, certain matters discussed in Item 1A.
