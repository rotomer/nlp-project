ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview During the year ended December 31, 2006, the U.S. housing market was impacted by a lack of consumer confidence, decreased housing affordability, and large supplies of resale and new home inventories and related pricing pressures. These factors contributed to weakened demand for new homes, slower sales, higher cancellation rates, and increased price discounts and selling incentives to attract homebuyers, compared with the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, when we had experienced record growth in our homebuilding operations. As a result, gross margins recorded during the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased from the same periods in the prior years. From time to time, we write off deposit and pre acquisiton costs related to land and lot option contracts which we no longer plan to pursue. As a result of changing market conditions during the year ended December 31, 2006, we wrote off deposit and pre acquisition costs of $151.2 million related to land transactions we no longer plan to pursue. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded land valuation and net realizable value adjustments of $353.8 million, including our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures, to reduce the carrying value of these assets to fair value. Our evaluation for these adjustments assumed our best estimate of cash flows for the communities tested. If conditions in the homebuilding industry worsen in the future, we may be required to evaluate for additional impairment, resulting in additional impairment charges that could be significant. We continue to operate our business with the expectation that these difficult market conditions will continue to impact us for at least the near term. We have adjusted our approach to land acquisition and construction practices, continuing to shorten our land pipeline, reduce production volumes, and balance home price and profitability with sales pace. We are slowing down planned land purchases and reducing our total number of controlled lots owned and under option. Additionally, we are reducing the number of spec homes put into production. However, we continue to purchase select land positions where it makes economic and strategic sense to do so. We believe that these measures will help to strengthen our market position and allow us to take advantage of opportunities that will develop in the future. The following is a summary of our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Pre tax income (loss): Homebuilding $ 1,010,368 $ 2,298,822 $ 1,635,580 Financial Services 115,460 70,586 47,429 Other non operating (43,100 ) (92,394 ) (90,685 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes 1,082,728 2,277,014 1,592,324 Income taxes 393,082 840,126 598,751 Income from continuing operations 689,646 1,436,888 993,573 Income (loss) from discontinued operations (2,175 ) 55,025 (7,032 ) Net income $ 687,471 $ 1,491,913 $ 986,541 Per share data assuming dilution: Income from continuing operations $ 2.67 $ 5.47 $ 3.82 Income (loss) from discontinued operations (.01 ) .21 (.03 ) Net income $ 2.66 $ 5.68 $ 3.79 19 Table of Contents Overview (continued) The following is a comparison of pre tax income for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004: During 2006, demand for new homes weakened in many of our markets as a result of increases in the supply of existing homes for sale, increases in incentives offered by homebuilders and sellers of existing homes and increases in cancellation rates. These factors negatively impacted the homebuilding industry and contributed to a 56% decrease in the pre tax income of our homebuilding operations for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with the prior year period. During 2005, strong demand for new homes in many of our markets as well as geographic and product mix shifts contributed to a 41% increase in the pre tax income of our homebui1ding operations for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with the prior year period. For the year ended December 31, 2006, pre tax income was negatively impacted by $505 million of valuation adjustments recorded to land inventory ($203.8 million) and land held for sale ($54.6 million), our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures ($95.4 million) and the write off of deposits and pre acquisition costs ($151.2 million) related to land option contracts we no longer plan to pursue due to declining market conditions in the homebuilding industry. Pre tax income from our financial services business segment increased 64% for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with the prior year period due to increased origination volume, favorable product mix and a one time gain of $31.6 million related to the sale of our investment in Su Casita, a Mexican mortgage banking company. Pre tax income increased 49% for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared with the prior year period. Capture rates were 91%, 89% and 88% for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in non operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with the same period in the prior year, was due primarily to an increase in the amount of interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory. Loss from discontinued operations included a provision of $2.3 million, net of taxes for the year ended December 31, 2006, resulting from a contractual adjustment related to the December 2005 disposition of our Mexico homebuilding operations. Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 includes a $48.7 million payment received due to final judgment in litigation related to our former thrift operation. Income (loss) from discontinued operations also includes non cash, after tax gains of $7.8 million and $10.8 million realized during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, from the favorable resolution of certain tax matters related to our former thrift operation. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the sale of our Argentina homebuilding operations is included in discontinued operations. 20 Table of Contents Homebuilding Operations The following table presents a summary of pre tax income for our Homebuilding operations ($000s omitted): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Home sale revenue (settlements) $ 13,975,387 $ 14,370,667 $ 11,094,617 Land sale revenue 99,861 157,569 305,391 Home cost of sales (a) (11,544,905 ) (11,005,591 ) (8,583,551 ) Land cost of sales (b) (138,528 ) (139,377 ) (205,589 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (1,136,027 ) (1,107,816 ) (973,629 ) Equity income (loss) (c) (95,244 ) 72,604 53,908 Other income (expense), net (d) (150,176 ) (49,234 ) (55,567 ) Pre tax income $ 1,010,368 $ 2,298,822 $ 1,635,580 Unit settlements 41,487 45,630 38,612 Average selling price $ 337 $ 315 $ 287 Net new orders: Units 33,925 47,531 40,576 Dollars $ 11,253,000 $ 15,518,000 $ 12,101,000 Backlog at December 31: Units 10,255 17,817 15,916 Dollars $ 3,580,000 $ 6,301,000 $ 5,154,000 (a) Includes homebuilding interest expense which represents the amortization of capitalized interest; land and community valuation adjustments of $203.8 million, $7.7 million and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. (b) Includes net realizable value adjustments for land held for sale of $54.6 million, $3.1 million and $265,000 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. (c) Includes land and community valuation adjustments for two of our unconsolidated joint ventures, which totaled $95.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. (d) Includes the write off of deposits and pre acquisition costs for land option contracts we no longer plan to pursue of $151.2 million, $19.2 million and $27 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2006, other income (expense) also includes $18.5 million related to the closure of our production facility in Virginia. Home sale revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 were lower than those for the prior year by approximately $395 million, or 3%. The decrease in homebuilding revenues was attributable to a 9% decrease in the number of homes closed to 41,487, partially offset by a 7% increase in the average selling price of homes delivered to $337,000. The increase in average selling price reflects a combination of changes in product mix and geographic mix of homes closed during the year ended December 31, 2006. Home sale revenues set a record for the year ended December 31, 2005 at 45,630 units, an increase of 18% over the same period in 2004, while the 2005 average selling price for our homes increased 10% to $315,000, compared with 2004. Homebuilding gross profit margins from home sales in 2006 decreased 600 basis points from 2005 to 17.4%, and in 2005 increased 80 basis points to 23.4% compared with 2004. The increase in homebuilding gross profit margins in 2005 is due to strong consumer demand, positive home pricing, favorable shifts in product and geographic mix, the benefits of leverage buy purchasing activities and effective production and inventory management. During the fourth quarter of 2006, homebuilding gross profit margins were 11.0% compared with 22.3% and 22.7% in the same periods of 2005 and 2004, respectively. The significant decrease in gross profit margins during 2006 is attributable to the difficult market conditions and challenging sales environment where we have realized increased sales incentives and increased material and labor costs related to homes closed during the year. Additionally, during 2006, we identified communities under development that demonstrated potential impairment indicators which were evaluated for potential impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144). Consequently, during the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded respective land valuation adjustments of $146 million and $203.8 million, which included capitalized interest of $16 million, to reduce the carrying value of the impaired projects to their estimated fair value. There were no significant land valuation adjustments recorded during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. 21 Table of Contents Homebuilding Operations (continued) We consider land acquisition and development to be one of our core competencies. We acquire land primarily for the construction of our homes for sale to homebuyers. We select locations for development of homebuilding communities after completing extensive market research, enabling us to match the location and product offering with our targeted consumer group. Where we develop land, we engage directly in many phases of the development process, including land and site planning, obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals, as well as constructing roads, sewers, water and drainage facilities and other amenities. We will often sell select parcels of land within or adjacent to our communities to retail and commercial establishments. We also will, on occasion, sell lots within our communities to other homebuilders. Gross profit (loss) from land sales was ($38.7) million, $18.2 million and $99.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Revenues and their related gains/losses may vary significantly between periods, depending on the timing of land sales. We continue to evaluate our existing land positions to ensure the most effective use of capital. Land held for disposition was approximately $465.8 million as of December 31, 2006, compared with $257.7 million and $230.1 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded net realizable value adjustments for land held for sale of $25.8 million and $54.6 million, respectively. There were no significant net realizable value adjustments for land held for sale during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2006, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of home settlement revenues, increased 40 basis points to 8.1% compared with 2005, after decreasing 110 basis points to 7.7% in 2005 compared with 2004. The decreased conversion in 2006 compared with the prior year was the result of lower home sale revenues, offset by our internal initiatives focused on controlling costs in the current business environment. The conversion improvement in 2005, compared with 2004, can be attributed to an increase in average selling prices, our internal initiatives focused on controlling costs and better overhead leverage as a result of volume increases. The decrease in equity income of $167.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with the prior year period, is primarily the result of a $95.4 million land valuation adjustment for two of our unconsolidated joint ventures, to reduce the carrying values of these investments to their estimated fair values. Additionally, the decrease in 2006 equity income, compared with the prior year, is also the result of our January 2006 acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in an entity that supplies and installs basic building components and operating systems. As a result of this acquisition, we own 100% of this entity, which is consolidated in our financial statements. For the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, earnings for this investment were recorded in equity income. In addition, earnings from our 50% investment in a Nevada based joint venture, related to the sale of commercial and residential properties, decreased in 2006 as the venture substantially completed its operations in 2005. Other income (expense), net includes the write off of deposits and pre acquisition costs resulting from decisions not to pursue certain land acquisitions and options, insurance related expenses and settlements and other non operating expenses. The changes in other income (expense), net are due primarily to write offs of deposit and pre acquisition costs during the fourth quarter of 2006, 2005 and 2004 of $82.7 million, $6.2 million and $13.8 million, respectively, and for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 of $151.2 million, $19.2 million and $27 million, respectively. These write offs vary in amount from year to year as we continue to evaluate potential land acquisitions for the most effective use of capital. During the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006 we recorded an $18.5 million charge related to the closure of a production facility located in Virginia. Unit settlements decreased 9% for the year ended December 31, 2006 to 41,487 units, compared with the same period in 2005 and increased 18% for the year ended December 31, 2005 to 45,630 units, compared with the same period in 2004. The average selling price for homes closed for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $337,000, $315,000 and $287,000, respectively. Changes in average selling price reflect a number of factors, including changes in market selling prices and the mix of product closed during each period. For the year ended December 31, 2006, unit net new orders decreased 29% to 33,925 units, compared with the same period in 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2005, unit net new orders increased 17% to 47,531 units, compared with the same period in 2004. During 2006, net new orders were impacted by the closeout of several large, established communities, where the replacement communities are still in the early phases of development. In addition, rising home prices, higher interest rates, and increased resale home inventories have negatively affected demand for new homes. Cancellation rates for the fourth quarter of 2006 were approximately 34.7%, compared with 22.7% and 25.7% for the same periods in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Year to date cancellation rates were 29.4% for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with 17.3% and 17.6% for the same periods in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Most markets have experienced a substantial increase in resale home inventory, and this, combined with declining consumer confidence, has resulted in higher cancellation rates and reduced net new orders during 2006. 22 Table of Contents Homebuilding Operations (continued) The dollar value of net new orders decreased 28% for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with the prior year period and increased 28% for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared with the same period in 2004. However, while net new order dollars decreased during 2006, average selling prices increased or remained stable in many of our markets, primarily as a result of favorable shifts in product and geographic mix. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we had 690 active selling communities, an increase of 4% from the same period in 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we had 662 active selling communities, an increase of 6% from the same period in 2004. Ending backlog, which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed, was 10,255 units at December 31, 2006 with a dollar value of $3.6 billion. Ending backlog was 17,817 units at December 31, 2005 with a dollar value of $6.3 billion. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, our Homebuilding operations controlled approximately 232,200 and 362,600 lots, respectively. Approximately 158,800 and 173,800 lots were owned, and approximately 63,700 and 133,400 lots were under option agreements approved for purchase at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In addition, there were approximately 9,700 and 55,400 lots under option agreements, pending approval, at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. For the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, we withdrew from land contracts representing approximately 37,500 lots and 95,200 lots, respectively, valued at $1.2 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. We believe that the depth of our existing land supply, coupled with our entitlement expertise, will enable us to continue opening new communities during the course of 2007 and beyond. The total purchase price related to approved land under option for use by our Homebuilding operations at future dates approximated $3.9 billion at December 31, 2006. In addition, total purchase price related to land under option pending approval was valued at approximately $450.3 million at December 31, 2006. Land option agreements, which may be cancelled at our discretion, may extend over several years and are secured by deposits and advanced costs totaling $369.5 million, of which $5.4 million is refundable and $12.9 million is related to deposits that our Homebuilding operations have made in regards to lots optioned from an unconsolidated joint venture in which we have an equity interest. This balance excludes $98.7 million of contingent payment obligations which may or may not become actual obligations of the Company. The following table presents markets that represent 10% or more of unit new orders, unit settlements, and settlement revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Unit net new orders: Phoenix 12 % 10 % 16 % Unit settlements: Phoenix 11 % 12 % 14 % Las Vegas 11 % * * Settlement revenues: Phoenix 12 % 11 % 12 % Las Vegas 12 % * 12 % * Represents less than 10%. 23 Table of Contents Homebuilding Segment Operations The Homebuilding operations represent our core business. Homebuilding offers a broad product line to meet the needs of first time, first and second move up, and active adult homebuyers. We have determined our operating segments to be our Areas, which are aggregated into seven reportable segments based on similarities in the economic and geographic characteristics of our homebuilding operations. We conduct our operations in 52 markets, located throughout 27 states, and have presented our reportable homebuilding segments as follows: Northeast: Northeast and Mid Atlantic Areas include the following states: Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia Southeast: Southeast Area includes the following states: Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee Florida: Florida Area includes the following state: Florida Midwest: Great Lakes Area includes the following states: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Minnesota Central: Rocky Mountain and Central Areas include the following states: Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Texas Southwest: Southwest and Nevada Areas include the following states: Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico *California: Northern California and Southern California Areas include the following state: California * Our homebuilding operations located in Reno, Nevada are reported in the California segment, while our remaining Nevada homebuilding operations are reported in the Southwest segment. 24 Table of Contents Homebuilding Segment Operations (continued) The following table presents selected financial information for our homebuilding reporting segments: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Home sale revenue (settlements) ($000s omitted): Northeast $ 1,650,129 $ 1,856,906 $ 1,435,532 Southeast 1,254,337 950,792 758,994 Florida 2,209,864 2,247,513 1,270,797 Midwest 1,270,072 1,757,842 1,592,804 Central 1,264,318 1,090,914 938,966 Southwest 3,694,571 3,259,913 2,945,918 California 2,632,096 3,206,787 2,151,606 $ 13,975,387 $ 14,370,667 $ 11,094,617 Income (loss) before income taxes ($000s omitted): Northeast $ 127,376 $ 326,399 $ 267,494 Southeast 88,162 86,683 53,502 Florida 381,924 475,939 198,975 Midwest (37,327 ) 149,063 175,845 Central (37,330 ) 1,729 45,736 Southwest 714,185 745,163 647,179 California 107,368 654,940 379,765 Unallocated (a) (333,990 ) (141,094 ) (132,916 ) $ 1,010,368 $ 2,298,822 $ 1,635,580 Unit settlements: Northeast 3,489 3,909 3,249 Southeast 4,504 4,127 3,719 Florida 7,374 8,784 5,643 Midwest 4,171 5,879 5,315 Central 6,192 6,424 5,576 Southwest 10,548 10,237 10,179 California 5,209 6,270 4,931 41,487 45,630 38,612 Net new orders units: Northeast 2,813 4,019 3,197 Southeast 4,632 4,888 3,896 Florida 4,501 8,383 7,045 Midwest 4,087 5,928 5,219 Central 5,437 7,549 5,568 Southwest 8,365 10,723 10,353 California 4,090 6,041 5,298 33,925 47,531 40,576 Unit backlog: Northeast 917 1,593 1,483 Southeast 1,708 1,580 819 Florida 1,212 4,085 4,486 Midwest 1,199 1,283 1,234 Central 1,320 2,075 950 Southwest 2,719 4,902 4,416 California 1,180 2,299 2,528 10,255 17,817 15,916 (a) Unallocated primarily includes amortization of capitalized interest of $255.7 million, $179.6 million and $133 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and other costs which are not allocated to the operating segments reported above. 25 Table of Contents Homebuilding Segment Operations (continued) Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Controlled Lots: Northeast 27,524 44,088 41,405 Southeast 23,332 31,863 22,926 Florida 48,640 70,434 73,799 Midwest 18,436 36,334 38,578 Central 22,966 39,331 42,572 Southwest 66,034 97,290 82,630 California 25,291 43,275 41,508 232,223 362,615 343,418 Land and community valuation adjustments ($000s omitted): Northeast $ 22,206 $ $ Southeast 1,083 Florida 22,715 Midwest 52,555 4,000 Central 23,866 3,718 Southwest 9,774 California 55,569 Total segment land and community valuation adjustments 187,768 7,718 Corporate and unallocated (a) 16,000 Total valuation adjustments $ 203,768 $ 7,718 $ Net realizable value adjustments (NRV) land held for sale ($000s omitted): Northeast $ 3,204 $ $ Southeast 14 Florida 5,596 Midwest 10,789 314 Central 27,674 2,756 265 Southwest 7,014 California 293 Total NRV adjustments land held for sale $ 54,570 $ 3,084 $ 265 Write off of deposits and pre acquisition costs ($000s omitted): Northeast $ 33,798 $ 2,931 $ 2,811 Southeast 4,514 2,194 1,617 Florida 25,108 1,119 1,573 Midwest 24,892 4,065 5,263 Central 10,739 5,292 3,248 Southwest 21,013 2,283 2,444 California 33,102 2,548 10,047 Total segment write off of deposits and pre acquisition costs 153,166 20,432 27,003 Corporate and unallocated (1,981 ) (1,237 ) Total write off of deposits and pre acquisition costs $ 151,185 $ 19,195 $ 27,003 (a) Corporate and unallocated includes a $16 million write off of capitalized interest related to land and community valuation adjustments recorded during 2006. 26 Table of Contents Homebuilding Segment Operations (continued) Northeast: For the year ended December 31, 2006, our Northeast operations experienced weakened demand for new homes primarily as a result of increases in existing home inventories. Net new orders for the fourth quarter of 2006 decreased 11% to 623 units, and for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased 30% to 2,813 units, compared with the same periods in 2005. During 2006, increased cancellation rates were attributable to lower new order sign up activity and increased cancellations in all markets. For the fourth quarter of 2006 cancellation rates were approximately 25% compared with 19% for the same period in 2005. Cancellation rates for fiscal year 2006 were 22%, compared with 14% for the same period in 2005. For the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, operating results were negatively impacted by $12.2 million and $22.2 million of respective land valuation adjustments taken in our New England markets as well as higher sales incentives offered to homebuyers. During 2006, we also recorded $3.2 million of net realizable value adjustments for land held for sale. During the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, we wrote off $17.7 million and $33.8 million, respectively, of deposits and pre acquisition costs associated with transactions we no longer plan to pursue, resulting in a reduction of lots controlled of approximately 6,800 and 12,900, respectively. There were no significant land valuation adjustments or write offs taken during the same periods in 2005 and 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005, our Northeast operations contributed positively to our Homebuilding operating results with increased revenues and higher average selling prices and profits compared with 2004. During 2005, most of the markets in the Northeast experienced strong demand conditions, particularly in Lehigh Valley and Baltimore, which were offset by increased resale inventories and pricing pressures in Washington D.C. Net new orders increased 26% to 4,019 units for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared with the same period in 2004. However, during the fourth quarter of 2005, net new orders decreased 10% to 697 units compared with the fourth quarter of 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005, cancellation rates were approximately 14% compared with 11% for the same period in 2004. Cancellation rates for the fourth quarter of 2005 increased to 19% compared with 14% for the same period in 2004. As of December 31, 2005, we had 99 active selling communities, compared with 78 as of December 31, 2004. In addition, the year over year comparability of our Northeast operations was affected by a significant land sale ($19.4 million of income before income taxes) in our Washington D.C. market during the year ended December 31, 2004. Southeast: During the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, our Southeast operations contributed positively to our Homebuilding operating results, evidenced by increased revenues and unit settlements as well as higher average selling prices and profits compared with prior year periods. The increases in the Southeasts profitability are attributable to a continued shift in product mix associated with the active adult homebuyer. Additionally, we opened a new large active adult community in Charlotte during 2006. Net new orders for the fourth quarter of 2006 decreased 27% to 715 units, and for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased 5% to 4,632 units, compared with the same periods in 2005. The reduction in new orders during the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006 contributed to the increase in cancellation rates. Cancellation rates for the fourth quarter of 2006 were approximately 35%, compared with 23% for the same periods in 2005, while cancellation rates were 24% for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with 18% for the same period in 2005. During 2006, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased as we continue to align our operations to meet current market conditions. There were no significant land related valuation adjustments or write offs taken during 2006, 2005 or 2004 in our Southeast markets. Most of the markets in the Southeast experienced strong demand conditions during 2005. Additionally, during 2005 we opened several new communities, including two new active adult communities in Atlanta and Raleigh. As of December 31, 2005, we had 64 active selling communities, compared with 74 as of December 31, 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005, net new orders increased 26% to 4,888 units compared with the same period in 2004. Net new orders for the fourth quarter of 2005 increased 7% to 976 units, compared with the same periods in 2004. Cancellation rates for the year ended December 31, 2005 were approximately 18%, which was comparable with the same period in 2004. For the fourth quarter and year ended 2005, our Carolina operating results were negatively impacted by $7 million of lot cost adjustments recorded primarily in Hilton Head. 27 Table of Contents Homebuilding Segment Operations (continued) Florida: During 2006, our Florida operations experienced weakened demand, largely attributable to increased existing home inventories, especially in Orlando and Naples/Ft. Myers. During the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, Florida experienced high cancellation rates and pricing pressures associated with excess inventories and aggressive sales incentives offered by competitors. Net new orders for the fourth quarter of 2006 decreased 51% to 769 units, and for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased 46% to 4,501 units, compared with the same periods in 2005. For the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, increased cancellation rates were attributable to lower new order sign up activity and increased cancellations in all Florida markets. For the fourth quarter of 2006, cancellation rates were approximately 40% compared with 17% for the same period in 2005, while cancellation rates for the year ended December 31, 2006 were approximately 31% compared with 12% for the same period in 2005. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased during 2006, as we continue to align our operations to meet current market conditions. During the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded valuation adjustments of $21.7 million and $22.7 million, respectively, related to land inventory. During the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, we also recorded charges of $17.6 million and $25.1 million, respectively, for the write off of deposits and pre acquisition costs associated with transactions we no longer plan to pursue in Jacksonville and Southeast Florida. During the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, these charges resulted in a reduction of lots controlled of approximately 3,800 and 10,500, respectively. There were no significant land valuation adjustments or write offs taken during the same periods in 2005 and 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2005, our Florida operations had increased revenues and higher average selling prices and profits compared with the same period in 2004. As of December 31, 2005, we had 73 active selling communities, compared with 65 as of December 31, 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005, net new orders increased 19% to 8,383 units compared with 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2005, net new orders decreased 20% to 1,577 units compared with the prior year quarter, due primarily to a decreased community count of approximately 20% in Tampa and the fact that we were transitioning out of a recently completed active adult community in Ocala. Additionally, some of our Florida operations began to experience weakened demand for new homes due to excess resale inventories and pricing pressures in Orlando and Naples/Ft. Myers. At December 31, 2005 unit backlog decreased 9% to 4,085 units compared with the same period in 2004. Cancellation rates for the year ended December 31, 2005 were approximately 12%, which was comparable with 2004. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2004, our Florida operations were affected by land sales (totaling $14.4 million of income before income taxes), which occurred primarily in our Tampa and Jacksonville markets. Midwest: The Midwest operations have been one of the most challenged areas in the country as Cleveland and Michigan continue to experience weakened demand due to difficult local economic conditions. Net new orders for the fourth quarter of 2006 decreased 40% to 749 units, and for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased 31% to 4,087 units, compared with the same periods in 2005. During 2006, reduced new order sign up activity resulted in higher cancellation rates. For the fourth quarter of 2006 cancellation rates were approximately 22% compared with 18% for the same period in 2005, while cancellation rates for the year ended December 31, 2006 were approximately 17% compared with 13% for the same periods in 2005. For the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, Midwest operating results were negatively impacted by land and community valuation adjustments of $32.6 million and $52.6 million, respectively. During the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006 we recorded net realizable value adjustments for land held for sale of $5.1 million and $10.8 million, respectively. During the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded charges of $9 million and $24.9 million, respectively, for the write off of deposits and pre acquisition costs associated with transactions we no longer plan to pursue in the Michigan, Minnesota and Indianapolis markets, resulting in a reduction of lots controlled of 3,600 and 11,800, respectively. There were no significant land valuation and net realizable adjustments or write offs taken during the same periods in 2005 and 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005, our Midwest operations realized increased revenues compared with the same period in 2004, primarily due to higher unit settlements. During the year ended December 31, 2005 average selling prices and profits decreased compared with the same period in 2004. During 2005, some of our Midwest operations were impacted by weakened demand for new homes due to increased resale home inventories and challenging local economic conditions, especially in Michigan. However, other Midwest operations, such as Illinois, Indianapolis and Ohio experienced solid demand, as evidenced by increased net new orders. For the year ended December 31, 2005, net new orders increased 14% to 5,928 units compared with 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2005, net new orders increased 11% to 1,240 units compared with the prior year period. In 2005, we opened large active adult communities in Detroit and Cleveland which contributed to the 2005 increase in net new orders. Cancellation rates for the year ended December 31, 2005 were approximately 13%, compared with 16% for the same periods in 2004. 28 Table of Contents Homebuilding Segment Operations (continued) Central: For the year ended December 31, 2006, revenue from home settlements increased compared with the same period in 2005. Higher average selling prices realized during 2006 were the result of unit settlements in new communities in both Texas and Colorado. However, the Central reporting segment recorded losses for both the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, compared with profits during the same period in 2005, which was largely attributable to decreased home settlements. Net new orders for the fourth quarter of 2006 decreased 50% to 895 units, and for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased 28% to 5,437 units, compared with the same periods in 2005. For the fourth quarter of 2006 cancellation rates were approximately 38% compared with 31% for the same period in 2005, while cancellation rates for the year ended December 31, 2006 were approximately 30% compared with 23% for the same period in 2005. During 2006 and 2005, Central operating results were negatively impacted by valuation adjustments to land inventory, net realizable value adjustments and write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs associated with transactions we no longer plan to pursue. We recorded valuation adjustments to land inventory of $15.1 million and $3.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2006 and 2005, respectively, and $23.9 million and $3.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We also recorded net realizable value adjustments on land held for sale of $8.1 million and $2.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2006 and 2005, respectively, and $27.7 million and $2.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. There were no significant land valuation and net realizable adjustments or write offs taken during the same periods in 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005, our Central operations realized increased revenues primarily due to higher unit settlements, compared with the same period in 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2005 average selling prices increased compared with the same period in 2004, and net new orders increased 36% to 7,549 units compared with the same period in 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2005, net new orders increased 53% to 1,801 units compared with the prior year period. During 2005, we realized increases in net new orders in Houston and San Antonio as well as Denver, which experienced significant increases from the successful grand opening of a large traditional/active adult community in November 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2005, our Central operations were negatively impacted by a shift in product mix as well as delays in the opening of certain new communities, compared with the prior year period for 2004. Cancellation rates for the year ended December 31, 2005 were approximately 23%, compared with 29% for the same period in 2004. For the fourth quarter of 2005, the cancellation rate was 31%, compared with 38% for the same period in 2004. Southwest: The Southwest operations continued to contribute positively to our Homebuilding operating results, evidenced by increased revenues, unit settlements and higher average selling prices compared with 2005. Net new orders for the fourth quarter of 2006 decreased 28% to 1,755 units, and for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased 22% to 8,365 units, compared with the same periods in 2005. During 2006, reduced new order sign up activity resulted in higher cancellation rates. For the fourth quarter of 2006 cancellation rates were approximately 37%, compared with 19% for the same period in 2005, while cancellation rates for the year ended December 31, 2006 were approximately 35%, compared with 16% for the same period in 2005. Operating results for the Southwest segment were positively impacted by our January 2006 acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in an entity that supplies and installs basic building components and operating systems in both Arizona and Nevada. During 2005 and 2004, income from this entity was recorded as equity income and had no impact on segment pre tax income. However, during the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, operating results were negatively impacted by land valuation and net realizable adjustments and the write off of deposits and pre acquisition costs. For the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded land and community valuation adjustments for both periods of $9.8 million, as well as net realizable value adjustments for land held for sale of $6.9 million and $7 million, respectively. During the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, we also recorded charges of $11.9 million and $21 million, respectively, for the write off of deposits and pre acquisition costs associated with transactions we no longer plan to pursue, primarily in the Phoenix and Tucson markets, which resulted in a reduction of lots controlled of 7,600 and 21,200, respectively. There were no significant land valuation and net realizable adjustments or write offs taken during the same periods in 2005 and 2004. 29 Table of Contents Homebuilding Segment Operations (continued) Southwest (continued): During the year ended December 31, 2005, our Southwest operations contributed positively to our Homebuilding operating results, evidenced by increased revenues and higher average selling prices and profits compared with 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005, net new orders increased 4% to 10,723 units compared with the same period in 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2005, net new orders increased 33% to 2,447 units compared with the prior year period. As of December 31, 2005, the decrease in Arizonas active community count, compared with the prior year, is attributable to the close out of several communities, including a large, established active adult community located in Phoenix. We opened two large active adult communities, also located in Phoenix, during the first quarter of 2006 as replacement communities. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we lowered pricing in Las Vegas to better align pricing in our communities with pricing in the market. This action was in response to a period of slow sign ups and increased cancellation rates, which we attributed to our then above market pricing. After the price reductions took effect in the fourth quarter of 2004, our communities in Las Vegas experienced improved traffic and new order activity during 2005. Cancellation rates in the Southwest for the year ended December 31, 2005 were approximately 16%, which was comparable with the same period in 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2005, cancellation rates were 19% compared with 34% during the same period in 2004. California: The California operations were impacted by weakened demand for new homes, evidenced by increased resale inventories and pricing pressures, especially in Sacramento. During 2006, these factors contributed to a decrease in net new orders, unit settlements and average selling prices in California. Net new orders for the fourth quarter of 2006 decreased 13% to 940 units, and for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased 32% to 4,090 units, compared with the same periods in 2005. During 2006, reduced new order sign up activity resulted in higher cancellation rates. For the fourth quarter of 2006 cancellation rates were approximately 35% compared with 31% for the same period in 2005 while cancellation rates for the year ended December 31, 2006 were approximately 36% compared with 24% for the same period in 2005. California operating results were impacted during the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006 by valuation adjustments to land inventory of $37.5 million and $55.6 million, respectively, in addition to a $95.4 million land valuation adjustment recorded during the fourth quarter of 2006 for two of our unconsolidated joint ventures located in Sacramento. During the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, we also recorded charges of $18.8 million and $33.1 million, respectively, for the write off of deposits and pre acquisition costs associated with transactions we no longer plan to pursue primarily in the Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay Area markets, which resulted in a reduction of lots controlled of 9,200 and 19,300, respectively. There were no significant land valuation and net realizable adjustments or write offs taken during the same periods in 2005 and 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2005, our California operations contributed positively to our Homebuilding operating results, evidenced by increased revenues and higher average selling prices and profits compared with 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005, net new orders increased 14% to 6,041 units compared with the same period in 2004. For the fourth quarter of 2005, net new orders decreased 6% to 1,083 units compared with the prior year period. At December 31, 2005, unit backlog decreased 9% to 2,299 units compared with December 31, 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2005, our California operations were impacted by weakened demand for new homes evidenced by increased resale inventories and pricing pressures, especially in Sacramento. In addition, the closeout of a large, successful active adult community which contributed significantly to our operations impacted the California reporting segment during the fourth quarter of 2005 and contributed to the decrease in net new orders, unit settlements and average selling price during this period. Cancellation rates for the year ended December 31, 2005 were approximately 24%, compared with 15% for the year ended December 31, 2004. 30 Table of Contents Financial Services Operations We conduct our financial services business, which includes mortgage and title operations, through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries. We originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various credit arrangements, and then sell such mortgage loans monthly to outside investors. Also, we sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts. Due to the short period of time the servicing rights are held, we do not amortize the servicing asset. Since the servicing rights are recorded based on the value in the servicing sales contracts, there are no impairment issues related to these assets. The following table presents mortgage origination data for our Financial Services operations: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Total originations: Loans 40,269 42,994 35,232 Principal ($000s omitted) $ 8,683,500 $ 8,528,600 $ 6,739,200 Originations for Pulte customers: Loans 40,117 42,302 32,290 Principal ($000s omitted) $ 8,642,900 $ 8,397,600 $ 6,268,100 Pre tax income of our financial services operations was $115.5 million, $70.6 million, and $47.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Mortgage origination unit volume decreased 6%, while mortgage origination principal volume increased 2% for the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease in unit volume is attributable to lower home settlements in 2006 compared with 2005, offset by a higher capture rate in 2006 compared with 2005, while the increase in origination principal volume is attributable to a higher average loan size. For the year ended December 31, 2005, mortgage origination unit and principal volume increased 22% and 27%, respectively, over 2004. This growth can be attributed to increases in the capture rate of 140 basis points to 89.2% in 2005 combined with the volume increases experienced in our homebuilding business and an increase in average loan size. Our capture rate represents loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percent of total loan opportunities, excluding cash settlements, from our homebuilding business. Our homebuilding customers continue to account for the majority of total loan production, representing nearly 100% of Pulte Mortgage unit production for 2006, compared with 98% in 2005 and 92% in 2004. Adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) represented 28% of total funded origination dollars and 22% of total funded origination units for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with 45% and 39%, respectively, in 2005 and 43% and 42%, respectively, in 2004. Interest only mortgages, a component of ARMs, represented 79% of ARMs origination dollars and 81% of ARMs origination units for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with 65% and 56% in 2005, and 42% and 30%, respectively, in 2004. Interest only mortgages represented 22%, 29%, and 18%, respectively, of total funded origination dollars for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004. Refinancings represented 1% of total loan production in 2006 and 2005, compared with 3% in 2004. Our customers average FICO scores for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 were 743, 741, and 737, respectively. Combined Loan to Value was 82% for the year ended December 31, 2006, and 81% for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. At December 31, 2006, loan application backlog was $2.1 billion, compared with $4.2 billion and $3.5 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Pre tax income increased 64% for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with 2005, primarily due to the sale of our investment in Su Casita, a Mexico based mortgage banking company. As a result of this transaction, we recognized a pre tax gain of approximately $31.6 million ($20.1 million after tax). Excluding this gain, pre tax income increased 19% in 2006 compared with 2005, due to the combination of increased origination principal volume and a shift in product mix to more profitable loans. In 2006, 21% of total origination dollars were from brokered loans, which are less profitable to us, compared with 26% in 2005. Mortgage origination fees of $15.5 million in 2006 were $5.2 million, or 25%, lower than the $20.7 million recorded for the same period in 2005. The 25% decrease over the same period in 2005 is due to a shift in product mix towards funded production. Pre tax income increased 49% for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with 2004, due to increased volume and a favorable product mix shift to funded, from non funded originations. In 2005, 26% of total origination dollars were from brokered loans, which are less profitable to us, compared with 36% in 2004. Mortgage origination fees of $20.7 million in 2005 were $0.2 million, or 1%, higher than the $20.5 million recorded for the same period in 2004. The 1% increase over the same period in 2004 is due to higher revenues per loan as brokered origination volume decreased 7% in 2005 when compared with 2004. 31 Table of Contents Financial Services Operations (continued) The net gain from sale of mortgages of $110.8 million in 2006 was $29.7 million, or 37%, higher than the $81.1 million recorded for the same period in 2005. This favorable variance was due primarily to an increase in loans available for sale combined with a favorable shift in product mix in 2006 when compared to 2005. Net interest income in 2006 was $9.8 million, or 2%, lower than the $10 million for the same period in 2005. The decrease was primarily due to a lower net interest margin partially offset by higher funded origination volume. Income from our title operations was $20 million in 2006, a decrease of 10% over 2005, due primarily to a decrease in the number of homes closed in 2006 compared to 2005. Selling, general and administrative expense increased $10.2 million, or 13%, from 2005, due primarily to higher operating expenses. Our minority interest in Su Casita, a Mexican mortgage banking company, contributed income from operations of approximately $350 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2005. During February 2005, 25% of our investment in the capital stock of Su Casita was redeemed for a gain of approximately $620 thousand. Our remaining interest of 16.66% was accounted for under the cost method of accounting and therefore no income was recorded for periods subsequent to the sale. Income from Su Casita for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $4 million. In February 2006, we completed the sale of our remaining investment in Su Casita for approximately $50 million, and realized a pre tax gain of approximately $31.6 million related to the transaction. We hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed mortgage loans with derivative financial instruments. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not recognize any material net gains or losses related to an ineffective portion of the hedging instrument. We also did not recognize any material net gains or losses during 2005 for cash flow hedges that were discontinued because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur. At December 31, 2006, we expect to reclassify $978 thousand, net of taxes, of net gains on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next twelve months as sales of mortgage backed securities occur. 32 Table of Contents Other non operating Other non operating expenses, net consists of income and expenses related to corporate services provided to our subsidiaries. These expenses are incurred for financing, developing and implementing strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies, and providing the necessary administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Accordingly, these results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve. The following table presents results of operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Net interest expense $ 531 $ 43,344 $ 47,372 Other expenses, net 42,569 49,050 43,313 Loss before income taxes $ 43,100 $ 92,394 $ 90,685 Net interest expense was $531 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with approximately $43.3 million and $47.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These variances are the result of an increase in the amount of interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory. Changes in other expenses, net for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, compared with prior years were primarily due to changes in compensation related costs. Additionally, during 2004 we recognized income from the sale and adjustment to fair value of various non operating parcels of commercial land held for sale. Interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory is charged to home cost of sales based on the cyclical timing of our unit settlements over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. During 2006 and 2005, interest in homebuilding inventory increased compared with the prior years due to increased amounts of interest capitalized based on our homebuilding inventory and debt levels. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2006, $16 million of capitalized interest related to inventory impairment write offs was expensed. Information related to corporate interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory is as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Interest in homebuilding inventory at beginning of year $ 229,798 $ 223,591 $ 200,584 Interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory 261,486 185,792 156,056 Interest expensed to homebuilding cost of sales (255,688 ) (179,585 ) (133,049 ) Interest in homebuilding inventory at end of year $ 235,596 $ 229,798 $ 223,591 Interest incurred * $ 266,561 $ 234,024 $ 205,176 * Interest incurred includes interest on our senior debt, short term borrowings, and other financing arrangements and excludes interest incurred by our financial services operations. 33 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations First Heights In September 2003, the United States Court of Federal Claims issued final judgment that Pulte Homes, Inc., Pulte Diversified Companies, Inc. and First Heights (collectively, the Pulte Parties) had been damaged by approximately $48.7 million as a result of the United States governments breach of contract with them. The final judgment follows the Courts August 17, 2001 ruling that the United States breached the contract related to the Pulte Parties 1988 acquisition of five savings and loan associations by enacting Section 13224 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. The United States government and the Pulte Parties filed Notices of Appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in October 2003. In August 2005, the United States Court of Appeals affirmed the United States Court of Federal Claims judgment, in its entirety, that we had been damaged by approximately $48.7 million as a result of the United States governments breach of contract in connection with the enactment of Section 13224 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. In December 2005, we received payment of the judgment in the amount of $48.7 million, which was recorded as income from discontinued operations. In September 2005, First Heights received notice confirming the voluntary dissolution of the First Heights Bank. The Office of Thrift Supervision also canceled First Heights charter. Accordingly, the day to day activities of First Heights, which had been principally devoted to supporting residual regulatory compliance matters and the litigation with the United States government, have now ceased. W e also recorded non cash, after tax gains of $7.8 million and $10.8 million, during the third quarter of 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters relating to our former thrift operation, which was discontinued in 1994. Mexico In January 2005, the minority shareholders of Pulte Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V. (Pulte Mexico) exercised a put option under the terms of a reorganization agreement dated as of December 31, 2001, to sell their shares to us, the consummation of which resulted in our owning 100% of Pulte Mexico. In March 2005, we purchased 60% of the minority interest of Pulte Mexico for approximately $18.7 million in cash. In June 2005, we purchased the remaining 40% of the minority interest of Pulte Mexico for approximately $12.5 million in cash. We assigned approximately $17.6 million of the purchase price premium to house and land inventory, which was amortized through cost of sales as homes were sold. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed, of $5.3 million, was recorded as goodwill. In December 2005, we sold substantially all of our Mexico homebuilding operations to a consortium of purchasers involved in residential and commercial real estate development. The disposition of the Mexico homebuilding operations will allow us to invest additional resources in the U.S. housing market. We realized cash of $131.5 million related to the sale. The sale of these operations did not include our investment in the capital stock of a mortgage company in Mexico as well as various non operating entities, which are not considered to be material to our results of operations or our financial position. Revenues of these discontinued operations were $201 million and $185.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, discontinued Mexico homebuilding operations reported total after tax income (losses) of ($1.5) million and $4.4 million, respectively. Results of Mexico homebuilding operations, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, resulted in pre tax operating income of $4.6 million and $8.2 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized a pre tax loss of $6.6 million (after tax loss of $13.1 million) related to the sale of our Mexico homebuilding operations. The pre tax loss on sale includes the accounting recognition of the economic losses related to accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments of $7.6 million, which had previously been reported in other comprehensive income, as well as the write off of $5.3 million of goodwill related to the 2005 acquisition of the minority shareholder interests. At December 31, 2005, the Mexico homebuilding operations have been presented as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements, while previously they were included in our Homebuilding operations. Certain amounts previously reported in the 2004 financial statements and notes thereto were reclassified to conform to the 2005 presentation. Concurrent with the sale of the Mexico homebuilding operations, we elected to repatriate all of our earnings from our Mexico operations in accordance with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Internal Revenue Code Section 965, Temporary Dividends Received Deduction) and recorded $4.8 million of related income taxes, which have been included in the Mexico loss on sale from discontinued operations. For the year ended December 31, 2006, loss from discontinued operations included a provision of $2.3 million, net of taxes, which resulted from a contractual adjustment related to the December 2005 disposition of the our Mexico homebuilding operations. 34 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations (continued) Argentina In January 2005, we sold all of our Argentina operations to an Argentine company involved in residential and commercial real estate development. The disposition of these operations was intended to improve our overall returns. At December 31, 2004, the Argentina operations were classified as held for sale and presented as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements, while previously they were included in our Homebuilding operations. Revenues of these discontinued Argentine operations were $24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2004 discontinued Argentine operations reported total after tax losses of $22 million. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Argentina operations reported after tax operating losses of $1.4 million. In addition, we recognized a pre tax loss of $33.2 million ($20.6 million after tax) on the write down of the Argentina operations to fair value less costs to sell. The pre tax loss includes the accounting recognition of the economic losses related to accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments of $25.1 million ($15.6 million after tax), which had previously been reported in other comprehensive income. For the year ended December 31, 2006, loss from discontinued operations included a provision of $111 thousand, net of taxes, which resulted from a contractual adjustment related to the January 2005 disposition of our Argentine operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources We finance our homebuilding land acquisition, development and construction activities by using internally generated funds and existing credit arrangements. We routinely monitor current operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate the use of available financing sources, including securities offerings. At December 31, 2006, we had cash and equivalents of $551.3 million and $3.5 billion of senior notes outstanding. Other financing included non recourse collateralized financing totaling $26.9 million. Sources of our working capital include our cash and equivalents, our $2.01 billion committed unsecured revolving credit facility and Pulte Mortgages $955 million committed credit arrangements and other uncommitted borrowing arrangements. Our ratio of debt to total capitalization, excluding our collateralized debt related to financial services, was approximately 35% at December 31, 2006, and approximately 31.2% net of cash and equivalents. Pulte Mortgage provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available pursuant to various committed and uncommitted credit arrangements. At December 31, 2006, Pulte Mortgage had committed credit arrangements of $955 million, comprised of a $405 million bank revolving credit facility and a $550 million asset backed commercial paper program. In May 2006, Pulte Mortgage amended its revolving credit facility, which included amendments to its restrictive covenants. In August 2006, Pulte Mortgage amended the bank credit agreement related to its asset backed commercial paper program, which also included amendments to its restrictive covenants. Both amended credit agreements now require Pulte Mortgage to maintain a consolidated tangible net worth of at least $50 million or eighty five percent of the average month end tangible net worth for the last twelve months of the preceding calendar year and funded debt cannot exceed 15 times tangible net worth. Our income tax liability and related effective tax rate are affected by a number of factors. In 2006, our effective tax rate was 36.3% compared with 36.9% in 2005 and 37.6% in 2004. The reduction in the effective tax rate for 2006 was primarily due to an adjustment for the Section 199 manufacturing deduction, a change in the overall state tax rate associated with the geographical mix in income and certain other tax matters. The reduction in the effective tax rate for 2005 was principally due to the Section 199 manufacturing deduction established by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2007 will be approximately 37%. Our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to $267.5 million, while net cash provided by operating activities was $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2004, net cash used in operating activities was $692.2 million. In 2006, decreased net income and an increase in deferred income taxes were offset by the write down of land and deposits and pre acquisition costs of $409.5 million. In 2005 and 2004, increased net income was offset primarily by significant investments in land inventory. 35 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Cash used in investing activities was $86.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $25.3 million and $198.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We invested approximately $65.8 million, net of cash acquired, to purchase the remaining 50% of an entity that installs basic building components and operating systems. In addition, we received cash of $49.2 million for the sale of our investment in Su Casita, a Mexico based mortgage banking company. Also, we made $58.2 million of capital contributions to and received $67.4 million in capital distributions from our unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2006. Further we incurred approximately $98.6 million in capital expenditures to support the growth of our business. The change in net cash used in investing activities from 2004 to 2005 primarily relates to proceeds from the sale of subsidiaries during 2005 of $142.9 million, increases in distributions from unconsolidated entities of $41.9 million, offset by increases in capital expenditures of $13.7 million. During 2005, we invested approximately $37.3 million in three new joint ventures that develop and or sell land within the United States. Also, we contributed $124.6 million of additional capital contributions to and received $108 million in capital distributions from our unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2005. Further, we incurred approximately $88.9 million in capital expenditures to support the growth of our business. During January 2004, we invested $35 million for a 50% ownership in an entity that supplies and installs basic building components and operating systems. During 2004, we invested approximately $117.8 million in new joint ventures that develop and or sell land in the United States. Also, we contributed $44.2 million of additional capital contributions to and received $66.1 million in capital distributions from our unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $96.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Cash inflows from financing activities are primarily attributed to the issuance of $150 million, 7.375% senior notes and $8.4 million from the issuance of common stock. Cash outflows from financing activities are primarily attributed to $78.3 million repayment of Pulte Mortgages collateralized short term debt, $19.8 million payment of non recourse collateralized financing, $122.3 million used to repurchase our common stock, and $40.9 million of cash dividends paid to shareholders. Net cash provided by financing activities was $700.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Cash inflows from financing activities are primarily attributed to proceeds from our $350 million, 5.2% senior notes and $300 million, 6% senior notes issued in February 2005, proceeds from Pulte Mortgages line of credit of approximately $275.6 million, proceeds from non recourse collateralized financing arrangements of approximately $46.8 million, and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $31.2 million. Cash outflows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily relate to the repayment of our $125 million, 7.3% senior notes in October 2005, approximately $33.6 million of cash dividends paid to our shareholders, and $143.2 million used to repurchase our common stock. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $809.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Cash inflows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 are primarily attributed to proceeds received from our $500 million, 5.25% senior notes issued in January 2004 and our $400 million, 4.875% senior notes issued in July 2004 and $44 million of cash received from the exercise of stock options. Cash outflows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily relate to the repayment of our $112 million, 8.375% senior notes in August 2004, redemption of the remaining $77 million of Del Webb 10.25% senior subordinated notes in February 2004, approximately $25.4 million of cash dividends paid to our shareholders, $44.9 million used to repay borrowings, and $14.7 million used to repurchase our common stock. In May 2006, we sold $150 million of 7.375% senior notes, which mature on June 1, 2046, which are guaranteed by us and certain of our 100% owned subsidiaries. These notes are unsecured and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The notes are redeemable at any time on or after June 1, 2011, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. Proceeds from the sale were used to repay the indebtedness of our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including continued investment in our business. In August 2006, we increased the borrowing availability under our 4 year unsecured revolving credit facility from $1.66 billion to $2.01 billion. The credit facility includes an uncommitted accordion feature, under which the credit facility may be increased to $2.25 billion. We have the capacity to issue letters of credit up to $1.125 billion. Borrowing availability is reduced by the amount of letters of credit outstanding. The credit facility contains restrictive covenants, the most restrictive of which requires us not to exceed a debt to total capitalization ratio of 60% and also requires us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2:1 (EBITDA to interest incurred), as defined in the agreement. As of December 31, 2006, we had no borrowings outstanding and $1.45 billion available for borrowing under this facility. Pursuant to the two $100 million stock repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors in October 2002 and 2005, and the $200 million stock repurchase authorization in February 2006 (for a total stock repurchase authorization of $400 million), we have repurchased a total of 9,688,900 shares for a total of $297.7 million. At December 31, 2006, we had remaining authorization to purchase $102.3 million of common stock. 36 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Inflation We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation also increases our financing, labor and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006: Payments Due by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 After 2011 Contractual obligations: Long term debt (a) $ 6,703,950 $ 227,839 $ 855,678 $ 1,107,116 $ 4,513,317 Operating lease obligations 287,360 58,575 96,598 57,581 74,606 Other long term liabilities (b) 27,295 19,945 7,350 Total contractual obligations (c) $ 7,018,605 $ 306,359 $ 959,626 $ 1,164,697 $ 4,587,923 (a) Represents our senior notes and related interest payments (b) Represents our non recourse collateralized financing arrangements and related interest payments (c) We do not have any payments due in connection with capital lease or purchase obligations We are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts (including option contracts) for the purchase, development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business. Option contracts for the purchase of land enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we are ready to build homes on them. This reduces our financial risks associated with long term land holdings. At December 31, 2006, we had agreements to acquire approximately 71,800 homesites through option contracts and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At December 31, 2006, we had $369.5 million of non refundable option deposits and advanced costs related to certain of these agreements. The following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2006: Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 After 2011 Other commercial commitments: Guarantor revolving credit facilities (a) $ 2,010,000 $ $ $ 2,010,000 $ Non guarantor revolving credit facilities (b) 955,000 550,000 405,000 Standby letters of credit (c) 32,184 32,184 Total commercial commitments (d) $ 2,997,184 $ 582,184 $ 405,000 $ 2,010,000 $ (a) Includes capacity to issue up to $1.125 billion in standby letters of credit, of which $559 million was outstanding at December 31, 2006. (b) Includes credit facility of $405 million and $550 million asset backed commercial paper program. (c) Excludes standby letters of credit issued under the Guarantor revolving credit facilities. (d) Excludes performance and surety bonds of approximately $1.8 billion, which typically do not have stated expiration dates. 37 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We use standby letters of credit and performance bonds to guarantee our performance under various contracts, principally in connection with the development of our projects. The expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related homebuilding projects. If the obligations related to a project are ongoing, annual extensions of the letters of credit are typically granted on a year to year basis. At December 31, 2006, we had outstanding letters of credit of $591.2 million. Performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These bonds, which approximated $1.8 billion at December 31, 2006, are typically outstanding over a period of approximately 3 5 years. We do not believe that we will be required to draw upon any such letters of credit or performance bonds. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land option or option type agreements in order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future. At December 31, 2006, these agreements totaled approximately $4.3 billion. Pursuant to these land option agreements, we provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future, usually at predetermined prices. If the entity holding the land under option is a variable interest entity, our deposit represents a variable interest in that entity. At December 31, 2006, we consolidated certain variable interest entities with assets totaling $43.6 million. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, aggregate outstanding debt of unconsolidated joint ventures was $935.9 million and $882.2 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, our proportionate share of joint venture debt was approximately $312.8 million and $297.9 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we provided non recourse debt guarantees for $304.1 million and $293.4 million, respectively, of joint venture debt. Accordingly, we may be liable, on a contingent basis, through limited guarantees with respect to a portion of the secured land acquisition and development debt. However, we would not be liable other than in instances of fraud, misrepresentation or other bad faith actions by us, unless the joint venture was unable to perform its contractual borrowing obligations. As of December 31, 2006, we do not anticipate that we will incur any significant costs under these guarantees that have not already been recognized in our impairment analysis, as further discussed in Note 4 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we recognized equity income (loss) from our unconsolidated joint ventures of $(62.9) million, $75.4 million and $60.1 million, respectively. The equity loss recognized during the year ended December 31, 2006 includes land valuation adjustments of $95.4 million, which relate to two of our joint ventures located in Sacramento, California. In accordance with their debt guarantees, these joint ventures are required to maintain a certain ratio of value of the collateral (generally land and improvements) as a specified percentage of the loan balance. If we are required to make a payment to bring the loan balance below the specified percentage of the loan balance, the payment would constitute a capital contribution or loan to the unconsolidated entity and increase our share of any funds the unconsolidated entity distributes, if they are available. The land valuation adjustments recorded during 2006 include all significant costs expected at this time under such guarantees. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these consolidated financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements, giving due regard to materiality. Revenue recognition Homebuilding Homebuilding revenue and related profit are generally recognized at the time of the closing of the sale, when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. In situations where the buyers financing is originated by Pulte Mortgage, our wholly owned mortgage subsidiary, and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment as required by SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, the profit on such sales is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a third party investor has been completed. 38 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Financial Services Mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors. Servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance, or a contracted set fee in the case of certain sub servicing, and are credited to income when related mortgage payments are received. Loan origination fees, commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred as an adjustment to the cost of the related mortgage loan until such loan is sold. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold. Interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold. Loans are placed on non accrual status once they become greater than 90 days past due their contractual terms. Subsequent payments received are applied according to the contractual terms of the loan. Inventory valuation Our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated costs or net realizable value. Included in inventories are all direct development costs. Inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated cost, unless they are determined to be impaired, in which case these inventories are measured at fair value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory adjustments may be required. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, we record valuation adjustments on land inventory and related communities under development when events and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired and when the cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. Additionally, we also value long lived assets for sale at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories. Interest capitalized each quarter is identified as a separate layer in our capitalized interest balance sheet pool. Each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development. Interest expense is allocated to the quarters over the amortization period based on the cyclical timing of unit settlements. Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis. Under the specific identification basis, cost of sales includes the construction cost of the home, an average lot cost by project based on land acquisition and development costs, and closing costs and commissions. Construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home, plus an accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid, based on an analysis of budgeted construction cost. This accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared to the amount accrued, and adjustments are made if needed. Total project land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared to actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete. Adjustments to estimated total project land acquisition and development costs for the project affect the amount of future lots costed prospectively. Residential mortgage loans available for sale Residential mortgage loans available for sale are stated at the lower of aggregate cost or market value. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold. We hedge our residential mortgage loans available for sale. Gains and losses from closed commitments and futures contracts are matched against the related gains and losses on the sale of mortgage loans. An allowance for credit losses is established when specific loans are identified as probable of foreclosure and loss. Additionally, an allowance is provided based on historical losses applied against the most recent quarter of funded production. Goodwill and intangible assets We have recorded certain intangible assets and goodwill, most of which relate to the Del Webb merger in 2001. Intangible assets, primarily trademarks and tradenames, were valued using proven valuation procedures and are amortized over their estimated useful life. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing. The carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use. If our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly, intangible assets and goodwill may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material. If we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment, we measure impairment based on several accepted valuation methods. For assets related to ongoing operations, we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists and then measure impairment using discounted cash flows. For assets to be disposed of, we assess the fair value of the asset based on current market conditions for similar assets. For goodwill, we assess fair value by measuring discounted cash flows of our reporting units and measure impairment as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded book value. The estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control. Changes in these estimates could result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and material charges to the results of operations. 39 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Allowance for warranties Home purchasers are provided with warranties against certain building defects. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary geographically. Most warranties cover different aspects of the homes construction and operating systems for a period of up to ten years. We estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim. We periodically assess the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. Although we have not made significant adjustments to the accrual in the past, actual warranty cost in the future could differ from our current estimate. Insurance We have, and require the majority of our subcontractors to have, general liability, property, errors and omissions, workers compensation and other business insurance. These insurance policies protect us against a portion of the risk of loss from claims, subject to certain self insured retentions, deductibles, and other coverage limits. Through our captive insurance subsidiaries, we reserve for costs to cover our self insured and deductible amounts under those policies and for any costs of claims and lawsuits, based on an analysis of our historical claims, which include an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. As of January 1, 2006, we are also self insured for certain of our medical and dental claims and reserve for costs to cover our liability for such claims, based on analysis of historical claims, which include an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Stock based compensation The Company currently has several stock based compensation plans for its employees (Employee Plans) and nonemployee directors (the Director Plan). The Employee Plans primarily provide for the grant of options (both non qualified options and incentive stock options as defined in each respective plan), stock appreciation rights and restricted stock to key employees of the Company or its subsidiaries (as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors) for periods not exceeding ten years. Options granted under the Employee Plans vest incrementally in periods ranging from six months to four years. Under the Director Plan, nonemployee directors are entitled to an annual distribution of 3,600 shares of common stock and options to purchase an additional 7,000 shares. All options granted under the Director Plan are non qualified, vest immediately and are exercisable on the date of grant. Options granted under the Director Plan are exercisable for ten years from the grant date. On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payments, which is a revision of SFAS No. 123 and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends SFAS Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. We calculate the fair value of stock options using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions, which involve a number of variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, the expected dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior. In addition, we also use judgment in estimating the number of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited. The Company adopted SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective method of transition. Accordingly, prior periods have not been restated. The adoption of SFAS 123(R) did not have a significant effect on basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2006. Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company accounted for its stock based awards under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. The Company selected the prospective method of adoption as permitted by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. Under the prospective method, the Company recognized compensation expense on an accelerated basis over the vesting period based on the fair value provisions of SFAS No. 123. New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our rate sensitive financing to the extent long term rates decline. The following tables set forth, as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, our rate sensitive financing obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value ($000s omitted). As of December 31, 2006 for the Years ended December 31, There Fair 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 after Total Value Rate sensitive liabilities: Fixed interest rate debt: Senior notes $ $ $ 400,000 $ $ 698,563 $ 2,450,000 $ 3,548,563 $ 3,584,523 Average interest rate 4.88 % 7.95 % 6.24 % 6.42 % Non recourse collateralized financing $ 19,755 $ 3,484 $ 3,650 $ $ $ $ 26,889 $ 26,889 Average interest rate .31 % 1.25 % 2.37 % .71 % As of December 31, 2005 for the Years ended December 31, There Fair 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 after Total Value Rate sensitive liabilities: Fixed interest rate debt: Senior notes $ $ $ $ 400,000 $ $ 2,998,563 $ 3,398,563 $ 3,421,959 Average interest rate 4.88 % 6.58 % 6.38 % Non recourse collateralized financing $ 18,051 $ 5,700 $ 3,949 $ 933 $ $ $ 28,633 $ 28,633 Average interest rate .89 % 1.80 % 1.27 % 8.25 % 1.36 % Pulte Mortgage, operating as a mortgage banker, is also subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed upon terms (i.e., commit to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2006 and 2005, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float. We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to LIBOR and A1/P1 commercial paper rates and (ii) hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments. These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in long term mortgage rates of plus 50, 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results. At December 31, 2006, our aggregate net investment exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk includes our remaining non operating investments in Mexico, which approximated $3.5 million. 41 Table of Contents SPECIAL NOTES CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS As a cautionary note, except for the historical information contained herein, certain matters discussed in Item 1A., Risk Factors, Item 7., Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the Reform Act).
