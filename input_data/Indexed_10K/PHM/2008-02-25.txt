ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview During 2007 and 2006, the U.S. housing market was impacted by a lack of consumer confidence, decreased housing affordability, and large supplies of resale and new home inventories and related pricing pressures. During 2007, these conditions continued to deteriorate and were accompanied by increased foreclosure activity and constraints on the availability of certain mortgage financing products. These factors contributed to weakened demand for new homes, slower sales, higher cancellation rates, and increased price discounts and selling incentives to attract homebuyers compared with recent years when we had experienced record growth. The combination of these homebuilding industry and related mortgage financing developments resulted in significant decreases in our revenues and profitability during 2007. Additionally, we incurred total land related charges of $2 billion and $409.5 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, which represent significant increases from land related charges of $30 million in 2005. We also recorded impairments of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures totaling $189.9 million and $95.4 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, and goodwill impairments of $370 million in 2007. We continue to operate our business with the expectation that difficult market conditions will continue to impact us for at least the near term. We expect these trends in our unit settlements and pricing to continue and the majority of the markets we serve to remain challenging throughout 2008. We have adjusted our approach to land acquisition and development and construction practices and continue to shorten our land pipeline, limit land development expenditures, reduce production volumes, and balance home price and profitability with sales pace. We are delaying planned land purchases and development spending and have significantly reduced our total number of controlled lots owned and under option. Additionally, we are significantly reducing the number of speculative homes put into production. While we will continue to purchase select land positions where it makes strategic and economic sense to do so, we currently anticipate minimal investment in new land parcels in the near term. We have also closely evaluated and made significant reductions in employee headcount and overhead expenses. In May 2007, we announced a restructuring plan designed to reduce costs and improve ongoing operating efficiencies, which resulted in related charges of $45.7 million in 2007. Given the persistence of these difficult market conditions, improving the efficiency of our overhead costs will continue to be a significant area of focus. We believe that these measures will help to strengthen our market position and allow us to take advantage of opportunities that may develop in the future. Given the continued weakness in new home sales and closings, visibility as to future earnings performance is limited. Our outlook is tempered with caution, as conditions in many of the markets we serve across the United States have become increasingly challenging. Our evaluation for land related charges recorded to date assumed our best estimates of cash flows for the communities tested. If conditions in the homebuilding industry worsen in the future or if our strategy related to certain communities changes, we may be required to evaluate our assets, including additional projects, for additional impairments or write downs, which could result in additional charges that might be significant. The following is a summary of our operating results for 2007, 2006, and 2005 ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Pre tax income (loss): Homebuilding $ (2,509,492 ) $ 1,010,368 $ 2,298,822 Financial Services 42,980 115,460 70,586 Other non operating (30,391 ) (43,100 ) (92,394 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes (2,496,903 ) 1,082,728 2,277,014 Income taxes (benefit) (222,486 ) 393,082 840,126 Income (loss) from continuing operations (2,274,417 ) 689,646 1,436,888 Income (loss) from discontinued operations 18,662 (2,175 ) 55,025 Net income (loss) $ (2,255,755 ) $ 687,471 $ 1,491,913 Per share data assuming dilution: Income (loss) from continuing operations $ (9.02 ) $ 2.67 $ 5.47 Income (loss) from discontinued operations 0.07 (0.01 ) 0.21 Net income (loss) $ (8.94 ) $ 2.66 $ 5.68 19 Table of Contents Overview (continued) The following is a comparison of pre tax income (loss) for 2007, 2006, and 2005: Homebuilding pre tax loss for 2007 was $2.5 billion compared with Homebuilding pre tax income of $1 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, for 2006 and 2005. The pre tax loss experienced in 2007 resulted from lower settlement revenues combined with lower gross margins. In addition, for 2007 and 2006, results of operations were affected by land related charges totaling $2 billion and $409.5 million, respectively, and impairments of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures of $189.9 million and $95.4 million, respectively. Gross margins in 2007 were unfavorably impacted by lower selling prices and increased sales incentives. Land related charges for 2007 and 2006 consisted of write offs of deposits and other related costs for land transactions we no longer plan to pursue ($239.7 million and $151.2 million, respectively), net realizable valuation adjustments related to land positions sold or held for sale ($199.2 million and $54.6 million, respectively), and impairments on land assets related to communities under development or to be developed in the future ($1.6 billion and $203.8 million, respectively). In addition, we incurred goodwill impairment charges of $370 million in 2007. There were no significant land related charges in 2005. Pre tax income from our Financial Services business segment decreased 63% in 2007 compared with 2006 after increasing 64% in 2006 compared with 2005. Pre tax income for 2006 includes a one time gain of $31.6 million related to the sale of our investment in Su Casita, a Mexican mortgage banking company, which occurred in the first quarter of 2006. The significant decrease in 2007 is also the result of lower loan originations due to significant decreases in the number of homes closed as well as increased loan loss reserves. Capture rates were 92%, 91%, and 89% in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Our Other non operating loss decreased 29% in 2007 compared with 2006 after decreasing 53% in 2006 compared with 2005, due primarily to reductions in compensation related costs. 20 Table of Contents Homebuilding Operations The following table presents a summary of pre tax income (loss) for our Homebuilding operations ($000s omitted): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Home sale revenue (settlements) $ 8,881,509 $ 13,975,387 $ 14,370,667 Land sale revenue 240,221 99,861 157,569 Home cost of sales (a) (9,329,354 ) (11,544,905 ) (11,005,591 ) Land cost of sales (b) (418,177 ) (138,528 ) (139,377 ) Selling, general, and administrative expenses (1,060,818 ) (1,136,027 ) (1,107,816 ) Equity income (loss) (c) (190,383 ) (95,244 ) 72,604 Other income (expense), net (d) (632,490 ) (150,176 ) (49,234 ) Pre tax income (loss) $ (2,509,492 ) $ 1,010,368 $ 2,298,822 Unit settlements 27,540 41,487 45,630 Average selling price $ 322 $ 337 $ 315 Net new orders: Units 25,175 33,925 47,531 Dollars (e) $ 7,812,000 $ 11,253,000 $ 15,518,000 Backlog at December 31: Units 7,890 10,255 17,817 Dollars $ 2,510,000 $ 3,580,000 $ 6,301,000 (a) Includes homebuilding interest expense, which represents the amortization of capitalized interest. Home cost of sales also includes land and community valuation adjustments of $1.6 billion, $203.8 million, and $7.7 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. (b) Includes net realizable value adjustments for land held for sale of $199.2 million, $54.6 million, and $3.1 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. (c) Includes impairments of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, which totaled $189.9 million and $95.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. (d) Includes the write off of deposits and other related costs for land option contracts we no longer plan to pursue of $239.7 million, $151.2 million, and $19.2 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. For 2007, other income (expense) includes goodwill impairment charges of $370 million. For 2006, other income (expense) also includes $18.6 million related to the closure of our production facility in Virginia. (e) Net new order dollars represent a composite of new order dollars combined with other movements of the dollars in backlog related to cancellations and change orders. Home sale revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 were lower than those for the prior year by approximately $5.1 billion, or 36%. Unit settlements decreased 34% in 2007 to 27,540 units, compared with 2006 and increased 9% for 2006 to 41,487 units, compared with 2005. The average selling price for homes closed in 2007, 2006, and 2005 was $322,000, $337,000, and $315,000, respectively. The changes in average selling price reflect a combination of factors, including changes in product mix and geographic mix of homes closed during the period as well as lower market selling prices. The average selling price decreased in the majority of our Homebuilding segments during 2007. Homebuilding gross profit margins from home sales in 2007 were negative 5%, compared with positive 17.4% in 2006. In 2006, homebuilding gross profit margins decreased 600 basis points from 23.4% in 2005. The significant decreases in gross profit margins that commenced in 2006 and continued into 2007 were attributable to the difficult market conditions and challenging sales environment where we have realized lower average selling prices and increased sales incentives related to homes closed during the year. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144), we recorded land and community valuation adjustments of $1.6 billion and $203.8 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, which included capitalized interest of $110.8 million and $16 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. There were no significant valuation adjustments recorded during the year ended December 31, 2005. 21 Table of Contents Homebuilding Operations (continued) We acquire land primarily for the construction of our homes for sale to homebuyers. We select locations for development of homebuilding communities after completing extensive market research, enabling us to match the location and product offering with our targeted consumer group. Where we develop land, we engage directly in many phases of the development process, including land and site planning, obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals, as well as constructing roads, sewers, water and drainage facilities, and other amenities. We will often sell select parcels of land within or adjacent to our communities to retail and commercial establishments. We also will, on occasion, sell lots within our communities to other homebuilders. Gross profit from land sales had negative margin contributions of $178 million and $38.7 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, compared with a positive margin contribution of $18.2 million for 2005. Land sale revenues and their related gains/losses may vary significantly between periods, depending on the timing of land sales. We continue to evaluate our existing land positions to ensure the most effective use of capital. Land held for disposition was $252.6 million as of December 31, 2007, compared with $465.8 million at December 31, 2006. During 2007 and 2006, we recorded net realizable value adjustments for land held for sale of $199.2 and $54.6 million, respectively. There were no significant net realizable value adjustments in 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2007, selling, general, and administrative expenses, as a percentage of home settlement revenues, increased 380 basis points to 11.9% compared with 2006, after increasing 40 basis points to 8.1% in 2006 compared with 2005. These increases are attributable primarily to reduced overhead leverage as a result of the significant decrease in revenues, lower absorption into inventory of overhead costs due to lower construction volume, net increases in insurance related expenses of $57.7 million and $15.5 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, and employee severance benefits, including $32 million of severance benefits related to the restructuring plan initiated in May 2007. Equity loss was $190.4 million and $95.2 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, compared with equity income of $72.6 million for 2005. The equity losses experienced for 2007 and 2006 included impairments related to investments in unconsolidated joint ventures totaling $189.9 million and $95.4 million, respectively. Additionally, the decrease in 2006 equity income, compared with the prior year, is also the result of our January 2006 acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in an entity that supplies and installs basic building components and operating systems. As a result of this acquisition, we own 100% of this entity, which is consolidated in our financial statements. In 2005, earnings for this investment were recorded in equity income. In addition, earnings from our 50% investment in a Nevada based joint venture, related to the sale of commercial and residential properties, decreased in 2006 as the venture substantially completed its operations in 2005. Other income (expense), net includes the write off of deposits and other related costs resulting from decisions not to pursue certain land acquisitions and options, insurance related expenses and settlements, and other non operating expenses. The changes in other income (expense), net are due in part to write offs of deposit and other related costs during 2007, 2006, and 2005 of $239.7 million, $151.2 million, and $19.2 million, respectively. These write offs vary in amount from year to year as we continue to evaluate potential land acquisitions for the most effective use of capital. Other income (expense), net also includes goodwill impairment charges of $370 million in 2007 and charges of $2.3 million and $18.5 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to the closure of a production facility located in Virginia. 22 Table of Contents Homebuilding Operations (continued) For 2007, unit net new orders decreased 26% to 25,175 units compared with 2006. For 2006, unit net new orders decreased 29% to 33,925 units, compared with 2005. Cancellation rates were 33%, 29%, and 17% in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Most markets experienced a substantial increase in resale and new home inventory, and this, combined with declining consumer confidence, decreased housing affordability, increased interest rates, difficulties experienced by customers in selling their existing homes, and the more restrictive mortgage financing market, has resulted in higher cancellation rates and reduced net new orders during 2007 and 2006. The dollar value of net new orders decreased 31% for 2007 compared with 2006 and decreased 27% for 2006 compared with 2005. The average selling price of net new orders decreased 7% to $310,000 in 2007 after increasing 2% to $332,000 in 2006. At December 31, 2007, we had 636 active selling communities, a decrease of 8% from December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, we had 690 active selling communities, an increase of 4% from December 31, 2005. Ending backlog, which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed, was 7,890 units at December 31, 2007 with a dollar value of $2.5 billion. Ending backlog was 10,255 units at December 31, 2006 with a dollar value of $3.6 billion. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, our Homebuilding operations controlled approximately 157,900 and 232,200 lots, respectively. Approximately 131,400 and 158,800 lots were owned, and approximately 24,800 and 63,700 lots were under option agreements approved for purchase at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In addition, there were approximately 1,700 and 9,700 lots under option agreements, pending approval, at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. During 2007, we withdrew from land option contracts representing approximately 43,900 lots valued at $2.4 billion. The total purchase price related to approved land under option for use by our Homebuilding operations at future dates approximated $1.5 billion at December 31, 2007. In addition, total purchase price related to land under option pending approval was valued at approximately $95.1 million at December 31, 2007. Land option agreements, which may be cancelled at our discretion, may extend over several years and are secured by deposits and advanced costs totaling $226.2 million, of which $3.7 million is refundable. This balance excludes $25.8 million of contingent payment obligations which may or may not become actual obligations of the Company. 23 Table of Contents Homebuilding Segment Operations The Homebuilding operations represent our core business. Homebuilding offers a broad product line to meet the needs of first time, first and second move up, and active adult homebuyers. We have determined our operating segments to be our Areas, which are aggregated into seven reportable segments based on similarities in the economic and geographic characteristics of our homebuilding operations. We conduct our operations in 51 markets, located throughout 26 states, and have presented our reportable homebuilding segments as follows: Northeast: Northeast Area includes the following states: Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia Southeast: Southeast Area includes the following states: Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee Florida: Florida Area includes the following state: Florida Midwest: Great Lakes Area includes the following states: Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio Central: Texas Area includes the following state: Texas Southwest: Southwest Area includes the following states: Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico *California: Northern California and Southern California Areas include the following state: California * Our homebuilding operations located in Reno, Nevada are reported in the California segment, while our Nevada homebuilding operations are reported in the Southwest segment. We also have one reportable segment for our financial services operations which consists principally of mortgage banking and title operations conducted through Pulte Mortgage and our other subsidiaries. Our Financial Services segment operates generally in the same markets as our Homebuilding segments. 24 Table of Contents Homebuilding Segment Operations (continued) The following table presents selected financial information for our homebuilding reporting segments: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Home sale revenue (settlements) ($000s omitted): Northeast $ 1,113,805 $ 1,650,129 $ 1,856,906 Southeast 1,173,485 1,254,337 950,792 Florida 1,087,918 2,209,864 2,247,513 Midwest 1,146,991 1,639,940 2,055,483 Central 575,541 894,450 793,273 Southwest 2,316,147 3,694,571 3,259,913 California 1,467,622 2,632,096 3,206,787 $ 8,881,509 $ 13,975,387 $ 14,370,667 Income (loss) before income taxes ($000s omitted): Northeast $ (149,793 ) $ 127,376 $ 326,399 Southeast 72,799 88,162 86,683 Florida (347,587 ) 381,924 475,939 Midwest (339,193 ) (90,695 ) 140,232 Central (121,351 ) 16,038 10,560 Southwest (249,173 ) 714,185 745,163 California (545,369 ) 107,368 654,940 Unallocated (a) (829,825 ) (333,990 ) (141,094 ) $ (2,509,492 ) $ 1,010,368 $ 2,298,822 Unit settlements: Northeast 2,573 3,489 3,909 Southeast 3,990 4,504 4,127 Florida 4,007 7,374 8,784 Midwest 3,888 5,548 7,344 Central 2,623 4,815 4,959 Southwest 7,318 10,548 10,237 California 3,141 5,209 6,270 27,540 41,487 45,630 Net new orders units: Northeast 2,447 2,813 4,019 Southeast 3,563 4,632 4,888 Florida 4,047 4,501 8,383 Midwest 3,319 5,201 7,701 Central 2,371 4,323 5,776 Southwest 6,609 8,365 10,723 California 2,819 4,090 6,041 25,175 33,925 47,531 Unit backlog: Northeast 791 917 1,593 Southeast 1,281 1,708 1,580 Florida 1,252 1,212 4,085 Midwest 828 1,397 1,744 Central 870 1,122 1,614 Southwest 2,010 2,719 4,902 California 858 1,180 2,299 7,890 10,255 17,817 (a) Unallocated includes amortization of capitalized interest of $315 million, $255.7 million, and $179.6 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively; goodwill impairment of $370 million for 2007; and shared services that benefit all operating segments, the costs of which are not allocated to the operating segments reported above. 25 Table of Contents Homebuilding Segment Operations (continued) Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Controlled Lots: Northeast 13,152 27,524 44,088 Southeast 17,170 23,332 31,863 Florida 35,348 48,640 70,434 Midwest 14,098 23,082 47,414 Central 13,023 18,320 28,251 Southwest 49,746 66,034 97,290 California 15,321 25,291 43,275 157,858 232,223 362,615 Land and community valuation adjustments ($000s omitted): Northeast $ 116,418 $ 22,206 $ Southeast 17,089 1,083 Florida 283,919 22,715 Midwest 240,380 73,152 7,110 Central 97,615 3,269 608 Southwest 335,044 9,774 California 398,717 55,569 Total segment land and community valuation adjustments 1,489,182 187,768 7,718 Corporate and unallocated (a) 114,473 16,000 Total valuation adjustments $ 1,603,655 $ 203,768 $ 7,718 Net realizable value adjustments (NRV) land held for sale ($000s omitted): Northeast $ 16,051 $ 3,204 $ Southeast 6,652 14 Florida 27,633 5,596 Midwest 103,374 29,784 314 Central 19,140 8,679 2,756 Southwest 14,859 7,014 California 11,538 293 Total NRV adjustments land held for sale 199,247 $ 54,570 $ 3,084 Write off of deposits and pre acquisition costs ($000s omitted): Northeast $ 60,863 $ 33,798 $ 2,931 Southeast 3,114 4,514 2,194 Florida 46,763 25,108 1,119 Midwest 10,940 31,644 7,590 Central 5,302 3,987 1,767 Southwest 54,870 21,013 2,283 California 57,864 33,102 2,548 Total segment write off of deposits and pre acquisition costs 239,716 153,166 20,432 Corporate and unallocated (1,981 ) (1,237 ) Total write off of deposits and pre acquisition costs $ 239,716 $ 151,185 $ 19,195 Impairments of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures: Southwest $ 59,075 $ $ California 128,303 95,400 Corporate and unallocated (b) 2,485 Total joint venture impairments $ 189,863 $ 95,400 $ (a) Corporate and unallocated includes $110.8 million and $16 million, respectively, of write offs of capitalized interest related to land and community valuation adjustments recorded during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 and $3.7 million of land and community valuation adjustments related to our Puerto Rico operations for the year ended December 31, 2007. (b) Corporate and unallocated includes impairments of $2.5 million related to our joint ventures in Puerto Rico. 26 Table of Contents Homebuilding Segment Operations (continued) Northeast: For 2007, Northeast home sale revenues decreased 33% compared with the prior year period due to a 26% decrease in unit settlements combined with an 8% decrease in the average selling price, including significant home sale revenue reductions in our Metro New York market. The loss before income taxes was primarily attributable to this reduction in revenues combined with a significant decline in gross margin and $193.3 million in impairments and land related charges, which resulted in a reduction of approximately 12,800 lots under control. Northeast recorded impairments and land related charges of $59.2 million in 2006. Net new orders decreased 13% compared with 2006 while the cancellation rate increased to 24% compared with 22% in 2006. For 2006, Northeast operations experienced weakened demand for new homes primarily as a result of increases in existing home inventories. Home sale revenues in 2006 decreased 11% due to an 11% decrease in closings. Average sales prices in 2006 were consistent with 2005. For 2006, operating results were negatively impacted by $59.2 million of impairments and land related charges. There were no significant impairments or land related charges in 2005. Net new orders for 2006 decreased 30% compared with 2005. During 2006, increased cancellation rates were attributable to lower new order sign up activity and increased cancellations in all markets. Cancellation rates for 2006 were 22% compared with 14% for 2005. Southeast: Our Southeast segment continued to contribute positively to operating results in 2007 due to strength in local demographic factors and a continued shift in our product mix toward higher price point customers, especially active adult buyers as large active adult communities were opened in our markets in Georgia and the Carolinas at various points during 2006 and 2007. For 2007, Southeast home sale revenues decreased 6% compared with the prior year period as an 11% decrease in unit settlements was offset by a 6% increase in the average selling price. Income before income taxes decreased compared with the prior year period due to $26.9 million in impairments and land related charges, which resulted in a reduction of approximately 4,700 lots under control. Southeast recorded land related charges of $5.6 million in 2006. Net new orders declined by 23% compared with 2006 partially due to 2006 including new orders from the successful openings of our large active adult communities in our Charlotte, Raleigh, and Georgia markets. The cancellation rate in 2007 was 28% compared with 24% in 2006. For 2006, Southeast operations contributed positively to our Homebuilding operating results, evidenced by increased revenues and unit settlements as well as higher average selling prices and profits compared with prior year periods. The increases in the Southeasts profitability were attributable to a continued shift in product mix toward the active adult homebuyer. Additionally, we opened a new large active adult community in Charlotte during 2006. Southeast home sale revenues increased 32% compared with 2005 due to a 9% increase in unit settlements combined with a 21% increase in the average selling price. Our Southeast operations recorded impairments and land related charges of $5.6 million in 2006. There were no significant impairments or land related charges recorded in 2005. Net new orders in 2006 decreased 5% compared with 2005. The reduction in new orders during 2006 contributed to the increase in cancellation rates. Cancellation rates for 2006 were 24% compared with 18% for 2005. 27 Table of Contents Homebuilding Segment Operations (continued) Florida: Our Florida segment continues to be challenged due to the combination of a significant decrease in demand combined with high levels of new and existing home inventories, especially in the southern portion of the state. For 2007, Florida home sale revenues decreased 51% compared with the prior year period due to a 46% decrease in unit settlements combined with a 9% decrease in the average selling price, including significant home sale revenue reductions in our Orlando and Southwest Florida markets. The loss before income taxes was primarily attributable to this reduction in revenues combined with a significant decline in gross margin and $358.3 million in impairments and land related charges, which resulted in a reduction of approximately 7,700 lots under control. Florida recorded impairments and land related charges of $53.4 million in 2006. Net new orders declined by 10% due to the difficult market conditions. Cancellation rates for 2007 were 30%, which was comparable to the 2006 cancellation rate of 31%. During 2006, our Florida operations experienced weakened demand, largely attributable to increased existing home inventories, especially in Orlando and Naples/Ft. Myers. Florida experienced high cancellation rates and pricing pressures associated with excess inventories and aggressive sales incentives offered by competitors. Floridas home sale revenues decreased 2% compared with 2005, as a 16% decrease in unit settlements was offset by a 17% increase in average selling price. During 2006, we recorded impairments and land related charges of $53.4 million. There were no significant impairments and land related charges recorded in 2005. Net new orders for 2006 decreased 46% compared with 2005. For 2006, increased cancellation rates were attributable to lower new order sign up activity and increased cancellations in all Florida markets. For 2006, cancellation rates were approximately 31% compared with 12% for 2005. Midwest: Our Midwest segment continues to face difficult local economic conditions in the majority of its markets. For 2007, Midwest home sale revenues decreased 30% compared with the prior year period due to a 30% decrease in unit settlements, as all of our Midwest markets experienced home sale revenue reductions. Average selling prices were flat. The increase in the loss before income taxes was primarily attributable to this reduction in revenues and $354.7 million in impairments and land related charges, which resulted in a reduction of approximately 2,900 lots under control. Midwest recorded impairments and land related charges of $134.6 million in the prior year period. Net new orders declined by 36% due to the difficult market conditions. Cancellation rates were approximately 26% for 2007 compared with 20% for 2006. The Midwest operations were one of the most challenged areas in the country in 2006 as Cleveland and Michigan experienced weakened demand due to difficult local economic conditions. Midwest home sale revenues decreased 20% compared with 2005 as a 24% decrease in unit settlements was offset by a 6% increase in average selling price. For 2006, Midwest operating results were negatively impacted by impairments and land related charges of $134.6 million. There were no significant impairments or land related charges recorded in 2005. During 2006, reduced new order sign up activity resulted in higher cancellation rates. Net new orders in 2006 decreased 32% compared with 2005. For 2006, cancellation rates were approximately 20% compared with 17% for 2005. Central: For 2007, Central home sale revenues decreased 36% compared with the prior year period due to a 46% decrease in unit settlements, as all of our Central markets experienced home sale revenue reductions. This lower unit volume was partially offset by an 18% increase in average selling prices. The loss before income taxes was primarily attributable to this reduction in revenues and $122.1 million in impairments and land related charges, which resulted in a reduction of approximately 1,400 lots under control. Central recorded impairments and land related charges of $15.9 million in 2006. Net new orders declined by 45% due to the difficult market conditions. For 2007, cancellation rates were approximately 34% compared with 30% for 2006. For 2006, Central home sale revenue increased 13% compared with 2006 as a 3% decrease in unit settlements was offset by a 16% increase in average selling price. Higher average selling prices realized during 2006 were the result of unit settlements in new communities in Texas. During 2006, Central operating results were negatively impacted by impairments and land related charges of $15.9 million. There were no significant impairments or land related charges in 2005. Net new orders for 2006 decreased 25% compared with 2005. For 2006, cancellation rates were approximately 30% compared with 22% for 2005. 28 Table of Contents Homebuilding Segment Operations (continued) Southwest: Market conditions in our Arizona operations deteriorated markedly in 2007 while our Las Vegas and New Mexico markets remained challenged as well. For 2007, Southwest home sale revenues decreased 37% compared with the prior year period due to a 31% decrease in unit settlements combined with a 10% decrease in average selling prices, mostly due to home sale revenue reductions in our Las Vegas market. The loss before income taxes was primarily attributable to this decrease in revenues combined with a significant decline in gross margin and $404.8 million in impairments and land related charges, which resulted in a reduction of approximately 7,600 lots under control. In addition, Southwests results include impairments of $59.1 million related to two unconsolidated joint ventures. Southwest recorded impairments and land related charges of $37.8 million in 2006. Net new orders declined by 21% due to the difficult market conditions. Cancellation rates were approximately 37% for 2007 compared with 35% for 2006. In 2006, the Southwest operations contributed positively to our Homebuilding operating results, evidenced by increased revenues, unit settlements and higher average selling prices compared with 2005. Southwest home sale revenue increased 13% in 2006 due to a 3% increase in unit settlements combined with a 10% increase in average selling price. However, during 2006, our Southwest operations recorded impairments and land related charges of $37.8 million. There were no significant impairments or land related charges recorded in 2005. Operating results for the Southwest segment were positively impacted by our January 2006 acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in an entity that supplies and installs basic building components and operating systems in both Arizona and Nevada. During 2005, income from this entity was recorded as equity income and had no impact on segment pre tax income. Net new orders for 2006 decreased 22% compared with 2005. During 2006, reduced new order sign up activity resulted in higher cancellation rates. For 2006, cancellation rates were approximately 35% compared with 16% for 2005. California: Our California operations have been impacted by significantly weakened demand for new homes, affordability issues, and an excess supply of resale inventory in substantially all of our markets. For 2007, California home sale revenues decreased 44% compared with the prior year period due to a 40% decrease in unit settlements combined with an 8% decrease in average selling prices, as a majority of our California markets experienced home sale revenue reductions. The loss before income taxes was primarily attributable to this reduction in revenues combined with a significant decline in gross margin and $468.1 million in impairments and land related charges, which resulted in a reduction of approximately 6,900 lots under control. Also included in Californias results for 2007 is an impairment of $128.3 million related to unconsolidated joint ventures. In 2006, California recorded impairments and land related charges of $89 million and a $95.4 million valuation adjustment related to two of our unconsolidated joint ventures located in Sacramento. Net new orders declined by 31% in 2007 due to the difficult market conditions. Cancellation rates were approximately 43% for 2007 compared with 36% for 2006. The California segment was impacted in 2006 by weakened demand for new homes, evidenced by increased resale inventories and pricing pressures, especially in Sacramento. California home sale revenues decreased 18% in 2006 due primarily to a 17% decrease in unit settlements. Average selling prices remained consistent with 2005. In 2006, California recorded impairments and land related charges of $89 million and a $95.4 million valuation adjustment related to two of our unconsolidated joint ventures located in Sacramento. There were no significant impairments or land related charges recorded in 2005. During 2006, reduced new order sign up activity resulted in higher cancellation rates. Net new orders for 2006 decreased 32% compared with 2005. For 2006, cancellation rates were approximately 36% compared with 24% for 2005. 29 Table of Contents Financial Services Operations We conduct our Financial Services business, which includes mortgage and title operations, through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries. We originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various credit arrangements, and then sell such mortgage loans monthly to outside investors. Also, we sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts. Due to the short period of time the servicing rights are held, we do not amortize the servicing asset. Since the servicing rights are recorded based on the value in the servicing sales contracts, there are no impairment issues related to these assets. The following table presents selected financial information for our Financial Services operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Net gain from sale of mortgages $ 75,539 $ 110,759 $ 81,084 Mortgage origination and servicing fees 12,807 17,317 22,020 Interest income 21,807 33,494 25,961 Title services 20,802 29,833 29,496 Other revenues 3,814 3,193 2,853 Total Financial Services revenues 134,769 194,596 161,414 Expenses (92,150 ) (111,468 ) (93,574 ) Gain on sale of equity investment 31,635 Equity income 361 697 2,746 Income before income taxes $ 42,980 $ 115,460 $ 70,586 Total originations: Loans 23,404 40,269 42,994 Principal $ 5,336,400 $ 8,683,500 $ 8,528,600 Originations for Pulte customers: Loans 23,272 40,117 42,302 Principal $ 5,309,100 $ 8,642,900 $ 8,397,600 Mortgage origination unit volume and principal volume decreased 42% and 39%, respectively, in 2007 compared with 2006. The decreases in unit and principal volume are due primarily to lower home settlements in 2007 compared with 2006. This factor was partially offset by an increase in the capture rate to 92% in 2007 from 91% in 2006 as well as a higher average loan size. During 2006, mortgage origination unit volume decreased 6% while mortgage origination principal volume increased 2% compared with 2005. The decrease in unit volume is attributable to lower home settlements offset by a higher capture rate in 2006 (91%) compared with 2005 (89%), while the increase in origination principal volume is attributable to a higher average loan size. Our capture rate represents loan originations from our Homebuilding operations as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our Homebuilding operations, excluding cash settlements. Our Homebuilding customers continue to account for substantially all loan production, representing nearly 100% of Pulte Mortgage unit production for 2007 and 2006 compared with 98% in 2005. The mortgage industry experienced a significant shift away from adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) to fixed rate mortgages during 2007 and 2006. ARMs, which generally have a lower profit per loan than fixed rate products, represented 8% of total funded origination dollars and 6% of total funded origination units in 2007 compared with 28% and 22%, respectively, in 2006 and 45% and 39%, respectively, in 2005. Interest only mortgages, a component of ARMs, represented 74% of ARMs origination dollars and 72% of ARMs origination units in 2007 compared with 79% and 81%, respectively, in 2006 and 65% and 56%, respectively, in 2005. As a result, interest only mortgages represented 6%, 22%, and 29% of total funded origination dollars in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. 30 Table of Contents Financial Services Operations (continued) Our customers average FICO scores for 2007, 2006, and 2005 were 745, 743, and 741, respectively. Average Combined Loan to Value was 82% for both 2007 and 2006 and 81% for 2005. At December 31, 2007, our loan application backlog was $1.5 billion, compared with $2.1 billion and $4.2 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Based on principal dollars, approximately 4% of the loans we originated during 2007 were considered sub prime loans, which we define as first mortgages with FICO scores below 620. Approximately 14% of 2007 originations were considered Alt A loans, which we define as non full documentation first mortgages with FICO scores of 620 or higher. The remaining 82% of 2007 originations were prime loans, which we define as full documentation first mortgages with FICO scores of 620 or higher. Because we sell our loans monthly and retain only limited risk for sold loans for a short period of time, we believe that our Financial Services operations do not have any material direct risks related to sub prime and Alt A loans. However, the availability of certain mortgage financing products has become more constrained in 2007 as the mortgage industry is now more closely scrutinizing sub prime, Alt A, and other non conforming mortgage products. These developments have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the overall demand for new housing and thereby on the results of operations of both our Homebuilding and Financial Services businesses. Pre tax income decreased 63% in 2007 compared with 2006. During 2006, we sold our investment in Su Casita, a Mexico based mortgage banking company. As a result of this transaction, we recognized a pre tax gain of approximately $31.6 million in 2006. Excluding this gain, pre tax income decreased significantly in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily due to lower originations and increased loan loss reserves. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in average loan size and the shift in funded product mix toward fixed rate and agency loans, which are more profitable for us. The percentage of total origination dollars from brokered loans, which are funded by third party lenders and are therefore less profitable to us, was comparable in 2007 and 2006. Pre tax income increased 64% in 2006 compared with 2005, primarily due to the sale of our investment in Su Casita. Excluding this gain, pre tax income increased in 2006 compared with 2005 due to the combination of increased origination principal volume and a shift in product mix to more profitable loans, including a small decline in the mix from brokered loans. Interest income in 2007 was 35% lower than in 2006, primarily due to the significant decrease in loan origination volume offset slightly by higher loan yields. For 2006, interest income increased 29% compared with 2005, due to the increase in funded origination volume combined with higher loan yields. Revenues from our title operations decreased 30% in 2007 compared with 2006 due to the decline in loan origination volume and stayed fairly even in 2006 compared with 2005 based on the lack of significant change in origination principal volume. Expenses decreased significantly in 2007 due to the decrease in volume and reduced headcount offset by higher loan loss reserves and less leverage of our fixed operating costs. Since we sell the majority of our loans monthly and retain only limited risk related to the loans we originate, our overall loan loss reserves have historically not been significant. During 2007, however, we experienced increases in our loans held for investment, non performing portfolio loans, and foreclosed properties as well as higher expected losses on repurchased loans. As a result, our overall loan loss reserves increased to $11.7 million at December 31, 2007 compared with $1.7 million at December 31, 2006. We hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed mortgage loans with derivative financial instruments to minimize the impact of changes in interest rates. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 31 Table of Contents Other Non Operating Other non operating expenses consists of income and expenses related to corporate services provided to our subsidiaries. These expenses are incurred for financing, developing, and implementing strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies and providing the necessary administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Accordingly, these results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve. The following table presents results of operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Net interest (income) expense $ (2,731 ) $ 531 $ 43,344 Other expenses, net 33,122 42,569 49,050 Loss before income taxes $ 30,391 $ 43,100 $ 92,394 Our higher invested cash balances during 2007 resulted in interest income in excess of amounts expensed compared with net interest expense in 2006. The decrease in net interest expense in 2006 compared with 2005 was the result of an increase in the amount of interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory. Changes in other expenses, net for 2007 and 2006 compared with 2005 were primarily due to reductions in compensation related costs. Interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory is charged to home cost of sales based on the cyclical timing of our unit settlements over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. Interest expensed to homebuilding cost of sales for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 includes $110.8 and $16 million, respectively, related to land and community valuation adjustments. Information related to corporate interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory is as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Interest in homebuilding inventory at beginning of year $ 235,596 $ 229,798 $ 223,591 Interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory 240,000 261,486 185,792 Interest expensed to homebuilding cost of sales (314,998 ) (255,688 ) (179,585 ) Interest in homebuilding inventory at end of year $ 160,598 $ 235,596 $ 229,798 Interest incurred * $ 243,864 $ 266,561 $ 234,024 * Interest incurred includes interest on our senior debt, short term borrowings, and other financing arrangements and excludes interest incurred by our financial services operations. Income Taxes Our income tax assets and liabilities and related effective tax rate are affected by a number of factors. Income taxes were provided at an effective tax rate of 8.9%, 36.3%, and 36.9% for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The effective tax rate during 2007 was lower than in prior years primarily due to a $621.9 million non cash deferred tax valuation allowance. Excluding the valuation allowance and goodwill impairment charges, the effective tax rate would have been approximately 38% for 2007. 32 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations First Heights In 2005, we completed the disposal of First Heights, our former bank subsidiary. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, after tax income was $189 thousand and $56.5 million, respectively, and is included in income from discontinued operations. Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 includes $7.8 million related to the recognition of income tax benefits resulting from the favorable resolution of certain tax matters. We also received payment in December 2005 of a $48.7 million judgment resulting from litigation related to First Heights 1988 acquisition from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation and First Heights ownership of five failed thrifts. The payment was recorded as income from discontinued operations. Mexico Homebuilding Operations In January 2005, the minority shareholders of Pulte Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V. (Pulte Mexico) exercised a put option under the terms of a reorganization agreement dated as of December 31, 2001, to sell their shares to us, the consummation of which resulted in our owning 100% of Pulte Mexico. In March 2005, we purchased 60% of the minority interest of Pulte Mexico for approximately $18.7 million in cash. In June 2005, we purchased the remaining 40% of the minority interest of Pulte Mexico for approximately $12.5 million in cash. In December 2005, we sold substantially all of our Mexico homebuilding operations to a consortium of purchasers involved in residential and commercial real estate development. We realized cash of $131.5 million related to the sale. The sale of these operations did not include our investment in the capital stock of a mortgage company in Mexico as well as various non operating entities, which are not considered to be material to the Companys results of operations or its financial position. For 2007, 2006, and 2005, the Mexico homebuilding operations have been presented as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements. For 2007, income from discontinued operations represents $18.7 million in refundable income taxes related to our investment in our discontinued Mexico homebuilding operations. Argentina Operations In January 2005, we sold all of our Argentina operations to an Argentine company involved in residential and commercial real estate development. For the year ended December 31, 2006, loss from discontinued operations included a provision of $111 thousand, net of taxes, resulting from a contractual adjustment related to the disposition. Liquidity and Capital Resources We finance our homebuilding land acquisitions, development, and construction activities by using internally generated funds and existing credit arrangements. We routinely monitor current operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate the use of available financing sources, including securities offerings. Based on our current financial condition and credit relationships, we believe that our operations and borrowing resources will provide for our current and long term capital requirements. However, we continue to evaluate the impact of market conditions on our liquidity and may determine that modifications are necessary if market conditions continue to deteriorate or if the current difficult market conditions extend beyond our expectations. At December 31, 2007, we had cash and equivalents of $1.1 billion and $3.5 billion of senior notes outstanding. Other financing included non recourse collateralized financing totaling $9.4 million. Sources of our working capital include our cash and equivalents, our committed unsecured revolving credit facility, and Pulte Mortgages committed credit arrangements. Our ratio of debt to total capitalization, excluding our land collateralized and Pulte Mortgage debt, was 44.6% at December 31, 2007, and approximately 35.9% net of cash and equivalents. We amended our unsecured revolving credit facility twice during 2007, decreasing the borrowing capacity from $2.01 billion to $1.86 billion and extending the maturity date from October 2010 to June 2012. In February 2008, we amended the credit facility again and decreased the borrowing capacity to $1.6 billion. Under the terms of the credit facility, we have the capacity to issue letters of credit totaling up to $1.125 billion. Borrowing availability is reduced by the amount of letters of credit outstanding. The credit facility includes a borrowing base limitation when we do not have an investment grade senior unsecured debt rating from at least two of Fitch Ratings, Moodys Investor Service, and Standard and Poors Corporation. Under the borrowing base limitation, the sum of our senior debt and the amount drawn on the revolving credit facility may not exceed an amount based on certain percentages of various categories of our unencumbered inventory and other assets. 33 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) The credit facility contains certain financial covenants. We are required to not exceed a debt to total capitalization ratio of 55%, and we are required to meet a tangible net worth minimum each quarter. At December 31, 2007, our debt to total capitalization ratio (as defined in the credit facility) was 42.6% while our tangible net worth (as defined in the credit facility) cushion was $818.5 million after giving effect to the February 2008 amendment. In the event market conditions deteriorate in the future and result in additional significant land related charges, our tangible net worth may come close to or fall below the required minimum. Violations of any of the covenants in the credit facility, if not cured or waived by the lenders, could result in an optional maturity date acceleration by the lenders. In the event this were to occur, we would seek to replace the financing provided by the credit facility. The credit facility no longer contains an interest coverage ratio covenant that could create an event of default for us, but if the interest coverage ratio (as defined in the credit facility) is less than 2 to 1, LIBOR margin and letter of credit pricing under the credit facility can increase in increments ranging from 0.125% to 0.375% and the debt to total capitalization ratio covenant threshold can decrease in increments of 2.5%. The credit facilitys uncommitted accordion feature remains unchanged at $2.25 billion. As of December 31, 2007, we had no borrowings outstanding and $1.41 billion available for borrowing under this facility. Pulte Mortgage provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available pursuant to various committed and uncommitted credit arrangements. At December 31, 2007, Pulte Mortgage had committed credit arrangements of $705 million, comprised of a $405 million bank revolving credit facility and a $300 million asset backed commercial paper program. Due to the reduced loan origination volume and unfavorable changes in the asset backed commercial paper market, Pulte Mortgage amended its commercial paper program twice during 2007, which, among other things, reduced the capacity from $550 million to the $300 million available at December 31, 2007. In February 2008, Pulte Mortgage further amended the commercial paper program to reduce the capacity to $150 million. After giving effect to the most recent amendment, Pulte Mortgage has committed credit arrangements of $555 million, comprised of a $405 million bank revolving credit facility and a $150 million commercial paper program. The credit agreements require Pulte Mortgage to maintain a consolidated tangible net worth of at least $50 million or eighty five percent of the average month end tangible net worth for the last twelve months of the preceding calendar year ($52.8 million for 2008) and funded debt cannot exceed 15 times tangible net worth. Pulte Mortgage had $440.6 million outstanding under its committed credit arrangements at December 31, 2007. We have experienced downgrades in our credit ratings during 2007 by each of the major credit rating agencies. While such downgrades do not directly impact our senior notes, they could increase the cost of borrowing under our unsecured revolving credit facility and limit our ability to obtain additional financing or refinancing on favorable terms. In the event of additional downgrades, the lenders under Pulte Mortgages asset backed commercial paper program may have the right at their discretion to require early repayment of outstanding balances or place other restrictions on our ability to utilize the asset backed commercial paper program. In the event of such an occurrence, we believe we have capacity through other sources to meet Pulte Mortgages anticipated financing needs. Our net cash provided by operating activities in 2007 amounted to $1.2 billion while net cash used in operating activities was $267.5 million in 2006. For 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was $18.7 million. The primary drivers of cash flow from operations are profitability and investments in inventory. In 2007, the net loss was largely attributable to non cash asset impairments, including land related charges, impairments of goodwill and investments in unconsolidated entities, and a deferred tax valuation allowance. In addition, we significantly reduced our investments in land inventory in light of the challenging conditions in the homebuilding industry. In 2006, the reduced profitability compared with 2005 was coupled with significant investments in land inventory. In 2005, net income was offset primarily by significant investments in land inventory. Cash used in investing activities was $221.4 million in 2007 compared with $86.7 million in 2006 and $25.3 million in 2005. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2007 compared with 2006 resulted primarily from investments of $217.5 million in unconsolidated entities. The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2006 compared with 2005 resulted primarily from the use of $65.8 million, net of cash acquired, to purchase the remaining 50% of an entity that installs basic building components and operating systems. In addition, we received cash of $49.2 million in 2006 for the sale of subsidiaries and equity investments, primarily resulting from the sale of our Mexico homebuilding operations. 34 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net cash used in financing activities totaled $487.6 million and $96.2 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, compared with net cash provided by financing activities of $700.4 million in 2005. The cash used in financing activities in 2007 and 2006 were largely attributable to reductions in outstanding borrowings under various credit arrangements as the result of the lower volumes in our Homebuilding and Financial Services operations. Offsetting this to some degree in 2007 was a significant reduction in stock repurchases under our stock repurchase programs. The cash provided by financing activities in 2005 resulted primarily from increased borrowings under our Pulte Mortgage credit arrangements to fund the increase in funded loan originations and the issuance of $650 million in senior notes to help fund additional investments in land inventory. Pursuant to the two $100 million stock repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors in October 2002 and 2005, and the $200 million stock repurchase authorization in February 2006 (for a total stock repurchase authorization of $400 million), we have repurchased a total of 9,688,900 shares for a total of $297.7 million. There were no repurchases under these programs during 2007. We had remaining authorization to purchase common stock aggregating $102.3 million at December 31, 2007. Inflation We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation may also increase our financing, labor, and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. While we attempt to pass to our customers increases in our costs through increased sales prices, the current industry conditions have resulted in lower sales prices in many of our markets. If we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs, or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly, affecting our prospective homebuyers ability to adequately finance home purchases, our revenues, gross margins, and net income would be adversely affected. Seasonality We experience variability in our quarterly results from operations due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry. Historically, we have experienced significant increases in revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home settlements. 35 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007: Payments Due by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 After 2012 Contractual obligations: Long term debt (a) $ 6,408,960 $ 224,857 $ 772,008 $ 1,051,604 $ 4,360,491 Operating lease obligations 239,537 56,118 81,714 38,888 62,817 Other long term liabilities (b) 10,465 4,677 4,833 955 Total contractual obligations (c) $ 6,658,962 $ 285,652 $ 858,555 $ 1,091,447 $ 4,423,308 (a) Represents our senior notes and related interest payments. (b) Represents our non recourse collateralized financing arrangements and related interest payments. (c) We do not have any payments due in connection with capital lease or purchase obligations. We are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts (including option contracts) for the purchase, development, and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business. Option contracts for the purchase of land enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we are ready to build homes on them. This reduces our financial risks associated with long term land holdings. At December 31, 2007, we had agreements to acquire approximately 26,500 homesites through option contracts and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At December 31, 2007, we had $222.5 million of non refundable option deposits and advanced costs related to certain of these agreements. We are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state jurisdictions. We are also subject to income tax in certain foreign jurisdictions related to operations previously sold or discontinued. As of December 31, 2007, we had $86.2 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits and $21.1 million and $12.1 million of related accrued interest and penalties, respectively. We are currently under examination by various taxing jurisdictions and anticipate finalizing the examinations with certain jurisdictions within the next twelve months. However, the final outcome of these examinations is not yet determinable. The statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for tax years 1998 2006. The following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2007: Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period ($000s omitted) Total 2008 2009 20010 2011 2012 After 2012 Other commercial commitments: Guarantor revolving credit facilities (a) $ 1,860,000 $ $ $ 1,860,000 $ Non guarantor revolving credit facilities (b) 705,000 300,000 405,000 Standby letters of credit (c) 46,549 39,699 6,850 Total commercial commitments (d) $ 2,611,549 $ 339,699 $ 411,850 $ 1,860,000 $ (a) Includes capacity to issue up to $1.125 billion in standby letters of credit, of which $447 million was outstanding at December 31, 2007. In February 2008, we amended the credit facility and decreased the borrowing capacity to $1.6 billion. (b) Includes credit facility of $405 million and $300 million asset backed commercial paper program. In February 2008, we amended the commercial paper program to reduce the capacity to $150 million. (c) Excludes standby letters of credit issued under the Guarantor revolving credit facilities. (d) Excludes performance and surety bonds of approximately $1.5 billion, which typically do not have stated expiration dates. 36 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We use standby letters of credit and performance bonds to guarantee our performance under various contracts, principally in connection with the development of our projects. The expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related homebuilding projects. If the obligations related to a project are ongoing, annual extensions of the letters of credit are typically granted on a year to year basis. At December 31, 2007, we had outstanding letters of credit of $493.6 million. Performance bonds and surety bonds do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These bonds, which approximated $1.5 billion at December 31, 2007, are typically outstanding over a period of approximately 3 5 years. We do not believe that there will be draws upon any such letters of credit or performance bonds. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land option or option type agreements in order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future. At December 31, 2007, these agreements totaled approximately $1.6 billion. Pursuant to these land option agreements, we provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future, usually at predetermined prices. If the entity holding the land under option is a variable interest entity, our deposit represents a variable interest in that entity. At December 31, 2007, we consolidated certain variable interest entities with assets totaling $20.8 million. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, aggregate outstanding debt of unconsolidated joint ventures was $602.5 million and $935.9 million, respectively. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, our proportionate share of joint venture debt was approximately $134 million and $312.8 million, respectively. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we provided non recourse debt guarantees for $124.5 million and $304.1 million, respectively, of joint venture debt. In the case of most joint ventures, we have agreed to indemnify the joint ventures lenders for certain environmental contingencies, and most guarantee arrangements provide that we are responsible for our proportionate share of the outstanding debt if the joint venture voluntarily files for bankruptcy. We would not be responsible under these guarantees unless the joint venture was unable to meet its contractual borrowing obligations or in instances of fraud, misrepresentation, or other bad faith actions by us. For 2007, 2006, and 2005, we recognized equity income (loss) from our unconsolidated joint ventures of $(190) million, $(62.9) million, and $75.4 million, respectively. The equity loss recognized during 2007 and 2006 includes land valuation adjustments of $189.9 million and $95.4 million, respectively, which relate to certain of our joint ventures located in our California and Southwest reportable segments. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these consolidated financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements, giving due regard to materiality. Revenue recognition Homebuilding Homebuilding revenue and related profit are generally recognized at the time of the closing of the sale, when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. In situations where the buyers financing is originated by Pulte Mortgage, our wholly owned mortgage subsidiary, and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment as required by SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, the profit on such sales is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a third party investor has been completed. 37 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Financial Services Mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors. Servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance, or a contracted set fee in the case of certain sub servicing arrangements, and are credited to income when related mortgage payments are received. Loan origination fees, commitment fees, and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred as an adjustment to the cost of the related mortgage loan until such loan is sold. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold. Interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold. Loans are placed on non accrual status once they become greater than 90 days past due their contractual terms. Subsequent payments received are applied according to the contractual terms of the loan. Inventory valuation Inventories are stated at accumulated cost unless certain facts indicate such cost would not be recovered from the cash flows generated by future disposition. In this instance, such inventories are measured at fair value in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144). Accumulated cost includes costs associated with land acquisition, land development, and home construction costs, including interest, real estate taxes, and certain direct and indirect overhead costs related to development and construction. We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories. Interest capitalized each quarter is identified as a separate layer in our capitalized interest balance sheet pool. Each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development. Interest expense is allocated to the quarters over the amortization period based on the cyclical timing of unit settlements. Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis. Under the specific identification basis, cost of sales includes the construction cost of the home, an average lot cost based on expected land acquisition and development costs for the project, as well as closing costs and commissions applicable to the home. Construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home, plus an appropriate accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid, based on an analysis of budgeted construction cost. This accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared with the amount accrued, and adjustments are made if needed. Total project land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared with actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete. Adjustments to estimated total land acquisition and development costs for the project affect the amounts costed for the projects remaining lots. Residential mortgage loans Residential mortgage loans available for sale are stated at the lower of aggregate cost or market value. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold. We hedge our residential mortgage loans available for sale. Gains and losses from closed commitments and futures contracts are matched against the related gains and losses on the sale of mortgage loans. Loans held for investment consist of interim financing mortgage loans for certain of our customers as well as a portfolio of loans that either have been repurchased from investors or were not saleable upon closing. These loans are carried at cost and reviewed for impairment when recoverability becomes doubtful. Goodwill and intangible assets We have recorded certain intangible assets and goodwill, most of which relate to the Del Webb merger in 2001. Intangible assets, primarily trademarks and tradenames, were valued using proven valuation procedures and are amortized over their estimated useful life. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing. The carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use. If our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly, intangible assets and goodwill may be impaired. If we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment, we measure impairment based on several accepted valuation methods. For assets related to ongoing operations, we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists and then measure impairment using discounted cash flows. For assets to be disposed of, we assess the fair value of the asset based on current market conditions for similar assets. For goodwill, we assess fair value by measuring discounted cash flows of our reporting units and measure impairment as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded book value. The estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control. 38 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Allowance for warranties Home purchasers are provided with warranties against certain building defects. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary geographically. Most warranties cover different aspects of the homes construction and operating systems for a period of up to ten years. We estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim. We periodically assess the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. Although we have not made significant adjustments to the accrual in the past, actual warranty cost in the future could differ from our current estimate. Insurance We have, and require the majority of our subcontractors to have, general liability, property, errors and omissions, workers compensation, and other business insurance. These insurance policies protect us against a portion of the risk of loss from claims, subject to certain self insured retentions, deductibles, and other coverage limits. Through our captive insurance subsidiaries, we reserve for costs to cover our self insured and deductible amounts under those policies and for any costs of claims and lawsuits, based on an analysis of our historical claims, which includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. We are also self insured for certain of our medical and dental claims and reserve for costs to cover our liability for such claims, based on analysis of historical claims, which include an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Stock based compensation On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, which is a revision of SFAS No. 123 and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends SFAS Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. We calculate the fair value of stock options using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions, which involve a number of variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, the expected dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior. In addition, we also use judgment in estimating the number of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited. The Company adopted SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective method of transition. Accordingly, prior periods have not been restated. The adoption of SFAS 123(R) did not have a significant effect on basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2006. Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company accounted for its stock based awards under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. The Company selected the prospective method of adoption as permitted by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. Under the prospective method, the Company recognized compensation expense on an accelerated basis over the vesting period based on the fair value provisions of SFAS No. 123. Income taxes The Company calculates its provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible or carryback to prior tax years. In determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Companys financial statements or tax returns, judgment is required. Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial position. New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our rate sensitive financing to the extent long term rates decline. The following tables set forth, as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, our rate sensitive financing obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates, and estimated fair value ($000s omitted). As of December 31, 2007 for the Years ended December 31, There Fair 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 after Total Value Rate sensitive liabilities: Fixed interest rate debt Senior notes $ $ 338,812 $ $ $ 698,563 $ 2,450,000 $ 3,487,375 $ 2,962,634 Average interest rate 4.88 % 7.95 % 6.24 % 6.45 % Non recourse collateralized financing $ 4,120 $ 3,490 $ 890 $ 890 $ $ $ 9,390 $ 9,390 Average interest rate 5.65 % 5.57 % 7.25 % 7.25 % 5.93 % As of December 31, 2006 for the Years ended December 31, There Fair 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 after Total Value Rate sensitive liabilities: Fixed interest rate debt: Senior notes $ $ $ 400,000 $ $ 698,563 $ 2,450,000 $ 3,548,563 $ 3,584,523 Average interest rate 4.88 % 7.95 % 6.24 % 6.42 % Non recourse collateralized financing $ 19,755 $ 3,484 $ 3,650 $ $ $ $ 26,889 $ 26,889 Average interest rate .31 % 1.25 % 2.37 % .71 % Pulte Mortgage, operating as a mortgage banker, is also subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed upon terms (i.e., commit to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2007 and 2006, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float. We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to LIBOR and A1/P1 commercial paper rates and (ii) hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments. These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury future contracts, and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in long term mortgage rates of plus 50, 100, and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results. At December 31, 2007, our aggregate net investment exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk includes our remaining non operating investments in Mexico, which approximated $5 million. 40 Table of Contents SPECIAL NOTES CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS As a cautionary note, except for the historical information contained herein, certain matters discussed in Item 1A., Risk Factors, Item 7., Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the Reform Act).
