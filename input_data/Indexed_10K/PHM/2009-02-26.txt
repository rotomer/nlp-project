ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Since early 2006, the U.S. housing market has been unfavorably impacted by a lack of consumer confidence, decreased housing affordability, tightened mortgage standards, and large supplies of resale and new home inventories and related pricing pressures. These factors have contributed to weakened demand for new homes, slower sales, higher cancellation rates, and increased price discounts and sales incentives to attract homebuyers. During 2008, these conditions continued to deteriorate and were accompanied by increased foreclosure activity, constraints on the availability of certain mortgage financing products, increasing unemployment, and significant uncertainty in the U.S. economy. As a result of the combination of these homebuilding industry, mortgage financing, and broader economic factors, we have experienced a net loss in each quarter since the fourth quarter of 2006. Such losses resulted from a combination of reduced operational profitability and significant asset impairments. Since the beginning of 2006, we have incurred total land related charges of $4.3 billion and goodwill impairments of $375.7 million. We continue to operate our business with the expectation that difficult market conditions will continue to impact us for at least the near term. We expect these trends in our unit settlements and pricing to continue and the majority of the markets we serve to remain challenging throughout 2009. We have adjusted our approach to land acquisition and development and construction practices and continue to shorten our land pipeline, limit land development expenditures, reduce production volumes, and balance home price and profitability with sales pace and cash flow at each of our communities. We are delaying planned land purchases and development spending and have significantly reduced our total number of controlled lots owned and under option. Additionally, we are closely managing the number of speculative homes put into production. While we will continue to purchase select land positions where it makes strategic and economic sense to do so, we anticipate minimal investment in new land parcels in the near term. We have also closely evaluated and made significant reductions in employee headcount and overhead expenses. As a result of these actions, we incurred restructuring charges of $45.5 million during 2008. In May 2007, we announced a restructuring plan designed to reduce costs and improve ongoing operating efficiencies, which resulted in related charges of $45.7 million in 2007. Due to the persistence of these difficult market conditions, improving the efficiency of our overhead costs will continue to be a significant area of focus. We believe that these measures will help to strengthen our market position and allow us to take advantage of opportunities that may develop in the future. The U.S. economy is currently undergoing a period of economic uncertainty, and the related financial markets are experiencing significant volatility. In response, the U.S. government has made significant efforts in recent months to stabilize these conditions and increase the regulatory oversight of the financial markets. These actions have included: The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, which was enacted into law in July 2008. Overall, the act is intended to help stabilize and add consumer confidence to the housing industry. However, the act also mandates certain changes to which the industry will have to adjust, such as the elimination of down payment assistance programs for FHA loans. Such programs were utilized for approximately 8% of our home closings in 2008. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which was enacted into law in October 2008. In addition to providing additional liquidity into the financial markets, the act also provides for additional measures to be used to prevent future home foreclosures. Modifications to the Real Estate Settlement and Procedures Act (RESPA) regarding the use by homebuilders of affiliated businesses, such as captive mortgage and title insurance providers. As specific interpretations of the application of certain of these modifications are not yet final, it is unclear as to the magnitude of the impact, if any, that these modifications will have on our business. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which was enacted into law in February 2009. The act is intended to provide additional economic stimulus to the U.S. economy and, among other things, provides for expansion of an existing housing tax credit, an increase to FHA loan limits, various individual tax reductions, and significant increases in government spending for certain programs. While the ultimate impact of laws already enacted are not yet known, thus far, these actions have not proven stimulative for the homebuilding industry. Due to the uncertainties as to the provisions that may be included in any future legislation, we can not estimate the impact that such new laws, if enacted, would have on our business or future results of operations. 20 Table of Contents Overview (continued) If the current trends in economic conditions or financial market volatility continue, it could adversely affect our business and results of operations in future periods, including a further reduction in the demand for housing as well as difficulties in accessing financing on acceptable terms. Given these conditions and the continued weakness in new home sales and closings, visibility as to future earnings performance is limited. Our evaluation for land related charges recorded to date assumed our best estimates of cash flows for the communities tested. If conditions in the homebuilding industry or our local markets worsen in the future, or if our strategy related to certain communities changes, we may be required to evaluate our assets, including additional projects, for further impairments or write downs, which could result in future charges that might be significant. The following is a summary of our operating results for 2008, 2007, and 2006 ($000s omitted, except per share data): Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Income (loss) before income taxes: Homebuilding $ (1,694,711 ) $ (2,509,492 ) $ 1,010,368 Financial Services 28,045 42,980 115,460 Other non operating (15,933 ) (30,391 ) (43,100 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes (1,682,599 ) (2,496,903 ) 1,082,728 Income taxes (benefit) (209,486 ) (222,486 ) 393,082 Income (loss) from continuing operations (1,473,113 ) (2,274,417 ) 689,646 Income (loss) from discontinued operations 18,662 (2,175 ) Net income (loss) $ (1,473,113 ) $ (2,255,755 ) $ 687,471 Per share data assuming dilution: Income (loss) from continuing operations $ (5.81 ) $ (9.02 ) $ 2.67 Income (loss) from discontinued operations 0.07 (0.01 ) Net income (loss) $ (5.81 ) $ (8.94 ) $ 2.66 The following is a comparison of income (loss) before income taxes for 2008, 2007, and 2006: Our Homebuilding loss before income taxes for 2008 was $1.7 billion compared with a loss before income taxes of $2.5 billion in 2007 and income before income taxes of $1.0 billion for 2006. The losses experienced in 2008 and 2007 resulted from lower settlement revenues combined with lower gross margins and significant land related charges and impairments of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. Gross margins in 2008 and 2007 were unfavorably impacted by lower selling prices and increased sales incentives. Land related charges totaled $1.5 billion, $2.2 billion, and $0.5 billion for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. In addition, we incurred goodwill impairment charges of $5.0 million in 2008 and $370.0 million in 2007. There were no goodwill impairment charges in 2006. Income before income taxes from our Financial Services business segment decreased 35% in 2008 compared with 2007 after decreasing 63% in 2007 compared with 2006. Income before income taxes for 2006 includes a one time gain of $31.6 million related to the sale of our investment in Su Casita, a Mexican mortgage banking company, which occurred in the first quarter of 2006. The significant decreases in 2008 and 2007 are primarily the result of lower loan originations due to significant decreases in the number of homes closed and average selling prices combined with higher loan loss reserves. In addition, Financial Services incurred goodwill impairment charges of $0.7 million in 2008. There were no goodwill impairment charges in 2007 or 2006. Capture rates were 92%, 92%, and 91% in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Our Other non operating loss decreased 48% in 2008 compared with 2007 after decreasing 29% in 2007 compared with 2006, due primarily to reductions in compensation related costs. 21 Table of Contents Homebuilding Operations The following is a summary of income (loss) before income taxes for our Homebuilding operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Home sale revenue (settlements) $ 5,980,289 $ 8,881,509 $ 13,975,387 Land sale revenue 131,749 240,221 99,861 Total Homebuilding revenues 6,112,038 9,121,730 14,075,248 Home cost of sales (a) (6,585,177 ) (9,329,354 ) (11,544,905 ) Land cost of sales (b) (393,998 ) (418,177 ) (138,528 ) Selling, general and administrative expense (776,673 ) (1,060,818 ) (1,136,027 ) Equity income (loss) (c) (12,924 ) (190,383 ) (95,244 ) Other income (expense), net (d) (37,977 ) (632,490 ) (150,176 ) Income (loss) before income taxes $ (1,694,711 ) $ (2,509,492 ) $ 1,010,368 Total active communities at December 31 459 636 690 Unit settlements 21,022 27,540 41,487 Average selling price $ 284 $ 322 $ 337 Net new orders: Units 15,306 25,175 33,925 Dollars (e) $ 4,101,000 $ 7,812,000 $ 11,253,000 Backlog at December 31: Units 2,174 7,890 10,255 Dollars $ 631,000 $ 2,510,000 $ 3,580,000 (a) Includes homebuilding interest expense, which represents the amortization of capitalized interest. Home cost of sales also includes land and community valuation adjustments of $1.2 billion, $1.6 billion, and $203.8 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. (b) Includes net realizable value adjustments for land held for sale of $271.1 million, $199.2 million, and $54.6 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. (c) Includes impairments of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, which totaled $18.5 million, $189.9 million, and $95.4 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. (d) Includes the write off of deposits and pre acquisition costs for land option contracts we no longer plan to pursue of $33.3 million, $239.7 million, and $151.2 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. For 2008 and 2007, other income (expense) includes goodwill impairment charges of $5.0 million and $370.0 million, respectively. (e) Net new order dollars represent a composite of new order dollars combined with other movements of the dollars in backlog related to cancellations and change orders. Home sale revenues for 2008 were lower than those for 2007 by $2.9 billion, or 33%, and in 2007 were lower than those for 2006 by $5.1 billion, or 36%. The lower home sale revenues in 2008 and 2007 were attributable to decreases in unit settlements of 24% and 34%, respectively, combined with decreases in the average selling price of 12% and 4%, respectively. The declines in unit settlements resulted from both reductions in the number of our active communities (down 28% and 8% at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, compared with the respective prior year) and the challenging sales conditions in our local markets. The decreases in average selling price in 2008 and 2007 reflect a combination of factors, including changes in the product and geographic mix of homes closed during the periods as well as lower market selling prices and higher sales incentives. Home sale revenues, unit settlements, and average selling prices decreased in all of our Homebuilding segments during 2008 and 2007. Homebuilding gross profit margins from home sales in 2008 were negative 10.1%, compared with negative 5.0% in 2007 and positive 17.4% in 2006. The significant decreases in gross profit margins that commenced in 2006 and continued through 2008 were attributable to the difficult market conditions and challenging sales environment, which have resulted in lower average selling prices and increased sales incentives. In addition, we recorded land and community valuation adjustments of $1.2 billion, $1.6 billion, and $203.8 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. 22 Table of Contents Homebuilding Operations (continued) We continue to evaluate our existing land positions to ensure the most effective use of capital. Land sale revenues and their related gains or losses may vary significantly between periods, depending on the timing of land sales. Gross profit from land sales had negative margin contributions of $262.2 million, $178.0 million, and $38.7 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. These negative margin contributions in 2008, 2007, and 2006 included net realizable value adjustments totaling $271.1 million, $199.2 million, and $54.6 million, respectively, related to land held for sale. Selling, general, and administrative expenses, as a percentage of home sale revenues, increased to 13.0% compared with 11.9% in 2007 and 8.1% in 2006. While our internal initiatives focused on controlling costs and matching our overall cost structure with the current business environment have resulted in significant reductions in our selling, general, and administrative expenses since 2006, these reductions have been offset by reduced operating leverage resulting from the significant decrease in home sale revenues and lower absorption into inventory of overhead costs due to lower construction volumes. We incurred employee severance costs related to overhead reductions totaling $28.1 million in 2008. We also initiated a restructuring plan in May 2007 that resulted in employee severance costs totaling $31.9 million in 2007. Additionally, we incurred incremental insurance related expenses in 2008 and 2007 related to the adverse development of general liability product claims. Equity loss was $12.9 million, $190.4 million, and $95.2 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The equity losses experienced for 2008, 2007 and 2006 included impairments related to investments in unconsolidated joint ventures totaling $18.5 million, $189.9 million, and $95.4 million, respectively. Other income (expense), net includes the write off of deposits and pre acquisition costs resulting from decisions not to pursue certain land acquisitions which totaled $33.3 million, $239.7 million, and $151.2 million, in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. These write offs vary in amount from year to year as we continue to evaluate potential land acquisitions for the most effective use of capital. Other income (expense), net also includes goodwill impairment charges of $5.0 million and $370.0 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Additionally, other income (expense), net includes restructuring charges (primarily asset impairments and lease termination costs) of $13.3 million in 2008 related to overhead reduction efforts, $13.7 million in 2007 related to the reorganization initiated in May 2007, and $18.5 million in 2006 related to the closure of a production facility located in Virginia. For 2008, net new order units decreased 39% to 15,306 units compared with 2007. For 2007, net new order units decreased 26% to 25,175 units compared with 2006. Cancellation rates were 33%, 33%, and 29%, in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Most markets experienced a substantial increase in resale and new home inventory, and this, combined with declining consumer confidence, decreased housing affordability, difficulties experienced by customers in selling their existing homes, and the more restrictive mortgage financing market, has resulted in higher than historical cancellation rates and reduced net new orders during 2008, 2007, and 2006. The dollar value of net new orders decreased 48% in 2008 compared to 2007 and decreased 31% in 2007 compared with 2006. At December 31, 2008, we had 459 active selling communities, a decrease of 28% from December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2007, we had 636 active selling communities, a decrease of 8% from December 31, 2006. Ending backlog, which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed, was 2,174 units at December 31, 2008 with a dollar value of $631 million. Ending backlog was 7,890 units at December 31, 2007 with a dollar value of $2.5 billion. We had 5,058 and 9,031 homes in production at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, excluding 1,372 and 1,628 model homes, respectively. Included in our total homes in production were 3,509 and 3,744 homes that were unsold to customers at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, of which 1,857 and 1,273 homes, respectively, were completed. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, our Homebuilding operations controlled 120,796 and 157,858 lots, respectively. Of these controlled lots, 97,473 and 131,385 lots were owned and 23,250 and 24,813 lots were under option agreements approved for purchase at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In addition, there were 73 and 1,660 lots under option agreements, pending approval, at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. During 2008, we withdrew from land option contracts representing 6,203 lots with purchase prices totaling $179.4 million. The total purchase price related to approved land under option for use by our Homebuilding operations at future dates approximated $1.3 billion at December 31, 2008. In addition, total purchase price related to land under option pending approval was valued at approximately $1.7 million at December 31, 2008. Land option agreements, which may be cancelled at our discretion, may extend over several years and are secured by deposits and pre acquisition costs totaling $225.3 million, of which $1.2 million is refundable. This balance excludes $19.8 million of contingent payment obligations which may or may not become actual obligations to us. 23 Table of Contents Homebuilding Segment Operations Our homebuilding operations represent our core business.

(b) Includes settlements related to costs previously in dispute and considered non recoverable. (c) Includes impairments related to joint ventures located in Puerto Rico. 26 Table of Contents Homebuilding Segment Operations (continued) Atlantic Coast: For 2008, Atlantic Coast home sale revenues decreased 22% compared with 2007 due to a 17% decrease in unit settlements combined with a 5% decrease in the average selling price, including significant home sale revenue reductions in our Mid Atlantic and Georgia markets. The increased loss before income taxes was primarily attributable to the reduction in revenues combined with a decline in gross margin. Atlantic Coast recorded land related charges of $220.6 million and $220.2 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Gross margins, excluding land related charges, increased within the New England and Metro NY/NJ markets during 2008. Net new orders decreased 35% compared with 2007 while the cancellation rate increased to 29% compared with 27% in 2007. For 2007, Atlantic Coast operations experienced weakened demand for new homes primarily as a result of increases in existing home inventories. Home sale revenues in 2007 decreased 21% due to an 18% decrease in unit settlements combined with a 4% decrease in the average selling price. Operating results were negatively impacted by $220.2 million and $64.8 million of land related charges in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Net new orders for 2007 decreased 19% compared with 2006. During 2007, increased cancellation rates were attributable to lower new order sign up activity and increased cancellations in all markets. Cancellation rates for 2007 were 27% compared with 23% for 2006. Gulf Coast: For 2008, Gulf Coast home sale revenues decreased 28% compared with the prior year period with a 19% decrease in unit settlements combined with a 12% decrease in the average selling price, including a significant decrease in home sale revenues in our Orlando and Southwest Florida markets. While all of our Gulf Coast markets experienced a loss before income taxes in 2008, the overall loss before income taxes decreased in 2008 compared with 2007 due to significantly lower land related charges, which totaled $247.7 million and $480.4 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Excluding land related charges, gross margins decreased within the majority of our Gulf Coast markets. Net new orders declined by 38% compared with 2007. The cancellation rate in 2008 was 33% compared with 31% in 2007. For 2007, Gulf Coast home sale revenues decreased 46% compared with 2006 due to a 46% decrease in unit settlements combined with 1% decrease in the average selling price. Our Gulf Coast operations recorded impairments and land related charges of $480.4 million in 2007 compared with $69.4 million in 2006. Net new orders in 2007 decreased 27% compared with 2006. Cancellation rates for 2007 were 31% compared with 30% for 2006. Midwest: Our Midwest segment continues to face difficult local economic conditions in the majority of its markets. For 2008, Midwest home sale revenues decreased 37% compared with 2007 due to a 32% decrease in unit settlements combined with an 8% decrease in the average selling price, as all of our Midwest markets experienced home sale revenue reductions. Our Illinois market had the most sizable decrease in home sale revenues and closings. Each of our Midwest markets experienced pretax losses during 2008. The segments loss before income taxes decreased during 2008 due to significantly lower land related charges, which totaled $100.1 million in 2008 compared with $354.7 million in 2007. Net new orders declined by 37% due to the difficult market conditions. Cancellation rates were 23% for 2008 compared with 26% for 2007. The Midwest operations were one of the most challenged areas in the country in 2007 due to difficult local economic conditions. Midwest home sale revenues decreased 30% compared with 2006 due to a 30% decrease in unit settlements. Average selling prices were flat. For 2007 and 2006, Midwest operating results were negatively impacted by land related charges of $354.7 million and $134.6 million, respectively. During 2007, reduced new order sign up activity resulted in higher cancellation rates. Net new orders in 2007 decreased 36% compared with 2006. For 2007, cancellation rates were 26% compared with 20% for 2006. 27 Table of Contents Homebuilding Segment Operations (continued) Southwest: Market conditions in our Las Vegas and Phoenix operations deteriorated markedly in 2008. For 2008, Southwest home sale revenues decreased 37% compared with the prior year period due to a 25% decrease in unit settlements combined with a 16% decrease in average selling prices. The increased loss before income taxes in 2008 was primarily attributable to this decrease in revenues combined with a significant decline in gross margin and $588.0 million in land related charges in 2008 compared with $404.8 million in 2007. In addition, Southwests 2007 results included impairments of $59.1 million related to two unconsolidated joint ventures. Excluding land related charges, all of our Southwest markets experienced lower gross margin during 2008 compared with 2007, especially Las Vegas and Phoenix. Net new orders declined by 41% in 2008 due to the difficult market conditions. Cancellation rates remained flat at 37% in both 2008 and 2007. In 2007, Southwest home sale revenues decreased 37% due to a 31% decrease in unit settlements combined with a 10% decrease in average selling prices. During 2007 and 2006, our Southwest operations recorded impairments and land related charges of $404.8 million and $37.8 million, respectively. During 2007, Southwests results also included impairments of $59.1 million related to two unconsolidated joint ventures. Net new orders for 2007 decreased 21% compared with 2006. Cancellation rates were 37% in 2007 compared with 35% in 2006. California: For 2008, California home sale revenues decreased 45% compared with 2007 due to a 34% decrease in unit settlements combined with a 16% decrease in average selling prices as all of our California markets experienced home sale revenue reductions. This reduction in revenues and significant decline in gross margin contributed to the loss before income taxes, which also included $270.0 million in land related charges and a $15.4 million valuation adjustment related to unconsolidated joint ventures. The 2008 loss before income taxes was lower than in 2007 primarily due to the lower land related charges, which totaled $468.1 million in 2007. In 2007, California also recorded valuation adjustments totaling $128.3 million related to unconsolidated joint ventures. Excluding land related charges, our Bay Area market experienced the most sizable decrease in gross margin. Net new orders declined by 48% in 2008 due to the difficult market conditions. Cancellation rates were 44% in 2008 compared with 43% in 2007. California home sale revenues decreased 44% in 2007 due primarily to a 40% decrease in unit settlements and an 8% decrease in average selling price. In 2007, California recorded impairments and land related charges of $468.1 million and valuation adjustments totaling $128.3 million related to unconsolidated joint ventures. In 2006, California recorded land related charges of $89.0 million and $95.4 million of valuation adjustments related to two of our unconsolidated joint ventures located in Sacramento. During 2007, reduced new order sign up activity resulted in higher cancellation rates. Net new orders for 2007 decreased 31% compared with 2006. For 2007, cancellation rates were approximately 43% compared with 36% for 2006. 28 Table of Contents Financial Services Operations We conduct our Financial Services operations, which includes mortgage and title operations, through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries. We originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various credit arrangements, and then sell such mortgage loans monthly to outside investors. Also, we sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts. The following table presents selected financial information for our Financial Services operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Mortgage operations revenues $ 135,409 $ 113,967 $ 164,763 Title services 15,607 20,802 29,833 Total Financial Services revenues 151,016 134,769 194,596 Expenses (123,082 ) (92,150 ) (111,468 ) Gain on sale of equity investment 31,635 Equity income 111 361 697 Income before income taxes $ 28,045 $ 42,980 $ 115,460 Total originations: Loans 15,227 23,404 40,269 Principal $ 3,403,500 $ 5,336,400 $ 8,683,500 Total Financial Services revenues for 2008 increased 12% compared with 2007. The increase was attributable to a combination of a shift in product mix to agency loans, which are more profitable to us, and the adoption of two new accounting standards, SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 109 Written Loan Commitments Recorded at Fair Value Through Earnings (SAB 109) and SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS 159). These standards were adopted effective January 1, 2008 and require that the fair value of interest rate lock loan commitments include the fair value of future servicing rights and that loans held for sale for which we elected the fair value option be carried at fair value rather than at the lower of cost or market. The adoption of these standards resulted in an increase to mortgage operations revenues of $32.0 million during 2008 and an increase to expenses of $27.5 million. Partially offsetting these favorable impacts was a significant decrease in loan origination volume. Interest income, which is included in mortgage operations revenues, was 39% lower in 2008 than in 2007, primarily due to the significant decrease in loan origination volume. For 2007, interest income decreased 35% compared with 2006, also due to the decrease in loan origination volume partially offset by higher loan yields resulting from the shift to agency loans. Revenues from our title operations decreased 25% in 2008 compared with 2007 and 30% in 2007 compared with 2006 due to the declines in home settlements. Mortgage origination unit volume and principal volume decreased 35% and 36%, respectively, in 2008 compared with 2007 and 42% and 39%, respectively, in 2007 compared with 2006. The decrease in unit volume is due primarily to lower home settlements. Our capture rates for 2008, 2007, and 2006 were 92%, 92%, and 91%, respectively. Our capture rate represents loan originations from our Homebuilding operations as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our Homebuilding operations, excluding cash settlements. The decrease in mortgage origination principal volume resulted from the reduced settlement volume combined with lower average selling prices, which reduced the average loan size. Our Homebuilding customers continue to account for substantially all loan production, representing nearly 100% of Pulte Mortgage unit production for 2008, 2007, and 2006. At December 31, 2008, our loan application backlog was $342.0 million, compared with $1.5 billion and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 29 Table of Contents Financial Services Operations (continued) The table below provides certain selected operating data for our Financial Services operations: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Mortgage loan origination dollars: Adjustable rate interest only 1 % 6 % 22 % other 2 % 2 % 6 % Total adjustable rate 3 % 8 % 28 % Fixed rate 97 % 92 % 72 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Mortgage loan origination units: Adjustable rate interest only 1 % 4 % 18 % other 1 % 2 % 4 % Total adjustable rate 2 % 6 % 22 % Fixed rate 98 % 94 % 78 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Principal dollars originated (a): Prime loans 93 % 82 % 62 % Alt A loans 1 % 14 % 36 % Sub prime loans 6 % 4 % 3 % Average FICO score 739 745 743 Average combined loan to value 84 % 82 % 82 % (a) Based on first loans funded by Pulte Mortgage. Prime loans are defined as full documentation first mortgages with FICO scores of 621 or higher. Alt A loans are defined as non full documentation first mortgages with FICO scores of 621 or higher. Sub prime loans are defined as first mortgage with FICO scores of 620 or lower. The mortgage industry experienced a significant shift away from adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs), which generally have a lower profit per loan, to fixed rate mortgages during 2008 and 2007. Interest only mortgages, a component of ARMs, also decreased significantly during 2008 and 2007. Because we sell our loans monthly and retain only limited risk for sold loans for a short period of time, we believe that our Financial Services operations do not have any material direct risks related to sub prime and Alt A loans. However, the availability of certain mortgage financing products has become more constrained, as the mortgage industry is now more closely scrutinizing sub prime, Alt A, and other non conforming mortgage products. These developments have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the overall demand for new housing and thereby on the results of operations of both our Homebuilding and Financial Services businesses. Income before income taxes decreased 35% in 2008 compared with 2007 as the higher mortgage operations revenues were offset by decreased loan origination volumes, increased loan loss reserves, an impairment of goodwill totaling $0.7 million, and restructuring expenses of $4.1 million related to our overhead reduction initiatives. Income before income taxes decreased 63% in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily due to the sale of our investment in Su Casita, a Mexico based mortgage banking company, in 2006. As a result of this transaction, we recognized a pre tax gain of approximately $31.6 million in 2006. Excluding this gain, income before income taxes still decreased significantly in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily due to lower loan origination volumes and increased loan loss reserves. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in average loan size and the shift in funded product mix toward fixed rate and agency loans, which are more profitable for us. Since we sell the majority of our loans monthly and retain only limited risk related to the loans we originate, our overall loan loss reserves have historically not been significant. During 2008 and 2007, however, we experienced increases in our loans held for investment, non performing portfolio loans, and foreclosed properties as well as higher expected losses on repurchased or re insured loans. As a result, our overall loan loss reserves increased to $23.4 million at December 31, 2008 compared with $12.4 million and $2.1 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Loan loss provisions included in expenses totaled $20.4 million, $11.6 million, and $1.5 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. We hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed mortgage loans with derivative financial instruments to minimize the impact of changes in interest rates. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 30 Table of Contents Other Non Operating Other non operating expenses consists of income and expenses related to corporate services provided to our subsidiaries. These expenses are incurred for financing, developing and implementing strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies, and providing the necessary administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Accordingly, these results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve. The following table presents a summary of other non operating expenses ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net interest income (expense) $ 23,496 $ 2,731 $ (531 ) Other expenses, net (39,429 ) (33,122 ) (42,569 ) Loss before income taxes $ (15,933 ) $ (30,391 ) $ (43,100 ) The increases in net interest income in 2008 and 2007 resulted from higher average invested cash balances and lower borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility. Other expenses, net in 2008 exceeded those in 2007 primarily as a result of expenses related to the amendments of our unsecured revolving credit facility and the repurchase of $313.4 million of our senior notes due 2009 by means of a tender offer completed in June 2008. The lower levels of other expenses, net in 2008 and 2007 compared with 2006 resulted primarily from reductions in compensation related costs. Interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory is charged to home cost of sales based on the cyclical timing of our unit settlements over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities. Interest expensed to homebuilding cost of sales for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 includes $84.8 million, $110.8 million, and $16.0 million, respectively, related to land and community valuation adjustments. Information related to corporate interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory is as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Interest in inventory, beginning of period $ 160,598 $ 235,596 $ 229,798 Interest capitalized 220,131 240,000 261,486 Interest expensed (210,709 ) (314,998 ) (255,688 ) Interest in inventory, end of period $ 170,020 $ 160,598 $ 235,596 Interest incurred* $ 223,039 $ 243,864 $ 266,561 * Interest incurred includes interest on our senior debt, short term borrowings, and other financing arrangements and excludes interest incurred by our financial services operations. Income Taxes Our income tax assets and liabilities and related effective tax rate are affected by a number of factors. Income taxes were provided at an effective tax rate of 12.4%, 8.9%, and 36.3% for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The effective tax rates for 2008 and 2007 were lower than the rate for 2006 due to the non cash deferred tax asset valuation allowances and impairments of goodwill recorded in those periods. Excluding the valuation allowances and goodwill impairment charges, which are discussed more fully in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the effective tax rates for 2008 and 2007 would have been approximately 37.3% and 38.1%, respectively. 31 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations In 2007, income (loss) from discontinued operations includes $18.7 million in refundable income taxes related to the our investment in our discontinued Mexico homebuilding operations. We disposed of our Mexico homebuilding operations in December 2005. In 2006, income (loss) from discontinued operations includes a provision of $2.3 million, net of tax, which resulted from a contractual adjustment related to the disposition of our Mexico homebuilding operations in December 2005. Income (loss) from discontinued operations for 2006 also includes $0.2 million of income, net of tax, related to the disposal of First Heights, our former bank subsidiary, which was completed in 2005. A provision of $0.1 million, net of tax, resulting from a contractual adjustment related to the January 2005 disposition of our former Argentina homebuilding operations is also included in income (loss) from discontinued operations in 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources We finance our land acquisitions, development, and construction activities by using internally generated funds and existing credit arrangements. We routinely monitor current operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate the use of available financing sources, including securities offerings. Based on our current financial condition and credit relationships, we believe that our operations and borrowing resources are sufficient to provide for our current and foreseeable capital requirements. However, we continue to evaluate the impact of market conditions on our liquidity and may determine that modifications are appropriate if market conditions continue to deteriorate or if the current difficult market conditions extend beyond our expectations. At December 31, 2008, we had cash and equivalents of $1.7 billion and no borrowings outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility. We also had $3.2 billion of senior notes outstanding. Other financing included limited recourse land collateralized financing totaling $5.7 million. Sources of our working capital include our cash and equivalents, our committed unsecured revolving credit facility, and Pulte Mortgages committed credit arrangements. We follow a diversified investment approach for our cash and equivalents by maintaining such funds with a diversified portfolio of banks within our group of relationship banks in high quality, highly liquid, short term investments, generally money market funds and federal government or agency securities. We monitor our investments with each bank on a daily basis and do not believe our cash and equivalents are exposed to any material risk of loss. However, given the current volatility in the global financial markets, there can be no assurances that losses of principal balance on our cash and equivalents will not occur. Our ratio of debt to total capitalization, excluding our land collateralized and Pulte Mortgage debt, was 52.8% at December 31, 2008, and 34.8% net of cash and equivalents. We amended our unsecured revolving credit facility twice during 2008, decreasing the borrowing capacity from $1.86 billion to $1.2 billion, adjusting the required tangible net worth minimum and maximum allowed debt to total capitalization ratio, increasing the costs of borrowing or issuing letters of credit, and establishing certain liquidity reserve accounts in the event that we fail to satisfy an interest coverage test. The maturity date of June 2012 was not impacted. Under the terms of the credit facility, we have the capacity to issue letters of credit totaling up to $1.125 billion. Borrowing availability is reduced by the amount of letters of credit outstanding. The credit facility includes a borrowing base limitation when we do not have an investment grade senior unsecured debt rating from at least two of Fitch Ratings, Moodys Investor Service, and Standard and Poors Corporation (the Rating Agencies). We currently do not have investment grade ratings from any of the Rating Agencies and are therefore subject to the borrowing base limitation. Given the uncertainty of current market conditions, we anticipate operating under the borrowing base limitation throughout 2009. Under the borrowing base limitation, the sum of our senior debt and the amount drawn on the revolving credit facility may not exceed an amount based on certain percentages of various categories of our unencumbered inventory and other assets. At December 31, 2008, we had no borrowings outstanding and full availability of the remaining $846.7 million under the credit facility after consideration of $353.3 million of outstanding letters of credit. As a result, the borrowing base limitation did not restrict our borrowing at December 31, 2008. 32 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Effective with the November 2008 amendment, we are required to maintain certain liquidity reserve accounts in the event we fail to satisfy an interest coverage test. Specifically, if the interest coverage ratio (as defined in the credit facility) is less than 2.0 to 1.0, we are required to maintain cash and equivalents in designated accounts with certain banks. While our access to and utilization of cash and equivalents maintained in liquidity reserve accounts is not restricted, failure to maintain sufficient balances within the liquidity reserve accounts restricts our ability to utilize the credit facility. We maintained the required cash and equivalents of $393.3 million within the liquidity reserve accounts at December 31, 2008. Additionally, failure to satisfy the interest coverage test can also result in an increase to LIBOR margin and letter of credit pricing. The credit facility contains certain financial covenants. We are required to not exceed a debt to total capitalization ratio as well as to meet a tangible net worth minimum each quarter. At December 31, 2008, our debt to total capitalization ratio (as defined in the credit facility) was 49.4% (compared with the requirement not to exceed 55%) while our tangible net worth (as defined in the credit facility) cushion was $722 million. Violations of any of the covenants in the credit facility, if not waived by the lenders or cured, could result in an optional maturity date acceleration by the lenders, which might require repayment of any borrowings and replacement or cash collateralization of any letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility. In the event these violations were not waived by the lenders or cured, the violations could also result in a default under our $3.2 billion of senior notes. As of December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the credit facility. However, in the event market conditions deteriorate in the future or we incur additional land related charges, our compliance with the required covenant levels may be adversely impacted. Additionally, our ability to utilize the full capacity of the credit facility may be limited under the terms of the borrowing base. Pulte Mortgage provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available pursuant to its committed credit arrangements. Pulte Mortgage uses these resources to finance its lending activities until the mortgage loans are sold to third party investors. At December 31, 2008, Pulte Mortgage had a committed credit arrangement consisting of a $405 million revolving credit facility, which expires May 2009. The previous asset backed commercial paper program was repaid and terminated in May 2008. The revolving credit facility requires Pulte Mortgage to maintain a consolidated tangible net worth minimum each month and restricts funded debt to 15 times tangible net worth. At December 31, 2008, Pulte Mortgage had $237.6 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility. We believe that Pulte Mortgage will be able to renew or replace its revolving credit facility when it expires. However, given the uncertainty in the capital markets, there can be no assurances that we will be able to complete such renewal or replacement on commercially reasonable terms. In the event of such an occurrence, we believe we have capacity through other sources to meet Pulte Mortgages anticipated financing needs. Pursuant to the two $100 million stock repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors in October 2002 and 2005, and the $200 million stock repurchase authorization in February 2006 (for a total stock repurchase authorization of $400 million), we have repurchased a total of 9,688,900 shares for a total of $297.7 million. There were no repurchases under these programs during 2008. We had remaining authorization to purchase common stock aggregating $102.3 million at December 31, 2008. Our net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $1.2 billion in each of 2008 and 2007. For 2006, net cash used in operating activities was $267.5 million. The primary drivers of cash flow from operations are inventory levels and profitability. In 2008 and 2007, our net loss was largely attributable to non cash asset impairments, including land related charges and investments in unconsolidated entities, goodwill impairments, and a deferred tax asset valuation allowance. In addition, we focused on right sizing our land and house inventory in 2008 and 2007 to better match current market conditions, which resulted in a significant net decrease to inventories. In 2006, net income was offset primarily by significant investments in land inventory. Cash used in investing activities was $55.9 million in 2008 compared with $221.4 million in 2007 and $86.9 million in 2006. The significant decrease in cash used in investing activities during 2008 compared with 2007 resulted primarily from reduced investments in unconsolidated entities and lower capital expenditures. The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2007 compared with 2006 resulted primarily from investments of $217.5 million in unconsolidated entities. In addition, we received cash of $49.2 million in 2006 for the sale of subsidiaries and equity investments, primarily resulting from the sale of our Mexico homebuilding operations, though this was offset by the use of $65.8 million, net of cash acquired, to purchase the remaining 50% of our vertically integrated construction operations in our Southwest reporting segment. 33 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net cash used in financing activities totaled $567.7 million, $487.6 million, and $96.2 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The cash used in financing activities in 2008, 2007, and 2006 was largely attributable to reductions in outstanding borrowings under various credit arrangements as the result of the lower volumes in our Homebuilding and Financial Services operations. Additionally, we repurchased $313.4 million of our senior notes due 2009 by means of a tender offer completed in June 2008. Offsetting this to some degree in 2008 and 2007 was a significant reduction in stock repurchases under our stock repurchase programs. On November 24, 2008, our Board of Directors discontinued the regular quarterly dividend on our common stock effective in the first quarter of 2009. Inflation We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation may also increase our financing, labor, and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. While we attempt to pass to our customers increases in our costs through increased sales prices, the current industry conditions have resulted in lower sales prices in substantially all of our markets. If we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs, or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly, affecting our prospective homebuyers ability to adequately finance home purchases, our revenues, gross margins, and net income would be adversely affected. Seasonality We experience variability in our quarterly results from operations due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry. Historically, we have experienced significant increases in revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home settlements. However, the challenging market conditions experienced since early 2006 have lessened the seasonal variations of our results. Given the current significant uncertainty in the homebuilding industry, we can make no assurances as to when and whether our historical seasonality will recur. 34 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008: Payments Due by Period($000s omitted) Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 After 2013 Contractual obligations: Long term debt (a) $ 5,855,423 $ 234,989 $ 1,107,116 $ 596,279 $ 3,917,039 Operating lease obligations 206,528 41,574 53,166 36,453 75,335 Other long term liabilities (b) 6,278 4,214 1,985 79 Total contractual obligations (c) $ 6,068,229 $ 280,777 $ 1,162,267 $ 632,811 $ 3,992,374 (a) Represents our senior notes and related interest payments. (b) Represents our limited recourse collateralized financing arrangements and related interest payments. (c) We do not have any payments due in connection with capital lease or purchase obligations. We are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts (including option contracts) for the purchase, development, and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business. Option contracts for the purchase of land enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we are ready to build homes on them. This reduces our financial risks associated with long term land holdings. At December 31, 2008, we had agreements to acquire 23,323 homesites through option contracts. At December 31, 2008, we had $224.1 million of non refundable option deposits and advanced costs related to certain of these agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had $126.3 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits and $36.1 million of related accrued interest and penalties. We are currently under examination by various taxing jurisdictions and anticipate finalizing the examinations with certain jurisdictions within the next twelve months. However, the final outcome of these examinations is not yet determinable. The statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for tax years 1998 2007. The following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2008: Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period($000s omitted) Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 After 2013 Other commercial commitments: Guarantor revolving credit facilities (a) $ 1,200,000 $ $ $ 1,200,000 $ Non guarantor revolving credit facilities 405,000 405,000 Standby letters of credit (b) 10,593 4,843 5,750 Total commercial commitments (c) $ 1,615,593 $ 409,843 $ 5,750 $ 1,200,000 $ (a) Includes capacity to issue up to $1.125 billion in standby letters of credit, of which $353.3 million was outstanding at December 31, 2008. (b) Excludes standby letters of credit issued under the Guarantor revolving credit facilities. (c) Excludes performance and surety bonds of approximately $1.1 billion, which typically do not have stated expiration dates. 35 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We use standby letters of credit and performance bonds to guarantee our performance under various contracts, principally in connection with the development of our projects. The expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related homebuilding projects. If the obligations related to a project are ongoing, annual extensions of the letters of credit are typically granted on a year to year basis. At December 31, 2008, we had outstanding letters of credit of $363.9 million. Performance bonds and surety bonds generally do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These bonds, which approximated $1.1 billion at December 31, 2008, are typically outstanding over a period of approximately 3 5 years. We do not believe that there will be draws upon any such letters of credit or performance bonds. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land option or option type agreements in order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future. At December 31, 2008, these agreements totaled approximately $1.3 billion. Pursuant to these land option agreements, we provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future, usually at predetermined prices. If the entity holding the land under option is a variable interest entity, our deposit represents a variable interest in that entity. At December 31, 2008, we consolidated certain land option agreements and recorded assets of $156.6 million as land, not owned, under option agreements. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, aggregate outstanding debt of unconsolidated joint ventures was $519.3 million and $602.5 million, respectively, of which our proportionate share of such joint venture debt was $92.0 million and $134.0 million, respectively. Of our proportionate share of joint venture debt, we provided limited recourse guaranties for $84.3 million and $124.5 million of such joint venture debt at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10 K for additional information. For 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recognized equity loss from our unconsolidated joint ventures of $12.8 million, $190.0 million, and $62.9 million, respectively. The equity loss recognized during 2008, 2007, and 2006 includes land valuation adjustments of $18.5 million, $189.9 million, and $95.4 million, respectively. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these consolidated financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements, giving due regard to materiality. Revenue recognition Homebuilding Homebuilding revenue and related profit are generally recognized at the time of the closing of the sale, when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. In situations where the buyers financing is originated by Pulte Mortgage, our wholly owned mortgage subsidiary, and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment as required by SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, the profit on such sales is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a third party investor has been completed unless there is a loss on the sale in which case the loss on such sale is recognized at the time of closing. 36 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Financial Services Mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors. Servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance, or a contracted set fee in the case of certain sub servicing arrangements, and are credited to income when related mortgage payments are received or the sub servicing fees are earned. With the adoption of SFAS 159 effective January 1, 2008, loan origination fees, commitment fees, and certain direct loan origination costs are recognized as incurred. Previously, such fees and costs were deferred as an adjustment to the cost of the related loans and recognized as an adjustment to revenues upon the sale of such loans. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold. Interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold. Loans are placed on non accrual status once they become greater than 90 days past due their contractual terms. Subsequent payments received are applied according to the contractual terms of the loan. Inventory valuation Inventory is stated at the lower of accumulated cost or fair value, as determined in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144). Accumulated cost includes costs associated with land acquisition, land development, and home construction costs, including interest, real estate taxes, and certain direct and indirect overhead costs related to development and construction. For those communities for which construction and development activities have been idled, applicable interest and real estate taxes are expensed as incurred. Land acquisition and development costs are allocated to individual lots using an average lot cost determined based on the total expected land acquisition and development costs and the total expected home closings for the community. The specific identification method is used to accumulate home construction costs. We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories. Each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development. Interest expense is allocated over the period based on the cyclical timing of unit settlements. Cost of sales includes the construction cost of the home, the average lot cost for the home, estimated warranty costs for the home, and commissions and closing costs applicable to the home. The construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home, plus an appropriate accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid, based on an analysis of budgeted construction cost. This accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared with the amount accrued, and adjustments are made if needed. Total community land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared with actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete. The development cycles for our communities range from under one year to in excess of ten years for certain master planned communities. Adjustments to estimated total land acquisition and development costs for the community affect the amounts costed for the communitys remaining lots. In accordance with SFAS 144, we record valuation adjustments on land inventory and related communities under development when events and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired and when the cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. For communities that demonstrate indicators of impairment, we compare the expected undiscounted cash flows for these communities to their carrying value. For those communities whose carrying values exceeds the expected undiscounted cash flows, we calculate the fair value of the community. Impairment charges are required to be recorded if the fair value of the communitys inventory is less than its carrying value. We generally determine the fair value of each communitys inventory using a discounted cash flow model. These estimated cash flows are significantly impacted by estimates related to expected average selling prices and sale incentives, expected sales paces and cancellation rates, expected land development and construction timelines, and anticipated land development, construction, and overhead costs. Such estimates must be made for each individual community and may vary significantly between communities. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process, the significant volatility in demand for new housing, and the long life cycles of many communities, actual results could differ significantly from such estimates. 37 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments in unconsolidated entities We have investments in a number of unconsolidated entities, including joint ventures, with independent third parties. Many of these unconsolidated entities purchase, develop, and or sell land and homes in the United States and Puerto Rico. The equity method of accounting is used for unconsolidated entities over which we have significant influence; generally this represents partnership equity or common stock ownership interests of at least 20% and not more than 50%. Under the equity method of accounting, we recognize our proportionate share of the profits and losses of these entities. Certain of these entities sell land to us. In these situations, we defer the recognition of profits from such activities until the time the related homes are sold. The cost method of accounting is used for investments in which we have less than a 20% ownership interest and do not have the ability to exercise significant influence. We evaluate our investments in unconsolidated entities for recoverability in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock (APB 18). If we determine that a loss in the value of the investment is other than temporary, we write down the investment to its estimated fair value. Any such losses are recorded to equity loss in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Additionally, each unconsolidated entity evaluates its long lived assets, such as inventory, for recoverability in accordance with SFAS 144. Our proportionate share of any such impairments under SFAS 144 are also recorded to equity loss in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Evaluations of recoverability under both APB 18 and SFAS 144 are primarily based on projected cash flows. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process and the significant volatility in demand for new housing, actual results could differ significantly from such estimates. Residential mortgage loans Prior to January 1, 2008, residential mortgage loans available for sale were stated at the lower of aggregate cost or market value. In accordance with SFAS 159, we elected the fair value option for our portfolio loans available for sale and for first mortgage loans originated subsequent to December 31, 2007. SFAS 159 permits entities to measure various financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on a contract by contract basis. Election of the fair value option for residential mortgage loans available for sale allows a better offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. Changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in revenues as they occur. Loans held for investment consist of interim financing mortgage loans for certain of our customers as well as a portfolio of loans that either have been repurchased from investors or were not saleable upon closing. These loans are carried at cost and reviewed for impairment when recoverability becomes doubtful. Goodwill and intangible assets We have recorded certain intangible assets and goodwill, most of which relate to the Del Webb merger in 2001. Intangible assets, primarily trademarks and tradenames, were valued using proven valuation procedures and are amortized over their estimated useful life. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing. The carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use. If our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly, intangible assets and goodwill may be impaired. If we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment, we measure impairment using accepted valuation methods. For intangible assets, we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists and then measure impairment using discounted cash flows. For goodwill, we assess fair value by measuring discounted cash flows of our reporting units and measure impairment as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded book value. The estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control. As of December 31, 2008, all of our recorded goodwill has been written off. Allowance for warranties Home purchasers are provided with a limited warranty against certain building defects, including a one year comprehensive limited warranty and coverage for certain other aspects of the homes construction and operating systems for periods of up to ten years. We estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and the cost per claim. We periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability for each geographic market in which we operate and adjust the amounts as necessary. Actual warranty costs in the future could differ from our estimates. 38 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Insurance We have, and require the majority of our subcontractors to have, general liability, property, errors and omissions, workers compensation, and other business insurance. These insurance policies protect us against a portion of the risk of loss from claims, subject to certain self insured retentions, deductibles, and other coverage limits. Through our captive insurance subsidiaries, we reserve for costs to cover our self insured and deductible amounts under those policies and for any costs of claims and related lawsuits, based on an analysis of our historical claims, which includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. These estimates are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors, including extended lag times in the reporting and resolution of claims, which generally occur over several years and can occur in excess of ten years, and trends or changes in claim settlement patterns, insurance industry practices, and legal interpretations. As a result, actual costs could differ significantly from the estimated amounts. Adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs. Stock based compensation We calculate the fair value of stock options using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions, which involve a number of variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, the expected dividend yield, and expected stock option exercise behavior. In addition, we also use judgment in estimating the number of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited. We adopted SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective method of transition. Income taxes We calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. In determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns, judgment is required. Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. We adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), effective January 1, 2007. FIN 48 creates a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions and clarifies accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. Evaluations of our tax positions consider changes in facts or circumstances, changes in law, correspondence with taxing authorities, and settlements of audit issues. New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our rate sensitive financing to the extent long term rates decline. The following tables set forth, as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, our rate sensitive financing obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates, and estimated fair value ($000s omitted). As of December 31, 2008 for theYears ending December 31, 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total FairValue Rate sensitive liabilities: Fixed interest rate debt: Senior notes $ 25,412 $ $ 698,563 $ $ 300,000 $ 2,150,000 $ 3,173,975 $ 2,136,628 Average interest rate 4.88 % 7.95 % 6.25 % 6.24 % 6.60 % Non recourse collateralized financing $ 3,840 $ 890 $ 890 $ 75 $ $ $ 5,695 $ 5,695 Average interest rate 6.22 % 7.25 % 7.25 % 7.25 % As of December 31, 2007 for theYears ending December 31, 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total FairValue Rate sensitive liabilities: Fixed interest rate debt: Senior notes $ $ 338,812 $ $ 698,563 $ $ 2,450,000 $ 3,487,375 $ 2,962,634 Average interest rate 4.88 % 7.95 % 6.24 % 6.45 % Non recourse collateralized financing $ 4,120 $ 3,490 $ 890 $ 890 $ $ $ 9,390 $ 9,390 Average interest rate 5.65 % 5.57 % 7.25 % 7.25 % 5.93 % Pulte Mortgage, operating as a mortgage banker, is also subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed upon terms (i.e., commit to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2008 and 2007, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float. We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to LIBOR and (ii) hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments. These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury future contracts, and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in long term mortgage rates of plus 50, 100, and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results. At December 31, 2008, our aggregate net investment exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk includes our remaining non operating investments in Mexico, which approximated $6 million. 40 Table of Contents SPECIAL NOTES CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS As a cautionary note, except for the historical information contained herein, certain matters discussed in Item 1A., Risk Factors, Item 7., Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the Reform Act).
