ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview On August 18, 2009, we completed the acquisition of Centex through the merger of Pultes merger subsidiary with and into Centex pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of April 7, 2009 among Pulte, Pi Nevada Building Company, and Centex. As a result of the merger, Centex became a wholly owned subsidiary of Pulte. Accordingly, the results of Centex are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the merger. Since early 2006, the U.S. housing market has been unfavorably impacted by a lack of consumer confidence, tightened mortgage standards, and large supplies of resale and new home inventories and related pricing pressures. These factors have contributed to weakened demand for new homes, slower sales, and increased price discounts and sales incentives to attract homebuyers. During 2009, these conditions were accompanied by significant foreclosure activity, increasing unemployment, and significant uncertainty in the U.S. economy. As a result of the combination of these homebuilding industry, mortgage financing, and broader economic factors, we have experienced a net loss in each quarter since the fourth quarter of 2006. Such losses resulted from a combination of reduced operational profitability and significant asset impairments. Since the beginning of 2006, we have incurred total land related charges of $5.2 billion and goodwill impairments of $938.7 million. The U.S. economy remains in a period of economic uncertainty, and the related financial markets are experiencing significant volatility. These factors have contributed to continued significant declines throughout the homebuilding industry. In response to these adverse macroeconomic conditions, the U.S. government has made significant efforts to stabilize these conditions and increase the regulatory oversight of the financial markets. However, significant uncertainty remains as to the ultimate impact these programs, or their expiration, will have on the demand for new housing, including enactment into law on November 6, 2009, of the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009 (the Act). The Act amended Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code to allow net operating losses realized in either tax year 2008 or 2009 to be carried back up to five years (previously limited to a two year carryback). This change will allow us and certain of our subsidiaries to carry back 2009 taxable losses to prior years and receive refunds of previously paid federal income taxes. The Act also extended and expanded the current homebuyer tax credit until April 30, 2010. Entering 2010, there are indications that certain of the aforementioned negative trends may be slowing or improving. However, there are also a number of factors that may further worsen market conditions or delay a recovery in the homebuilding industry. Such factors include: Continued high levels of foreclosure activity, in part due to lenders more aggressively pursuing foreclosures after lifting voluntary moratoriums; High levels of unemployment, which are generally not expected to recede to historical levels during 2010; The expiration of the homebuyer tax credit in April 2010; Potentially higher mortgage interest rates resulting from the Federal Reserves recent announcement that it will discontinue its purchases of mortgage backed securities in the coming months; and Increased costs and standards related to FHA loans, which became a significant source of customer financing for the homebuilding industry in 2009. 22 Table of Contents Overview (continued) Accordingly, we continue to operate our business with the expectation that difficult market conditions will continue to impact us for at least the near term. While we plan to purchase select land positions where it makes strategic and economic sense to do so, our targeted profile for such investments consists of rolling lot option contracts for developed lots that are cash flow positive early in the project cycle and accretive to earnings. Additionally, we are closely managing the number of speculative homes put into production. We have also closely evaluated and made significant reductions in employee headcount and overhead expenses. Due to the persistence of these difficult market conditions, improving the efficiency of our overhead costs will continue to be a significant area of focus. We are also adjusting the content in our homes to provide our customers more affordable alternatives and are building homes with smaller floor plans in certain of our communities. We are maintaining our focus on our lean operating goals, a long term initiative designed to extract unnecessary waste out of the home construction process. The targeted benefits include better scheduling, direct order materials, eliminating waste at the construction site, and reducing the amount of time it takes to build our homes. As a result of the Centex merger, we expect to achieve significant savings in corporate and divisional overhead costs and interest costs for the combined entity as well as synergies in the areas of purchasing leverage and operational best practices. We also anticipate that the Centex merger will contribute to growth through expanded geographic and customer segment diversity and the ability to leverage additional brands. We believe that the combination of our operational improvement activities with the benefits of the Centex merger will help strengthen our market position and allow us to take advantage of opportunities that may develop in the future. If the current trends in economic conditions or financial market volatility continue, it could adversely affect our business and results of operations in future periods, including a further reduction in the demand for housing as well as difficulties in accessing financing on acceptable terms. Given these conditions and the continued weakness in new home sales and closings, visibility as to future earnings performance is limited. Our evaluation for land related charges recorded to date assumed our best estimates of cash flows for the communities tested. If conditions in the homebuilding industry or our local markets worsen in the future, or if our strategy related to certain communities changes, we may be required to evaluate our assets, including additional projects, for further impairments or write downs, which could result in future charges that might be significant. 23 Table of Contents Overview (continued) The following is a summary of our operating results for 2009, 2008, and 2007 ($000s omitted, except per share data): Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Income (loss) before income taxes: Homebuilding $ (1,853,297 ) $ (1,694,711 ) $ (2,509,492 ) Financial Services (55,038 ) 28,045 42,980 Other non operating (66,784 ) (15,933 ) (30,391 ) Loss from continuing operations before income taxes (1,975,119 ) (1,682,599 ) (2,496,903 ) Income tax benefit (792,552 ) (209,486 ) (222,486 ) Loss from continuing operations (1,182,567 ) (1,473,113 ) (2,274,417 ) Income from discontinued operations 18,662 Net loss $ (1,182,567 ) $ (1,473,113 ) $ (2,255,755 ) Per share data assuming dilution: Loss from continuing operations $ (3.94 ) $ (5.81 ) $ (9.02 ) Income from discontinued operations 0.07 Net loss $ (3.94 ) $ (5.81 ) $ (8.94 ) The following is a comparison of income (loss) before income taxes for 2009, 2008, and 2007: Our Homebuilding loss before income taxes for 2009 was $1.9 billion compared with losses before income taxes of $1.7 billion and $2.5 billion in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The losses experienced in 2009, 2008, and 2007 resulted from lower settlement revenues and lower gross margins combined with significant non cash asset impairments. Land related charges totaled $973.3 million, $1.5 billion, and $2.2 billion for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. In addition, our Homebuilding operations incurred goodwill impairment charges of $563.0 million, $5.0 million, and $370.0 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The Homebuilding loss before income taxes also includes certain transaction and integration costs directly related to the Centex merger totaling $123.7 million for 2009. Such costs consist primarily of severance benefits, lease exit and related impairment costs, investment banking fees, and other professional fees. During 2009, Financial Services experienced a loss before income taxes of $55.0 million, compared with income before income taxes of $28.0 million and $43.0 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively. The loss was primarily due to reduced loan origination volume resulting from the decline in home sale revenues from Homebuilding coupled with a significant increase in loan losses, including $60.9 million related to mortgage loan repurchase obligations. The Financial Services loss before income taxes during 2009 also includes certain transaction and integration costs directly related to the Centex merger totaling $8.4 million. Such costs consist primarily of severance benefits and lease exit and related asset impairment costs. Financial Services incurred goodwill impairment charges of $0.7 million in 2008 but none in either 2009 or 2007. Our other non operating loss during 2009 increased compared with 2008 and 2007, due primarily to a loss realized on the repurchase of debt. The other non operating loss before income taxes in 2009 also includes certain transaction and integration costs directly related to the Centex merger totaling $5.4 million. The income tax benefit for 2009 reflects the impact of the Act, which allows us and certain of our subsidiaries to carry back 2009 taxable losses to prior years and receive refunds of previously paid federal income taxes. 24 Table of Contents Overview (continued) The operating results for the year ended December 31, 2009 includes Centexs results for the period from August 19 to December 31 as follows ($000s omitted): Revenues Loss BeforeIncome Taxes IncomeTaxBenefit Net Loss Homebuilding $ 1,056,597 $ (546,219 ) Financial Services 30,612 (41,564 ) Other non operating (47,143 ) Total Centex $ 1,087,209 $ (634,926 ) $ (192,030 ) $ (442,896 ) The above operating results for Centexs Homebuilding operations include the aforementioned goodwill impairment charges of $563.0 million while the income tax benefit primarily reflects the impact of the Act attributable to Centexs operations. 25 Table of Contents Homebuilding Operations The following is a summary of loss before income taxes for our Homebuilding operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Home sale revenues (settlements) $ 3,869,297 $ 5,980,289 $ 8,881,509 Land sale revenues 97,292 131,749 240,221 Total Homebuilding revenues 3,966,589 6,112,038 9,121,730 Home cost of revenues (a) (4,274,474 ) (6,585,177 ) (9,329,354 ) Land cost of revenues (b) (211,170 ) (393,998 ) (418,177 ) Selling, general and administrative expense (630,339 ) (776,673 ) (1,060,818 ) Equity loss (c) (49,668 ) (12,924 ) (190,383 ) Other income (expense), net (d) (654,235 ) (37,977 ) (632,490 ) Loss before income taxes $ (1,853,297 ) $ (1,694,711 ) $ (2,509,492 ) Active communities at December 31 (e) 882 572 737 Unit settlements 15,013 21,022 27,540 Average selling price $ 258 $ 284 $ 322 Net new orders: Units (f) 14,185 15,306 25,175 Dollars (g) $ 3,708,000 $ 4,101,000 $ 7,812,000 Backlog at December 31 (h): Units 5,931 2,174 7,890 Dollars $ 1,577,000 $ 631,000 $ 2,510,000 (a) Includes homebuilding interest expense, which represents the amortization of capitalized interest. Home cost of sales also includes land and community valuation adjustments of $751.2 million, $1.2 billion, and $1.6 billion for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. (b) Includes net realizable value adjustments for land held for sale of $113.7 million, $271.1 million, and $199.2 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. (c) Includes impairments of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, which totaled $54.1 million, $18.5 million, and $189.9 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. (d) Includes the write off of deposits and pre acquisition costs for land option contracts we no longer plan to pursue of $54.3 million, $33.3 million, and $239.7 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. For 2009, 2008, and 2007, other income (expense) includes goodwill impairment charges of $563.0 million, $5.0 million, and $370.0 million, respectively. (e) In response to the significant decline in net new order volume in recent periods, the criteria for determining active communities was modified during 2009 in order to provide a more accurate measure of communities with active selling efforts. The active community counts for prior periods have been recalculated to conform to the current presentation. Active communities at December 31, 2009 include 435 active Centex communities. (f) Net new order units for the year ended December 31, 2009 include Centexs operations, which contributed 2,948 units. (g) Net new order dollars represent a composite of new order dollars combined with other movements of the dollars in backlog related to cancellations and change orders. Net new order dollars for the year ended December 31, 2009 include $766.0 million related to Centex. (h) Backlog at December 31, 2009 includes 3,246 units and $822.6 million related to Centex. Home sale revenues for 2009, which include $1.1 billion related to Centex, were lower than those for 2008 by $2.1 billion, or 35%, and in 2008 were lower than those for 2007 by $2.9 billion, or 33%. The decrease in home sale revenues in 2009 and 2008 were attributable to decreases in unit settlements of 29% and 24%, respectively, combined with decreases in the average selling price of 9% and 12%, respectively. The decreases in average selling price in 2009 and 2008 reflect a combination of factors, including changes in the product and geographic mix of homes closed during the periods as well as lower market selling prices and elevated sales incentives. Home sale revenues, unit settlements, and average selling prices decreased in each of our Homebuilding segments during 2009 and 2008. 26 Table of Contents Homebuilding Operations (continued) Homebuilding gross profit margins from home sales in 2009 were negative 10.5%, compared with negative 10.1% in 2008 and positive 5.0% in 2007. We recorded land and community valuation adjustments of $751.2 million, $1.2 billion, and $1.6 billion in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Gross profit margins were also adversely impacted in 2009 by the fair value adjustment related to homes under construction inventory acquired with the Centex merger. We recognized this fair value adjustment as an increase of $31.1 million to cost of sales as the related homes closed. Excluding these inventory valuation adjustments, gross profit margins held steady in 2009 compared with 2008 while gross margins in 2008 were lower than 2007 primarily as a result of lower average selling prices. We continue to evaluate our existing land positions to ensure the most effective use of capital. Land sale revenues and their related gains or losses may vary significantly between periods, depending on the timing of land sales. Land sales had negative margin contributions of $113.9 million, $262.2 million, and $178.0 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. These negative margin contributions in 2009, 2008, and 2007 included net realizable value adjustments totaling $113.7 million, $271.1 million, and $199.2 million, respectively, related to land held for sale. Selling, general, and administrative expenses, as a percentage of home sale revenues, increased to 16.3% compared with 13.0% in 2008 and 11.9% in 2007. While our internal initiatives focused on controlling costs and matching our overall cost structure with the current business environment have resulted in significant reductions in our selling, general, and administrative expense, we experienced an increase in our selling, general and administrative expenses relative to home sale revenues during 2009 primarily as the result of duplicative corporate and divisional overhead costs during the transition period following the Centex merger. During 2009, Homebuilding selling, general and administrative expenses also include transaction and integration costs related to the Centex merger, including employee severance costs, totaling $65.0 million. Employee severance costs during 2008 and 2007 totaled $28.1 million and $31.9 million, respectively. During 2009 we experienced a 19% decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses compared with 2008 despite such merger related costs and the duplicative overhead expenses discussed above. The reductions in selling, general and administrative expenses have been offset by reduced operating leverage resulting from the significant decrease in home sale revenues and lower absorption into inventory of overhead costs due to lower construction volumes. In addition to the significant cuts in overhead spending, such reductions were partially attributable to decreases in certain casualty insurance related expenses; such expenses totaled $34.9 million, $103.5 million, and $141.2 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. While the majority of these decreases resulted from the lower sales volumes between periods, our exposure to general liability product claims did not develop as adversely during 2009 as in 2008 and 2007 when we experienced significant increases in the frequency and severity of claims. Equity loss was $49.7 million, $12.9 million, and $190.4 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The equity losses experienced for 2009, 2008 and 2007 included impairments related to investments in unconsolidated joint ventures totaling $54.1 million, $18.5 million, and $189.9 million, respectively. Other income (expense), net includes the write off of deposits and pre acquisition costs resulting from decisions not to pursue certain land acquisitions which totaled $54.3 million, $33.3 million, and $239.7 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. These write offs vary in amount from year to year as we continue to evaluate potential land acquisitions for the most effective use of capital. Other income (expense), net includes certain integration costs, including lease exit costs, directly related to the Centex merger totaling $27.5 million in 2009. Other income (expense) during 2008 and 2007 includes lease termination costs and asset impairments totaling $13.3 million and $13.7 million, respectively, related to overhead reduction efforts. Other income (expense), net also includes goodwill impairment charges of $563.0 million, $5.0 million, and $370.0 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The 2008 and 2007 impairments resulted from the deteriorating market conditions throughout the homebuilding industry. The 2009 impairment resulted from a number of factors, including a significant decline in our overall market capitalization between the Centex merger date and the goodwill valuation date in the fourth quarter, the relationship of our market capitalization to our stockholders equity, and the requirement under ASC 350 to allocate all goodwill to our reporting units even though a significant portion of the goodwill is attributable to the economic value of deferred tax assets and corporate and financing synergies that are not directly reflected in the fair values of the individual reporting units. If our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly, goodwill may be further impaired. Of our remaining goodwill of $895.9 million at December 31, 2009, approximately $350 million relates to reporting units that are at increased risk of future impairment. Management will continue to monitor these reporting units and perform goodwill impairment testing when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 27 Table of Contents Homebuilding Operations (continued) For 2009, net new order units decreased 7% to 14,185 units compared with 2008. Excluding Centex, net new order units decreased significantly during 2009. For 2008, net new order units decreased 39% to 15,306 units compared with 2007. Cancellation rates were 23% in 2009 and 33% in both 2008 and 2007. Most markets continued to have significant resale and new home inventory on the market, and this, combined with low consumer confidence, difficulties experienced by customers in selling their existing homes, the high rate of foreclosures, and the restrictive mortgage financing market, has resulted in reduced net new orders. The dollar value of net new orders decreased $393.0 million in 2009 compared to 2008 and decreased $3.7 billion in 2008 compared with 2007. At December 31, 2009, we had 882 active selling communities, an increase of 54% from December 31, 2008. Centex contributed 435 active communities at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, we had 572 active selling communities, a decrease of 22% from December 31, 2007. Ending backlog, which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed, was 5,931 units at December 31, 2009 with a dollar value of $1.6 billion and included 3,246 Centex units with a dollar value of $822.6 million. Ending backlog was 2,174 units at December 31, 2008 with a dollar value of $631.0 million. We had 6,653 and 5,058 homes in production at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, excluding 1,657 and 1,372 model homes, respectively. Included in our total homes in production were 2,793 and 3,509 homes that were unsold to customers at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, of which 1,309 and 1,857 homes, respectively, were completed. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, our Homebuilding operations controlled 154,694 and 120,796 lots, respectively. Of these controlled lots, 138,273 and 97,473 lots were owned and 14,208 and 23,250 lots were under option agreements approved for purchase at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, there were 2,213 and 73 lots under option agreements pending approval at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. During 2009, we withdrew from land option contracts representing 11,944 lots with purchase prices totaling $685.9 million. The total purchase price related to land under option for use by our Homebuilding operations at future dates approximated $666.5 million at December 31, 2009. These land option agreements, which may be cancelled at our discretion, and may extend over several years, are secured by deposits and pre acquisition costs totaling $143.5 million, of which $2.7 million is refundable. This balance excludes contingent payment obligations which may or may not become actual obligations to us. 28 Table of Contents Homebuilding Segment Operations Our homebuilding operations represent our core business. Homebuilding offers a broad product line to meet the needs of first time, first and second move up, and active adult homebuyers. We have determined that our operating segments are our Areas. In the third quarter of 2009, in connection with the Centex merger, we realigned the organizational structure for certain of our markets. Accordingly, the operating data by segment have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. We conduct our operations in 69 markets, located throughout 29 states, and have presented our reportable Homebuilding segments as follows: Northeast: Northeast Area includes the following states: Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey,New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia Southeast: Southeast Area includes the following states: Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee Gulf Coast: Gulf Coast Area includes the following states: Florida, Texas Midwest: Midwest Area includes the following states: Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio Southwest: Southwest Area includes the following states: Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico *West: West Area includes the following states: California, Oregon, Washington * Our homebuilding operations located in Reno, Nevada are reported in the West segment, while our remaining Nevada homebuilding operations are reported in the Southwest segment. Also, our Hawaii and Puerto Rico operations are included in Other homebuilding, which does not represent a reportable segment. We also have one reportable segment for our financial services operations which consists principally of mortgage banking and title operations conducted through Pulte Mortgage and our other subsidiaries. Our Financial Services segment operates generally in the same markets as our Homebuilding segments. 29 Table of Contents Homebuilding Segment Operations (continued) The following table presents selected financial information for our homebuilding reporting segments ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Home sale revenue (settlements): Northeast $ 640,595 $ 870,123 $ 1,113,805 Southeast 561,187 924,260 1,173,485 Gulf Coast 920,960 1,194,828 1,663,459 Midwest 445,059 720,565 1,146,991 Southwest 640,554 1,459,385 2,316,147 West 598,137 811,128 1,467,622 Other homebuilding 62,805 $ 3,869,297 $ 5,980,289 $ 8,881,509 Income (loss) before income taxes: Northeast $ (207,461 ) $ (129,552 ) $ (149,793 ) Southeast (52,930 ) (14,968 ) 72,799 Gulf Coast (276,164 ) (244,900 ) (468,938 ) Midwest (66,554 ) (103,202 ) (339,193 ) Southwest (308,358 ) (555,756 ) (249,173 ) West (109,554 ) (284,048 ) (545,369 ) Other homebuilding (a) (832,276 ) (362,285 ) (829,825 ) $ (1,853,297 ) $ (1,694,711 ) $ (2,509,492 ) Unit settlements: Northeast 1,748 2,142 2,573 Southeast 2,296 3,274 3,990 Gulf Coast 4,578 5,391 6,630 Midwest 1,810 2,651 3,888 Southwest 2,751 5,494 7,318 West 1,766 2,070 3,141 Other homebuilding 64 15,013 21,022 27,540 Net new orders units: Northeast 1,731 1,563 2,447 Southeast 2,297 2,357 3,563 Gulf Coast 4,172 3,958 6,418 Midwest 1,724 2,094 3,319 Southwest 2,675 3,878 6,609 West 1,520 1,456 2,819 Other homebuilding 66 14,185 15,306 25,175 Unit backlog: Northeast 989 212 791 Southeast 1,079 364 1,281 Gulf Coast 2,081 689 2,122 Midwest 583 271 828 Southwest 497 394 2,010 West 700 244 858 Other homebuilding 2 5,931 2,174 7,890 (a) Other homebuilding includes amortization of capitalized interest of $165.4 million, $210.7 million, and $315.0 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, and goodwill impairments of $563.0 million, $5.0 million, and $370.0 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007. 30 Table of Contents Homebuilding Segment Operations (continued) Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Controlled lots: Northeast 16,156 8,988 13,152 Southeast 20,803 12,339 17,170 Gulf Cost 53,759 41,840 48,371 Midwest 12,226 9,187 14,098 Southwest 33,091 36,920 49,746 West 16,272 11,522 15,321 Other homebuilding 2,387 154,694 120,796 157,858 Northeast: For 2009, Northeast home sale revenues decreased 26% compared with 2008 due to an 18% decrease in unit settlements combined with a 10% decrease in the average selling price, including significant home sale revenue reductions in our Metro New York/New Jersey and Delaware Valley markets. Excluding Centex, home sale revenues, settlements, and average selling price decreased compared with 2008. The increased loss before income taxes was primarily attributable to the reduction in revenues combined with higher land related charges. Northeast recorded land related charges of $170.7 million and impairments totaling $31.1 million related to unconsolidated joint ventures during 2009, compared with land related charges totaling $161.1 million in 2008. Gross margins, excluding land related charges, decreased slightly in 2009, compared with 2008. Net new orders increased 11% compared with 2008 while the cancellation rate decreased to 17% compared with 21% in 2008. Home sale revenues in 2008 decreased 22% due to a 17% decrease in unit settlements combined with a 6% decrease in the average selling price. Operating results were negatively impacted by $161.1 million and $193.3 million of land related charges in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Net new orders for 2008 decreased 36% compared with 2007, and cancellation rates for 2008 were 21% compared with 24% for 2007. Southeast: For 2009, Southeast home sale revenues decreased 39% compared with 2008 due to a 30% decrease in unit settlements combined with a 13% decrease in the average selling price, including significant home sale revenue reductions in our Georgia and Charlotte markets. Excluding Centex, home sale revenues, settlements, and average selling price decreased compared with 2008. The increased loss before income taxes was primarily attributable to the reduction in revenues. Southeast recorded land related charges of $54.2 million and $59.5 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Gross margins, excluding land related charges, increased slightly during 2009. Net new orders decreased 3% compared with 2008 while the cancellation rate decreased to 21% compared with 33% in 2008. For 2008, Southeast home sale revenues decreased 21% due to an 18% decrease in unit settlements combined with a 4% decrease in the average selling price. Operating results were negatively impacted by $59.5 million and $26.9 million of land related charges in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Net new orders for 2008 decreased 34% compared with 2007. During 2008, increased cancellation rates were attributable to lower new order sign up activity and increased cancellations in all markets. Cancellation rates for 2008 were 33% compared with 28% for 2007. Gulf Coast: For 2009, Gulf Coast home sale revenues decreased 23% compared with 2008 due to a 15% decrease in unit settlements combined with a 9% decrease in the average selling price, including a significant decrease in home sale revenues in our North and Central Florida markets. Excluding Centex, home sale revenues, settlements, and average selling price decreased compared with the prior year period. The Gulf Coast area experienced an increased loss before income taxes in 2009 compared with 2008 due to decreased home sale revenues and higher land related charges, which totaled $261.3 million and $247.7 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Excluding land related charges, gross margins increased moderately compared with 2008. Net new orders increased by 5% compared with 2008. The cancellation rate in 2009 was 25% compared with 33% in 2008. 31 Table of Contents Homebuilding Segment Operations (continued) Gulf Coast (continued): For 2008, Gulf Coast home sale revenues decreased 28% compared with 2007 due to a 19% decrease in unit settlements combined with a 12% decrease in the average selling price. While all of our Gulf Coast markets experienced a loss before income taxes in 2008, the overall loss before income taxes decreased in 2008 compared with 2007 due to significantly lower impairments and land related charges, which totaled $247.7 million and $480.4 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Net new orders in 2008 decreased 38% compared with 2007. Cancellation rates for 2008 were 33% compared with 31% for 2007. Midwest: Our Midwest segment continues to face difficult local economic conditions in the majority of its markets. For 2009, Midwest home sale revenues decreased 38% compared with 2008 due to a 32% decrease in unit settlements combined with a 10% decrease in the average selling price, including a significant decrease in our Illinois markets home sale revenues. Excluding Centex, home sale revenues, settlements, and average selling price decreased compared with 2008. Despite lower home sale revenues, the segments loss before income taxes decreased during 2009 due to lower land related charges, which totaled $45.7 million in 2009 compared with $100.1 million in 2008. Net new orders declined by 18% compared with 2008 due to the difficult market conditions. Cancellation rates were 18% for 2009 compared with 23% for 2008. The Midwest operations were one of the most challenged areas in the country in 2008 due to difficult local economic conditions. Midwest home sale revenues decreased 37% compared with 2007 due to a 32% decrease in unit settlements combined with an 8% decrease in average selling prices. For 2008 and 2007, Midwest operating results were negatively impacted by land related charges of $100.1 million and $354.7 million, respectively. Net new orders in 2008 decreased 37% compared with 2007. For 2008, cancellation rates were 23% compared with 26% for 2007. Southwest: For 2009, Southwest home sale revenues decreased 56% compared with 2008 due to a 50% decrease in unit settlements combined with a 12% decrease in average selling prices. Excluding Centex, home sale revenues, settlements, and average selling price decreased compared with 2008. The decreased loss before income taxes in 2009 was primarily attributable to lower land related charges, which totaled $222.5 million in 2009 compared with $588.0 million in 2008. During 2009 the Southwest market also incurred charges of $19.3 million related to investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. Excluding land related charges, several of our Southwest markets experienced higher gross margins during 2009 compared with 2008, including Phoenix West and New Mexico. Net new orders declined by 31% in 2009 compared with 2008 due to the difficult market conditions. Cancellation rates were 26% for 2009 compared with 37% for 2008. In 2008, Southwest home sale revenues decreased 37% due to a 25% decrease in unit settlements combined with a 16% decrease in average selling prices. During 2008 and 2007, our Southwest operations recorded impairments and land related charges of $588.0 million and $404.8 million, respectively. During 2007, Southwests results also included impairments of $59.1 million related to unconsolidated joint ventures. Net new orders for 2008 decreased 41% compared with 2007, and cancellation rates remained flat compared with 2007. West: For 2009, West home sale revenues decreased 26% compared with 2008 due to a 15% decrease in unit settlements combined with a 14% decrease in average selling prices as the majority of our West markets experienced lower home sale revenues. Excluding Centex, home sale revenues, settlements, and average selling price decreased compared with 2008. During 2009, the reduction in revenues was partially offset by higher gross margins in several of our markets, which also included $96.5 million in land related charges and a $1.2 million valuation adjustment related to unconsolidated joint ventures. The lower loss before income taxes in 2009 was primarily due to significantly lower land related charges and impairments in unconsolidated joint ventures, which totaled $270.0 million and $15.4 million, respectively, in 2008. Excluding land related charges, we experienced increased gross margins in each of our West markets, with the exception of the Bay Area. Net new orders increased by 4% in 2009 compared with 2008. Cancellation rates were 25% in 2009 compared with 44% in 2008. 32 Table of Contents Homebuilding Segment Operations (continued) West (continued): West home sale revenues decreased 45% in 2008 due primarily to a 34% decrease in unit settlements and a 16% decrease in average selling price. In 2008, West recorded impairments and land related charges of $270.0 million and $15.4 million of valuation adjustments related to unconsolidated joint ventures. In 2007, West recorded land related charges of $468.1 million and $128.3 million of valuation adjustments related to unconsolidated joint ventures. Net new orders for 2008 decreased 48% compared with 2007. For 2008, cancellation rates were approximately 44% compared with 43% for 2007. Financial Services Operations We conduct our Financial Services operations, which include mortgage and title operations, through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries. We originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various credit arrangements, and then sell such mortgage loans monthly to outside investors. Also, we sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts. The following table presents selected financial information for our Financial Services operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Mortgage operations revenues $ 92,933 $ 135,409 $ 113,967 Title services revenues 24,867 15,607 20,802 Total Financial Services revenues 117,800 151,016 134,769 Expenses (172,854 ) (123,082 ) (92,150 ) Equity income 16 111 361 Income (loss) before income taxes $ (55,038 ) $ 28,045 $ 42,980 Total originations: Loans 10,737 15,227 23,404 Principal $ 2,276,400 $ 3,403,500 $ 5,336,400 Our Homebuilding customers continue to account for substantially all loan production, representing 98% of loan originations for 2009, and 99% of loan originations in both 2008 and 2007. Total Financial Services revenues during 2009, which include $30.6 million related to Centex, decreased 22% compared with 2008 primarily as a result of lower loan origination volume due to lower home settlements within our Homebuilding operations. Financial Services revenues for 2008 increased 12% compared with 2007. The increase was attributable to a combination of a shift in product mix to agency loans, which are more profitable to us, and the adoption of two new accounting standards, SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 109 Written Loan Commitments Recorded at Fair Value Through Earnings (SAB 109) and the financial instruments topic of the Accounting Standards Codification. These standards were adopted effective January 1, 2008 and require that the fair value of interest rate lock loan commitments include the fair value of future servicing rights and that loans held for sale for which we elected the fair value option be carried at fair value rather than at the lower of cost or market. The adoption of these standards resulted in an increase to mortgage operations revenues of $32.0 million during 2008 and an increase to expenses of $27.5 million. Partially offsetting these favorable impacts was a significant decrease in loan origination volume. Interest income, which is included in mortgage operations revenues, was significantly lower in 2009 than in 2008 and significantly lower in 2008 than in 2007, primarily due to the decrease in loan origination volume. Revenues from our title operations increased 59% in 2009 compared with 2008 due to the Centex merger, and decreased 25% in 2008 compared with 2007 due to the declines in home settlements. 33 Table of Contents Financial Services Operations (continued) Mortgage origination unit volume and principal volume decreased 29% and 33%, respectively, in 2009 compared with 2008 and 35% and 36%, respectively, in 2008 compared with 2007. The decrease in unit volume is due primarily to lower home settlements. Excluding Centex, mortgage origination unit volume decreased 46% in 2009 compared with 2008, while mortgage origination principal volume decreased 48% in 2009 compared with 2008. Agency production for funded origination principal was 99%, 98%, and 82% in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Within the funded agency origination principal, FHA loans were approximately 40%, 25%, and 6% in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Our capture rate for 2009 was 85.3%, while the capture rates for 2008 and 2007 were both 92%. Our capture rate represents loan originations from our Homebuilding operations as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our Homebuilding operations, excluding cash settlements. The decrease in mortgage origination principal volume resulted from the reduced settlement volume combined with lower average selling prices, which reduced the average loan size. At December 31, 2009, our loan application backlog was $877.9 million, compared with $342.0 million at December 31, 2008. The mortgage industry experienced a significant shift away from adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs), which generally have a lower profit per loan, to fixed rate mortgages during 2009 and 2008. Interest only mortgages, a component of ARMs, also decreased significantly during 2009 and 2008. Substantially all loan production in 2009 and 2008 consisted of fixed rate loans, the majority of which are prime, conforming loans. We define prime loans as full documentation first mortgages with FICO scores of 621 or higher, Alt A loans as non full documentation first mortgages with FICO scores of 621 or higher, and sub prime loans as first mortgages with FICO scores of 620 or lower. Income before income taxes decreased $83.1 million in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to decreased loan origination volumes, lower values of servicing rights, and increased loan loss reserves, including $60.9 million related to mortgage loan repurchase obligations. The 2009 loss before income taxes also includes certain integration costs directly related to the Centex merger totaling $8.4 million. Income before income taxes decreased 35% in 2008 compared with 2007 as the higher mortgage operations revenues were offset by decreased loan origination volumes, increased loan loss reserves, an impairment of goodwill totaling $0.7 million, and restructuring expenses of $4.1 million related to our overhead reduction initiatives. Since we sell the majority of our loans monthly and retain only limited risk related to the loans we originate, our overall loan loss reserves have historically not been significant. During recent years, however, we experienced increased losses in our loans held for investment, repurchased or re insured loans, and foreclosed properties. The largest source for these losses has been a significant increase in actual and anticipated losses for loans previously originated and sold to investors, which have increased as a result of the high level of loan defaults and related losses in the mortgage industry and increasing aggressiveness by investors in presenting such claims to the Company. Additionally, Centexs mortgage operations were historically broader than Pulte Mortgages, so our exposure to losses related to loans previously originated has increased significantly. As a result, loan loss provisions related to our portfolio loans, real estate owned, and mortgage reinsurance included in expenses totaled $9.8 million, $17.0 million, and $7.8 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Additionally, we recorded provisions for losses related to contingent consideration repurchase obligations of $60.9 million, $2.4 million, and $1.8 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, We are exposed to market risks from commitments to lend, movements in interest rates, and cancelled or modified commitments to lend. A commitment to lend at a specific interest rate (an interest rate lock commitment) is a derivative financial instrument (interest rate is locked to the borrower). In order to reduce these risks, we use other derivative financial instruments to economically hedge the interest rate lock commitment. These financial instruments can include cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury futures contracts, and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities. We enter into one of the aforementioned derivative financial instruments upon accepting interest rate lock commitments. The changes in the fair value of the interest rate lock commitment and the other derivative financial instruments are included in Financial Services revenues. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 34 Table of Contents Other Non Operating Other non operating expenses consist of income and expenses related to corporate services provided to our subsidiaries. These expenses are incurred for financing, developing, and implementing strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies, and providing the necessary administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Accordingly, these results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve. The following table presents a summary of other non operating expenses ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Net interest income $ 6,905 $ 23,496 $ 2,731 Other income (expense), net (73,689 ) (39,429 ) (33,122 ) Loss before income taxes $ (66,784 ) $ (15,933 ) $ (30,391 ) The decrease in net interest income in 2009 compared with 2008 resulted from significantly lower interest rates on our invested cash balances. Net interest income in 2008 exceeded the prior year as a result of higher invested cash balances. Other income (expense), net includes gains (losses) on debt retirements of ($31.6) million, ($1.6) million, and $0.5 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The loss before income taxes also includes certain integration costs directly related to the Centex merger totaling $5.4 million for 2009, which consists primarily of severance benefits. Additionally, compared with the prior year period, compensation related expenses increased in 2009 primarily as a result of duplicative corporate overhead expenses during the transition period following the Centex merger. Other income (expense), net in 2008 exceeded 2007 primarily as a result of expenses related to the amendments of our unsecured revolving credit facility and the repurchase of $313.4 million of our senior notes due 2009 by means of a tender offer completed in June 2008. We capitalize interest cost into inventory during the active development and construction of our communities. Each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development. Interest expense is allocated over the period based on the cyclical timing of unit settlements. Interest expensed to Homebuilding cost of revenues for 2009, 2008, and 2007 includes $68.2 million, $84.8 million, and $110.8 million, respectively, of capitalized interest related to inventory impairments. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we capitalized all of our Homebuilding interest costs into inventory because the level of our active inventory exceeded our debt levels. As a result of our inventory management strategies and potential future inventory impairments, it is reasonably possible that our debt levels will exceed the amount of our active inventory at some point during 2010, which would require us to expense some portion of our Homebuilding interest costs as incurred. Information related to interest capitalized into inventory is as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Interest in inventory, beginning of period $ 170,020 $ 160,598 $ 235,596 Interest capitalized 234,700 220,131 240,000 Interest expensed (165,355 ) (210,709 ) (314,998 ) Interest in inventory, end of period $ 239,365 $ 170,020 $ 160,598 Interest incurred* $ 236,962 $ 223,039 $ 243,864 * Interest incurred includes interest on our senior debt, short term borrowings, and other financing arrangements and excludes interest incurred by our financial services operations. Income Taxes Our income tax assets and liabilities and related effective tax rate are affected by a number of factors, the most significant of which is the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets. Due to the effect of our valuation allowance adjustments in 2009, 2008, and 2007, our effective tax rates for these years are not meaningful. Our effective tax rates were a benefit of 40.1% for 2009 compared with expense of 12.4% and 8.9% for 2008 and 2007, respectively. 35 Table of Contents Income Taxes (continued) Our 2009 income tax benefit of $792.6 million is primarily due to the impact of the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009 (the Act), which was enacted into law on November 6, 2009. The Act amended Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code to allow net operating losses realized in either tax year 2008 or 2009 to be carried back up to five years (previously limited to two years). The Company recorded income taxes receivable of $867.3 million at December 31, 2009, related to net operating losses pursuant to the Act. The effective tax rate for 2008 differs from the effective tax rate for 2007 primarily as the result of the non deductible goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2007. Discontinued Operations In 2007, income from discontinued operations includes $18.7 million in refundable income taxes related to our investment in our discontinued Mexico homebuilding operations. We disposed of our Mexico homebuilding operations in December 2005. Liquidity and Capital Resources We finance our land acquisitions, development, and construction activities by using internally generated funds and existing credit arrangements. We routinely monitor current and expected operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate the use of available financing sources, including securities offerings. Based on our current financial condition and credit relationships, we believe that our operations and borrowing resources are sufficient to provide for our current and foreseeable capital requirements. However, we continue to evaluate the impact of market conditions on our liquidity and may determine that modifications are appropriate if market conditions continue to deteriorate or if the current difficult market conditions extend beyond our expectations. At December 31, 2009, we had cash and equivalents of $1.9 billion and no borrowings outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility). We also had $4.3 billion of senior notes outstanding. Other financing included limited recourse land collateralized financing totaling $2.0 million. Sources of our working capital include our cash and equivalents, our Credit Facility, our unsecured letter of credit facility (the LOC Agreement), and Pulte Mortgages committed credit arrangements. Additionally, we expect to receive significant federal tax refunds as a result of the carryback of taxable losses provided for under the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009. We expect to receive the majority of these refunds in the first half of 2010, including the receipt of $193.0 million in January 2010. We follow a diversified investment approach for our cash and equivalents by maintaining such funds with a diversified portfolio of banks within our group of relationship banks in high quality, highly liquid, short term investments, generally money market funds and federal government or agency securities. We monitor our investments with each bank on a daily basis and do not believe our cash and equivalents are exposed to any material risk of loss. However, given the current volatility in the global financial markets, there can be no assurances that losses of principal balance on our cash and equivalents will not occur. Our ratio of debt to total capitalization, excluding our land collateralized and Financial Services debt, was 57.3% at December 31, 2009, and 42.8% net of cash and equivalents. As of September 30, 2009, the Company was not in compliance with the tangible net worth covenant under the Credit Facility. The Company subsequently requested and received a limited waiver from its banks until December 15, 2009, permitting the Company to utilize letters of credit under the credit facility during the term of the waiver. On December 11, 2009, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment and Waiver to Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which decreased the Companys borrowing capacity from $1.0 billion to $750.0 million, reduced the credit facilitys uncommitted accordion feature from $1.75 billion to $1.0 billion, replaced the maximum debt to capitalization ratio with a maximum debt to tangible capital limit, reduced the tangible net worth minimum, and waived any default under the previous credit facility resulting from failure to comply with the tangible net worth financial covenant. 36 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Under the terms of the Credit Facility, we have the capacity to issue letters of credit totaling up to $750.0 million. Borrowing availability is reduced by the amount of letters of credit outstanding. The Credit Facility includes a borrowing base limitation when we do not have an investment grade senior unsecured debt rating from at least two of Fitch Ratings, Moodys Investor Service, and Standard and Poors Corporation (the Rating Agencies). We currently do not have investment grade ratings from any of the Rating Agencies and are therefore subject to the borrowing base limitation. Given the uncertainty of current market conditions, we anticipate operating under the borrowing base limitation throughout 2010. Under the borrowing base limitation, the sum of our senior debt and the amount drawn on the Credit Facility may not exceed an amount based on certain percentages of various categories of our unencumbered inventory and other assets. At December 31, 2009, we had no borrowings outstanding and full availability of the remaining $249.4 million under the Credit Facility after consideration of $500.6 million of outstanding letters of credit. As a result, the borrowing base limitation did not restrict our borrowing at December 31, 2009. We are also required to maintain certain liquidity reserve accounts in the event we fail to satisfy an interest coverage test. Specifically, if the interest coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) is less than 2.0 to 1.0, we are required to maintain cash and equivalents in designated accounts with certain banks. While our access to and utilization of cash and equivalents maintained in liquidity reserve accounts is not restricted, failure to maintain sufficient balances within the liquidity reserve accounts restricts our ability to utilize the Credit Facility. We maintained the required cash and equivalents of $415.1 million within the liquidity reserve accounts at December 31, 2009, calculated under the Credit Facility as two times the amount by which the interest incurred over the last four quarters exceeds interest income over the last four quarters, excluding Financial Services. Additionally, failure to satisfy the interest coverage test can also result in an increase to LIBOR margin and letter of credit pricing. Our interest coverage ratio for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 was negative 1.29. Due to the increase in our senior notes outstanding resulting from the Centex merger, we expect the required cash and equivalents to be maintained within the liquidity reserve accounts to increase in 2010. For the period ending March 31, 2010, we will be required to maintain cash and equivalents of $455.6 million within the liquidity reserve accounts, calculated as of December 31, 2009. The Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants. We are required to not exceed a debt to tangible capital ratio as well as to meet a tangible net worth covenant each quarter. At December 31, 2009, our debt to tangible capital ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) was 57.3% (compared with the requirement not to exceed 60.0%) while our tangible net worth (as defined in the Credit Facility) cushion was $855.7 million. Violations of the financial covenants in the Credit Facility, if not waived by the lenders or cured, could result in an optional maturity date acceleration by the lenders, which might require repayment of any borrowings and replacement or cash collateralization of any letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility. In the event these violations were not waived by the lenders or cured, the violations could also result in a default under the Companys $4.3 billion of senior notes. As of December 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants under the Credit Facility. However, in the event market conditions deteriorate in the future or the Company incurs additional land related charges, the Companys compliance with the required covenant levels may be adversely impacted. Additionally, the Companys ability to utilize the full capacity of the Credit Facility may be limited under the terms of the borrowing base. In June 2009, the Company entered into the LOC Agreement, a five year, unsecured letter of credit facility that permits the issuance of up to $200.0 million of letters of credit by the Company. The LOC Agreement supplements the Companys existing letter of credit capacity included in our Credit Facility. At December 31, 2009, $28.6 million of letters of credit were outstanding under the LOC Agreement. Pulte Mortgage provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available pursuant to its committed credit arrangements. Pulte Mortgage uses these resources to finance its lending activities until the mortgage loans are sold to third party investors. At December 31, 2009, Pulte Mortgage had $18.4 million outstanding under three separate master repurchase agreements with a total borrowing capacity of $175.0 million, subject to certain sublimits. These repurchase agreements expire at different dates in 2010 beginning in May and contain various affirmative and negative covenants, including certain financial covenants. Based on current market conditions, there is a reasonable risk that Pulte Mortgage may not be able to comply with at least one of the required covenants prior to the maturity of the related repurchase agreement. Violations of any of the covenants in the repurchase agreements, if not waived by the lenders or cured, could result in an optional maturity date acceleration by the lenders, which might require repayment of any borrowings. Given the uncertainty in the capital markets, there can be no assurances that we will be able to renew or replace the repurchase agreements on commercially reasonable terms upon their expiration. In the event of any of these occurrences, we believe we have adequate liquidity to meet Pulte Mortgages anticipated financing needs. 37 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) CTX Mortgage, which we acquired with the Centex merger, previously maintained a master repurchase agreement with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. that provided for advances of up to $50.0 million, subject to certain sublimits, and was scheduled to expire on January 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2009 we had transitioned all of CTX Mortgages loan origination production to Pulte Mortgage. Accordingly, we terminated CTX Mortgages master repurchase agreement in December 2009. Pursuant to the two $100.0 million stock repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors in October 2002 and 2005, and the $200.0 million stock repurchase authorization in February 2007 (for a total stock repurchase authorization of $400 million), we have repurchased a total of 9,688,900 shares for a total of $297.7 million. There were no repurchases under these programs during 2009. We had remaining authorization to purchase common stock aggregating $102.3 million at December 31, 2009. For the last three years, we have generated significant positive cash flow primarily through the liquidation of land inventory without a corresponding level of reinvestment combined with refunds of income taxes paid in prior years. We have used this positive cash flow to, among other things, increase our cash reserves as well as retire outstanding debt. While we expect to receive significant federal tax refunds in the first half of 2010, there can be no assurances that we will be able to continue to generate positive cash flow at the same levels in the future. Our net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $738.9 million in 2009 and $1.2 billion in each of 2008 and 2007. The primary drivers of cash flow from operations are profitability and inventory levels. For the years 2007 through 2009, our net loss was largely attributable to non cash asset impairments, including land related charges and investments in unconsolidated entities, goodwill impairments, and a deferred tax asset valuation allowance. We have also generated significant cash flow by focusing on right sizing our land and house inventory in 2009 and 2008 to better match current market conditions, which resulted in a significant net decrease to inventories. In addition, we received federal income tax refunds totaling $362.0 million, $212.1 million, and $67.5 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Cash provided by investing activities totaled $1.7 billion in 2009, substantially all of which resulted from the $1.7 billion of cash acquired with the Centex merger. Excluding cash acquired with the Centex merger, cash used in investing activities decreased in 2009 from 2008 primarily as a result of lower investments in unconsolidated entities offset by higher capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities was $55.9 million in 2008 compared with $221.4 million in 2007. The significant decrease in cash used in investing activities during 2008 compared with 2007 resulted primarily from lower investments in unconsolidated entities and lower capital expenditures. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $2.2 billion, $567.7 million, and $487.6 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The significant increase in cash used in investing activities in 2009 resulted primarily from the repurchase of $1.5 billion of senior notes during a tender offer completed in September 2009. We also retired $236.4 million of senior notes at scheduled maturity dates and repurchased an additional $192.9 million of senior notes during 2009. The increase in net cash used in 2008 compared with 2007 was largely attributable to the repurchase of $313.4 million of senior notes by means of a tender offer in 2008 compared with total senior note repurchases of $61.2 million in 2007. This was partially offset by reduced repayments under our Financial Services credit agreements as the result of lower volumes. On November 24, 2008, our Board of Directors discontinued the regular quarterly dividend on our common stock effective in the first quarter of 2009. Inflation We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation may also increase our financing, labor, and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. While we attempt to pass to our customers increases in our costs through increased sales prices, the current industry conditions have resulted in lower sales prices in substantially all of our markets. If we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs, or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly, affecting our prospective homebuyers ability to adequately finance home purchases, our revenues, gross margins, and net income would be adversely affected. 38 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Seasonality We experience variability in our quarterly results from operations due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry. Historically, we have experienced significant increases in revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home settlements. However, the challenging market conditions experienced since early 2006 have lessened the seasonal variations of our results. Given the current significant uncertainty in the homebuilding industry, we can make no assurances as to when and whether our historical seasonality will recur. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009: Payments Due by Period($000s omitted) Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 After 2014 Contractual obligations: Long term debt (a) $ 7,229,839 $ 314,937 $ 973,000 $ 1,715,823 $ 4,226,079 Operating lease obligations 256,092 54,162 76,536 48,992 76,402 Other long term liabilities (b) 2,337 990 1,068 129 150 Total contractual obligations (c) $ 7,488,268 $ 370,089 $ 1,050,604 $ 1,764,944 $ 4,302,631 (a) Represents our senior notes and related interest payments. (b) Represents our limited recourse collateralized financing arrangements and related interest payments. (c) We do not have any payments due in connection with capital lease or purchase obligations. We are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts (including land option contracts) for the purchase, development, and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business. Option contracts for the purchase of land enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we are ready to build homes on them. This reduces our financial risks associated with long term land holdings. At December 31, 2009, we had agreements to acquire 16,421 homesites through option contracts. At December 31, 2009, we had $140.8 million of non refundable option deposits and pre acquisition costs related to these agreements. At December 31, 2009, we had $326.1 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits and $80.6 million of related accrued interest and penalties. We are currently under examination by various taxing jurisdictions and anticipate finalizing the examinations with certain jurisdictions within the next twelve months. However, the final outcome of these examinations is not yet determinable. The statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for tax years 1998 2008. The following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2009: Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period($000s omitted) Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 After 2014 Other commercial commitments: Guarantor credit facilities (a) $ 950,000 $ $ 750,000 $ 200,000 $ Non guarantor repurchase agreements 175,000 175,000 Total commercial commitments (b) $ 1,125,000 $ 175,000 $ 750,000 $ 200,000 $ (a) Includes capacity to issue up to $950.0 million in letters of credit, of which $529.2 million were outstanding at December 31, 2009. (b) Excludes performance and surety bonds of approximately $2.9 billion, which typically do not have stated expiration dates. 39 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We use letters of credit and performance and surety bonds to guarantee our performance under various contracts, principally in connection with the development of our projects. The expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related homebuilding projects. If the obligations related to a project are ongoing, annual extensions of the letters of credit are typically granted on a year to year basis. At December 31, 2009, we had outstanding letters of credit of $529.2 million. Performance bonds and surety bonds generally do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These bonds, which approximated $2.9 billion at December 31, 2009, are typically outstanding over a period of approximately three to five years. We do not believe that there will be draws upon any such letters of credit or performance or surety bonds. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land option or option type agreements in order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future. At December 31, 2009, these agreements totaled approximately $666.5 million. Pursuant to these land option agreements, we provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future, usually at predetermined prices. In certain instances, we are required to record the land under option as if we own it. At December 31, 2009, we consolidated certain land option agreements and recorded assets of $174.1 million as land, not owned, under option agreements. At December 31, 2009, aggregate outstanding debt of unconsolidated joint ventures was $69.5 million, of which our proportionate share of such joint venture debt was $25.3 million. Of our proportionate share of joint venture debt, we provided limited recourse guaranties for $19.0 million of such joint venture debt at December 31, 2009. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10 K for additional information. For 2009, 2008, and 2007, we recognized equity loss from our unconsolidated joint ventures of $49.7 million, $12.8 million, and $190.0 million, respectively. The equity loss recognized during 2009, 2008, and 2007 includes land valuation adjustments of $54.1 million, $18.5 million, and $189.9 million, respectively. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these consolidated financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements, giving due regard to materiality. Revenue recognition Homebuilding Homebuilding revenue and related profit are generally recognized at the time of the closing of the sale, when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. In situations where the buyers financing is originated by Pulte Mortgage, our wholly owned mortgage subsidiary, and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment as required by ASC 360 20, Property, Plant, and Equipment Real Estate Sales, the profit on such sales is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a third party investor has been completed unless there is a loss on the sale in which case the loss on such sale is recognized at the time of closing. Financial Services Mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors. Servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance, or a contracted set fee in the case of certain sub servicing arrangements, and are credited to income when related mortgage payments are received or the sub servicing fees are earned. With the adoption of SFAS 159 (codified within ASC 825, Financial Instruments) effective January 1, 2008, loan origination fees, commitment fees, and certain direct loan origination costs are recognized as incurred. Previously, such fees and costs were deferred as an adjustment to the cost of the related loans and recognized as an adjustment to revenues upon the sale of such loans. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold. Interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold. Loans are placed on non accrual status once they become greater than 90 days past due their contractual terms. Subsequent payments received are applied according to the contractual terms of the loan. 40 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Inventory valuation Inventory is stated at the lower of accumulated cost or fair value, as determined in accordance ASC 360 10, Property, Plant, and Equipment Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (ASC 360 10). Accumulated cost includes costs associated with land acquisition, land development, and home construction costs, including interest, real estate taxes, and certain direct and indirect overhead costs related to development and construction. For those communities for which construction and development activities have been idled, applicable interest and real estate taxes are expensed as incurred. Land acquisition and development costs are allocated to individual lots using an average lot cost determined based on the total expected land acquisition and development costs and the total expected home closings for the community. The specific identification method is used to accumulate home construction costs. We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories. Each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development. Interest expense is allocated over the period based on the cyclical timing of unit settlements. Cost of sales includes the construction cost, average lot cost, estimated warranty costs, and commissions and closing costs applicable to the home. The construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home, plus an appropriate accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid, based on an analysis of budgeted construction cost. This accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared with the amount accrued, and adjustments are made if needed. Total community land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared with actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete. The development cycles for our communities range from under one year to in excess of ten years for certain master planned communities. Adjustments to estimated total land acquisition and development costs for the community affect the amounts costed for the communitys remaining lots. In accordance with ASC 360 10, we record valuation adjustments on land inventory and related communities under development when events and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired and when the cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. For communities that demonstrate indicators of impairment, we compare the expected undiscounted cash flows for these communities to their carrying value. For those communities whose carrying values exceed the expected undiscounted cash flows, we calculate the fair value of the community. Impairment charges are required to be recorded if the fair value of the communitys inventory is less than its carrying value. We generally determine the fair value of each communitys inventory using a combination of market comparable transactions, where available, and discounted cash flow models. These estimated cash flows are significantly impacted by estimates related to expected average selling prices and sale incentives, expected sales paces and cancellation rates, expected land development and construction timelines, and anticipated land development, construction, and overhead costs. Such estimates must be made for each individual community and may vary significantly between communities. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process, the significant volatility in demand for new housing, and the long life cycles of many communities, actual results could differ significantly from such estimates. Investments in unconsolidated entities We have investments in a number of unconsolidated entities, including joint ventures, with independent third parties. Many of these unconsolidated entities purchase, develop, and or sell land and homes in the United States and Puerto Rico. The equity method of accounting is used for unconsolidated entities over which we have significant influence; generally this represents partnership equity or common stock ownership interests of at least 20% and not more than 50%. Under the equity method of accounting, we recognize our proportionate share of the profits and losses of these entities. Certain of these entities sell land to us. In these situations, we defer the recognition of profits from such activities until the time the related homes are sold. The cost method of accounting is used for investments in which we have less than a 20% ownership interest and do not have the ability to exercise significant influence. 41 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments in unconsolidated entities (continued) We evaluate our investments in unconsolidated entities for recoverability in accordance with ASC 323, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures. If we determine that a loss in the value of the investment is other than temporary, we write down the investment to its estimated fair value. Any such losses are recorded to equity loss in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Additionally, each unconsolidated entity evaluates its long lived assets, such as inventory, for recoverability in accordance with ASC 360 10. Our proportionate share of any such impairments under ASC 360 10 are also recorded to equity loss in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Evaluations of recoverability under both ASC 323 and ASC 360 10 are primarily based on projected cash flows. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process and the significant volatility in demand for new housing, actual results could differ significantly from such estimates. Residential mortgage loans Prior to January 1, 2008, residential mortgage loans available for sale were stated at the lower of aggregate cost or market value. In accordance with ASC 825, Financial Instruments (ASC 825), we elected the fair value option for our portfolio loans available for sale and for first mortgage loans originated subsequent to December 31, 2007. ASC 825 permits entities to measure various financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on a contract by contract basis. Election of the fair value option for residential mortgage loans available for sale allows a better offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. Changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in revenues as they occur. Loans held for investment consist of interim financing mortgage loans for certain of our customers as well as a portfolio of loans that either have been repurchased from investors or were not saleable upon closing. These loans are carried at cost and reviewed for impairment when recoverability becomes doubtful. Mortgage loan allowances and loan origination liabilities Our mortgage operations have established liabilities for anticipated losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors that may result from borrower fraud, borrower early payment defaults, or loans that have not been underwritten in accordance with the investor guidelines. In the normal course of business, our mortgage operations also provide limited indemnities for certain loans sold to investors. We establish the liabilities for such anticipated losses based upon, among other things, historical loss rates, current trends in loan originations, and the geographic location of the underlying collateral. From time to time, our mortgage operations will be required to repurchase certain loans we originated and sold to third parties. If a repurchased loan is performing, it is classified as a residential mortgage loan available for sale and recorded at fair value. Such repurchased loans are typically re sold to third party investors. If a repurchased loan is nonperforming, the loan is classified as loans held for investment. We establish an allowance for such loans based on our historical loss experience and current loss trends. Although we consider our mortgage loan allowances and loan origination liabilities reflected in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets to be adequate, there can be no assurance that these allowances and liabilities will prove to be sufficient over time to cover ultimate losses in connection with our loan originations. These allowances and liabilities may prove to be inadequate due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, the mortgage market, or discrete events adversely affecting specific borrowers. 42 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Goodwill and intangible assets We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill related to the Centex merger completed in 2009. Goodwill, which represents the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of the net assets at the acquisition date, is subject to annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill by comparing the carrying value of each of our reporting units to their estimated fair value. We determine the fair value of each reporting unit using accepted valuation methods, including the use of discounted cash flows supplemented by market based assessments of fair value, and measure impairment as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded carrying value. Such fair values are significantly impacted by estimates related to current market valuations, current and future economic conditions in each of our geographical markets, and our strategic plans within each of our markets. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process and the significant volatility in demand for new housing, actual results could differ significantly from such estimates. If our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly, goodwill may be impaired. We have also recorded certain intangible assets related to tradenames acquired with the Centex merger completed in 2009 and the Del Webb merger completed in 2001, which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives. The carrying values and ultimate realization of these assets are dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use. If we determine that the carrying values of intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment, we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists. If the carrying values of the intangible assets exceed the expected undiscounted cash flows, then we measure impairment as the difference between the fair value of the asset and the recorded carrying value. If our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly or if our strategy related to the use of such intangible assets changes, the related intangible assets may be impaired. Allowance for warranties Home purchasers are provided with a limited warranty against certain building defects, including a one to two year comprehensive limited warranty and coverage for certain other aspects of the homes construction and operating systems for periods of up to ten years. We estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and the cost per claim. We periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability for each geographic market in which we operate and adjust the amounts as necessary. Actual warranty costs in the future could differ from our estimates. Self insured risks We have, and require the majority of our subcontractors to have, general liability, property, errors and omissions, workers compensation, and other business insurance. These insurance policies protect us against a portion of the risk of loss from claims, subject to certain self insured retentions, deductibles, and other coverage limits. We reserve for costs to cover our self insured and deductible amounts under those policies and for any costs of claims and related lawsuits, based on an analysis of our historical claims, which includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. These estimates are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors, including extended lag times in the reporting and resolution of claims, which generally occur over several years and can occur in excess of ten years, and trends or changes in claim settlement patterns, insurance industry practices, and legal interpretations. As a result, actual costs could differ significantly from the estimated amounts. Adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs. Stock based compensation We calculate the fair value of stock options using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions, which involve a number of variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, the expected dividend yield, and expected stock option exercise behavior. In addition, we also use judgment in estimating the number of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited. 43 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Income taxes We calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. In determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns, judgment is required. Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. We adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48, codified within ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740), effective January 1, 2007. FIN 48 created a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions and clarifies accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provided guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. Evaluations of our tax positions consider changes in facts or circumstances, changes in law, correspondence with taxing authorities, and settlements of audit issues. New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our rate sensitive financing to the extent long term rates decline. The following tables set forth, as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, our rate sensitive financing obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates, and estimated fair value ($000s omitted). As of December 31, 2009 for theYears ending December 31, 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total FairValue Rate sensitive liabilities: Fixed interest rate debt: Senior notes $ 47,427 $ 231,683 $ 236,961 $ 495,131 $ 813,996 $ 2,522,865 $ 4,348,063 $ 4,087,269 Average interest rate 4.55% 7.89% 6.40% 5.64% 5.44% 6.33% 6.15% Non recourse collateralized financing $ 835 $ 839 $ 105 $ 42 $ 47 $ 136 $ 2,004 $ 2,004 Average interest rate 7.35% 7.36% 8.25% 10.00% 10.00% 10.00% 7.70% As of December 31, 2008 for theYears ending December 31, 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total FairValue Rate sensitive liabilities: Fixed interest rate debt: Senior notes $ 25,412 $ $ 698,563 $ $ 300,000 $ 2,150,000 $ 3,173,975 $ 2,136,628 Average interest rate 4.88% 7.95% 6.25% 6.24% 6.60% Non recourse collateralized financing $ 3,840 $ 890 $ 890 $ 75 $ $ $ 5,695 $ 5,695 Average interest rate 6.22% 7.25% 7.25% 7.25% 6.55% The increase in senior notes outstanding at December 31, 2009 compared with December 31, 2008 resulted from the senior notes assumed with the Centex merger. Pulte Mortgage, operating as a mortgage banker, is also subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed upon terms (i.e., commit to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2009 and 2008, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float. We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to LIBOR and (ii) hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments. These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury future contracts, and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in long term mortgage rates of plus 50, 100, and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results. At December 31, 2009, our aggregate net investment exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk includes our remaining non operating investments in Mexico, which approximated $0.2 million. 45 Table of Contents SPECIAL NOTES CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS As a cautionary note, except for the historical information contained herein, certain matters discussed in Item 1A., Risk Factors, Item 7., Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the Reform Act).
