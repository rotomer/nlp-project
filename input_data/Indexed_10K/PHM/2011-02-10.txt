ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview On August 18, 2009, we completed the acquisition of Centex through the merger of PulteGroups merger subsidiary with and into Centex pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of April 7, 2009 among PulteGroup, Pi Nevada Building Company, and Centex. As a result of the merger, Centex became a wholly owned subsidiary of PulteGroup. Accordingly, the results of Centex are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the merger. Since early 2006, the U.S. housing market has been unfavorably impacted by weak consumer confidence, tightened mortgage standards, and large supplies of resale and new home inventories and related pricing pressures, among other factors. When combined with the significant foreclosure activity, a more challenging appraisal environment, higher than normal unemployment levels, and uncertainty in the U.S. economy in recent periods, these conditions have contributed to sharply weakened demand for new homes, slower sales, and heightened pricing pressures to attract homebuyers. As a result, we have experienced a pre tax loss in each quarter since the fourth quarter of 2006. Such losses resulted from a combination of reduced operational profitability and significant asset impairments. Since the beginning of 2006, we have incurred total land related charges of $5.5 billion and goodwill impairments of $1.6 billion. The U.S. housing market and broader economy remain in a period of uncertainty; however, we are beginning to see signs of stabilization in certain of our local markets, though at near historically low levels. This more stable environment resulted in a significant reduction in the level of land related charges recorded during 2010 compared with recent years. We believe our strategic merger with Centex positions us well for a recovery in the homebuilding industry. However, significant short term uncertainty remains. The expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit associated with the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009 (the Act), which was applicable to orders under contract by April 30 and closed by September 30, 2010, favorably impacted our revenues for the first half of 2010 but also contributed to industry wide softness in new orders in the latter half of 2010. Entering 2011, there are indications that certain of the aforementioned negative trends may be slowing or improving. However, there are also a number of factors that may further worsen market conditions or delay a recovery in the homebuilding industry. Such factors include: High levels of unemployment, which are generally not expected to recede to historical levels during 2011, and associated low levels of consumer confidence; Continued high levels of foreclosure activity; Potentially higher mortgage interest rates, which might result from a variety of macroeconomic factors, as the current level of historically low mortgage interest rates is not believed to be sustainable for the long term; Increased costs and standards related to FHA loans, which continue to be a significant source of customer financing; The overall impact of the federal governments intervention in the U.S. economy, including the expiration of various economic stimulus programs; and Potential impacts of reforms to the overall U.S. financial services and mortgage industries that may have an adverse impact on the ability of our customers to finance their home purchases or on our access to the capital markets, including the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act enacted into law on July 21, 2010 and the potential re privatization of the government sponsored enterprises commonly known as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Accordingly, we continue to operate our business with the expectation that difficult market conditions will continue to impact us for at least the near term. While we are purchasing select land positions where it makes strategic and economic sense to do so, our targeted profile for such investments consists of developed lots, frequently under rolling lot option contracts, that are cash flow positive early in the project cycle and accretive to earnings. We also continue to evaluate each existing land parcel to determine whether the strategy and economics support holding the 21 Table of Contents Overview (continued) parcel or disposing of it. We have closely evaluated and made significant reductions in employee headcount and overhead expenses since the beginning of the industry downturn and in conjunction with the Centex merger. Due to the persistence of these difficult market conditions, improving the efficiency of our overhead costs will continue to be a significant area of focus. We are also adjusting the content in our homes to provide our customers more affordable alternatives, including building homes with smaller floor plans in certain of our communities. As a result of the Centex merger, we have achieved significant savings in corporate and divisional overhead costs and interest costs for the combined entity. We have also achieved synergies in our purchasing leverage and integrating the combined organizations operational best practices. The Centex merger has contributed to growth through expanded geographic and customer segment diversity and the ability to leverage additional brands. We believe that the combination of our operational improvement activities with the benefits of the Centex merger will help strengthen our market position and allow us to take advantage of opportunities that may develop in the future. While signs of improvement for the overall U.S. economy, employment, and consumer confidence provide reasons for some level of optimism, our outlook is tempered for 2011 as the timing of a sustainable recovery in the homebuilding industry remains uncertain. If the negative trends in economic conditions or financial market volatility experienced in recent years return either nationally or to any of our local markets, it could adversely affect our business and results of operations in future periods, including a further reduction in the demand for housing as well as difficulties in accessing financing on acceptable terms. Given these conditions and the continued weakness in new home sales, visibility as to future earnings performance is limited. Our evaluation for land related charges recorded to date assumed our best estimates of cash flows for the communities tested. If conditions in the homebuilding industry or our local markets worsen in the future, or if our strategy related to certain communities changes, we may be required to evaluate our assets, including additional projects, for further impairments or write downs, which could result in future charges that might be significant. The following is a summary of our operating results for 2010, 2009 and 2008 ($000s omitted, except per share data): Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Income (loss) before income taxes: Homebuilding $ (1,168,634 ) $ (1,853,297 ) $ (1,694,711 ) Financial Services 5,609 (55,038 ) 28,045 Other non operating (71,521 ) (66,784 ) (15,933 ) Loss from continuing operations before income taxes (1,234,546 ) (1,975,119 ) (1,682,599 ) Income tax benefit (137,817 ) (792,552 ) (209,486 ) Net loss $ (1,096,729 ) $ (1,182,567 ) $ (1,473,113 ) Per share data assuming dilution: Net loss $ (2.90 ) $ (3.94 ) $ (5.81 ) The losses experienced by Homebuilding in 2010, 2009, and 2008 resulted primarily from significant charges related to the following ($000s omitted): 2010 2009 2008 Land related charges (see Note 6) $ 216,352 $ 973,289 $ 1,530,225 Goodwill impairments (see Note 3) 656,298 562,990 5,654 Restructuring costs (see Note 4) 50,718 64,453 41,403 Merger related costs (see Note 2) 4,133 66,625 Insurance related charges (see Note 16) 280,390 $ 1,207,891 $ 1,667,357 $ 1,577,282 22 Table of Contents Overview (continued) For additional information on each of the above, see the applicable Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Merger related costs relates to transaction and integration costs directly related to the Centex merger. In total, Homebuilding incurred $123.7 million of such costs in 2009. These costs consisted of $57.0 million of restructuring costs (primarily severance and lease exit costs) included in the above table within restructuring costs plus $66.6 million of investment banking and other professional fees, amortization of certain fair value adjustments, and certain other integration costs. In addition to the above charges, Homebuilding continued to experience declining revenues (after adjusting for the incremental revenue resulting from the Centex merger) and challenged gross margins. The Financial Services loss in 2009 resulted primarily from a significant increase in loan losses, including $60.9 million related to mortgage loan repurchase obligations compared with $16.9 million and $2.4 million of such losses in 2010 and 2008, respectively (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The Financial Services loss in 2009 also included certain integration costs directly related to the Centex merger totaling $8.4 million, which consisted primarily of severance benefits and lease exit and related asset impairment costs. After adjusting for these items, the reduced profitability in 2010 and 2009 compared with 2008 resulted primarily from significantly lower loan origination volumes due to the lower Homebuilding volumes. Our other non operating loss during 2010 increased compared with 2009 and 2008 primarily due to a $38.9 million loss realized on the repurchase of debt in 2010 compared with $31.6 million in 2009 and $1.6 million in 2008 (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The other non operating loss before income taxes in 2009 also included certain transaction and integration costs directly related to the Centex merger totaling $5.4 million. The income tax benefit in 2010 was primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain federal and state income tax matters. The income tax benefit in 2009 reflected the impact of the Act, which allowed us to carry back 2009 taxable losses to prior years and receive refunds of previously paid federal income taxes. The income tax benefit in 2008 primarily represented the tax benefit associated with the taxable loss for that year. The operating results for the year ended December 31, 2009 included Centexs results for the period from August 19 to December 31, 2009 as follows ($000s omitted): Revenues Loss BeforeIncome Taxes Homebuilding $ 1,056,597 $ (546,219 ) Financial Services 30,612 (41,564 ) Other non operating (47,143 ) Total Centex $ 1,087,209 $ (634,926 ) The above operating results for Centexs Homebuilding operations included the aforementioned goodwill impairment charges of $563.0 million and the majority of the merger related transaction and integration costs. 23 Table of Contents Homebuilding Operations The following is a summary of loss before income taxes for our Homebuilding operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Home sale revenues (settlements) $ 4,419,812 $ 3,869,297 $ 5,980,289 Land sale revenues 27,815 97,292 131,749 Total Homebuilding revenues 4,447,627 3,966,589 6,112,038 Home cost of revenues (a) (4,006,385 ) (4,274,474 ) (6,585,177 ) Land cost of revenues (b) (53,555 ) (211,170 ) (393,998 ) Selling, general and administrative expense (855,699 ) (630,339 ) (776,673 ) Equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated entities (c) 2,843 (49,668 ) (12,924 ) Other income (expense), net (d) (703,465 ) (654,235 ) (37,977 ) Loss before income taxes $ (1,168,634 ) $ (1,853,297 ) $ (1,694,711 ) Active communities at December 31 786 882 572 Unit settlements 17,095 15,013 21,022 Average selling price $ 259 $ 258 $ 284 Net new orders: Units (e) 15,148 14,185 15,306 Dollars (f) $ 3,899,000 $ 3,708,000 $ 4,101,000 Backlog at December 31 (g): Units 3,984 5,931 2,174 Dollars $ 1,057,000 $ 1,577,000 $ 631,000 (a) Includes homebuilding interest expense, which represents the amortization of capitalized interest. Home cost of revenues also includes land and community valuation adjustments of $169.7 million, $751.2 million, and $1.2 billion for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. (b) Includes net realizable value adjustments for land held for sale of $39.1 million, $113.7 million, and $271.1 million for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. (c) Includes impairments of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, which totaled $1.9 million, $54.1 million, and $18.5 million for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. (d) Includes the write off of deposits and pre acquisition costs for land option contracts we no longer plan to pursue of $5.6 million, $54.3 million, and $33.3 million for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Also includes goodwill impairment charges of $656.3 million, $563.0 million, and $5.0 million for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. (e) Net new order units for the years ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 include Centexs operations, which contributed approximately 6,400 and 2,900 units, respectively. (f) Net new order dollars represent a composite of new order dollars combined with other movements of the dollars in backlog related to cancellations and change orders. Net new order dollars for the years ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 include $1.5 billion and $766.0 million related to Centex, respectively. (g) Backlog includes approximately 3,200 units and $822.6 million related to Centex at December 31, 2009. As indicated above, the Centex merger had a significant impact on the operating results for 2010 and 2009. Excluding the impact of the Centex merger, our revenues, unit settlements, and net new orders in both 2010 and 2009 would have experienced significant decreases from the respective prior year periods. Our reported home sale revenues, unit settlements, and net new orders for 2010 as reflected in the above tables represent decreases of 19%, 22%, and 28%, respectively, from the combined operating results of the two companies from 2009. However, these lower volumes were offset by lower land related charges, improved gross margins and operating leverage, and removal of the substantial majority of duplicative overhead costs from the combined companies. Excluding the impact of the goodwill impairments and insurance related losses recorded in 2010 and 2009, our Homebuilding loss before income taxes in 2010 was significantly improved from the losses reported by either company or the combined companies in the prior year periods. This illustrates the impact of the various actions we have taken to restructure our combined homebuilding operations into a more efficient organization as well as the more stable environment that we believe the homebuilding industry has entered. 24 Table of Contents Homebuilding Operations (continued) Home sale revenues for 2010, which include $1.9 billion related to Centex, were higher than 2009 by $550.5 million, or 14%. In 2009, home sale revenues, which included $1.1 billion related to Centex, were lower than those for 2008 by $2.2 billion, or 35%. The increase in home sale revenues in 2010 over 2009 was mainly attributable to increased unit settlements of 14% as average selling price remained stable from 2009 to 2010. The decrease in home sale revenues in 2009 from 2008 was attributable to a decrease in unit settlements of 29% combined with a decrease in the average selling price of 9%. The lower average selling price in 2010 and 2009 compared with 2008 resulted from a combination of pricing pressures due to challenging industry conditions and a shift in the product and geographic mix of homes closed during the periods, including an increased concentration in the first time buyer segment resulting from the Centex merger along with adjusting the product offering in certain communities to better align with current market conditions. Homebuilding gross profit margins from home sales in 2010 were 9.4%, compared with negative 10.5% in 2009 and negative 10.1% in 2008. The improvement in our gross margin is largely due to the significant decrease in land and community valuation adjustments to $169.7 million in 2010, compared with $751.2 million in 2009 and $1.2 billion in 2008. Gross profit margins were also adversely impacted in 2009 by the fair value adjustment related to homes under construction inventory acquired with the Centex merger. We recognized this fair value adjustment as an increase of $31.1 million to home cost of revenues as the related homes closed. Home sale gross profit margins, excluding land and community valuation adjustments, amortization of capitalized interest, and merger related costs, were 16.7% in 2010 compared to 12.3% in 2009 and 12.2% in 2008. The increase in gross margin reflects a combination of factors, including shifts in the product and geographic mix of homes closed during the year, better alignment of our product offering with current market conditions, and our various initiatives to reduce the construction cost of our homes. (See the Non GAAP Financial Measure section for reconciliation of home sale gross profit margins, excluding land and community valuation adjustments, amortization of capitalized interest, and merger related costs, to home sale gross profit margins). We continue to evaluate our existing land positions to ensure the most effective use of capital. Land sale revenues and their related gains or losses may vary significantly between periods, depending on the timing of land sales. Land sales had a negative margin contribution of $25.7 million for 2010 and negative margin contributions of $113.9 million and $262.2 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. These margin contributions in 2010, 2009, and 2008 included net realizable value adjustments totaling $39.1 million, $113.7 million, and $271.1 million, respectively, related to land held for sale. Selling, general, and administrative expenses, as a percentage of home sale revenues, were 19.4% in 2010 compared with 16.3% in 2009 and 13.0% in 2008. This increase was largely the result of $280.4 million in insurance related charges taken during 2010, substantially all of which related to general liability construction defect claims. Inclusive of this charge, insurance related expenses totaled $313.6 million, $34.9 million, and $103.5 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Excluding the charge recorded in 2010, insurance related expenses decreased in 2010 and 2009 from 2008 primarily as the result of lower revenues. We also experienced some adverse development in our projected general liability claims during 2008 that contributed to that years expense. Excluding such charges, our selling, general, and administrative expense both in dollars and as a percentage of home sale revenues decreased significantly from 2009. Homebuilding selling, general, and administrative expense also included severance costs of $22.3 million in 2010. During 2009, Homebuilding selling, general, and administrative expense included transaction and integration costs related to the Centex merger, including employee severance costs, totaling $65.0 million, as well as certain duplicative corporate and divisional overhead costs during the transition period following the merger. Employee severance costs recorded to Homebuilding selling, general, and administrative expense during 2008 totaled $28.1 million. Overall, we have achieved significant reductions in overhead costs since the Centex merger. However, our overhead leverage remains high relative to our sales volumes, so achieving a more efficient overhead structure remains an area of focus. In order to further reduce overhead cost and drive greater leverage, we reconfigured our organization during the fourth quarter of 2010, reducing the number of operating areas from six to four and consolidating certain divisions. Along with these changes in our field operations, we also further reduced corporate and support staffing across a number of functions to further consolidate and streamline our operating processes. We expect that these changes in our operating structure along with the completion of our integration activities related to the Centex merger will significantly reduce our selling, general, and administrative costs in 2011. Equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated entities was $2.8 million, $(49.7) million, and $(12.9) million for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. The primary cause for this change in results is the lower levels of impairments related to these entities in 2010 and 2008 compared with 2009. The majority of our unconsolidated entities represent land development joint ventures, so the timing of income and losses can vary significantly between periods depending on the timing of transactions and circumstances specific to each entity. 25 Table of Contents Homebuilding Operations (continued) Other income (expense), net includes the write off of deposits and pre acquisition costs resulting from decisions not to pursue certain land acquisitions which totaled $5.6 million, $54.3 million, and $33.3 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. These write offs vary in amount from year to year as we continue to evaluate potential land acquisitions for the most effective use of capital. Other income (expense), net also includes lease exit costs and asset impairments related to overhead reduction efforts totaling $28.4 million in 2010 and $13.3 million in 2008. In 2009, other income (expense) included certain integration costs, including lease exit costs, directly related to the Centex merger totaling $27.5 million. Other income (expense), net also includes goodwill impairment charges of $656.3 million, $563.0 million, and $5.0 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of these impairments. For 2010, net new orders increased 7% to 15,148 units compared with 14,185 units in 2009. The increase in net new order units was primarily attributable to the positive impact of the federal homebuyer tax credit in the first half of 2010 and incremental orders resulting from the Centex merger partially offset in the latter half of 2010 by a lower average sales pace per community. For 2009, net new order units decreased 7% to 14,185 units compared with 15,306 units in 2008. Excluding Centex, net new order units decreased moderately during 2010 and significantly during 2009 due to the uncertainty in the overall U.S. housing industry. Most markets continue to have significant resale and new home inventory on the market, and this, combined with low consumer confidence, difficulties experienced by customers in selling their existing homes, the high rate of foreclosures, and the tighter mortgage financing market, has resulted in reduced net new orders. Cancellation rates were 19% in 2010, 23% in 2009, and 33% in 2008 as the cancellation rate for 2010 reverted back to our more typical historical range compared with the heightened cancellation rates experienced during 2006 through 2008. The dollar value of net new orders increased $190.8 million in 2010 compared to 2009 and decreased $393.0 million in 2009 compared to 2008. At December 31, 2010, we had 786 active selling communities, a decrease of 11% from December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009, we had 882 active selling communities, an increase of 54% from December 31, 2008. Centex contributed 435 active communities at December 31, 2009. Ending backlog, which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed, was 3,964 units at December 31, 2010 with a dollar value of $1.1 billion compared with ending backlog of 5,931 units at December 31, 2009 with a dollar value of $1.6 billion. We had 6,284 and 6,653 homes in production at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, excluding 1,452 and 1,657 model homes, respectively. Included in our total homes in production were 3,494 and 2,793 homes that were unsold to customers at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, of which 1,856 and 1,309 homes, respectively, were completed. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, our Homebuilding operations controlled 147,194 and 154,694 lots, respectively. Of these controlled lots, 131,964 and 138,273 lots were owned and 10,082 and 14,208 lots were under option agreements approved for purchase at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In addition, there were 5,148 and 2,213 lots under option agreements pending approval at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. While we are purchasing select land positions where it makes strategic and economic sense to do so, the reduction in lots resulting from unit settlements, land disposition activity, and withdrawals from land option contracts exceeded the number of lots added by new transactions during the year ended December 31, 2010. The total purchase price related to land under option for use by our Homebuilding operations at future dates approximated $709.5 million at December 31, 2010. These land option agreements, which may be cancelled at our discretion, and may extend over several years, are secured by deposits and pre acquisition costs totaling $95.1 million, of which only $3.1 million is refundable. This balance excludes contingent payment obligations which may or may not become actual obligations to us. Non GAAP Financial Measures This report contains information about our home sale gross profit margins, excluding land and community valuation adjustments, amortization of capitalized interest, and merger related costs, which is considered a non GAAP financial measure under the SECs rules and should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, home sale gross margin (which we define as home sale revenues less home cost of revenues) as a measure of our operating performance. Management and our local divisions use this measure in evaluating the operating performance of each 26 Table of Contents Non GAAP Financial Measures (continued) community and in making strategic decisions regarding sales pricing, construction and development pace, product mix, and other daily operating decisions. We believe it is a relevant and useful measure to investors for evaluating our performance through gross profit generated on homes delivered during a given period and for comparing our operating performance to other companies in the homebuilding industry. Although other companies in the homebuilding industry report similar information, the methods used may differ. We urge investors to understand the methods used by other companies in the homebuilding industry to calculate gross margins and any adjustments thereto before comparing our measures to that of such other companies. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of this non GAAP financial measure to home sale gross margin, a GAAP financial measure, which management believes to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to this non GAAP financial measure ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Home sale revenues $ 4,419,812 $ 3,869,297 $ 5,980,289 Home cost of revenues (4,006,385 ) (4,274,474 ) (6,585,177 ) Home sale gross margin 413,427 (405,177 ) (604,888 ) Add: Land and community valuation adjustments (a) 141,592 683,014 1,122,094 Capitalized interest amortization (a) 180,918 165,355 210,709 Merger related costs (b) 4,133 31,147 Home sale gross profit margins, excluding land and community valuation adjustments, amortization of capitalized interest, and merger related costs $ 740,070 $ 474,339 $ 727,915 Home sale gross margin as a percentage of home sales revenues 9.4 % 10.5 % 10.1 % Home sale gross profit margins, excluding land and community valuation adjustments, amortization of capitalized interest, and merger related costs as a as a percentage of home sales revenues 16.7 % 12.3 % 12.2 % (a) Write offs of capitalized interest related to land and community valuation adjustments are reflected in capitalized interest amortization. (b) Home sale gross margin was adversely impacted by the amortization of a fair value adjustment to homes under construction inventory acquired with the Centex merger. This fair value adjustment is being amortized as an increase to home cost of revenues over the related home closings. Homebuilding Segment Operations Homebuilding, our core business, is engaged in the acquisition and development of land primarily for residential purposes within the continental United States and the construction of housing on such land targeted for first time, first and second move up, and active adult home buyers. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we realigned the organizational structure for certain of our Areas. Accordingly, the operating data by segment have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. We conduct our operations in 67 markets, located throughout 29 states and the District of Columbia, and have presented our reportable Homebuilding segments as follows: East: Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia Gulf Coast: Florida, Texas Central: Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, Ohio West: California, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, Washington 27 Table of Contents Homebuilding Segment Operations (continued) We also have one reportable segment for our financial services operations which consists principally of mortgage banking and title operations conducted through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries. Our Financial Services segment operates generally in the same markets as our Homebuilding segments.

East: For 2010, East home sale revenues increased 25% compared with 2009 due to a 28% increase in unit settlements offset slightly by a 2% decrease in average selling price. Excluding Centex, home sale revenues and settlements decreased slightly while average selling price increased slightly compared with 2009. The income before income taxes was primarily attributable to higher revenues, increased gross margins (both including and excluding land related charges), and improved overhead leverage compared with 2009, and a decrease in land related charges to $18.4 million in 2010, compared with land related charges of $224.9 million and impairments related to unconsolidated joint ventures totaling $31.1 million in 2009. Net new orders increased 9% compared with 2009. Excluding Centex, net new orders decreased moderately compared with 2009. The cancellation rate decreased to 16% in 2010 compared with 19% in 2009. East home sale revenues in 2009 decreased 33% compared with 2008 due to a 25% decrease in unit settlements combined with a 10% decrease in the average selling price, including significant home sale revenue reductions in our Northeast, Georgia, and Charlotte markets. Excluding Centex, home sale revenues and settlements decreased significantly compared with 2008 while average selling price was flat. The increased loss before income taxes was primarily attributable to the reduction in revenues combined with higher land related charges. East recorded land related charges of $224.9 million and impairments totaling $31.1 million related to unconsolidated joint ventures during 2009, compared with land related charges of $220.6 million in 2008. Gross margins, excluding land related charges, decreased slightly during 2009. Net new orders for 2009 increased 3% compared with 2008 primarily due to the merger with Centex. The cancellation rate for 2009 was 19% compared with 29% in 2008. Gulf Coast: For 2010, Gulf Coast home sale revenues increased 28% compared with 2009 due to a 26% increase in unit settlements combined with a 1% increase in the average selling price, though our North Florida market experienced a significant decrease in revenues. Excluding Centex, home sale revenues and settlements decreased slightly and average selling price increased slightly compared with 2009. The significant decrease in loss before income taxes in 2010 was attributable to higher revenues and lower land related charges, which totaled $63.6 million and $261.3 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Gross margins including and excluding land related charges increased moderately compared with 2009. Net new orders increased by 24% compared with 2009 primarily due to the Centex merger. Excluding Centex, net new orders for 2010 decreased moderately from 2009. The cancellation rate in 2010 was 23% compared with 25% in 2009. For 2009, Gulf Coast home sale revenues decreased 23% compared with 2008 due to a 15% decrease in unit settlements combined with a 9% decrease in the average selling price, including a significant decrease in home sale revenues in our North and Central Florida markets. Excluding Centex, home sale revenues and settlements decreased significantly compared with 2008 and average selling price decreased slightly. The Gulf Coast area experienced an increased loss before income taxes in 2009 compared with 2008 due to decreased home sale revenues and higher land related charges, which totaled $261.3 million and $247.7 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Excluding land related charges, gross margins increased moderately compared with 2008. Net new orders increased by 5% compared with 2008, primarily due to the Centex merger. The cancellation rate in 2009 was 25% compared with 33% in 2008. 29 Table of Contents Homebuilding Segment Operations (continued) Central: For 2010, Central home sale revenues decreased less than 1% compared with 2009 due to a 6% decrease in unit settlements offset by a 6% increase in the average selling price. Excluding Centex, home sale revenues and settlements decreased moderately while average selling price increased moderately compared with 2009. Our Arizona market continued to experience significant declines in volumes due to the challenging market conditions in the Phoenix area. Central experienced a decreased loss before income taxes in 2010 compared with 2009 due to significantly higher gross margins (including and excluding land related charges) and improved overhead leverage during 2010. In 2010, Central recorded land related charges totaling $40.8 million, compared to land related charges of $174.8 million and impairments of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures of $19.3 million in 2009. Net new orders decreased by 8% compared with 2009 primarily due to decreased demand in Arizona. Excluding Centex, net new orders for 2010 decreased significantly compared to 2009. The cancellation rate in 2010 was 14% compared with 23% in 2009. Our Central segment faced difficult local economic conditions in the majority of its markets during 2009. Central home sale revenues decreased 46% compared with 2008 due to a 41% decrease in unit settlements combined with a 10% decrease in average selling price, including a significant decrease in the Illinois markets home sale revenues. Excluding Centex, home sale revenues settlements decreased significantly compared with 2008 and average selling price decreased slightly. For 2009 and 2008, Central operating results were negatively impacted by land related charges of $174.8 million and $493.9 million, respectively. During 2009 the Central market also incurred charges of $19.3 million related to investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. Excluding land related charges, gross margins decreased slightly compared with 2008. Net new orders in 2009 decreased 24% compared with 2008. For 2009, cancellation rates were 23% compared with 32% for 2008. West: For 2010, West home sale revenues decreased 1% compared with 2009 due to a less than 1% decrease in both unit settlements and average selling price, though our Las Vegas and Bay Area markets experienced significant declines in volumes. Excluding Centex, home sale revenues and settlements decreased moderately while average sales price increased less than 1% compared with 2009. The decreased loss before income taxes in 2010 compared with 2009 is attributable to significantly higher gross margins (both including and excluding land related charges), and lower land related charges of $63.5 million in 2010 compared with $190.0 million in 2009. The loss before taxes in 2010 and 2009 also included impairment charges of $1.9 million and $1.2 million, respectively, related to unconsolidated joint ventures. Net new orders decreased by 4% in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to declines in Las Vegas and Bay Area. Cancellation rates were 23% in 2010 compared with 25% in 2009. West home sale revenues decreased 35% in 2009 compared with 2008 due primarily to a 32% decrease in unit settlements and a 5% decrease in average selling price as the majority of our West markets experienced lower home sale revenues. Excluding Centex, home sale revenues and settlements decreased significantly and average selling price decreased moderately compared with 2008. During 2009, the reduction in revenues was partially offset by higher gross margins in several of our markets, which also included $190.0 million in land related charges and a $1.2 million valuation adjustment related to unconsolidated joint ventures. The decreased loss before income taxes in 2009 was primarily due to significantly lower land related charges and lower impairments in unconsolidated joint ventures, which totaled $464.2 million and $15.4 million, respectively, in 2008. Excluding land related charges, we experienced increased gross margins in each of our West markets, with the exception of the Bay Area. Net new orders decreased by 11% in 2009 compared with 2008. Cancellation rates were 25% in 2009 compared with 41% in 2008. 30 Table of Contents Financial Services Operations We conduct our Financial Services operations, which include mortgage and title operations, through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries. We originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various credit arrangements, and then sell such mortgage loans monthly to outside investors. Also, we sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts. The following table presents selected financial information for our Financial Services operations ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Mortgage operations revenues $ 94,587 $ 92,933 $ 135,409 Title services revenues 27,076 24,867 15,607 Total Financial Services revenues 121,663 117,800 151,016 Expenses (116,122 ) (172,854 ) (123,082 ) Equity income 68 16 111 Income (loss) before income taxes $ 5,609 $ (55,038 ) $ 28,045 Total originations: Loans 10,770 10,737 15,227 Principal $ 2,273,000 $ 2,276,000 $ 3,404,000 Operating as a captive business model primarily targeted to supporting our Homebuilding operations, the operating results of our Financial Services operations are directly linked to Homebuilding. Since 2007, the mortgage industry experienced a significant shift away from subprime, Alt A, and high loan to value loans brought about by investors reluctance to purchase these loans due to their perceived risk. This, among other things, has resulted in an overall tightening of lending standards and a shift toward agency production and fixed rate loans versus adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs). Our Homebuilding customers continue to account for substantially all loan production, representing 98% of loan originations for 2010, 98% for 2009, and 99% for 2008. Total Financial Services revenues during 2010 increased 3% compared with 2009 primarily as a result of increased home settlement volumes in 2010 compared to 2009. Financial Services revenues for 2009 decreased 22% compared with 2008 primarily as a result of lower loan origination volume due to lower home settlements within our Homebuilding operations. Interest income, which is included in mortgage operations revenues, was moderately lower in 2010 than in 2009 due to the combination of lower interest rates and selling loans faster in 2010; and significantly lower in 2009 than in 2008, due to the decrease in loan origination volume. Revenues from our title operations increased 9% in 2010 compared with 2009 due to increased home settlement volume, and increased 59% in 2009 compared with 2008 due to the Centex merger. Agency production for funded origination principal was 99%, 99%, and 98% in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Within the funded agency origination principal, FHA loans were approximately 38%, 40%, and 25% in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Our capture rate for 2010 was 78% compared with 85% for 2009 and 92% for 2008. Our capture rate represents loan originations from our Homebuilding operations as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our Homebuilding operations, excluding cash settlements. Our customers average FICO scores for 2010, 2009, and 2008 were 749, 743, and 739, respectively. At December 31, 2010, our loan application backlog was $558.8 million, compared with $877.9 million at December 31, 2009. Substantially all loan production in 2010, 2009, and 2008 consisted of fixed rate loans, the majority of which are prime, conforming loans. We define prime loans as full documentation first mortgages with FICO scores of 621 or higher, Alt A loans as non full documentation first mortgages with FICO scores of 621 or higher, and sub prime loans as first mortgages with FICO scores of 620 or lower. The shift toward agency fixed rate loans from ARMs and interest only mortgages, a component of ARMs, has contributed to profitability as fixed rate loans generally result in higher profitability due to higher servicing values, less competition, and structured guidelines that allow for expense efficiencies when processing the loan. Income before income taxes increased significantly in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to lower expenses related to loan repurchase liabilities combined with improved operating efficiencies. Income before income taxes decreased significantly in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to increased loan loss reserves, decreased loan 31 Table of Contents Financial Services Operations (continued) origination volumes, and lower values of servicing rights. The 2009 loss before income taxes also includes certain integration costs directly related to the Centex merger totaling $8.4 million, which consist primarily of severance benefits and lease exit and related asset impairment costs. Financial Services also incurred goodwill impairment charges of $0.7 million in 2008 but none in either 2009 or 2010. Since we sell the majority of our loans monthly and retain only limited risk related to the loans we originate, our overall loan losses have historically not been significant. In 2010 and 2009, however, we experienced higher than historical losses on our loans held for investment, repurchased or re insured loans, and foreclosed properties. The largest source of these losses has been a significant increase in anticipated losses for loans previously originated and sold to investors. Such losses may result from certain representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, including representations as to underwriting standards, the type of collateral, the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan. If determined to be at fault, we either repurchase the loans from the investors or reimburse the investors losses. We establish liabilities for such anticipated losses based upon, among other things, the level of current and estimated probable future repurchase demands made by investors, our ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchase demands, and the severity of loss upon repurchase. Beginning in 2009, we have experienced a significant increase in anticipated losses as a result of the high level of loan defaults and related losses in the mortgage industry and increasing aggressiveness by investors in presenting such claims to us. Additionally, Centexs mortgage operations were historically broader than those of Pulte Mortgage, so our exposure to losses related to loans previously originated increased significantly as a result of the Centex merger. While not increasing our exposure to Centexs contingent loan origination liabilities, we entered into an agreement in conjunction with the wind down of Centexs mortgage operations, which originated its last loan in December 2009, that provides a guaranty for one major investor in loans originated by Centexs mortgage operations. This guaranty provides that we will honor the potential repurchase obligations of Centexs mortgage operations related to breaches of representations and warranties in the origination of a certain pool of loans. Other than with respect to this pool of loans, our contractual repurchase obligations are limited to our non guarantor subsidiaries (see Note 17 for a discussion of non guarantor subsidiaries). The vast majority of losses related to our overall exposure for loans previously originated and sold to investors relate to loans originated in 2006 and 2007 when industry lending standards were less stringent and borrower fraud is believed to have peaked. Given the volatility in the mortgage industry and the uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims, it is reasonably possible that future losses may exceed our current estimates. Changes in these liabilities are as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Liabilities, beginning of period $ 105,914 $ 3,240 $ 2,107 Provision for losses 16,856 60,896 2,370 Settlements (29,713 ) (14,515 ) (1,237 ) Liabilities assumed with Centex merger 56,293 Liabilities, end of period $ 93,057 $ 105,914 $ 3,240 In addition to the above, loan loss provisions related to our portfolio loans, real estate owned, and mortgage reinsurance reserves totaled $1.2 million, $9.8 million, and $17.0 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. We are exposed to market risks from commitments to lend, movements in interest rates, and cancelled or modified commitments to lend. A commitment to lend at a specific interest rate (an interest rate lock commitment) is a derivative financial instrument (interest rate is locked to the borrower). In order to reduce these risks, we use other derivative financial instruments to economically hedge the interest rate lock commitment. These financial instruments can include cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury futures contracts, and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities. We enter into one of the aforementioned derivative financial instruments upon accepting interest rate lock commitments. The changes in the fair value of the interest rate lock commitment and the other derivative financial instruments are included in Financial Services revenues. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 32 Table of Contents Other Non Operating Other non operating expenses consist of income and expenses related to corporate services provided to our subsidiaries. These expenses are incurred for financing, developing, and implementing strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies, and providing the necessary administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Accordingly, these results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve. The following table presents a summary of other non operating expenses ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Net interest income $ 6,802 $ 6,905 $ 23,496 Selling, general and administrative expenses (39,403 ) (42,095 ) (37,835 ) Other income (expenses), net (38,920 ) (31,594 ) (1,594 ) Income (loss) before income taxes $ (71,521 ) $ (66,784 ) $ (15,933 ) The slight decrease in net interest income in 2010 compared with 2009 resulted from higher invested cash balances and a corporate note receivable offset by lower interest rates. The decrease in net interest income in 2009 compared with 2008 resulted from significantly lower interest rates on our invested cash balances. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses for 2010 compared with 2009 is due primarily to the prior year period containing certain integration costs directly related to the Centex merger totaling $5.4 million. Other income (expense), net consists of gains (losses) on debt retirements (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). We capitalize interest cost into inventory during the active development and construction of our communities. Each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development. Interest expense is allocated over the period based on the cyclical timing of unit settlements. Interest expensed to Homebuilding cost of revenues for 2010, 2009, and 2008 includes $27.6 million, $68.2 million, and $84.8 million, respectively, of capitalized interest related to inventory impairments. During the second and third quarters of 2010, the level of our active inventory was lower than our debt level. Accordingly, $1.5 million of Homebuilding interest costs were expensed directly to interest expense in 2010. During 2009 and 2008, we capitalized all of our Homebuilding interest costs into inventory because the level of our active inventory exceeded our debt levels. Given the substantial reduction in debt that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2010, our active inventory exceeded our debt levels at December 31, 2010. While the amount of interest incurred and capitalized into homebuilding inventory will decline as the result of these debt retirements, the amount of interest expensed will actually increase in the near term due to the amortization of previously capitalized amounts. Information related to interest capitalized into inventory is as follows ($000s omitted): Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Interest in inventory, beginning of period $ 239,365 $ 170,020 $ 160,598 Interest capitalized 264,932 234,700 220,131 Interest expensed (180,918 ) (165,355 ) (210,709 ) Interest in inventory, end of period $ 323,379 $ 239,365 $ 170,020 Interest incurred* $ 266,474 $ 234,700 $ 220,131 * Homebuilding interest incurred includes interest on our senior debt, short term borrowings, and other financing arrangements and excludes interest incurred by our Financial Services segment and certain other interest costs. Income Taxes Our income tax assets and liabilities and related effective tax rate are affected by a number of factors, the most significant of which is the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets and changes in our unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the effect of our valuation allowance and changes in our unrecognized tax benefits, our effective tax rates for 2008 through 2010 are not meaningful as our income tax benefit is not correlated to the amount of our pretax loss. Our effective tax rates were a benefit of 11.2% for 2010 compared with a benefit of 40.1% and 12.4% for 2009 and 2008, respectively. 33 Table of Contents Income Taxes (continued) The income tax benefit for 2010 was primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain federal and state income tax matters. Our 2009 income tax benefit of $792.6 million was primarily due to the impact of the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009 (the Act), which was enacted into law on November 6, 2009. The Act amended Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code to allow net operating losses realized in either tax year 2008 or 2009 to be carried back up to five years (previously limited to two years). The Act allowed us to carry back 2009 taxable losses to prior years and receive refunds of previously paid federal income taxes. We recorded income taxes receivable of $867.3 million at December 31, 2009, related to the carryback of net operating losses pursuant to the Act. Liquidity and Capital Resources We finance our land acquisitions, development, and construction activities by using internally generated funds and existing credit arrangements. We routinely monitor current and expected operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate the use of available financing sources, including securities offerings. Based on our current financial condition and credit relationships, we believe that our operations and borrowing resources are sufficient to provide for our current and foreseeable capital requirements. However, we continue to evaluate the impact of market conditions on our liquidity and may determine that modifications are appropriate if the current difficult market conditions extend beyond our expectations or if we incur additional land related charges. At December 31, 2010, we had cash and equivalents of $1.5 billion and no borrowings outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility). We also had $3.4 billion of senior notes outstanding. Other financing included limited recourse land collateralized financing totaling $0.6 million. Sources of our working capital include our cash and equivalents, our Credit Facility, and our unsecured letter of credit facility (the LOC Agreement). An additional source of liquidity during 2010 was the receipt of federal tax refunds aggregating $934.7 million. Such refunds resulted primarily from the carryback of taxable losses provided by the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009. We follow a diversified investment approach for our cash and equivalents by maintaining such funds with a diversified portfolio of banks within our group of relationship banks in high quality, highly liquid, short term investments, generally money market funds and federal government or agency securities. We monitor our investments with each bank on a daily basis and do not believe our cash and equivalents are exposed to any material risk of loss. However, given the volatility in the global financial markets, there can be no assurances that losses of principal balance on our cash and equivalents will not occur. Our ratio of debt to total capitalization, excluding our land collateralized debt, was 61.4% at December 31, 2010, and 47.4% net of cash and equivalents. In June 2009, we entered into the LOC Agreement, a five year, unsecured letter of credit facility that permits the issuance of up to $200.0 million of letters of credit. The LOC Agreement supplements our existing letter of credit capacity included in our Credit Facility (described below). At December 31, 2010, $167.2 million of letters of credit were outstanding under the LOC Agreement. Given the difficult conditions in the homebuilding industry in recent years, we have reduced the borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility as the result of a combination of reduced working capital needs and challenges in meeting the Credit Facilitys financial covenants. On December 23, 2010, we entered into the Fifth Amendment to Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Fifth Amendment), which decreased the borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility from $750.0 million to $250.0 million and also reduced the required level of cash and equivalents to be maintained in certain liquidity reserve accounts. Previously, on December 11, 2009, we entered into the Fourth Amendment and Waiver to Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which reduced the borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility from $1.2 billion to $750.0 million, replaced the maximum debt to capitalization ratio with a maximum debt to tangible capital limit, reduced the tangible net worth minimum, and waived any default under the previous Credit Facility resulting from failure to comply with the tangible net worth financial covenant. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, we have the capacity to issue letters of credit totaling up to $250.0 million. Borrowing availability is reduced by the amount of letters of credit outstanding. The Credit Facility includes a borrowing base limitation when we do not have an investment grade senior unsecured debt rating from at least two of 34 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Fitch Ratings, Moodys Investor Service, and Standard and Poors Corporation (the Rating Agencies). We currently do not have investment grade ratings from any of the Rating Agencies and are therefore subject to the borrowing base limitation. Given the uncertainty of current market conditions, we anticipate operating under the borrowing base limitation for the remainder of the Credit Facilitys term. Under the borrowing base limitation, the sum of our senior debt and the amount drawn on the Credit Facility may not exceed an amount based on certain percentages of various categories of our unencumbered inventory and other assets. At December 31, 2010, we had no borrowings outstanding and full availability of the remaining $28.4 million under the Credit Facility after consideration of $221.6 million of outstanding letters of credit. As a result, the borrowing base limitation did not restrict our borrowing availability at December 31, 2010. We are also required to maintain certain liquidity reserve accounts in the event we fail to satisfy an interest coverage test. Specifically, if the interest coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) is less than 2.0 to 1.0, we are required to maintain cash and equivalents in designated accounts with certain banks. While our access to and utilization of cash and equivalents maintained in liquidity reserve accounts is not restricted, failure to maintain sufficient balances within the liquidity reserve accounts restricts our ability to utilize the Credit Facility. We maintained the required cash and equivalents of $250.0 million within the liquidity reserve accounts at December 31, 2010, calculated under the Credit Facility as two times the amount by which the interest incurred over the last four quarters exceeds interest income over the last four quarters, excluding Financial Services, with a maximum amount of $250.0 million to be maintained in the liquidity reserve accounts effective with the Fifth Amendment. Additionally, failure to satisfy the interest coverage test can also result in an increase to LIBOR margin and letter of credit pricing. Our interest coverage ratio for the quarter ended December 31, 2010 was negative 0.66. For the period ending March 31, 2011, we will be required to maintain cash and equivalents of $250.0 million within the liquidity reserve accounts. The Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants. We are required to not exceed a debt to tangible capital ratio as well as to meet a tangible net worth covenant each quarter. At December 31, 2010, our debt to tangible capital ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) was 57.5% (compared with the requirement not to exceed 60.0%) while our tangible net worth (as defined in the Credit Facility) cushion was $436.2 million. Accordingly, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2010. However, the required debt to tangible capital ratio adjusts to 57.5% as of both March 31 and June 30, 2011 and 55.0% as of the end of each quarter thereafter. In the event we are not able to reduce our debt to tangible capital ratio below our current level, our compliance with the required covenant levels may be adversely impacted. Violations of the financial covenants in the Credit Facility, if not waived by the lenders or cured, could result in an optional maturity date acceleration by the lenders, which might require repayment of any borrowings and replacement or cash collateralization of any letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility. In the event these violations were not waived by the lenders or cured, the violations could also result in a default under our $3.4 billion of senior notes. Based on current market conditions, we believe that we may need to take action in order to avoid violating the debt to tangible capital ratio, potentially as early as March 31, 2011. Possible actions could include: negotiating changes to the Credit Facilitys financial covenants with our group of lenders or arranging a new credit facility; terminating the Credit Facility, which would release the funds currently maintained in the liquidity reserve accounts ($250.0 million) and using our available cash to collateralize required letters of credit ($221.6 million at December 31, 2010); or replacing the Credit Facility with a separate letter of credit facility, similar to our existing LOC Agreement. While there can be no assurances that we could complete any of these actions given the uncertainties in the homebuilding industry and the financial markets, we believe that the combination of these potential actions will allow us to avoid any violations of covenants under either the Credit Facility or senior notes for the near term. Pulte Mortgage provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available pursuant to certain third party and intercompany borrowings. Pulte Mortgage uses these resources to finance its lending activities until the mortgage loans are sold to third party investors, generally within 30 days. At December 31, 2009, Pulte Mortgage had a combination of repurchase lending agreements in place with various banks that provided borrowing capacity totaling $175.0 million. Given our strong liquidity and the cost of third party financing relative to existing mortgage rates, Pulte Mortgage allowed each of its third party borrowing arrangements to expire during 2010 and began funding its operations using internal Company resources. At December 31, 2010, we elected to fund $74.5 million of Pulte Mortgages financing needs via a repurchase agreement with the Company. In order to satisfy regulatory requirements in certain states, Pulte Mortgage also maintains a $2.5 million repurchase lending agreement with a bank that expires in October 2011. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2010. 35 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Pursuant to the two $100 million stock repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors in October 2002 and 2005, and the $200 million stock repurchase authorization in February 2006 (for a total stock repurchase authorization of $400 million), we have repurchased a total of 9,688,900 shares for a total of $297.7 million. There have been no repurchases under these programs since 2006. We had remaining authorization to purchase common stock aggregating $102.3 million at December 31, 2010. For the last three years, we have generated significant positive cash flow primarily through the liquidation of land inventory without a corresponding level of reinvestment combined with refunds of income taxes paid in prior years. We have used this positive cash flow to, among other things, increase our cash reserves as well as retire outstanding debt. Over the last three years, we have retired $3.1 billion of debt, including debt assumed with the Centex merger (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding these retirements). The majority of this debt was retired prior to its stated maturity. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we retired $898.5 million of senior notes. Additionally, we voluntarily used $111.2 million to repurchase at a discount prior to their maturity certain community development district obligations with an aggregate principal balance of $124.1 million in order to improve the future financial performance of the related communities (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and also voluntarily used $74.5 million of Company funds to finance Pulte Mortgages lending operations rather than continue to use third party financing arrangements. However, we do not anticipate that we will be able to continue to generate positive cash flow at these same levels in the near future. Additionally, should growth conditions return to the homebuilding industry, we will need to invest significant capital into our operations to support such growth. Our net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $580.3 million in 2010, $738.9 million in 2009 and $1.2 billion in 2008. During 2010, we received federal income tax refunds of $934.7 million compared with $362.0 million and $212.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. After adjusting for these tax refunds, operating cash flow was negative for 2010. Generally, the primary drivers of cash flow from operations are inventory levels and profitability. For the years ended 2008 through 2010, our net losses were largely attributable to non cash asset impairments, including land related charges and goodwill impairments. Cash flows from operations in 2010 were negatively impacted by the voluntary repurchase of certain community development district obligations for $111.2 million (see above) and using $74.5 million to internally finance Pulte Mortgages lending operations. During 2010, inventory levels and residential mortgage loans available for sale decreased slightly while operating cash flows in 2009 and 2008 benefited from a significant net decrease in inventory and residential mortgage loans available for sale. Net cash used by investing activities was $19.5 million at December 31, 2010, compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $1.7 billion in 2009 and net cash used in investing activities of $55.9 million in 2008. The net cash used in 2010 was primarily the result of investments in unconsolidated entities and capital expenditures, partially offset by distributions from unconsolidated entities and a reduction in residential mortgage loans held for investment. Our contributions to unconsolidated entities and investments in capital expenditures have declined in recent years as the result of the reduction in our overall land investments. Substantially all of the cash provided by investing activities in 2009 was the result of cash acquired through the Centex merger. For 2008, the majority of the cash used by investing activities related to contributions to our unconsolidated entities. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $948.4 million, $2.2 billion, and $567.7 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Net cash used in 2010 was primarily the result of the repurchase of senior notes as mentioned above as well as repayments made under Financial Services credit arrangements. The large increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2009 was largely attributable to $2.0 billion used to retire outstanding debt combined with reductions in amounts outstanding under our Financial Services credit arrangements. Net cash used in 2008 was largely attributable to the repurchase of outstanding senior notes combined with reductions in amounts outstanding under our Financial Services credit arrangements. On November 24, 2008, our Board of Directors discontinued the regular quarterly dividend on our common stock effective in the first quarter of 2009. Inflation We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation may also increase our financing, labor, and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective 36 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Inflation (continued) homebuyers. While we attempt to pass to our customers increases in our costs through increased sales prices, the current industry conditions have resulted in lower sales prices in substantially all of our markets. If we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs, or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly, affecting our prospective homebuyers willingness or ability to adequately finance home purchases, our revenues, gross margins, and net income would be adversely affected. Seasonality We experience variability in our quarterly results from operations due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry. Historically, we have experienced significant increases in revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home settlements. However, the challenging market conditions experienced since early 2006 have lessened the seasonal variations of our results. Given the current significant uncertainty in the homebuilding industry, we can make no assurances as to when and whether our historical seasonality will recur. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010: Payments Due by Period($000s omitted) Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 After 2015 Contractual obligations: Long term debt (a) $ 5,946,671 $ 224,157 $ 743,379 $ 1,636,174 $ 3,342,961 Operating lease obligations 180,258 40,028 59,368 43,352 37,510 Other long term liabilities (b) 596 596 Total contractual obligations (c) $ 6,127,525 $ 264,781 $ 802,747 $ 1,679,526 $ 3,380,471 (a) Represents our senior notes and related interest payments. (b) Represents our limited recourse collateralized financing arrangements and related interest payments. (c) We do not have any payments due in connection with capital lease or long term purchase obligations. We are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts (including land option contracts) for the purchase, development, and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business. Option contracts for the purchase of land enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we are ready to build homes on them. This reduces our financial risks associated with long term land holdings. At December 31, 2010, we had agreements to acquire 15,230 homesites through option contracts. At December 31, 2010, we had $92.0 million of non refundable option deposits and pre acquisition costs related to these agreements. At December 31, 2010, we had $258.0 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits and $48.4 million of related accrued interest and penalties. We are currently under examination by various taxing jurisdictions and anticipate finalizing the examinations with certain jurisdictions within the next twelve months. However, the final outcome of these examinations is not yet determinable. The statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for tax years 1998 2010. The following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2010: Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period($000s omitted) Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 After 2015 Other commercial commitments: Guarantor credit facilities (a) $ 450,000 $ $ 250,000 $ 200,000 $ (a) Includes capacity to issue up to $450.0 million in letters of credit, of which $388.9 million were outstanding at December 31, 2010. Excludes performance and surety bonds of $1.7 billion, which typically do not have stated expiration dates. 37 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We use letters of credit and performance and surety bonds to guarantee our performance under various contracts, principally in connection with the development of our projects. The expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related homebuilding projects. If the obligations related to a project are ongoing, annual extensions of the letters of credit are typically granted on a year to year basis. At December 31, 2010, we had outstanding letters of credit of $388.9 million. Performance bonds and surety bonds generally do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These bonds, which approximated $1.3 billion at December 31, 2010, are typically outstanding over a period of approximately three to five years. We do not believe that there will be draws upon any such letters of credit or performance or surety bonds. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land option or option type agreements in order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future. At December 31, 2010, these agreements totaled approximately $709.5 million. Pursuant to these land option agreements, we provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future, usually at predetermined prices. In certain instances, we are required to record the land under option as if we own it. At December 31, 2010, we consolidated certain land option agreements and recorded assets of $50.8 million as land, not owned, under option agreements. At December 31, 2010, aggregate outstanding debt of unconsolidated joint ventures was $15.5 million, of which our proportionate share of such joint venture debt was $5.1 million. Of our proportionate share of joint venture debt, we provided limited recourse guaranties for $1.4 million of such joint venture debt at December 31, 2010. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. For 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recognized equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated entities of $2.9 million, $(49.7) million, and $(12.8), respectively. The earnings (losses) in 2010, 2009, and 2008 included impairments related to investments in unconsolidated joint ventures totaling $1.9 million, $54.1 million, and $18.5 million, respectively. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these consolidated financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements, giving due regard to materiality. Revenue recognition Homebuilding Homebuilding revenue and related profit are generally recognized at the time of the closing of the sale, when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. In situations where the buyers financing is originated by Pulte Mortgage, our wholly owned mortgage subsidiary, and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment as required by ASC 360 20, Property, Plant, and Equipment Real Estate Sales, the profit on such sales is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a third party investor has been completed unless there is a loss on the sale in which case the loss on such sale is recognized at the time of closing. Financial Services Mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors. Servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance, or a contracted set fee in the case of certain sub servicing arrangements, and are credited to income when related mortgage payments are received or the sub servicing fees are earned. Loan origination fees, commitment fees, and certain direct loan origination costs are recognized as incurred. Expected gains and losses from the sale of residential mortgage loans and their related servicing rights are included in the measurement of written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through Financial Services at the time of commitment. Subsequent changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in Financial Services revenues as they occur. Interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold. Loans are placed on non accrual status once they become greater than 90 days past due their contractual terms. Subsequent payments received are applied according to the contractual terms of the loan. Inventory valuation Inventory is stated at the lower of accumulated cost or fair value, as determined in accordance with ASC 360 10, Property, Plant, and Equipment Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (ASC 360 10). Accumulated cost 38 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Inventory valuation (continued) includes costs associated with land acquisition, land development, and home construction costs, including interest, real estate taxes, and certain direct and indirect overhead costs related to development and construction. For those communities for which construction and development activities have been idled, applicable interest and real estate taxes are expensed as incurred. Land acquisition and development costs are allocated to individual lots using an average lot cost determined based on the total expected land acquisition and development costs and the total expected home closings for the community. The specific identification method is used to accumulate home construction costs. We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories. Each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development. Interest expense is allocated over the period based on the cyclical timing of unit settlements. Cost of revenues includes the construction cost, average lot cost, estimated warranty costs, and commissions and closing costs applicable to the home. The construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home, plus an appropriate accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid, based on an analysis of budgeted construction cost. This accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared with the amount accrued, and adjustments are made if needed. Total community land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared with actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete. The development cycles for our communities range from under one year to in excess of ten years for certain master planned communities. Adjustments to estimated total land acquisition and development costs for the community affect the amounts costed for the communitys remaining lots. In accordance with ASC 360 10, we record valuation adjustments on land inventory when events and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired and when the cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. For communities that demonstrate indicators of impairment, we compare the expected undiscounted cash flows for these communities to their carrying value. For those communities whose carrying values exceed the expected undiscounted cash flows, we calculate the fair value of the community. Impairment charges are required to be recorded if the fair value of the communitys inventory is less than its carrying value. We generally determine the fair value of each communitys inventory using a combination of market comparable transactions, where available, and discounted cash flow models. These estimated cash flows are significantly impacted by estimates related to expected average selling prices and sale incentives, expected sales paces and cancellation rates, expected land development and construction timelines, and anticipated land development, construction, and overhead costs. Such estimates must be made for each individual community and may vary significantly between communities. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process, the significant volatility in demand for new housing, and the long life cycles of many communities, actual results could differ significantly from such estimates. Investments in unconsolidated entities We have investments in a number of unconsolidated entities, including joint ventures, with independent third parties. Many of these unconsolidated entities purchase, develop, and or sell land and homes in the United States and Puerto Rico. The equity method of accounting is used for unconsolidated entities over which we have significant influence; generally this represents partnership equity or common stock ownership interests of at least 20% and not more than 50%. Under the equity method of accounting, we recognize our proportionate share of the profits and losses of these entities. Certain of these entities sell land to us. In these situations, we defer the recognition of profits from such activities until the time the related homes are sold. The cost method of accounting is used for investments in which we have less than a 20% ownership interest and do not have the ability to exercise significant influence. We evaluate our investments in unconsolidated entities for recoverability in accordance with ASC 323, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures. If we determine that a loss in the value of the investment is other than temporary, we write down the investment to its estimated fair value. Any such losses are recorded to equity in (earnings) loss of unconsolidated entities in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Additionally, each unconsolidated entity evaluates its long lived assets, such as inventory, for recoverability in accordance with ASC 360 10. Our proportionate share of any such impairments under ASC 360 10 are also recorded to equity in (earnings) 39 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments in unconsolidated entities (continued) loss of unconsolidated entities in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Evaluations of recoverability under both ASC 323 and ASC 360 10 are primarily based on projected cash flows. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process and the significant volatility in demand for new housing, actual results could differ significantly from such estimates. Residential mortgage loans In accordance with ASC 825, Financial Instruments (ASC 825), we use the fair value option for our residential mortgage loans available for sale. ASC 825 permits entities to measure various financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on a contract by contract basis. Election of the fair value option for residential mortgage loans available for sale allows a better offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. Changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in revenues as they occur. Loans held for investment consist of a portfolio of loans that either have been repurchased from investors or were not saleable upon closing. These loans are carried at cost and reviewed for impairment when recoverability becomes doubtful. Mortgage loan allowances and loan origination liabilities Our mortgage operations have established liabilities for anticipated losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors that may result from certain representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, including representations as to underwriting standards, the type of collateral, the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan. We establish liabilities for such anticipated losses based upon, among other things, the level of current and estimated probable future repurchase demands made by investors, our ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchase demands, and the severity of loss upon repurchase. From time to time, our mortgage operations will be required to repurchase certain loans we originated and sold to third parties. If a repurchased loan is performing, it is classified as a residential mortgage loan available for sale and recorded at fair value. Such repurchased loans are typically re sold to third party investors. If a repurchased loan is nonperforming, the loan is classified as loans held for investment. We establish an allowance for such loans based on our historical loss experience and current loss trends. Although we consider our mortgage loan allowances and loan origination liabilities to be adequate, there can be no assurance that these allowances and liabilities will prove to be sufficient over time to cover ultimate losses in connection with our loan originations. These allowances and liabilities may prove to be inadequate due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, the mortgage market, or discrete events adversely affecting specific borrowers. Goodwill We recorded a significant amount of goodwill related to the Centex merger completed in 2009. Goodwill, which represents the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of the net assets at the acquisition date, is subject to annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we recorded a goodwill impairment of $563.0 million as part of our annual goodwill impairment test. In addition to the annual impairment test in 2010, we performed an event driven assessment as of September 30, 2010 in light of certain unfavorable indicators. We test goodwill at the reporting unit level, which represents an operating segment or one level below. Because goodwill is assigned at the reporting unit level after an acquisition and reflects the current overall operating structure of the business, it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition. We allocated goodwill resulting from the Centex merger to 24 reporting units, of which 23 reporting units related to our Homebuilding reporting segments and one reporting unit related to our Financial Services reporting segment. As a result of the impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2009 and impairment tests in 2010, we have recorded cumulative impairments of the goodwill acquired with the Centex merger totaling $1.2 billion. As a result, our remaining goodwill totals $240.5 million at December 31, 2010 allocated amongst 13 of our Homebuilding reporting units. Goodwill for the other 11 reporting units included in the original allocation of goodwill has been written off due to either impairment or disposal. 40 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Goodwill (continued) We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill by following a two step process. Step one of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the carrying value of each of our reporting units to their estimated fair value. We determine the fair value of each reporting unit using accepted valuation methods, including the use of discounted cash flows supplemented by market based assessments of fair value. The fair values are significantly impacted by estimates related to current market valuations, current and future economic conditions in each of our geographical markets, including the demand for new housing, and our strategic plans within each of our geographical markets. The discounted cash flow valuations involve the use of certain key assumptions, including projected revenue growth, profitability, and working capital levels as well as market based discount rates (a discount rate of 10.0% was used for all reporting units in the 2010 and 2009 goodwill impairment tests based on a market based weighted average cost of capital for the homebuilding industry). In performing these valuations, we rely on our internal forecasts trended toward long term averages that vary by reporting unit based on a combination of historical performance and our expectations for the future. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process and the significant volatility in demand for new housing, actual results could differ significantly from such estimates. As a result of step one of the September 2010 goodwill impairment test, we determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value for the majority of our reporting units with goodwill. We perform step two of the goodwill impairment test for any reporting unit whose carrying value exceeds its fair value. Step two involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its assets and liabilities, with the excess representing implied goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized if the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill. As a result of Step 2 at both September 30, 2010 and October 31, 2009, we determined that a significant portion of our goodwill balance was impaired. We also performed our annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill as of October 31, 2010, which determined that no additional impairments existed. The below table summarizes our 2010 goodwill impairment test results ($000s omitted): Number ofReportingUnits GoodwillImpairmentRecorded GoodwillRemaining atDecember 31,2010 (a) Goodwill impairment recorded 15 $ 654,923 $ 206,487 (b) Step two performed but goodwill not impaired 1 21,469 (c) Fair value exceeded carrying value by greater than 10% 2 12,585 18 $ 654,923 $ 240,541 As reflected in the above table, $228.0 million of the goodwill remaining at December 31, 2010 (the sum of lines (a) and (b)) relates to goodwill allocated to 11 reporting units that are at increased risk of future impairment. Our overall outlook and cash flow projections for each reporting unit involve the use of certain key assumptions, many of which are interdependent upon each other. A change in any one or combination of these assumptions could impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit. If our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly or other economic conditions deteriorate, goodwill may be further impaired. Also, while not directly triggering an impairment of goodwill, a significant decrease in our market capitalization in the future may indicate that the fair value of one or more of our reporting units has decreased. Should subsequent analysis confirm that a decrease has occurred for one or more reporting units, an impairment of goodwill may result. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the fair value of each reporting unit would have resulted in an additional impairment loss of approximately $159.9 million related to the 11 reporting units with goodwill balances remaining at December 31, 2010. 41 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Goodwill (continued) The below table summarizes the goodwill at increased risk of future impairment by reportable segment as of December 31, 2010 ($000s omitted): December 31, 2010 Goodwill at IncreasedRisk of FutureImpairment TotalGoodwill East $ 60,494 $ 60,494 Gulf Coast 92,095 92,095 Central 29,597 42,182 West 45,770 45,770 $ 227,956 $ 240,541 We will continue to monitor each of our reporting units and perform goodwill impairment testing when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. See Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of our goodwill impairment. Intangible assets We have recorded intangible assets related to tradenames acquired with the Centex merger completed in 2009 and the Del Webb merger completed in 2001, which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives. The carrying values and ultimate realization of these assets are dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use. If we determine that the carrying values of intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment, we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists. If the carrying values of the intangible assets exceed the expected undiscounted cash flows, then we measure impairment as the difference between the fair value of the asset and the recorded carrying value. If our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly or if our strategy related to the use of such intangible assets changes, the related intangible assets may be impaired. Allowance for warranties Home purchasers are provided with a limited warranty against certain building defects, including a one year comprehensive limited warranty and coverage for certain other aspects of the homes construction and operating systems for periods of up to ten years. We estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and the cost per claim. We periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability for each geographic market in which we operate and adjust the amounts as necessary. Actual warranty costs in the future could differ from our estimates. Self insured risks We maintain, and require the majority of our subcontractors to maintain, general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for certain construction defects. We also maintain property, errors and omissions, workers compensation, and other business insurance coverage. These insurance policies protect us against a portion of the risk of loss from claims. However, we retain a significant portion of the overall risk for such claims either through policies issued by our captive insurance subsidiaries or through our own self insured per occurrence and aggregate retentions, deductibles, and available policy limits. The availability of general liability insurance for the homebuilding industry and its subcontractors has become increasingly limited and more expensive in recent years. In certain instances, we may offer our subcontractors the opportunity to purchase insurance through one of our captive insurance subsidiaries or to participate in a project specific insurance program provided by us. Any policy issued by the captive insurance subsidiaries represents self insurance of these risks by us. While general liability coverage for the homebuilding industry is complex and our coverage varies significantly based on the policy year, in recent years we have generally been self insured for $5.0 million to $7.5 million on a per occurrence basis and up to $60.0 million on an annual aggregate basis, at which point our excess or reinsurance coverage begins. 42 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Self insured risks (continued) We generally reserve for costs associated with insurance claims and their related lawsuits (including expected legal fees) based on an actuarial analysis of our historical claims. The actuarial analysis includes an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. These estimates make up a significant portion of our estimates and are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors, including changes in claims reporting and resolution patterns, third party recoveries, insurance industry practices, the regulatory environment, and legal precedent. State regulations vary, but construction defect claims are reported and resolved over an extended period often exceeding ten years. As a result, actual costs could differ significantly from estimated costs. Adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs. Our recorded reserves for all insurance claims totaled $813.8 million and $566.7 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, substantially all of which relates to general liability insurance. The increase in the liability at December 31, 2010 was due to recording additional expense to insurance reserves during 2010 as a result of experiencing greater than anticipated frequency of newly reported claims and an increase in specific case reserves related to known claims for homes closed in prior periods. Substantially all of these increases related to general liability reserves. The recorded reserves included an actuarial assessment of incurred but not reported claims, which represented approximately 76% and 75% of the total general liability reserves at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Changes in the number and timing of reported claims and the estimates of specific claim values will significantly impact estimates of future reserves, which are reflected by the incurred but not reported reserve. In certain instances, we have the ability to recover a portion of its costs under various insurance policies or from our subcontractors or other third parties. Estimates of such amounts are recorded when recovery is considered probable. The actuarial analyses of the reserves also consider historical third party recovery rates. Our insurance policies are maintained with highly rated underwriters for whom we believe counterparty default risk is not significant. Stock based compensation We calculate the fair value of stock options using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions, which involve a number of variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, the expected dividend yield, and expected stock option exercise behavior. In addition, we also use judgment in estimating the number of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited. Income taxes We calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Our assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency, and magnitude of current and cumulative income and losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryback or carryforward periods, our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards being used before expiration, and tax planning alternatives. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. In determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns, judgment is required. Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. We follow the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740), which prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, and disclosure. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. Evaluations of our tax positions consider changes in facts or circumstances, changes in law, correspondence with taxing authorities, and settlements of audit issues.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our rate sensitive financing to the extent long term rates decline. The following tables set forth, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, our rate sensitive financing obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates, and estimated fair value ($000s omitted).

Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed upon terms (i.e., commit to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2010 and 2009, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float. We minimize interest rate risk by hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments. These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury future contracts, and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage backed securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in long term mortgage rates of plus 50, 100, and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results. At December 31, 2010, our aggregate net investment exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk includes our remaining non operating investments in Mexico, which approximated $0.2 million. 44 Table of Contents SPECIAL NOTES CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS As a cautionary note, except for the historical information contained herein, certain matters discussed in Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Item 7a, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
