The Company has approved separate plans to sell its Fluid Sciences business and Security and Detection business and has classified these businesses as discontinued operations. Discussions of Consolidated Results of Operations for the periods presented are on a continuing operations basis. Portfolio changes 2001 represented the fourth year in the Companys transformation into a global, high technology leader. During 2001, the Company continued its focus on shifting its portfolio of businesses to higher growth markets and applications. Significant changes to the Companys portfolio during the three years ended December 30, 2001 are highlighted below: 2001 Acquisition of Packard BioScience Company Approval of plan to dispose of Fluid Sciences business Agreement to dispose of Security and Detection business Disposal of Instruments for Research and Applied Science business Disposal of Voltarc Technologies business 2000 Acquisition of NEN Life Sciences, Inc. (NEN) Disposal of the Berthold business Disposal of micromachined sensors business 1999 Acquisition of the Analytical Instruments business from PE Corp. (AI) Disposal of the Technical Services business Other accomplishments Other significant accomplishments during 2001 included: Announced a record number of new product introductions Integration of NEN Life Sciences, acquired during 2000 Strengthening of Life Sciences business through further consolidation of Life Sciences European sales, marketing and administrative functions in Brussels, consolidation of certain North American production sites and establishment of production capabilities in lower cost sites in Asia Reorganization of Optoelectronics segment, including the elimination of several manufacturing sites through moves to lower cost manufacturing geographies in Canada and Asia 13 Table of Contents Consolidation within Analytical Instruments segment including starting the consolidation of European administrative functions to a central location in Monza, Italy, move to new world headquarters and manufacturing facility in Shelton, CT and moves of certain manufacturing functions from Europe to lower cost geographies within Asia As a result of the significant amount of changes, the results period over period are frequently not comparable. In order to improve the comparability of financial results, the Company has highlighted nonrecurring items in all periods and presented a discussion of the results excluding these items. Nonrecurring items represent income and expenses associated with an acquisition, restructuring, divestiture or other unusual event that are not expected to have an impact on ongoing operations. 2001 Acquisitions and Divestitures On November 13, 2001, the Company completed the acquisition of Packard BioScience Company (Packard) for consideration of approximately $762 million in the form of approximately 22 million common shares and the assumption of $118 million in debt. The acquisition extends the Companys capabilities in automated liquid handling and sample preparation and strengthens the Companys position as a global provider of comprehensive drug discovery solutions. Packard, a global developer, manufacturer and marketer of instruments, software and related consumables and services for use in drug discovery and other life sciences research, generated sales of approximately $165 million for its year ended December 31, 2000. Packards operations, assumed as of the date of acquisition, are reported within the results from operations of the Life Sciences segment. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase in accordance with the recently issued Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 141, Business Combinations, (SFAS No. 141), and the Company has accordingly allocated the purchase price of Packard based upon the fair values of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The allocation of the purchase price has not yet been finalized; however, the Company does not expect material changes. Portions of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed were valued by independent appraisers utilizing customary valuation procedures and techniques. These intangible assets included $69.0 million in acquired in process research and development for projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility as of the acquisition date and for which no future alternative use existed. These costs were expensed during the fourth quarter of 2001. Other acquired intangible assets valued at $237.3 million included the fair value of trade names, trademarks, patents and developed technology. Of this amount, $76.5 million has been ascribed to trade names and trademarks for which an indefinite life has been assigned. The Packard acquisition also resulted in goodwill of $438.6 million, which is not being amortized in accordance with SFAS No. 141, effective for all business combinations completed subsequent to July 1, 2001. During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company sold its Instruments for Research and Applied Science business (IRAS) and its Voltarc Technologies (Voltarc) business. These sales resulted in a gain of $32.3 million and a loss of $6.3 million, respectively. Additionally, the Company has deferred gains of approximately $3.0 million in connection with certain contingencies related to the IRAS sale. The combined net income of these businesses was $1.4 million in 2001 through date of disposal and $5.4 million in 2000. The Packard acquisition and 2001 dispositions are expected to result in a higher concentration of revenue in the Life Sciences segment in future periods. 14 Table of Contents Adjusted Income from Operations The following table presents Adjusted Net Income, which excludes goodwill and intangibles amortization and the impact of nonrecurring items: 12 Months Ended December 30, December 31, 2001 2000 (In thousands) Sales $ 1,330,054 $ 1,335,532 Cost of sales 706,322 753,332 Research and development costs 81,315 76,920 Selling, general and administrative expenses 350,676 340,004 Adjusted operating income from continuing operations 191,741 165,276 Other expense, net 34,069 34,593 Adjusted income from continuing operations before income taxes 157,672 130,683 Provision for income taxes 40,852 36,364 Adjusted income from continuing operations, net of income tax $ 116,820 $ 94,319 The following table reconciles Adjusted income from continuing operations to Net Income on a reported basis: 12 Months Ended December 30, December 31, 2001 2000 (In thousands) Adjusted income from continuing operation, before income taxes $ 157,672 $ 130,683 Continuing operations nonrecurring items: Acquisition related charges (70,540 ) (26,118 ) Gains on dispositions, net 26,630 35,089 Gains on sale of investments, net 4,274 900 Restructuring charges, net (9,500 ) (3,900 ) Reorganization related charges (14,298 ) (4,109 ) Integration related charges (5,982 ) (3,065 ) Telecom component inventory write down (4,000 ) Incentive payments (7,473 ) Other (332 ) 444 Net nonrecurring items (81,221 ) (759 ) Goodwill and intangibles amortization (42,297 ) (30,947 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes 34,154 98,977 Provision for income taxes (34,774 ) (39,699 ) (Loss)/income from continuing operations (620 ) 59,278 Gain/income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes 35,125 31,242 Net income $ 34,505 $ 90,520 Note: Certain components within the Nonrecurring items captions for the prior year have been adjusted in some instances for ease of comparability to current year. References to reported results refer to US GAAP whereas adjusted results reflect the US GAAP results excluding the impact of goodwill and intangible amortization and the impact of nonrecurring items. 15 Table of Contents Discussion of Consolidated Results of Operations 2001 Compared to 2000 Sales 2001 Compared to 2000 Sales for 2001 were $1,330.1 million versus $1,335.5 million during 2000, representing a decrease of $5.4 million or less than 1%. Incremental revenue of approximately $102 million from the acquisitions of Packard and NEN mostly offset lower revenue of $74 million associated with divested businesses, the negative impact of foreign exchange of $26 million and organic revenue decline of $8 million. Organic revenue, which the Company defines as growth in historical businesses plus growth in acquired businesses assuming they were owned in prior periods, adjusted for the effects of exited businesses and foreign exchange, was strong in the Life Sciences segment as a result of market expansion and new product introductions, but was offset by declines in electronic based end markets. 2000 Compared to 1999 Sales for 2000 were $1,335.5 million versus $1,050.8 million in 1999, representing an increase of $284.7 million or 27%. Incremental revenue from the acquisition of NEN and AI, organic growth in the Life Sciences and Optoelectronics segments as well as new product introductions within the Life Sciences segment contributed to the increase. Cost of Sales 2001 Compared to 2000 Reported cost of sales of $721.7 million for 2001 versus $756.9 million during 2000 represented a decrease of $35.2 million or 5%. On a percentage of sales basis, cost of sales decreased to 54% in 2001 from 57% during 2000. The decrease is reflective of the Companys continued productivity and cost containment gains in the form of headcount and facility rationalization and further expansion and relocation into lower cost manufacturing geographies as well as strategic moves into higher margin businesses. Adjusted cost of sales, which excludes the impact of nonrecurring items, was $706.3 million for 2001 versus $753.3 million for 2000, representing a $47.0 million or 6% decrease. Nonrecurring items for 2001 of $15.4 million related principally to an inventory write off related to unexpected declines in the telecom component business, the amortization of the write up of Packard inventory included as part of purchase accounting, the cost of movements of manufacturing facilities and charges associated with moves to lower cost geographies. The results from 2000 included $3.6 million in nonrecurring charges as discussed below. 2000 Compared to 1999 Reported cost of sales of $756.9 million for 2000 versus $624.7 million for 1999 represented an increase of $132.2 million or 21%. On a percentage of revenue basis, cost of sales decreased to 57% in 2000 from 59% in 1999. The decrease reflected productivity initiatives and the benefits of restructuring initiatives aimed at headcount reduction and facility rationalization. Adjusted cost of sales, which excludes the impact of nonrecurring items, was $753.3 million for 2000 versus $614.5 million in 1999. Nonrecurring items for 2000 included $3.6 million in charges associated with reorganization related activities and the write up of inventory acquired as part of the NEN acquisition. The results for 1999 included $10.2 million in nonrecurring charges, principally comprised of the write up of inventory acquired as part of the AI acquisition. Research and Development and In Process Research and Development Charges 2001 Compared to 2000 Reported research and development expenses including in process research and development charges increased to $150.4 million in 2001 from $101.2 million in 2000, an increase of $49.2 million or 49%, as a result of higher in process research and development charges in 2001. Research and development efforts during 2001 were mainly directed in the end markets of drug discovery tools, pharmaceutical and biomedical within the Life Sciences business. 16 Table of Contents Adjusted research and development costs, which exclude the impact of nonrecurring items, were $81.3 million in 2001 versus $76.9 million in 2000, an increase of $4.4 million or 6%. As a percentage of sales, research and development costs on an adjusted basis represented 6% of sales for both 2001 and 2000, a trend reflective of the Companys continued commitment to new product development. Nonrecurring items in 2001 were $69.0 million associated with the write off of in process technology acquired as part of the Companys acquisition of Packard. The results from 2000 included a similar charge of $24.3 million related to the Companys acquisition of NEN. 2000 Compared to 1999 Reported research and development costs including in process research and development charges of $101.2 million for 2000 versus $89.9 million for 1999 represented an increase of $11.3 million or 13%. The increase reflects research and development efforts as a result of the Companys continued commitment to new product development, particularly in the Life Sciences businesses. Adjusted research and development costs for 2000 were $76.9 million, versus $66.9 million for 1999. On a percentage of sales basis, adjusted research and development costs were 6% for both 2000 and 1999. Nonrecurring charges for 2000 were $24.3 million, which represented a write off of in process research and development charges associated with the NEN acquisition. Nonrecurring charges for 1999 were $23.0 million, which represented a similar write off related to the AI acquisition. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2001 Compared to 2000 Reported SG&A expenses for 2001 were $411.1 million versus $375.9 million for 2000, representing an increase of $35.2 million or 9%. The increase primarily reflects the inclusion of expenses associated with Packards operations of $9 million assumed during the fourth quarter of 2001, increased amortization expenses associated with the NEN and Packard acquisitions of $11.3 million as well as the restructuring and reorganization related charges noted below. Adjusted SG&A expenses, which exclude goodwill and intangibles amortization and the impact of nonrecurring items, were $350.7 million for 2001 versus $340.0 million for 2000, representing an increase of $10.7 million or 3% principally as a result of the acquisition of Packard. As a percentage of sales, adjusted SG&A expenses were 26% in 2001 versus 25% in 2000. Goodwill and intangibles amortization increased to $42.3 million in 2001 from $30.9 million in 2000 as a result of the NEN acquisition completed in 2000 and the Packard acquisition completed during the fourth quarter of 2001. Nonrecurring charges of $18.1 million in 2001 included: incentive payments associated with portfolio changes, charges associated with the integration of general and administrative functions for the Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments business units, as well as moves of certain manufacturing operations to lower cost geographies and acquisition related charges borne by the Company. Nonrecurring charges during 2000 were $5.0 million as discussed below. 2000 Compared to 1999 Reported SG&A expenses of $375.9 million for 2000 versus $290.8 million for 1999 represented an increase of $85.1 million or 29%. The increase is primarily attributable to the increased amortization expense associated with the AI and NEN acquisitions. Adjusted SG&A expenses, which excludes goodwill and intangible amortization and the impact of nonrecurring items, were $340.0 million in 2000 versus $271.3 million in 1999. As a percentage of sales, adjusted SG&A expenses were 25% in 2000 versus 26% in 1999. Goodwill and intangible amortization increased to $30.9 million in 2000 from $22.9 million in 1999. Net nonrecurring charges of $5.0 million in 2000 represented an increase over the $3.4 million net gains from 1999. Nonrecurring charges for 2000 included integration related charges associated with the Packard acquisition. Nonrecurring charges for 1999 included smaller items of a similar nature in connection with the AI acquisition. 17 Table of Contents Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges 2001 Compared to 2000 Net restructuring charges were $9.5 million for 2001 versus $3.9 million in 2000. Charges for the 2001 year represented a restructuring charge associated with the Packard acquisition of $3.9 million as well as additional funding for amendments to existing plans for integration activities previously identified. Resultant charges for both years are considered nonrecurring in the Companys presentation of Adjusted Net Income. 2000 Compared to 1999 Net restructuring charges were $3.9 million in 2000 versus $14.7 million in 1999. Net charges for 2000 were comprised of a $15.1 million plan announced during the fourth quarter of 2000, offset by $11.2 million in reversals associated with plans announced during prior years. The charges during 2000 related to restructuring activities within the Life Sciences and Optoelectronics businesses. Net charges for 1999 were comprised of an $18.0 million charge for the 1999 plan, offset by $3.3 million reversed from the 1998 plan. Results from 1999 also included $18.0 million in asset impairment charges associated with impairments recognized on long lived assets within the Analytical Instruments and Optoelectronics segments. These charges are considered nonrecurring in the Companys presentation of Adjusted Net Income. Gains on Dispositions 2001 Compared to 2000 Dispositions resulted in a net gain of $26.6 million for 2001 versus a net gain of $35.1 million in 2000. The gain in 2001 resulted principally from the $32.3 million gain on the sale of the Instruments for Research and Applied Sciences business, previously part of the Analytical Instruments business, and approximately $0.6 million in net gains resulting from dispositions in the Optoelectronics and Analytical Instruments businesses, offset in part by the $6.3 million loss resulting from the sale of the Voltarc Technologies business, previously part of the Optoelectronics segment. The gain in 2000 included a gain of approximately $16.7 million on the sale of a building, a $10.0 million gain on the disposition of the Companys Berthold business, $6.7 million in gains from other dispositions within the Optoelectronic business segment and $1.6 million in gains previously deferred from prior dispositions. The resulting impact for both years is considered nonrecurring in the Companys presentation of Adjusted Net Income. 2000 Compared to 1999 Dispositions resulted in gains of $35.1 million in 2000 versus $13.8 million in 1999. The gain in 2000 included amounts related to the sale of a building and dispositions of certain businesses, as previously discussed. The 1999 gain principally related to previously deferred sales proceeds recognized as a result of the favorable resolution of certain events and contingencies. The resulting impact for both years is considered nonrecurring in the Companys presentation of Adjusted Net Income. Other Expense, net 2001 Compared to 2000 Other expense, net for 2001 was $29.8 million versus $33.7 million in 2000, representing a decrease of $3.9 million or 12%. Other expense, net consisted principally of interest from debt associated with prior acquisitions. The decrease is caused primarily by the impact of nonrecurring gains, which consisted of gains realized on the sale of investments of $4.3 million and $0.9 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Other expense, net excluding nonrecurring items was $34.1 million versus $34.6 million. Decreased interest rates offset the impact of higher average debt levels resulting from the acquisition of NEN in 2000. 2000 Compared to 1999 Other Expense, net for 2000 was $33.7 million versus $15.0 million in 1999, an increase of $18.7 million. The increase is primarily the result of increased debt levels as a result of acquisitions, as well as the impact of foreign exchange losses. As discussed, the 2000 expense includes a $0.9 million nonrecurring gain associated with the sale of an investment. The 1999 results did not include any nonrecurring amounts. 18 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes 2001 Compared to 2000 Provision for income taxes was $34.8 million for 2001 versus $39.7 million in 2000. The 2001 tax rate was primarily impacted by the tax treatment of in process research and development charges associated with the Packard acquisition, with a minor benefit resulting from a refund on a case previously brought by the Internal Revenue Service. The 2000 rate was impacted to a lesser extent by similar in process research and development charges, as discussed below. Provision for income taxes on Adjusted Net Income was $40.9 million in 2001 and $36.4 million in 2000. The effective rate on an adjusted basis was 26% for 2001 versus 28% for 2000. The decrease in effective rate was primarily the result of the Companys continued expansion of manufacturing operations to lower tax jurisdictions. 2000 Compared to 1999 Provision for income taxes was $39.7 million in 2000 versus $4.6 million in 1999. The effective rate for both years was 40% on a reported basis and reflected the tax impact of in process research and development charges for the NEN acquisition during 2000 and the AI acquisition during 1999. Provision for income taxes on Adjusted net income was $36.4 million in 2000 versus $24.7 million in 1999. The effective rate was 28% for both periods on an adjusted basis. Segment Results of Operations The Companys continuing operations are reported as three segments, reflecting the Companys management methodology and structure. The Companys Technical Services segment, Security and Detection Systems business, previously reported as part of the Companys Instruments segment, and Fluid Sciences business have been classified as discontinued operations in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions (APB No. 30). The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the footnotes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company evaluates performance based on operating profit of the respective segments. The discussion that follows is a summary analysis of the primary changes in operating results by segment for 2001 versus 2000 and 2000 versus 1999. Life Sciences 2001 Compared to 2000 Sales for 2001 were $346.1 million versus $221.4 million in 2000, representing a $124.7 million or 56% increase. This increase reflects approximately $102 million from the combined impact of the inclusion of the results of operations of NEN for a full year and two months of results associated with Packard. The increase was also driven by strong growth in the drug discovery and genetic screening businesses and growth in related consumables resulting from new product introductions and geographic expansions leading to organic growth in excess of 12%. The reported operating loss for 2001 was $46.0 million versus a loss of $3.6 million in 2000 due to the inclusion of purchase accounting and restructuring charges associated with the acquisition of Packard during 2001, partially offset by similar charges during 2000 from the NEN acquisition as discussed below. Adjusted operating profit excluding goodwill and intangibles amortization and nonrecurring items was $63.9 million for 2001, which represented a $24.7 million or 63% increase over that of 2000. As a percentage of sales, adjusted operating profit rose to 18.5% from 17.7% as a result of sales of higher margin products and the impact of productivity and cost containment associated with the consolidation of manufacturing and administrative sites. Goodwill and intangibles amortization was $23.7 million for 2001 versus $9.3 million for 2000 as a result of the acquisitions discussed above. Nonrecurring charges during 2001 totaled $86.2 million, consisting of a $69.0 million charge associated with acquired in process research and development, a $1.5 million charge for the revaluation of acquired inventory, $3.4 million of net restructuring charges, a $3.3 million integration incentive associated with the Packard acquisition, $6.0 million in integration related 19 Table of Contents charges outside the scope of purchase accounting and a net $2.8 million in other charges which include the settlement of certain preacquisition contingencies from a prior acquisition. The 2000 reported operating profit included $33.5 million in nonrecurring charges as discussed below. 2000 Compared to 1999 Sales of $221.4 million for 2000 increased $63.4 million, or 40%, versus 1999. Organic revenue growth for 2000 was 18%. Higher volumes from high throughput screening and drug discovery applications, revenues from new product introductions in the areas of genetic screening and drug discovery tools, and the inclusion of revenues from NEN Life Sciences acquired in August 2000, were the primary drivers of the increase in 2000 versus 1999. Reported operating loss for 2000 was $3.6 million versus reported operating income of $15.8 million in 1999. The decline is attributed principally to the impact of purchase accounting and restructuring charges associated with the acquisition of NEN. Adjusted operating profit before goodwill and intangibles amortization and nonrecurring items for 2000 was $39.2 million, representing an increase of $15.2 million, or 63%, versus 1999. Higher revenues discussed above, particularly sales of higher margin new products, and revenues from the NEN acquisition contributed to the increase in operating profit before goodwill and intangibles amortization and nonrecurring items in 2000 versus 1999. The 2000 reported operating loss included goodwill and intangibles amortization of $9.3 million and nonrecurring charges of $33.5 million: a $24.3 million charge for acquired in process R&D, a $1.8 million charge for the revaluation of acquired inventory, $3.9 million of net restructuring charges and $3.5 million of integration related charges associated with the NEN acquisition borne by the Company. The 1999 reported operating profit included goodwill and intangibles amortization of $2.4 million and net restructuring charges of $5.8 million. Optoelectronics 2001 Compared to 2000 Sales for 2001 were $415.7 million, down $81.2 million or 16% from he $496.9 million in sales for 2000. The lower revenue was a result of an organic revenue decline of 10% as well as the impact of divested businesses and product lines. This decline in organic revenue reflects continued weakness in the photography, semiconductor and telecom component markets which more than offset strong growth in the digital imaging, sensors and biomedical markets. Reported operating profit for 2001 was $45.8 million, down $51.1 million or 53% from the $96.9 million recognized during 2000. The decline was driven principally by the decreases in revenue discussed above, and the costs associated with moving to lower cost production locations and streamlining operations. Adjusted operating profit for 2001 was $68.6 million, representing a $15.0 million or 18% decrease from $83.6 million for 2000. As a percentage of sales, adjusted operating profit was 16.5% for 2001 versus 16.8% for 2000, with the impact of the reduction in sales offset to some degree by cost savings and productivity enhancements associated with reduced headcount and facility costs as well as moves to lower cost geographies. The 2001 reported operating profit included goodwill and intangibles amortization of $8.1 million as well as nonrecurring items of $14.7 million. Nonrecurring items were primarily comprised of a $4.0 million inventory write off related to unexpected declines in end user demand in the telecom component business, a $5.5 million net loss realized on the disposal of certain businesses, a $1.8 million retention incentive, reorganization related charges of $6.0 million associated with the Companys further expansion and relocation into lower cost manufacturing locations, restructuring and other charges of $1.0 million as well as a $3.6 million nonrecurring credit related to accruals no longer deemed necessary. The 2000 reported operating profit included goodwill and intangibles amortization of $8.1 million and net nonrecurring gains of $21.4 million, as discussed below. 2000 Compared to 1999 Sales for 2000 were $496.9 million versus $447.7 million in 1999, representing an increase of $49.2 million, or 11%. Organic revenue growth for 2000 was 22%. Strong revenue growth across all businesses contributed to this increase in 2000 versus 1999. 20 Table of Contents Reported operating profit increased $56.6 million in 2000 to $96.9 million versus $40.3 million in 1999, representing a 140% increase. The increase in 2000 was due primarily to higher revenues discussed above, the sale of higher margin new specialty lighting products and the continued benefits of Six Sigma and other manufacturing initiatives and the nonrecurring credits discussed below. Adjusted operating profit before goodwill and intangibles amortization and nonrecurring items for 2000 was $83.6 million, increasing $25.3 million, or 43%, versus 1999. The 2000 reported operating profit included goodwill and intangibles amortization of $8.1 million and net nonrecurring gains of $21.4 million. Nonrecurring items included: gains on dispositions of $23.4 million, restructuring credits of $9.9 million, restructuring charges of $10 million and restructuring related charges of $1.9 million related to the shift by the Company to lower cost manufacturing geographies. The 1999 reported operating profit included goodwill and intangibles amortization of $9.5 million and nonrecurring items including restructuring charges of $5.5 million and an asset impairment charge of $3 million. Analytical Instruments 2001 Compared to 2000 Sales for 2001 were $568.2 million, a decrease of $49.1 million or 8% versus the $617.3 million recognized during 2000. The decline in revenue was driven principally by the disposition of the Berthold business in late 2000, which had revenue of $30 million in the year 2000, as well as the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange of $14 million in 2001. Organically, the business contracted less than 1%. Reported operating profit for 2001 was $78.4 million versus $56.9 million in 2000, an increase of $21.5 million or 38%. The increase during 2001 reflects the impact of nonrecurring gains associated with the sale of the Companys IRAS business, net of nonrecurring charges and the benefits of productivity and cost containment actions. Results from 2000 included a net nonrecurring gain of approximately $10.0 million resulting from the Berthold sale. Adjusted operating profit before goodwill and intangibles amortization and nonrecurring items was $72.8 million for 2001 versus $61.7 million for 2000, representing an $11.1 million or 18% increase. As a percentage of sales, adjusted operating profit rose from 10.0% to 12.8% driven principally by reductions in headcount of over 350 people as a result of transitioning European manufacturing to lower cost Asian facilities as well as consolidating European sales and back office operations. Adjusted operating profit for 2001 excludes goodwill and intangibles amortization of $10.5 million and net nonrecurring gains of $16.1 million. Nonrecurring items included: $32.1 million in gains realized on the disposal of businesses, a restructuring charge of $5.3 million, a $2.3 million incentive payment associated with the successful completion of the divestitures and $8.4 million in reorganization related charges associated with the business move to lower cost geographies, consolidation of European finance functions and the move to a new US headquarters. Reported operating profit for 2000 included goodwill and intangibles amortization of $13.5 million and nonrecurring gains of $8.7 million, as discussed below. 2000 Compared to 1999 Sales for 2000 were $617.3 million, increasing $172.2 million, or 39%, versus 1999. Organic revenue growth in 2000 was basically flat. The increase in reported 2000 revenues versus 1999 was due primarily to the inclusion of the AI business for a full year, partially offset by the Companys sale of its Berthold business in the fourth quarter and the effects of a stronger dollar in 2000. Reported operating profit for 2000 was $56.9 million versus an operating loss in 1999 of $21.4 million. The increase is due primarily to the inclusion of the AI acquisition for a full year in 2000, improvements in manufacturing cost structure and benefits from restructuring actions. For 2000, adjusted operating profit before goodwill and intangibles amortization and nonrecurring items was $61.7 million versus $40.2 million in 1999, representing an increase of $21.5 million, or 53%. The 2000 reported operating profit included goodwill and intangibles amortization of $13.5 million and net nonrecurring gains of $8.7 million. The net nonrecurring items included: a $10.0 million gain on disposition of the Berthold business, a $0.9 million gain on the sale of a building and $2.2 million of reorganization related charges associated with the integration of the AI acquisition. The 1999 reported operating profit included goodwill and 21 Table of Contents intangibles amortization of $11 million, certain acquisition related charges and other nonrecurring items: $23 million charge for acquired in process research and development, $15 million asset impairment charge, $9.8 million charge for the revaluation of acquired inventory and restructuring related and other charges of $2.8 million. Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded $33.0 million as part of a purchase accounting adjustment associated with the Packard acquisition (the Packard Plan) in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 95 3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination (EITF 95 3). The principal elements of this plan involve approximately $20.0 million in employee separation expenses, $3.0 million in expenses associated with the disposal of certain product lines and assets and $10.0 million in lease and contract termination costs and other expenses. During 2001, the Company announced restructuring charges totaling $9.2 million associated with continued integration activities (the 2001 plan). The principal elements of this plan included $7.0 million in employee separation expenses, $2.1 million in lease and contract termination costs and other expenses and $0.1 million in expenses associated with the disposal of certain product lines and assets. Expenditures Reversal of Balance at and Existing 2001 Balance at 12/31/2000 Adjustments Provision Provision 12/30/2001 (In millions) Existing plans $ 47.4 $ (38.5 ) $ (0.5 ) $ 0.8 $ 9.2 Packard plan 33.0 33.0 2001 plan (1.6 ) 9.2 7.6 Totals $ 47.4 $ (40.1 ) $ (0.5 ) $ 43.0 $ 49.8 Amounts accrued for under remaining plans include actions announced during the fourth quarter of 2000 associated with employee separation costs and asset disposal costs resulting from the rationalization of certain facilities and the disposal of underutilized assets. These actions occurred in the Life Sciences and Optoelectronics businesses. Additionally, the remaining accrual for existing plans includes amounts accrued for in connection with the AI and NEN acquisitions that occurred during 1999 and 2000, respectively. Cash outlays during 2001 were approximately $36.3 million for the above discussed plans. The Company expects to incur approximately $40 50 million of cash outlays in connection with these plans during 2002. Discontinued Operations In October 2001, the Company announced its plan to sell its Fluid Sciences business. The Company has accounted for the business as a discontinued operation in accordance with APB No. 30 and, accordingly, the results of operations have been segregated from continuing operations and reported as a separate line item on the Companys accompanying consolidated income statements. During July 2001, the Company announced its intention to sell its Security and Detection Systems business. During January 2002, the Company announced the sale of this business for consideration of approximately $100 million. The proposed sale is currently being reviewed by the US Department of Justice and is expected to be finalized during the first half of 2002. The Company has accounted for the business as a discontinued operation in accordance with APB No. 30 and, accordingly, the results of operations have been segregated from continuing operations and reported as a separate line item on the Companys accompanying consolidated income statements. The Company does not expect to incur a loss on the sale of either the Fluid Sciences or Security and Detection Systems businesses. On August 20, 1999, the Company sold the assets of its Technical Services business, including the outstanding capital stock of EG&G Defense Materials, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, to EG&G Technical Services, Inc., an affiliate of The Carlyle Group LP (the Buyer), for approximately $250 million in cash and the assumption by the Buyer of certain liabilities of the Technical Services business. The Company accounted for the sale of its Technical Services business as a discontinued operation in accordance 22 Table of Contents with APB No. 30. Accordingly, the results of operations have been segregated from continuing operations and reported as a separate line item on the Companys accompanying consolidated income statements. Sales from the discontinued operations of the Technical Services, Fluid Sciences and Security and Detection Systems businesses were $271.7 million, $359.7 million and $615.1 million during 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The summary operating results of the discontinued operations are outlined in Note 7 to the financial statements. Dividends During 2001, the Companys Board of Directors declared four regular quarterly cash dividends of 7 cents per share each, resulting in an annual rate of 28 cents per share. Stock Split At the Companys 2001 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock from 100,000,000 shares to 300,000,000 shares was approved. At the April 24, 2001 Board of Directors Meeting a two for one stock split was approved. The stock split has been retroactively reflected in this report. Environmental The Company is conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at current and former Company locations and, along with other companies, has been named a potentially responsible party (PRP) for certain waste disposal sites. The Company accrues for environmental issues in the accounting period that the Companys responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued $6.9 million as of December 30, 2001, representing managements estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters. Such amount is not discounted and does not reflect any recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. These cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the timeframe over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where the Company has been named a PRP, management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. The Company expects that such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to five years. As assessments and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations. While it is reasonably possible that a material loss exceeding the amounts recorded may have been incurred, the preliminary stages of the investigations make it impossible for the Company to reasonably estimate the range of potential exposure. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $111.0 million in 2001 compared to $98.2 million in 2000. For 2001, this was comprised of net income before depreciation, amortization and other non cash items of $176.8 million partially offset by gains on disposition of assets, net of $30.9 million and $34.9 million net change in certain assets and liabilities and other items during 2001. The 2000 operating cash flow was comprised of net income before depreciation, amortization and other non cash items of $162.6 million partially offset by gains on dispositions of assets, net of $37.2 million and $27.2 million of net change in certain assets, liabilities and other items during the period. Included in the change in assets and liabilities for 2001 was a $39.5 million increase in inventory due to lower than planned sales in a number of the businesses, primarily in the Optoelectronics segment and inventory safety stock for production moves, $31.5 million in restructuring payments, partially offset by a $14.0 million reduction in accounts receivable which is net of $37.0 million from a receivable securitization program that is discussed below. 23 Table of Contents Capital expenditures were $88.7 million in 2001 versus $55.3 million in 2000. This increase was due to a $30 million leasehold improvement at a new worldwide headquarters facility for the Analytical Instruments business and a $20 million expansion of the Companys telecom manufacturing capability. The Company estimates capital expenditures for 2002 of approximately $60 million, principally for equipment, process improvement and maintenance associated with increasing productivity and capacity within the businesses of drug discovery tools and other biomedical applications. Cash flow from the sale of businesses, primarily IRAS and Voltarc, was $57.5 million and from the monetization of assets was $56.3 million for 2001. Monetization of assets consisted of the sale of non strategic assets and the sale leaseback of facilities and equipment. Costs of acquisitions, net of cash acquired, generated $45.5 million of cash in 2001, principally from the Packard acquisition, versus a usage of $431.5 million in 2000. During 2000, cash flow from the sale of businesses was $49.2 million and from the monetization of assets was $33.9 million. Monetization of assets during 2000 included the sale of assets, nonstrategic investments and the sale leaseback of facilities. Cash flows generated through operating and investing activities, along with proceeds of $39.4 million from the exercise of stock options, were used in part to reduce short term commercial paper borrowings by $177.0 million during 2001. In 2000, the Company issued convertible debt with net proceeds totaling $448 million. These proceeds along with net borrowings under commercial paper of approximately $37.0 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $46.9 million were used in part to reduce other debt balances by approximately $234.0 million. Cash utilized in the payment of dividends to common stockholders totaled $28.3 million during 2001. Borrowing Arrangements The Company maintains two unsecured lines of credit totaling $370 million. In March 2002, the Companys revolving credit facility was refinanced in the amount of $270 million and will expire in March 2003. In March 2001, the Companys $100 million revolving credit facility was refinanced and will expire in March 2006. These agreements, which serve as backup facilities for the commercial paper borrowings, have no significant commitment fees. The credit lines, if drawn, bear interest at LIBOR plus 60 basis points. Under the terms of the credit agreement, the Company is required to maintain certain minimum Debt to Total Capital and Interest Coverage ratios. There were no amounts outstanding under these lines at December 31, 2000 or December 30, 2001 nor during any time period in these two years and the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants. At December 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000, long term debt was $598.1 million and $583.3 million, respectively. Included in these amounts are $115 million of unsecured ten year notes issued in October 1995, which carry an interest rate of 6.8% and mature in 2005. During the fourth quarter of 2001, this fixed rate was swapped to a floating rate, resulting in an all in cost of funds of 4.46% during 2001, a reduction of 2.34% from the fixed rate. This interest rate swap instrument resets semi annually in arrears based upon six month USD LIBOR. The fair value of this instrument as of December 30, 2001 was $(2.3) million which is offset by a corresponding gain on the underlying bond. Other long term debt includes zero coupon senior convertible debentures described below which had a $483 million accreted value at 2001 and a $468 million accreted value at 2000. The carrying amount of the unsecured ten year notes and senior subordinated ten year notes approximated the estimated fair value at December 30, 2001, based on a quoted market price. The estimated fair value of the convertible debentures approximated $512 million at December 30, 2001, also based on a quoted market price. As discussed above, in 2001 the Company relocated its Analytical Instruments headquarters to a new leased facility and pre funded $30 million of leasehold improvements. Originally, these improvements were to be included in the operating lease of the facility. However, the Company determined it was more economical to purchase the leasehold improvements and fund them through asset securitization. Consequently, the Company established a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary to purchase, on a revolving basis, certain of the Companys accounts receivable balances and simultaneously sell an undivided interest in this pool of receivables to a financial institution. As collections reduce the accounts receivable balances, new receivables are sold. The Companys consolidated subsidiary retains the risk of credit loss on the receivables and 24 Table of Contents accordingly, the full amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided for on the Companys balance sheet. Under the terms of this arrangement, the Company retains collection and administrative responsibilities for the balances. The facility is renewable on an annual basis and has an effective interest rate of approximately LIBOR plus 30 basis points. Amounts sold under this facility during 2001 approximated $37 million. This amount has reduced the outstanding receivables balance. In August 2000, the Company sold zero coupon senior convertible debentures with an aggregate purchase price of $460 million. The Company used the offerings net proceeds of approximately $448 million to repay a portion of its commercial paper borrowings, which had been increased temporarily to finance the NEN acquisition. Deferred issuance costs of $12 million were recorded as a non current asset and are being amortized over three years. The debentures are due August 2020, and were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%. At maturity, the Company would be required to repay $921 million, comprised of $460 million of original purchase price plus accrued original issue discount. The Company may redeem some or all of the debentures at any time on or after August 7, 2003 at a redemption price equal to the issue price plus the accrued original issue discount through the redemption date. Holders of the debentures may require the Company to repurchase some or all of the debentures in August 2003 and August 2010, or at any time upon certain changes of control in the Company, at a repurchase price equal to the initial price to the public plus the accrued original issue discount through the date of the repurchase. The Company has the right to repay some or all of the debentures with common stock based on the then current market price, subject to satisfying conditions within the trust indenture, particularly the Companys ability to register the necessary common shares under applicable securities laws. The Company may only exercise this right in connection with a repurchase at the option of the holders or a repurchase in connection with certain changes in control. The debentures are currently convertible into 10.8 million shares of the Companys common stock at approximately $44 per share. In November 2001, the Company completed its acquisition of Packard BioScience Company and assumed $118 million of senior subordinated ten year notes issued in March 1997. The Company redeemed the notes on March 1, 2002 at a rate of 104.688% in accordance with the indenture dated as of March 4, 1997. As such, this amount has been reclassified to short term for presentation purposes. As of December 30, 2001, the Company was in compliance with all covenants and other requirements set forth in its credit agreements and indentures. Although a downgrade in the Companys credit rating could affect the pricing of short term liquidity sources such as commercial paper, the only credit agreement or indenture the Company maintains with ratings downgrades that would accelerate the maturity dates of debt is the receivables securitization program discussed above. The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various other financing and leasing arrangements which do not contain any ratings triggers. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations at December 30, 2001, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods: 6.800% 9.375% Sr. Zero Coupon Unsecured Subordinated Convertible Operating Notes due Notes due Debentures Leases 20051 20052 Total due 20203 (In thousands) 2002 $ 20,000 $ 7,820 $ 118,145 $ 145,965 $ 2003 17,400 7,820 25,220 510,466 2004 15,400 7,820 23,220 2005 12,100 122,820 134,920 2006+ 127,800 127,800 Total $ 192,700 $ 146,280 $ 118,145 $ 457,125 $ 510,466 1 The interest on the Unsecured Notes maturing in 2005, originally fixed at 6.8%, has been swapped to a variable rate based upon the 6 month LIBOR. For the purposes of this table, the obligation has been calculated using the fixed 6.8% rate due to the variability in the actual rate. 25 Table of Contents 2 As discussed above, the 9.375% Sr. Subordinated Notes due 2005 have been redeemed by the Company as of March 1, 2002. 3 The 2003 obligation on the Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures reflects the right of the holders to require the Company to repurchase some or all of the notes in August 2003, as discussed above. The Company has the option to repay some or all of the debentures with common stock, as discussed above. Included in the lease commitments disclosed in the preceding table is a six year operating lease agreement signed in 2000 for a facility in the Optoelectronics segment. At the end of the lease term, the Company, at its option, may: (i) renew the lease; (ii) purchase the property at a price equal to the lessors original cost (approximately $30 million); or (iii) allow the lease to expire and cause the property to be sold. The Companys ability to cause the property to be sold depends upon its compliance with certain terms of the lease. Under certain conditions, the Company would receive any excess of the net sales proceeds over the propertys original cost. In the event that the net sales proceeds are less than the original cost, the Company would be required to make certain contingent rental payments to the lessor equal to that difference, subject to a maximum amount. The Company requires cash to pay its operating expenses, make capital expenditures and acquisitions and pay debt service, including principal and interest. The Companys principal sources of funds are from its operations and the capital markets, particularly the debt markets. The Company also anticipates receiving significant cash in the near term from the projected dispositions of its discontinued operations. In the near term, the Company anticipates that its operations will generate sufficient cash to fund its operating expenses, capital expenditures and interest payments on its debt. Depending on the size of the transaction, the Company may require funds from external sources for acquisitions that it effects for cash. The Company may also require funds from external sources to refinance the principal of its debt as it matures, particularly the $510 million of zero coupon convertible debentures that holders will have the option to put in 2003 and the $123 million of principal that becomes due on its 6.8% unsecured notes in 2005. Principal factors that could affect the Companys internally generated funds include: Increased working capital requirements. Deterioration of sales due to continued weakness in certain end markets into which the Company sells. Principal factors that could affect the Companys ability to obtain cash from external sources include: A deterioration in the external credit markets hindering the Companys ability to place investment grade commercial paper. The Companys inability to dispose of the Fluid Sciences and Security and Detection Systems businesses currently being held for sale. Borrowing requirements stemming from potential obligations noted above that would reduce the Companys overall borrowing capacity. The existence of a ratings downgrade that would impact the Companys ability to borrow under its receivable securitization program. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, restructuring, pensions and other post retirement benefits, and contingencies and litigation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 26 Table of Contents The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements. The Companys product sales are recorded at the time when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. A provision is made at the time the related revenue is recognized for the cost of any installation obligations and the estimated cost of product warranties. When other significant obligations remain after products are delivered, including certain customer acceptance provisions, revenue is recognized only after such obligations are fulfilled. If a loss is anticipated on any contract, a provision for the entire loss is made immediately. Revenue related to the sale of maintenance contracts is deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the service period. For equipment leased to a customer under a sales type lease, revenue recognition generally commences when the equipment has been shipped, installed and is ready for use. The Company values inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. Inventory quantities on hand are regularly reviewed, and where necessary, provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based primarily on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months or historical trailing twelve month usage. A significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand requiring additional inventory write downs. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets and investments for continued appropriateness. This review is based upon its projections of anticipated future cash flows, market conditions, legal factors and operational performance. While it believes that its future estimates are reasonable, different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could materially affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Financial Instruments Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments and accounts receivable. The Company believes it had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of December 30, 2001. In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with its committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Transactions covered by hedge contracts include inter company and third party receivables and payables. The contracts are primarily in European and Asian currencies, have maturities that do not exceed 12 months, have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Credit risk and market risk are minimal as the foreign exchange instruments are contracted with major banking institutions. Unrealized gains and losses on the Companys foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and, for hedges designated as cash flow, the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. These deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs. Effectiveness of these cash flow hedges is measured utilizing the cumulative dollar offset method and is reviewed quarterly. For the year ended December 30, 2001, net losses from hedges reclassified from other comprehensive income to revenue and expense totaled $36,000. The notional amount of the outstanding foreign currency contracts was approximately $280 million as of December 30, 2001 and $190 million at December 31, 2000. At December 30, 2001, the approximate fair value for foreign currency derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges was $560,000 and at December 31, 2000 was not significant. The approximate fair value for 27 Table of Contents foreign currency derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges was $380,000 and is recorded in other current assets with the offset to other comprehensive income. This gain will be recognized in earnings over the next 12 months. Market Risk Market Risk: The Company is exposed to market risk, including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, the Company enters into various derivative transactions pursuant to the Companys policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures. Foreign Exchange Risk: As a multinational corporation, the Company is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. As the Companys international sales grow, exposure to volatility in exchange rates could have a materially adverse impact on the Companys financial results. The Companys risk from exchange rates is primarily related to non dollar denominated sales in Europe and Asia. The Company uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. The derivative instruments held by the Company are not leveraged and are not held for trading purposes. The Company uses forward contracts to hedge its net asset position and uses a combination of forward and option contracts to hedge anticipated cash flows. The Companys hedging activity is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on assets, liabilities and cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. The success of the hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in various currencies. To the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility, the Company could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses. The principal currencies hedged are the British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen, and Singapore Dollar. In those currencies where there is a liquid, cost effective forward market, the Company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its anticipated transaction exposure for periods not to exceed one year. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposure. Interest Rate Risk: The Company maintains an investment portfolio consisting of securities of various issuers, types and maturities. The investments are classified as available for sale. These securities are recorded on the balance sheet at market value, with any unrealized gain or loss recorded in comprehensive income. These instruments are not leveraged, and are not held for trading purposes. Value at Risk: The Company utilizes a Value at Risk (VaR) model to determine the potential loss in fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchange sensitive derivative financial instruments within a 95% confidence interval. The Companys computation was based on the interrelationships between movements in interest rates and foreign currencies. These interrelationships were determined by observing historical interest rate and foreign currency market changes over corresponding periods. The assets, liabilities, firm commitments and anticipated transactions, which are hedged by derivative financial instruments, were excluded from the model. The Companys computations are based on the Monte Carlo simulation, utilizing a 95% confidence interval and a holding period of 30 days. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual gains or losses in fair value that will be incurred by the Company. The VaR model estimated that there is a 5% chance that the market value of the derivative instruments held as of December 30, 2001 will deteriorate due to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations by more than $1.8 million. During the four quarters ended December 30, 2001, the VaR ranged between $0.25 million and $1.8 million, and averaged approximately $0.8 million. Management periodically reviews its interest rate and foreign currency exposures and evaluates strategies to manage such exposures in the near future. The Company implements changes, when deemed necessary, in the management of hedging instruments which mitigate its exposure. Since the Company utilizes interest rate and foreign currency sensitive derivative instruments for hedging, a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying transaction. It is the Companys policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate transactions only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. The Company does not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. 28 Table of Contents Forward Looking Information and Factors Affecting Future Performance This report contains forward looking statements as defined in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. For this purpose, any statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements. Words such as believes, anticipates, plans, expects, will and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. There are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by these forward looking statements including, among others, the factors set forth below. The following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations: Our operating results could be harmed if the industries into which we sell our products are in downward cycles. Some of the industries and markets into which we sell our products are cyclical. Industry downturns often are characterized by reduced product demand, excess manufacturing capacity and erosion of average selling prices. Any significant downturn in our customers markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and could harm our business. For example, in 2001, and with respect to Optoelectronics, the first quarter of 2002, the operating results of our Optoelectronics and Fluid Sciences segments were adversely affected by the downturn in the telecom, photography and semiconductor markets. Current economic conditions have caused a decrease in capital spending by many of our customers, which in turn has adversely affected our revenues and business. If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our products could become obsolete, and our operating results would suffer. We sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements, our products could become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. The success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors, including our ability to: accurately anticipate customer needs; innovate and develop new technologies and applications; successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner; price our products competitively and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time; and differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings. Many of our products are used by our customers to develop, test and manufacture their products. Therefore, we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers products. In developing any new product, we may be required to make a substantial investment before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product. If we fail to accurately foresee our customers needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue. In addition, some of our Life Sciences segments licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions, which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications. For example, some of our Life Sciences segments license agreements are limited to the field of life sciences research and exclude clinical diagnostics applications. Economic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our sales. Since we sell our products worldwide, our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Our revenue originating outside the United States represented 56% of our total sales from continuing operations in the fiscal year ended December 30, 2001. We anticipate that sales from international 29 Table of Contents operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue. In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities, employees and suppliers are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including: changes in foreign currency exchange rates; changes in a countrys or regions political or economic conditions, particularly in developing or emerging markets; longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions; trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; differing tax laws and changes in those laws; difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; differing labor laws and changes in those laws; differing protection of intellectual property and changes in that protection; and differing regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements. Fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to decline. Given the nature of the markets in which we participate, we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability. Changes in competitive, market and economic conditions may cause us to adjust our operations. A high proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to our significant sales, research and development and manufacturing costs. Thus, small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter. Factors that may affect our quarterly operating results and the market price of our common stock include: demand for and market acceptance of our products; competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices; adverse changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which we do business; adverse changes in industries, such as drug discovery, pharmaceutical research, telecommunications, semiconductors and electronics, on which we are particularly dependent; changes in the portions of our revenue represented by our various products and customers; delays or problems in the introduction of new products; our competitors announcement or introduction of new products, services or technological innovations; increased costs of raw materials or supplies; and changes in the volume or timing of product orders. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities for reasons frequently unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of specific companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We may not be able to successfully execute our acquisition strategy, integrate acquired businesses into our existing business, or make acquired businesses profitable. One of our strategies is to supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines. We may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions for many reasons, including: competition among buyers; the need for regulatory and other approvals; and the high valuations of businesses. 30 Table of Contents Some of the businesses we may seek to acquire may be marginally profitable or unprofitable. Accordingly, the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings. For these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability, we must improve their management, operations, products and market penetration. We may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations. To finance our acquisitions, we may have to raise additional funds, either through public or private financings. We may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on unfavorable terms. We face aggressive competition in many areas of our business; if we do not compete effectively, our business will be harmed. We encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business. We may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors. To remain competitive, we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products in a timely manner. We anticipate that we may have to adjust prices of many of our products to stay competitive. In addition, new competitors may emerge, and entire product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines. If we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the Food and Drug Administration and other governmental agencies, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties. Some of the products produced by our Life Sciences segment are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration and similar international agencies. These regulations govern a wide variety of product activities, from design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If we fail to comply with the FDAs regulations or those of similar international agencies, we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution. In addition, we could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution. Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. We compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal, state, local and foreign regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or the cost of producing these products. Obtaining and enforcing patent protection for our proprietary products, processes and technologies may be difficult and expensive; we may infringe intellectual property rights of third parties. Patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing and marketing new technologies and products is time consuming and expensive. We own many U.S. and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents to cover our products. We may not obtain issued patents from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. The claims allowed under any issued patents may not be broad enough to protect our technology. Third parties may seek to challenge, invalidate or circumvent issued patents owned by or licensed to us or claim that our products and operations infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights. In addition to our patents, we possess an array of unpatented proprietary technology and know how and we license intellectual property rights to and from third parties. The measures employed to protect this technology and these rights may not be adequate. Moreover, some licenses can be terminated or converted to non exclusive arrangements by the licensor if we fail to meet specified performance targets. We may incur significant expense in any legal proceedings to protect our proprietary rights or to defend infringement claims by third parties. In addition, claims of third parties against us could result in awards of substantial damages or court orders that could effectively prevent us from making, using or selling our products in the U.S. or abroad. 31 Table of Contents We have substantial existing debt and may incur additional debt in the future. As of December 30, 2001, we had $598 million in outstanding long term indebtedness. Our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of, interest on and other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. We may also obtain additional long term debt and working capital lines of credit and issue additional commercial paper to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage. Our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences, including: increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing; requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we compete; and placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources. A significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness bears interest at floating rates. As a result, our interest payment obligations on such indebtedness will increase if interest rates increase. Because a substantial portion of our assets is represented by intangibles, such as goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights and technology licenses, the failure to realize the full value of those assets could adversely affect our results of operations. As of December 30, 2001, our total assets included $1.5 billion of net intangible assets. Net intangible assets consist of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights and technology licenses, net of accumulated amortization. These assets have historically been amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives. In connection our adoption of SFAS No. 142, we will discontinue the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets from December 31, 2001. Instead, these items will be tested on an annual basis for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned. There can be no assurance that we will ultimately be able to realize the full value assigned to those assets. Any realization assessment that results in the write off of a significant portion of our net intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations. We may not be able to successfully dispose of our Fluid Sciences business. In October 2001, we approved a plan to sell our Fluid Sciences business. Our ability to successfully dispose of our Fluid Sciences business and the price we receive upon any such disposition will be affected by, among other things, the performance of the Fluid Sciences business and the ability of prospective buyers to obtain adequate financing. The ability of prospective buyers to obtain financing will depend on, among other things, the state of the capital markets. We cannot predict whether we will be able to successfully dispose of our Fluid Sciences business. 32 Table of Contents
