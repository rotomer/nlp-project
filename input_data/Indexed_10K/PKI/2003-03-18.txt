Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following management discussion and analysis contains forward looking information that you should read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements that we have included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. Actual results may differ materially from the plans, intentions or expectations we disclose in the forward looking statements we make. We have included important factors below under the heading Forward Looking Information and Factors Affecting Future Performance that we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements we make. Overview We are a leading provider of scientific instruments, consumables and services to the pharmaceutical, biomedical, environmental testing and general industrial markets. We design, manufacture, market and service products and systems within three business units: Life and Analytical Sciences. We are a leading provider of drug discovery, genetic screening, environmental and chemical analysis tools and instrumentation. Our Life and Analytical Sciences business unit comprises our Life Sciences reporting segment and our Analytical Instruments reporting segment. Optoelectronics. We provide a broad range of digital imaging, sensor and specialty lighting components used in the biomedical, consumer products and other specialty end markets. Our Optoelectronics business unit constitutes a single reporting segment. Fluid Sciences. We provide critical fluid control and containment solutions for highly demanding environments such as turbine engines and semiconductor fabrication facilities. Our Fluid Sciences business unit constitutes a single reporting segment. Formation of our Life and Analytical Sciences business During the fourth quarter of 2002, we combined our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments business units into a new integrated business named Life and Analytical Sciences. We combined our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses to improve our operational scale, which we believe will enable us to better serve our customers and more fully capitalize on the strengths of the businesses sales, service and research and development organizations. Our Life and Analytical Sciences business unit comprised two reporting segments for the years presented in this annual report on Form 10 K. In connection with the formation of our Life and Analytical Sciences business unit and expected near term pressure on capital expenditures within certain key end markets, we recorded a $26.0 million restructuring charge as a result of workforce reductions, facility closures and contract terminations that we expect to make. We expect many of these actions to occur during 2003. The combination of these businesses will require changes to our organizational structure, processes and systems over the next year. We are targeting annualized pre tax cost savings from the combination of between $30.0 million and $45.0 million beginning in 2004, with interim pre tax cost savings of between $12.0 million and $25.0 million in 2003. We cannot assure you that we will achieve any of these cost savings. 18 Table of Contents 2002 Refinancing Transactions In December 2002, we completed a series of related debt refinancing transactions for the purpose of extending our existing average debt maturities. These transactions included: Establishing a new senior secured credit facility comprising: a $315.0 million six year term loan and a $100.0 million five year revolving credit facility, the sale of $300.0 million principal amount of ten year 8 7/8% senior subordinated notes at a price of 99.173%, the repurchase of $205.6 million in aggregate accreted amount of our zero coupon debentures due August 2020, the repurchase of $110.3 million of our 6.8% notes due October 2005, the repayment of $60.3 million outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in March 2006 and the termination of both that facility and our unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in March 2003, and the payment of $30.0 million in satisfaction of all of our obligations under our Fremont, California operating lease. Following these transactions, at December 29, 2002, we had $186.5 million in aggregate accreted amount of outstanding zero coupon debentures and $4.7 million in outstanding 6.8% notes. At December 29, 2002, we had a total of $186.5 million of the proceeds from the sale of our 8 7/8% notes and our new term loan held in escrow to retire substantially all of the remaining zero coupon debentures. We may redeem some or all of the zero coupon debentures at any time on or after August 7, 2003 at a redemption price equal to the issue price plus the accrued original issue discount through the redemption date. Under the terms of our new senior credit facility, we are required to redeem in the third quarter of 2003 all of the zero coupon debentures outstanding at that time. Prior to August 7, 2003, we may from time to time repurchase outstanding zero coupon debentures through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Accordingly, the zero coupon debentures are shown as current liabilities on our December 29, 2002 balance sheet. On March 1, 2002, we redeemed all $118.2 million outstanding of our 9.375% notes due March 2007 for aggregate consideration of $123.5 million, resulting in a $5.5 million loss on the extinguishment. The indenture governing the 9.375% notes established the 104.688% redemption rate we paid in this transaction. We assumed the 9.375% notes as part of our November 2001 acquisition of Packard BioScience Company. Acquisitions and Divestitures Significant Acquisitions In November 2001, we completed our acquisition of Packard BioScience Company for a purchase price of approximately $764.0 million, primarily in the form of approximately 22 million shares of our common stock and our assumption of approximately $118.2 million in debt which we subsequently redeemed in March 2002. The acquisition extended our capabilities in automated liquid handling and sample preparation and strengthened our position as a global provider of comprehensive drug discovery tools and solutions. Packard generated sales of approximately $165.0 million for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2000. In July 2000, we completed our acquisition of NEN Life Sciences, Inc., a provider of state of the art drug discovery products, services, reagents and technologies to the life sciences industry, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $418.0 million. In connection with the acquisition, we paid approximately $350.0 million in cash and issued warrants to purchase approximately 600,000 shares of our common stock. In addition, we repaid approximately $50.0 million of outstanding indebtedness of NEN. We financed the 19 Table of Contents acquisition and repayment of the outstanding indebtedness with $410.0 million of commercial paper borrowings with a weighted average interest rate of 7%. We repaid these short term borrowings in August 2000 with proceeds from the issuance of our zero coupon convertible debentures. Significant Divestitures and Discontinued Operations During October 2001, our Board of Directors approved a plan to sell our Fluid Sciences business unit, at which time the business was reflected as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions. As of the third quarter of 2002, we had not completed the sale of the business due to external market conditions. As APB No. 30 affords one year for the completion of a disposition, we have reflected the Fluid Sciences business unit within our consolidated results from continuing operations for 2002 and adjusted all other periods reported in this annual report on Form 10 K to reflect this change. In June 2002, our Board of Directors approved a plan to shut down our Telecommunications Component business and a plan to sell our Entertainment Lighting business as part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities. Both businesses have been reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets, which we adopted as of the beginning of 2002. In June 2001, our Board of Directors approved a plan to sell our Security and Detection Systems business. In June 2002, we completed the sale of our Security and Detection Systems business to L 3 Communications. We received cash proceeds in this transaction of approximately $100.0 million. These proceeds are subject to a working capital adjustment, which we do not expect to be material. Our consolidated financial statements reflect the business and the associated effect of the disposition as a discontinued operation in accordance with APB No. 30. Consolidated Results of Continuing Operations Sales 2002 Compared to 2001. Sales for 2002 were $1,505.0 million versus $1,525.3 million during 2001, a decrease of $20.4 million or 1%. The decrease in year over year sales was due primarily to lost sales from divested businesses and declines in sales within key end markets, offset by the inclusion of Packards results for a full year and favorable changes in foreign exchange rates. Sales in 2001 included $93.3 million from businesses we have divested. Sales for 2001 would have been approximately $165.0 million higher had Packard been included for the first 10 months of the year. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales in 2002 by approximately $22.0 million. Key end markets contributing to the year over year decline in sales included pharmaceutical research and development markets within our Life Sciences reporting segment, several general analytical markets served by our Analytical Instruments reporting segment, the fiber optic test and ultra specialty lighting markets within our Optoelectronics reporting segment and the aerospace and semiconductor assembly markets within our Fluid Sciences reporting segment. These declines were partially offset by increased sales within the genetic screening and digital imaging markets and increased sales of consumables and related services. 2001 Compared to 2000. Sales for 2001 were $1,525.3 million versus $1,538.0 million during 2000, a decrease of $12.6 million or less than 1%. The decrease in year over year sales was due primarily to lost sales from divested businesses and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, offset to some extent by the inclusion of NENs results for a full year and Packards results for two months, as well as increased sales within our genetic screening and drug discovery tools businesses. Our divestiture of businesses in 2001 and 2000 resulted in a $63.9 million decline in sales during 2001, while foreign exchange rate changes reduced sales by approximately $30.0 million. 2001 sales included Packards results for two months, which totaled $40.0 million. 2000 sales would have been approximately $70.0 million higher had NEN been included for the first seven months of the year. 20 Table of Contents Cost of Sales 2002 Compared to 2001. Cost of sales for 2002 was $904.1 million versus $849.4 million for 2001, an increase of $54.7 million or 6%. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased to 60% in 2002 from 56% in 2001. The increase in cost of sales was due primarily to unabsorbed manufacturing expenses, unfavorable product mix from the sale of lower margin instruments and increases in material and labor costs. The unabsorbed manufacturing expenses resulted from decreased production and lower capacity utilization as a result of lower sales and lower inventory. The increase in cost of sales was offset by benefits from the reduction and relocation of facilities and headcount reductions. Included in 2002 cost of sales was a $17.2 million write off of inventory associated with the Optoelectronics reporting segment and $1.5 million related to the amortization of the write up associated with Packard inventory included as part of purchase accounting. Included in the cost of sales for 2001 were $7.4 million in costs associated with relocating manufacturing facilities to lower cost geographies and an additional $1.5 million related to the amortization of the write up of inventory from the Packard acquisition. 2001 Compared to 2000. Cost of sales was $849.4 million for 2001 versus $892.4 million during 2000, a decrease of $43.0 million or 5%. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased to 56% in 2001 from 58% during 2000. The decrease in cost of sales was due primarily to lower headcount, the reduction and relocation of facilities, and strategic moves into higher margin businesses. Included in 2001 cost of sales were $7.4 million from the cost of relocating manufacturing facilities to lower cost geographies and $1.5 million related to the amortization of the write up of Packard inventory included as part of purchase accounting. Included in 2000 cost of sales were $1.8 million in charges associated with reorganization activities and $1.8 million from the write up of inventory acquired as part of the NEN acquisition. Research and Development Expenses 2002 Compared to 2001. Research and development expenses for 2002 were $86.5 million versus $80.1 million in 2001, an increase of $6.4 million or 8%. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses increased to 6% in 2002 from 5% in 2001, principally as a result of the inclusion of spending associated with the Packard operations. We directed research and development efforts during both 2002 and 2001 primarily toward drug discovery tools and genetic screening applications as well as biopharmaceutical end markets within the Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments reporting segments and biomedical end markets within the Optoelectronics reporting segment. We expect research and development to continue to approximate historical levels with future efforts directed principally in the health sciences end markets. 2001 Compared to 2000. Research and development expenses for 2001 were $80.1 million versus $76.1 million in 2000, an increase of $4.0 million or 5%. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses were 5% in both 2001 and 2000. We directed research and development efforts during 2001 primarily toward drug discovery tools and genetic screening applications, as well as biopharmaceutical end markets within the Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments reporting segments and biomedical end markets within the Optoelectronics reporting segment. We directed research and development efforts during 2000 primarily toward drug discovery tools, genetic screening applications and pharmaceutical end markets within the Life Sciences reporting segment. In Process Research and Development Expenses In process research and development expenses for 2001 were $71.5 million and consisted of $69.0 million from our acquisition of Packard within our Life Sciences reporting segment and $2.5 million from our acquisition of Applied Surface Technology within our Fluid Sciences reporting segment. In process research and development expenses for 2000 were $24.3 million from our acquisition of NEN within our Life Sciences reporting segment. In all instances, we deemed the in process research and development to have no future alternative use at the date of purchase. 21 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2002 Compared to 2001. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2002 were $431.3 million versus $376.9 million for 2001, an increase of $54.4 million or 14%. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 29% in 2002 from 25% in 2001. The increase resulted from unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, the inclusion of costs associated with Packard operations and increased investments made in the sales and marketing function in 2002. Our selling, general and administrative expenses for 2002 included $3.3 million associated with the integration of Packard into the Life Sciences reporting segment, while 2001 included $7.5 million for incentive payments associated with acquisitions and divestitures, $6.0 million in other acquisition related charges and $4.2 million for costs of integrating administrative functions for each of our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments reporting segments and relocating facilities to lower cost geographies. 2001 Compared to 2000. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2001 were $376.9 million versus $364.5 million for 2000, an increase of $12.4 million or 3%. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 25% in 2001 from 24% in 2000. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from the inclusion of expenses associated with Packards operations, investments made in our sales and marketing function, offset by changes in foreign exchange rates. The results from 2001 included charges of $7.5 million for incentive payments associated with acquisitions and divestitures, $6.0 million in other acquisition related charges and $4.2 million in charges incurred in the integration of administrative functions in each of the Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments reporting segments and relocating facilities to lower cost geographies. The results from 2000 included charges of $5.4 million in similar integration charges mainly attributable to NEN. Restructuring Charges, Net 2002 Compared to 2001. Restructuring charges, net for 2002 were $35.7 million versus $7.0 million during 2001. Our restructuring charges in 2002 included a $26.0 million charge taken in connection with our decision to combine our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses into a single business Life and Analytical Sciences. This charge consisted of approximately $20.8 million in severance payments, $3.5 million in lease cancellation payments and $1.7 million of asset writedowns. In addition, during 2002, we took $9.2 million in net charges associated with workforce reductions and manufacturing facility closures stemming primarily from relocating to lower cost geographies and reduction of our fixed costs. Our net restructuring charges in 2001 of $7.0 million related primarily to employee separation costs associated with the consolidation of European general and managerial functions within both our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments reporting segments. 2001 Compared to 2000. Restructuring charges, net for 2001 were $7.0 million versus $6.3 million in 2000. Our restructuring charges in 2001 related primarily to employee separation costs associated with the consolidation of European general and managerial functions within both our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments reporting segments. Restructuring charges in 2000 related to the consolidation of offices and manufacturing facilities, including associated employee separation costs, as well as the disposal of excess capacity. The following table summarizes our restructuring accrual balances and related activity during 2002 and 2001: Balance at Amounts paid Changes in 2001 Balance at Amounts paid Changes in 2002 Balance at 12/31/2000 and incurred Estimates Charges 12/30/2001 and incurred Estimates Charges 12/29/2002 Existing plans $ 21,044 $ (16,904 ) $ (2,189 ) $ $ 1,951 $ (1,022 ) $ (929 ) $ $ 2001 plan (1,603 ) 9,189 7,586 (4,891 ) 1,380 4,075 2002 plan (7,260 ) 35,247 27,987 Total $ 21,044 $ (18,507 ) $ (2,189 ) $ 9,189 $ 9,537 $ (13,173 ) $ 451 $ 35,247 $ 32,062 22 Table of Contents We expect to settle the majority of the actions remaining at December 29, 2002 in 2003, with the exception of our European pension and severance obligations and a number of lease obligations which may extend beyond 2003. We expect all cash payments to be made using available cash. Gains on Dispositions 2002 Compared to 2001. Dispositions resulted in a net gain of $5.2 million in 2002 versus a net gain of $33.2 million in 2001. Gains on dispositions in 2002 included $4.4 million from sales of facilities and $0.8 million from post closing adjustments relating to the sale of our Instruments for Research and Applied Sciences business, formerly part of our Analytical Instruments reporting segment. Gains on dispositions in 2001 included $32.3 million from the sale of our Instruments for Research and Applied Sciences business and $7.2 million from dispositions within our Optoelectronics and Analytical Instruments reporting segments, offset by a $6.3 million loss on the sale of our Voltarc Technologies business, formerly part of our Optoelectronics reporting segment. 2001 Compared to 2000. Dispositions resulted in a net gain of $33.2 million for 2001 versus a net gain of $37.7 million in 2000. The gain on dispositions in 2001 included $32.3 million from the sale of our Instruments for Research and Applied Sciences business and $7.2 million from dispositions in our Optoelectronics and Analytical Instruments reporting segments, offset by the $6.3 million loss from the sale of our Voltarc Technologies business. The gain on dispositions in 2000 included approximately $16.7 million on the sale of buildings, approximately $10.0 million on the disposition of our Berthold business, $7.2 million from other dispositions, primarily within the Optoelectronics reporting segment, and $2.5 million previously deferred from prior dispositions recognized as a result of the resolution of outstanding contingent liabilities. Amortization of Intangible Assets 2002 Compared to 2001. Amortization of intangible assets for 2002 was $28.3 million versus $43.9 million for 2001, a decrease of $15.6 million or 36%. Of the 2001 amortization expense, $27.1 million related to the amortization of goodwill in 2001. We discontinued the amortization of goodwill with our adoption of SFAS No. 142 at the beginning of 2002. The year over year increase in intangible asset amortization was the result of the amortization on intangible assets other than goodwill that arose from the acquisition of Packard. 2001 Compared to 2000. Amortization of intangible assets for 2001 was $43.9 million versus $32.3 million for 2000, an increase of $11.6 million or 36%. Within these amounts, the amortization of goodwill accounted for $27.1 million in 2001 and $22.7 million in 2000. The increase reflects a full year of amortization from the goodwill and intangible assets associated with our acquisition of NEN completed in July 2000 and to a lesser extent, the amortization of intangible assets in 2001 recorded as part of our acquisition of Packard. Other Expense, Net 2002 Compared to 2001. Other expense, net for 2002 was $32.9 million versus $29.2 million for 2001, an increase of $3.7 million or 13%. The increase in other expense, net was due primarily to $8.7 million in premiums, fees and write offs of unamortized costs resulting from the early extinguishment of debt during 2002, $2.5 million in transaction costs incurred as part of the proposed sale of the Fluid Sciences business, a $2.0 million loss on an equity investment versus net gains of $4.3 million in 2001, and other items totaling $4.1 million. Offsetting these amounts were $8.4 million in gains realized on the repurchase of a portion of the zero coupon convertible debentures, a year over year decline in net interest expense of $5.1 million and a $4.4 million gain realized on the termination of a fixed to variable interest rate swap as a result of the tender offer for our 6.8% notes. The $8.7 million in charges associated with the early extinguishment of debt were comprised of a $5.5 million call premium paid on the extinguishment of the Packard debt called in the first quarter of 2002 and $3.2 million in fees and previously capitalized issuance costs written off in connection with our December 2002 debt refinancing transactions. A decline in interest expense to $32.1 million in 2002 from $37.7 million in 2001 was the result of decreased levels of indebtedness and lower associated interest rates period over period. We expect interest expense in 2003 to increase due to the debt we raised as part of our 2002 debt refinancing transactions. 23 Table of Contents 2001 Compared to 2000. Other expense, net for 2001 was $29.2 million versus $33.1 million in 2000, a decrease of $3.9 million or 12%. Other expense, net for 2001 included gains realized on the sale of investments of $4.3 million. The results from 2000 included similar gains of $0.9 million. Interest expense for 2001 of $37.7 million versus $37.4 million in 2000 was the result of higher debt levels due to acquisition activity, offset by lower borrowing costs. The remaining impact in each of the years was attributable to foreign exchange losses. Provision/ Benefit for Income Taxes 2002 Compared to 2001. The benefit for income taxes for 2002 was $4.4 million versus a provision of $59.1 million during 2001. Our 2002 effective tax rate of 52% is primarily attributable to the geographic income patterns, reduced profitability, permanent tax differences and use of foreign tax credits in the United States. Our 2001 effective tax rate of 59% was increased by the tax treatment of in process research and development charges associated with our Packard acquisition, which were not deductible for tax purposes. Absent these items, we would expect our effective tax rate to approximate 35%. 2001 Compared to 2000. The provision for income taxes was $59.1 million in 2001 versus $56.4 million in 2000. Our 2001 tax rate was increased by the tax treatment of in process research and development charges associated with the Packard acquisition, which were not deductible for tax purposes. Our 2000 effective tax rate of 38% was impacted to a lesser extent by similar in process research and development charges. Discontinued Operations In June 2002, we sold our Security and Detection Systems business to L 3 Communications. We received cash proceeds in this transaction of approximately $100.0 million at closing. The proceeds are subject to a working capital adjustment, which we do not expect to be material. We have reflected the business and the associated impact of the disposition as a discontinued operation within our consolidated financial statements in accordance with APB No. 30. For the portion of 2002 prior to being sold, our Security and Detection Systems business had sales of $108.2 million. Also in June 2002, our Board of Directors approved a plan to shut down our Telecommunications Component business and a plan to sell our Entertainment Lighting business as part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities. We have reflected both businesses as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 144. As of June 30, 2002, we had shut down our Telecommunications Component business. For 2002, our Telecommunications Component business had sales of $1.7 million and our Entertainment Lighting business had sales of $10.3 million. Effect of Accounting Change We adopted SFAS No. 142 as of the beginning of fiscal 2002 and have accordingly ceased the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. During the second quarter of 2002, we completed our transitional implementation of the impairment of testing provisions of SFAS No. 142, which resulted in a $117.8 million after tax charge for goodwill associated with the lighting reporting unit within the Optoelectronics business unit. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, we have taken this charge as the effect of an accounting change as of the beginning of fiscal 2002. Contingencies We are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party for certain waste disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. We have accrued $7.1 million as of December 29, 2002, representing managements estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters. This amount is not discounted and does not reflect any recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. These cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential 24 Table of Contents remedies, possible joint and several liability, the timeframe over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party, management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. We expect that such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. While it is possible that a material loss exceeding the amounts recorded may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from the amounts recorded. We and certain of our officers have been named as defendants in a class action lawsuit in which the plaintiffs have alleged various statements made by us were misleading with respect to our prospects and future operating results. We believe we have meritorious defenses to the lawsuits and we intend to contest the actions vigorously. We are currently unable, however, to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss, if any, that may result from the resolution of these matters. Reporting Segment Results of Continuing Operations We report our continuing operations as four reporting segments, reflecting our management methodology and structure. Our Security and Detection Systems business, previously reported as part of our Analytical Instruments reporting segment, and our Telecommunications Component business and Entertainment Lighting business, previously reported as part of our Optoelectronics reporting segment, have been reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies of our reporting segments are the same as those described in the footnotes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We evaluate performance based on profitability of the respective reporting segments. The discussion that follows is a summary analysis of the primary changes in operating results by reporting segment for 2002 versus 2001 and for 2001 versus 2000. Life Sciences 2002 Compared to 2001. Sales for 2002 were $494.3 million versus $346.1 million in 2001, an increase of $148.2 million or 43%. Year over year sales increased due primarily to the timing of the Packard acquisition, increased sales in our genetic screening business and increased sales in consumables and services. These increases were offset in part by a decline in sales from drug discovery instruments due to challenges within the pharmaceutical research and development end markets. Sales in 2001 would have been approximately $165.0 million higher had the results from Packard been included for the first ten months of the year. Operating profit for 2002 was $8.0 million versus a loss of $46.4 million in 2001. The year over year increase in operating profit was primarily attributable to the inclusion of $21.7 million in charges in 2002 versus $86.1 million in charges during 2001 principally associated with acquisitions and restructurings. The operating profit for 2002 included $16.9 million in net restructuring charges, including a $12.9 million charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2002 for severance and facility closure actions stemming from the combination of our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses into a single business Life and Analytical Sciences. Additionally, the operating profit from 2002 included $3.3 million in costs incurred during the first quarter of 2002 as a result of integration efforts and $1.5 million from the amortization of inventory acquired as part of our acquisition of Packard. The results from 2001 included a $69.0 million charge associated with acquired in process research and development, $6.0 million in integration related charges, $3.4 million of net restructuring charges, a $3.3 million integration incentive associated with the Packard acquisition, a net $2.9 million in other charges which include the settlement of pre acquisition contingencies from a prior acquisition and a $1.5 million charge for the revaluation of acquired inventory. Lower production volumes, which led to lower utilization of production capacity, and the inclusion of Packard for the full year decreased operating profit in 2002. Goodwill and intangible asset amortization expenses were $21.2 million for 2002 and $23.7 million for 2001. 25 Table of Contents 2001 Compared to 2000. Sales for 2001 were $346.1 million versus $221.4 million for 2000, an increase of $124.7 million or 56%. The timing of our Packard and NEN acquisitions contributed to the increased sales for 2001. Sales for 2001 included two months of results from Packard, which totaled $40.0 million. Sales for 2000 would have been approximately $70.0 million higher had NEN been included for the first seven months of the year. The year over year increase in sales was also attributable to increased sales in our drug discovery tools and genetic screening businesses and increased sales in related consumables resulting from new product introductions and geographic expansions. Operating loss for 2001 was $46.4 million versus a loss of $3.6 million for 2000. The year over year increase in operating loss was primarily attributable to the inclusion of $86.1 million in charges during 2001 versus $33.5 million in charges during 2000. The results from 2001 included a $69.0 million charge associated with acquired in process research and development, $6.0 million in integration related charges, $3.4 million of net restructuring charges, a $3.3 million integration incentive associated with our Packard acquisition, a net $2.9 million in other charges which include the settlement of preacquisition contingencies from a prior acquisition and a $1.5 million charge for the revaluation of acquired inventory. 2000 operating profit included a $24.3 million charge for acquired in process research and development, $3.9 million in restructuring charges, $3.5 million in integration related charges associated with our NEN acquisition and a $1.8 million charge for the revaluation of acquired inventory. Sales of higher margin products and the benefit of lower costs resulting from the consolidation of manufacturing and administrative sites reduced the operating loss in 2001. Goodwill and intangible asset amortization expenses were $23.7 million for 2001 and $9.3 million for 2000. Analytical Instruments 2002 Compared to 2001. Sales for 2002 were $497.4 million versus $568.4 million for 2001, a decrease of $71.0 million or 12%. The year over year decrease was due primarily to business divestitures and declines in sales due to weakness in the general analytical and pharmaceutical end markets. These declines were offset by favorable changes in foreign exchange rates and by increased sales of consumables and services. Sales for 2001 included $47.4 million in sales from our Instruments for Research and Applied Science business which we divested in the fourth quarter of 2001. Operating profit for 2002 was $19.4 million versus $77.8 million for 2001, a decrease of $58.3 million or 75%. The year over year decrease in operating profit was due primarily to the inclusion of $9.4 million in charges during 2002 versus $16.1 million in net gains during 2001, as well as lower sales due to divested businesses, volume declines and associated lower utilization of production capacity. Operating profit for 2002 included $14.6 million in net restructuring charges, of which $13.1 million was taken in the fourth quarter in connection with our decision to combine our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses, as well as $5.2 million in gains resulting from the final settlement of the disposition of property and businesses divested in prior years. Operating profit for 2001 included $32.1 million in gains realized on the disposal of businesses, $8.4 million in reorganization charges associated with relocations to lower cost geographies, consolidation of European finance functions and relocations of administrative and manufacturing facilities, a restructuring charge of $5.3 million, and a $2.3 million incentive payment associated with the successful completion of divestitures. Goodwill and intangible asset amortization expense was $4.4 million in 2002 and $10.5 million in 2001. 2001 Compared to 2000. Sales for 2001 were $568.4 million versus $617.7 million for 2000, a decrease of $49.3 million or 8%. The year over year decrease was due primarily to the disposition of our Berthold business in late 2000, which had sales of approximately $30.0 million in the year 2000. Operating profit for 2001 was $77.8 million versus $56.1 million in 2000, an increase of $21.7 million or 39%. The year over year increase in operating profit was due primarily to productivity enhancements and cost containment actions. Results from 2001 included $32.1 million in gains realized on the disposal of businesses, $8.4 million in reorganization related charges associated with relocations to lower cost geographies, consolidation of European finance functions and relocations of administrative and manufacturing facilities, a restructuring charge of $5.3 million and a $2.3 million incentive payment associated with the successful completion of 26 Table of Contents the divestitures. Operating profit for 2000 included a $15.2 million gain from the sale of businesses. Goodwill and intangible asset amortization was $10.5 million for 2001 and $13.5 million for 2000. Optoelectronics 2002 Compared to 2001. Sales for 2002 were $323.8 million versus $380.2 million for 2001, a decrease of $56.4 million or 15%. The decrease in sales in 2002 was due primarily to the impact of divested businesses and product lines which accounted for $39.4 million in sales for 2001 and continued weakness in the semiconductor market which more than offset growth in sales in the digital imaging and sensors end markets. Operating loss for 2002 was $4.0 million versus an operating profit of $51.3 million for 2001. The year over year decline in operating profit was due primarily to a decline in sales due in part to divestitures, and lower capacity utilization leading to unabsorbed manufacturing expenses, partially offset by headcount reductions and the reduction and relocation of facilities. 2002 operating loss included an inventory write down of $17.2 million which was taken during the first quarter of 2002 as the result of expected lower sales volumes in several key markets. Additionally, 2002 operating loss included $3.7 million in net restructuring charges related to facility closures and workforce reduction actions. 2001 operating profit included a $5.5 million net loss realized on the disposal of businesses, reorganization related charges of $4.9 million associated with our further expansion and relocation into lower cost manufacturing locations, a $1.8 million retention incentive charge, and $3.0 million in other net credits related to resolution of outstanding liabilities. Goodwill and intangible asset amortization was $1.3 million for 2002 and $7.0 million for 2001. 2001 Compared to 2000. Sales for 2001 were $380.2 million versus $447.1 million for 2000, a decrease of $66.9 million or 15%. The decrease in sales in 2001 was due primarily to businesses and product lines divested during 2000 and 2001, which accounted for $33.6 million more in sales in 2000 than they did in 2001. The decrease in sales also resulted from decreased sales in the photography and semiconductor markets, offset by an increase in sales to the digital imaging and sensors markets. Operating profit for 2001 was $51.3 million versus $96.1 million for 2000, a decrease of $44.9 million or 47%. The year over year decline in operating profit was attributable to the $9.2 million in charges during 2001 versus $15.4 million in net gains during 2000 and lower sales discussed above. The 2001 operating profit included a $5.5 million net loss realized on the disposal of businesses, reorganization related charges of $4.9 million associated with our further expansion and relocation into lower cost manufacturing locations, restructuring and other net credits of $3.0 million mainly related to previously unresolved potential liabilities and a $1.8 million retention incentive. The 2000 operating profit included gains of $11.7 million from the sale of a building, $6.7 million from the disposition of businesses and other net credits of $3.0 million. Goodwill and intangible amortization was $7.0 million for both years. Fluid Sciences 2002 Compared to 2001. Sales for 2002 were $189.5 million versus $230.6 million for 2001, a decrease of $41.1 million or 18%. The decrease in sales was due primarily to weakness in the semiconductor assembly, fluid testing and aerospace end markets, offset by growth in the power generation end markets. The decline in sales was also a result of the divestiture of two aerospace businesses which contributed $6.6 million during 2001. Operating profit for 2002 was $17.5 million versus $57.3 million for 2001, a decrease of $39.8 million or 69%. The decrease in operating profit was due primarily to the decline in sales previously discussed and the cost of relocating manufacturing to lower cost geographies and, to a lesser extent, the impact of $2.1 million in net one time gains during 2001. The 2001 operating profit included $6.6 million in gains from the sale of two businesses during the first half of 2001, $2.5 million in reversals of previously announced restructuring charges, and $2.1 million in restructuring related charges. Goodwill and intangible amortization was $1.5 million for 2002 and $2.7 million for 2001. 2001 Compared to 2000. Sales for 2001 were $230.6 million versus $251.8 million for 2000, a decrease of $21.1 million or 8%. The decrease in sales in 2001 as compared to 2000 was due primarily to a decline in 27 Table of Contents sales to the semiconductor assembly markets, partially offset by an increase in sales to the aerospace fluid testing and power generation markets. Operating profit for 2001 was $57.3 million versus $45.1 million in 2000, an increase of $12.2 million or 27%. The year over year increase in operating profit resulted from increased sales of higher margin products to the aerospace market and the inclusion of $6.6 million in one time gains in 2001. Operating profit for 2001 included gains of $6.6 million associated with the sale of two businesses disposed of during 2001, $2.5 million in reversals of previously announced restructuring charges, and $2.1 million in restructuring related charges. Operating profit for 2000 included $2.4 million in restructuring charges and $0.4 million in restructuring related charges, offset by $2.8 million in gains from dispositions. Goodwill and intangible asset amortization was $2.7 million in 2001 and $2.5 million in 2000. Liquidity and Capital Resources We require cash to pay our operating expenses, make capital expenditures and service our debt and other long term liabilities. Our principal sources of funds are from our operations and the capital markets, particularly the debt markets. In the near term, we anticipate that our operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures and interest payments on our debt. In the long term, we expect to use internally generated funds and external sources to satisfy our debt and other long term liabilities. Principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include: deterioration of sales due to weakness in several markets in which we sell our products and services, changes in our working capital requirements, and our ability to successfully repatriate cash balances from our foreign subsidiaries for use in settling domestic obligations. Principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include: financial covenants contained in our new borrowings, a ratings downgrade that would limit our ability to borrow under our accounts receivable facility and our overall access to the corporate debt market, and volatility in the markets for corporate debt. Cash Flows Fiscal Year 2002 Operating Activities. Net cash generated by continuing operations operating activities was $108.2 million in 2002. Contributing to the generation of cash from operating activities during 2002 was a decrease in working capital, which includes accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable, of $97.4 million. The working capital decrease during 2002 reflects improved working capital management as well as a $17.2 million inventory adjustment within our Optoelectronics reporting segment, offset by a net decrease of $8.0 million in proceeds from our receivable securitization program. We decreased inventory levels by $48.2 million during 2002, including the $17.2 million Optoelectronics inventory adjustment, on lower sales volume. Non cash items contributing to the net loss during 2002 were $76.6 million in depreciation and amortization charges, $19.5 million in amortization of deferred debt issuance costs, accretion of discounts and net gains from extinguishment of debt, $3.2 million in non cash restructuring actions, and $2.6 million of stock based compensation. Offsetting these amounts were $35.4 million in non cash benefits from deferred taxes and $3.2 million in net gains from dispositions and sales of investments. Cash outlays for accrued expenses, restructuring and other assets and liabilities totaled $49.2 million during 2002, primarily as the result of payments toward restructuring plans and the settlement of payroll, professional fees, hedging and other obligations. 28 Table of Contents Investing Activities. In 2002, our investing activities used $150.8 million of cash, including our use of $186.5 million of cash held in escrow to retire substantially all of our outstanding indebtedness under the zero coupon convertible debentures which were not tendered as part of our 2002 refinancing transactions. In 2002, we made capital expenditures of $37.8 million mainly in the areas of tooling and process improvement for the drug discovery tools business and other products for biopharmaceutical applications. We also expended $30.0 million in the settlement of a lease obligation on our Fremont, California facility resulting in our purchase of this facility. Net proceeds from the dispositions of businesses and fixed assets during 2002 of $126.0 million were primarily from approximately $96.2 million in net proceeds received from the sale of our Security and Detection Systems business during the second quarter of 2002 and approximately $29.8 million associated with the sale of facilities. Cash outflows of $22.5 million associated with acquisitions related primarily to the settlement of liabilities incurred in connection with the Packard acquisition. Financing Activities. In 2002, we generated $30.7 million of net cash from financing activities. Our debt levels increased by $81.4 million to $805.5 million at December 29, 2002. Included in this amount is $186.5 million of our outstanding indebtedness under the zero coupon convertible debentures which were not tendered as part of our 2002 refinancing transactions for which we had $186.5 million of cash held in escrow at December 29, 2002 for the purpose of retiring. After consideration of the cash held in escrow, our debt decreased by $105.1 million. Because we anticipate that the cash held in escrow will be used to repurchase outstanding zero coupon debentures in 2003, we believe that an understanding of our debt levels after consideration of the escrow provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition. Reductions in debt included $110.3 million of 2005 notes and $304.3 million of zero coupon convertible debentures, both of which we repurchased as part of our 2002 debt refinancing transactions. Debt reductions in 2002 also included $118.2 million of 9.375% senior subordinated ten year notes issued by Packard in March 1997, which we repurchased at a rate of 104.688%, and $5.5 million in other credit facilities we paid down during 2002. Offsetting these reductions was our December 2002 issuance of senior subordinated notes which generated proceeds of $297.5 million and our establishment of a term loan which generated proceeds of $315.0 million. In connection with these debt issuances and terminations, we paid $15.8 million in fees during 2002. We also paid $35.3 million in dividends and received net cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and participation in our employee stock purchase plan of $13.1 million in 2002. Fiscal Year 2001 Operating Activities. Net cash provided by continuing operations operating activities was $145.3 million in 2001. Non cash items impacting net income during 2001 were depreciation and amortization of $88.5 million, an in process research and development charge of $71.5 million, $20.8 million in deferred debt issuance and accretion of discount costs, $5.6 million in changes of deferred tax balances and $3.5 million stock based compensation charges offset by $40.7 million in gains on dispositions and sale of investments, net and a $1.8 million non cash restructuring credit. An increase in working capital resulted in a net use of $16.8 million during 2001. Included in the working capital change for 2001 was a $35.5 million increase in inventory due to lower than planned sales in a number of the reporting segments, primarily in our Optoelectronics reporting segment, and inventory safety stock for production. This was partially offset by a $18.2 million reduction in accounts receivable which was net of $37.0 million from the receivable securitization program discussed below. Also impacting cash provided by operating activities during 2001 was a $41.9 million reduction in accrued expenses, restructuring and other assets and liabilities. Offsetting these amounts was $15.0 million from the tax benefit from the exercise of common stock options. Investing Activities. In 2001, we generated $76.7 million of net cash from investing activities. Cash flow from the sale of businesses, primarily Instruments for Research and Applied Science and Voltarc, was $73.5 million and from the monetization of assets was $61.2 million for 2001. Monetization of assets consisted of the sale and the sale leaseback of facilities and equipment. Costs of acquisitions, net of cash acquired, generated $34.1 million of cash in 2001, principally from the Packard acquisition. Capital expenditures were $94.4 million in 2001, and related in large part to equipment, process improvement and maintenance associated with increasing productivity and capacity within the business of drug discovery tools and other biomedical applications, as well as leasehold improvements in a number of manufacturing facilities. 29 Table of Contents Financing Activities. In 2001, we used $170.8 million of net cash from financing activities. Cash flows generated through operating and investing activities, along with net proceeds of $37.7 million from the exercise of stock options, were used in part to reduce short term commercial paper borrowings by $177.0 million during 2001. Cash utilized in the payment of dividends to common stockholders totaled $28.3 million during 2001. Borrowing Arrangements Senior Secured Credit Facility. In December 2002, we entered into a new senior credit facility. This facility comprises a six year term loan in the amount of $315.0 million and a $100.0 million five year revolving credit facility. This credit facility is secured primarily by a substantial portion of our and our subsidiaries domestic assets. The interest rates under the senior credit facility applicable to the term loan and to the revolving credit facility are determined as a margin over either the Eurodollar rate or the base rate. The base rate is the higher of (1) the corporate base rate announced from time to time by Bank of America, N.A. and (2) the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points. The applicable margin for the term loan is 400 basis points for the Eurodollar rate and 300 basis points for the base rate. The applicable margin for the revolving credit facility is determined based upon our leverage ratio for the prior quarter. We may allocate all or a portion of our indebtedness under the senior credit facility to interest based upon the margin over the Eurodollar rate or the base rate. At December 29, 2002, the Eurodollar rate was approximately 140 basis points and the base rate was 425 basis points. The term loan is repayable in nominal quarterly installments until December 2007, and thereafter in four equal quarterly installments until December 2008. The revolving credit facility is available to us through December 2007 for our working capital needs. At December 29, 2002, we had no outstanding principal balance under the revolving credit facility. Our senior credit facility contains covenants that require us to maintain specific financial ratios, including: a minimum interest coverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a maximum senior leverage ratio, and a maximum total leverage ratio. As of December 29, 2002, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. 8 7/8% Notes. In December 2002, we issued and sold ten year senior subordinated notes at a rate of 8 7/8% with a face value of $300.0 million. We received $297.5 million in gross proceeds from the issuance. Deferred issuance costs of $7.0 million were recorded as a non current asset. The debt, which matures in January 2013, is unsecured, but is guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries. Interest on our 8 7/8% notes is payable semi annually on January 15 and July 15, beginning July 15, 2003. If a change of control occurs, each holder of 8 7/8% notes may require us to repurchase some or all of its notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued interest. Before January 15, 2006, we may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of our 8 7/8% notes with the net proceeds of specified public equity offerings at 108.875% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued interest, if at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes remains outstanding after the redemption. We may redeem some or all of our 8 7/8% notes at any time on or after January 15, 2008, at a redemption price of 104.438%. The redemption price decreases to 102.958% on January 15, 2009, to 101.479% on January 15, 2010 and to 100% on January 15, 2011. The debt is subordinated to our new senior credit facility and other existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness. Our 8 7/8% notes contain financial and other covenants. Most of these covenants terminate if the notes obtain an investment grade rating by Standard & Poors Rating Services and Moodys Investors Service. At December 29, 2002, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures. In August 2000, we sold zero coupon convertible debentures with an aggregate purchase price of $460.0 million. We used the offerings net proceeds of approximately $448.0 million to repay a portion of our commercial paper borrowings, which had been increased temporarily 30 Table of Contents to finance the NEN acquisition. The zero coupon convertible debentures are due August 2020 and were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%. During 2002, we repurchased $106.5 million of our zero coupon convertible debentures in open market transactions, recognizing a gain of $8.4 million in the process. As part of our 2002 debt refinancing transactions, we commenced an offer to purchase any and all of our existing zero coupon convertible debentures. As of December 29, 2002, we had completed the tender offer and repurchased $205.6 million in aggregate accreted amount of the issue. The remaining $186.5 million in aggregate accreted amount at December 29, 2002 will either be repurchased prior to the first available call date of August 3, 2003, through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, or called by us thereafter. Under the terms of our new senior credit facility, we are required to redeem all of the zero coupon debentures remaining outstanding on August 7, 2003. Accordingly, our zero coupon debentures are shown as current liabilities on our December 29, 2002 Consolidated Balance Sheet. In December 2002, we deposited $186.5 million in escrow to retire substantially all our outstanding zero coupon debentures. Assuming all of the zero coupon debentures outstanding at December 29, 2002 remain outstanding at August 7, 2003, our redemption of those zero coupon debentures would require $190.5 million on that date. We expect to use available cash to satisfy our obligations on the zero coupon debentures in excess of the escrow amount. Through March 11, 2003, we have repurchased $32.5 million of accreted value of our outstanding zero coupon debentures in open market transactions using a portion of the funds held in escrow. 6.8% Notes. In October 1995, we issued $115.0 million in notes bearing an interest rate of 6.8% and maturing in 2005. Interest on the 6.8% notes is payable semi annually on April 15 and October 15. During the fourth quarter of 2001, the fixed rate on these notes was swapped to a floating rate using a swap instrument which reset semi annually in arrears based upon six month USD LIBOR. As part of our 2002 debt refinancing transactions, we initiated a tender offer for all of the outstanding 6.8% notes. As of December 29, 2002, we had completed the tender offer and repurchased all but $4.7 million of these notes. We paid consent payments pursuant to a consent solicitation we made concurrently with the tender offer. The consent solicitation eliminated substantially all of the restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing our 6.8% notes. We may from time to time repurchase outstanding 6.8% notes through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. In connection with this tender offer, we extinguished the swap arrangement and recorded a $4.4 million gain on the extinguishment. Packard Notes. In November 2001, we completed our acquisition of Packard and assumed approximately $118.2 million of senior subordinated ten year notes issued in March 1997. We redeemed the notes on March 1, 2002 at a rate of 104.688% in accordance with the indenture dated as of March 4, 1997. As such, this amount was reclassified to short term on our December 30, 2001 balance sheet for presentation purposes. In connection with this redemption, we realized a loss of $5.5 million as a result of the call premium paid to the holders of the notes. Receivables Securitization Facility In December 2001, we established a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary to purchase, on a revolving basis, certain of our accounts receivable balances and simultaneously sell an undivided interest in this pool of receivables to a financial institution. As collections reduce the accounts receivable balances, new receivables are sold. Our consolidated subsidiary retains the risk of credit loss on the receivables. Under the terms of this arrangement, we retain collection and administrative responsibilities for the balances. The accounts receivable securitization facility provides for up to $51.0 million in accounts receivable funding. The facility has an effective interest rate of approximately LIBOR plus 140 basis points as of December 29, 2002. Amounts funded by the counterparty under this facility were $29.0 million at December 29, 2002 and $37.0 million at December 30, 2001. The facility includes conditions that require us to maintain a senior unsecured credit rating of BB or above, as defined by Standard & Poors Rating Services, and Ba2 or above, as defined by Moodys Investors Service. At December 29, 2002, we had a senior unsecured credit rating of BB+ with a stable outlook from Standard & Poors Rating Services, and of Ba2 with a stable outlook from Moodys Investors Service. In January 2003, we entered into an agreement to extend the term of our accounts receivable securitization facility to January 31, 2004. 31 Table of Contents Dividends Our Board of Directors declared regular quarterly cash dividends of seven cents per share in each quarter of 2002 and 2001, resulting in an annual dividend rate of 28 cents per share. Our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our outstanding 8 7/8% senior subordinated notes contain restrictions that may limit our ability to pay our regular cash dividend. Stock Split At our 2001 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders approved an increase in the number of authorized shares of our common stock from 100,000,000 shares to 300,000,000 shares. On April 24, 2001, our Board of Directors approved a two for one stock split. The stock split has been retroactively reflected in this annual report on Form 10 K. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 29, 2002, and the effects we expect those obligations to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods. Zero Coupon 6.8% 8.875% Sr. Convertible Operating Unsecured Subordinated Debentures Leases Notes due 2005 Term Note Notes due 2013 due 2020(1) Total (In thousands) 2003 $ 23,821 $ $ 3,150 $ $ 186,483 $ 213,454 2004 20,951 3,150 24,101 2005 18,469 4,681 3,150 26,300 2006 12,796 3,150 15,946 2007 11,534 302,400 313,934 2008 and beyond 170,106 300,000 470,106 Total $ 257,677 $ 4,681 $ 315,000 $ 300,000 $ 186,483 $ 1,063,841 (1) In December 2002, we deposited $186.5 million of unused proceeds from our new $315.0 million term loan and our sale of $300.0 million of 8 7/8% notes in escrow to retire the remainder of our outstanding zero coupon debentures. We may redeem some or all of our remaining zero coupon debentures at any time on or after August 7, 2003, at a redemption price equal to the issue price plus the accrued original issue discount through the redemption date. Under the terms of our new senior credit facility, we are required to redeem in the third quarter of 2003 any remaining zero coupon debentures outstanding at that time. At December 29, 2002, the outstanding zero coupon debentures had an aggregate accreted amount of $186.5 million. At the time we redeem or otherwise repurchase the outstanding zero coupon debentures, the escrow amount may be less than the aggregate accreted amount of the zero coupon debentures. We expect to use available cash to redeem our outstanding zero coupon debentures with a redemption price exceeding the escrow amount. The accreted value at August 7, 2003 of the remaining zero coupon debentures outstanding at December 29, 2002 would be $190.5 million. However, through March 1, 2003, we have repurchased $32.5 million of accreted value of our outstanding zero coupon debentures in open market transactions using a portion of our funds held in escrow. During 2003, we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately $40 million primarily for the introduction of new products, the improvement of operating processes and the shift of production capacity to lower cost geographies. We expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures. 32 Table of Contents Change in Accounting Principle and New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, FASB issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer systematically amortized, but instead are subject to periodic impairment testing which, at a minimum, will occur on an annual basis. We adopted SFAS No. 142 as of the beginning of fiscal 2002 and have accordingly ceased the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. During the second quarter of 2002, we completed our transitional implementation of the impairment testing provisions of SFAS No. 142, which resulted in a $117.8 million after tax charge for goodwill associated with the lighting reporting unit within our Optoelectronics business unit. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, we took this charge as the effect of an accounting change as of the beginning of fiscal 2002. As part of our ongoing compliance with the SFAS No. 142, we will perform our annual assessment during the first quarter. Our consolidated financial statements also reflect our early adoption of SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections as of July 2, 2002. Accordingly, we reflected the gains and losses resulting from our retirement of debt during 2002 in other expense, net within our consolidated income statements rather than as extraordinary items. In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, which nullifies EITF Issue No. 94 3. SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, whereas EITF No. 94 3 had recognized the liability at the commitment date to an exit plan. We are required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 146 effective for exit or disposal activities initiated by us after December 30, 2002. SFAS No. 146 does not affect the restructuring actions that we took in the fourth quarter of 2002. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. SFAS No. 148 amends SFAS No. 123 to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148 have been implemented in Note 1 and Note 18 to the accompanying financial statements, and the interim reporting requirements will be adopted in the first interim period in 2003. We have not determined whether we will undertake a change to the fair value method in the near future. As our supplemental disclosure in Note 1 and Note 18 indicates, our adoption of the fair value provisions of SFAS No. 123 would have a negative effect on our Consolidated Income Statements. In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force reached a consensus on Issue No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF Issue No. 00 21 provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and or rights to use assets. The provisions of EITF Issue No. 00 21 will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. We are currently evaluating but have not yet determined the effect that the adoption of EITF Issue No. 00 21 will have on our results of operations and financial condition. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51. FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2003. We are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of FIN 46 will have on our results of operations and financial condition. 33 Table of Contents Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, restructuring, pensions and other post retirement benefits, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue recognition. We record product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. We analyze our installation requirements and record revenue only when installation is perfunctory; in instances where installation is necessary to ensure the functionality of the product, we do not recognize revenue until the product is installed. A provision is made at the time sales are recognized for the cost of any perfunctory installation obligations and the estimated cost of product warranties. We estimate product warranty obligations based on labor and material costs we incur within the one year warranty period. Future changes in warranty costs could decrease or increase our earnings. Because the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than long term customized projects, we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates. As discussed, in Change in Accounting Principle and New Accounting Pronouncements above, we will be required in the third quarter of 2003, to implement EITF 00 21. This standard may impact our revenue recognition methodology as described above. We are currently assessing this impact. Allowances for doubtful accounts. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by (1) applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible; and (2) specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty. Therefore, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts. This would reduce our earnings and our cash flows. Inventory valuation. We initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase and or manufacture inventory. We periodically review these values to ascertain that the inventory continues to maintain a market value that is in excess of its recorded cost. Generally, reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand or technological obsolescence of the inventory. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and, where necessary, record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirement or historical trailing usage of the product. If our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels, we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory. This would reduce our earnings and cash flows. Value of long lived assets, including intangibles. We carry a variety of long lived assets on our balance sheet including property and equipment, investments, identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. We periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based, in part, upon current estimated market values, and our projections of anticipated future cash flows. We undertake this review (1) on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and intangible assets and (2) on a periodic basis for other long lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from those assets may be diminished. Any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings. As reported in our 2002 financial statements, the 2002 initial assessment of goodwill recoverability under SFAS No. 142 resulted in a $117.8 million charge to our earnings. The charge relating to goodwill in our lighting reporting unit within our Optoelectronics business segment was caused by expected declines in profitability and cash flows as a result of softness in key end markets. While we believe that our future estimates are reasonable, different assumptions regarding items 34 Table of Contents such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets. Employee compensation and benefits. We develop estimates of the cost of the health care, pension and post retirement benefits we provide to employees based on factors including current discount rates, trends in health care costs, projected returns on trust assets and anticipated salary increases. The impact of pension and post retirement benefits have not had a material impact on the results from operations or cash flows. Our anticipated rate of return for our pension plans has been based, in general, on the average rate of return on assets expected. The expected rate of return on assets is based both on our actual long term historic return on assets and expected future rates of return for the asset investment classes. The discount rates used to measure our pension obligation reflect rates at which the pension benefit could be settled. The discount rates chosen are based on the current returns of investment quality bonds. In light of declining interest rates and rates of asset returns, we reduced our discount rate and expect to reduce our expected rate of return on plan assets. The reduction in rates is not expected to have a material impact on our financial results. Changes in these assumptions could lead to changes in estimates of cost and, consequently, to additional charges or credits to our earnings. We have reduced the volatility in our health care costs provided to our retirees because of the defined dollar plan feature we adopted. Our future liability therefore, cannot be impacted by future changes in the cost of health care. Restructuring activities. Our financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals. Our restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of (1) severance benefits to be granted to employees, based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades, (2) costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs and estimates of sub rental income and, (3) as discussed earlier, asset impairments. Because these accruals are estimates, they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention. When such changes in estimates occur they are reflected in our financial statements on the income statement line entitled restructuring charges, net. Gains or losses on dispositions. At the time we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition. This estimate is based on a variety of factors, including current interest in the market, alternative markets for the assets and other relevant factors. If anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation, we record a loss. If anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation, we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated. Accordingly, we may realize amounts different than were first estimated. Such changes decrease or increase current earnings and are recorded either against the gains on disposition or discontinued operations line items appearing in our income statement. Income taxes. Our business operations are global in nature, and our tax structure is complex. Tax rates in countries throughout the world vary substantially and are, on occasion, subject to fluctuations given the current political and economic climate in those countries. We employ tax planning strategies so as to minimize our overall tax burden. These strategies contemplate tax rates being in effect in certain countries and we use these rates to determine both our current and deferred tax status. Any significant fluctuations in rates and tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change. Such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rates. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks Financial Instruments Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments, marketable securities and accounts receivable. We believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of December 29, 2002. 35 Table of Contents In the ordinary course of business, we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Transactions covered by hedge contracts include inter company and third party receivables and payables. The contracts are primarily in European and Asian currencies, have maturities that do not exceed 12 months, have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Credit risk is minimal as the foreign exchange instruments are contracted with major banking institutions. Unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and, for hedges designated as cash flow, the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. These deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs. Effectiveness of these cash flow hedges is measured utilizing the cumulative dollar offset method and is reviewed quarterly. For the year ended December 29, 2002, net losses from hedges reclassified from other comprehensive income to sales and expense totaled $639,000. The notional amount of the outstanding foreign currency contracts was approximately $103.0 million at December 29, 2002 and $280.0 million as of December 30, 2001. At December 29, 2002, the approximate fair value for foreign currency derivative contracts designated as fair value hedges was insignificant. At December 30, 2001, the approximate fair value for foreign currency derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges was $560,000. Market Risk Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk, including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures. Foreign Exchange Risk. As a multinational corporation, we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. These exposures can take a variety of different forms: (1) As our international sales grow, exposure to volatility in exchange rates could have a material impact on our financial results. Reported sales made in foreign currencies by our international subsidiaries, when translated into US dollars for financial reporting purposes, can fluctuate due to exchange rate movement. While such exchange rate fluctuations can impact reported revenues and earnings, such impacts are purely a result of the translation effect and do not impact our short term cash flows in any material way. (2) In all parts of the world, our subsidiaries do, on occasion, invoice third party customers in foreign currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business (the functional currency). Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency result in both realized and unrealized transaction gains or losses that directly impact our cash flows and our results of operations. (3) Our manufacturing and distribution organization is world wide. Accordingly, inventories are manufactured in one location, stored in another, and distributed in a third location. This results in a wide array of intercompany transactions transactions that are billed and paid in many different currencies. Our cash flows and our results of operations are therefore directly impacted by fluctuations in these currencies. (4) The cash flow needs of each of our foreign subsidiaries vary through time. Accordingly, there may be times when a subsidiary is on the receiving side or the lending side of a short term advance from either the parent company or another affiliate. Such advances, again being denominated in currencies other than a particular entitys functional currency, can expose us to fluctuations in exchange rates that can impact both our cash flows and results of operations. (5) In order to repay debt or take advantage of tax saving opportunities, we may remit cash from our foreign locations to the US. When this occurs, we are liquidating foreign currency net asset positions and converting them into dollars. Our cash flows and our results of operations are therefore also impacted by such transactions. 36 Table of Contents We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. The derivative instruments held by us are not leveraged and are not held for trading purposes. We specifically use forward contracts to hedge our foreign denominated assets and liabilities and use a combination of forward and option contracts to hedge anticipated cash flows. Our hedging activity is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on assets, liabilities and cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. The success of the hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in various currencies. To the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility, we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses. The principal currencies hedged are the British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen, and Singapore Dollar. In those currencies where there is a liquid, cost effective forward market, we maintain hedge coverage between our established minimum and maximum percentages of our anticipated transaction exposure for periods not to exceed one year. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposure. Foreign Currency Risk Value at Risk Disclosure We utilize a Value at Risk (VaR) model to determine the potential earning/ fair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments. As discussed above, we seek to minimize such exposures through our hedging program. Our VaR computation is based on the Monte Carlo simulation, utilizing a 95% confidence interval and a holding period of 30 days. As of December 29, 2002, this computation estimated that there is a 5% chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than $0.6 million. This VaR measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program. Specifically, during the four quarters ended December 29, 2002, the VaR ranged between $0.6 million and $1.6 million, and averaged approximately $1.1 million. Interest Rate Risk. As described earlier, our debt portfolio includes both fixed rate and variable rate instruments. Fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our short term cash flows (as they relate to interest) and our earnings. For the year ended December 29, 2002, we maintained, for a portion of our fixed rate debt portfolio, an interest rate swap that served to effectively convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. This interest rate swap was specifically designed to serve as both a fair value hedge on our 6.8% $115 million debt and to modify our cash flows so that our net interest payments would be reduced in the event that interest rates continued to decline. The swap was marked to market in our consolidated financial statements so that fair value movements in the swap were offset by the fair value movement in the debt. This swap position was terminated at the end of 2002 when the 6.8% debt was effectively retired. Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity As we have discussed above, we have restructured our debt in the fourth quarter of 2002. Accordingly, as of December 29, 2002, 61% of our debt portfolio is composed of fixed rate debt and 39% represented by variable rate debt. There are currently no interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments outstanding intended to hedge fair value, cash flow or earnings exposures. Our current debt covenants also require that we maintain at least 50% of our debt portfolio in fixed rate debt as defined in the Credit Agreement. Our current earnings exposure can be summarized as follows: (1) changes in interest rates can cause our interest charges on $315 million in variable rate debt to fluctuate. A 10% increase or approximately 55 basis points in current interest rates would cause additional pre tax charge to our earnings of $1.7 million for fiscal year 2003. (2) changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt to fluctuate. Just as described immediately above, an increase of 10% or approximately 55 basis points in current interest rates can cause our cash outflows to increase by $1.7 million for fiscal year 2003. (3) changes in interest rates can cause the value of our fixed rate debt to change. However, such a value change has no impact on either our earnings or our cash flows unless we determine that we wish to retire this debt in the open market. 37 Table of Contents Forward Looking Information and Factors Affecting Future Performance This annual report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements as defined in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. For this purpose, any statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements. Words such as believes, anticipates, plans, expects, will and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. There are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by these forward looking statements including, among others, the factors set forth below. The following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations: Our operating results may continue to be harmed by cyclical downturns affecting several of the industries into which we sell our products. Some of the industries and markets into which we sell our products are cyclical. Industry downturns often are characterized by reduced product demand, excess manufacturing capacity and erosion of average selling prices and profits. Significant downturns in our customers markets and in general economic conditions have resulted in a reduced demand for several of our products and have hurt our operating results. For example, during 2002, our operating results were adversely affected by downturns in many of the markets we serve, including the pharmaceutical, biomedical, semiconductor and aerospace markets. Current economic conditions have caused a decrease in capital spending by many of our customers, which in turn has adversely affected our sales and business. These trends are continuing in 2003. If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our products could become obsolete and our operating results would suffer. We sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements, our products could become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our sales and operating results would suffer. The success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors, including our ability to: accurately anticipate customer needs, innovate and develop new technologies and applications, successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, price our products competitively and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time, and differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings. Many of our products are used by our customers to develop, test and manufacture their products. Therefore, we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers products. In developing new products, we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product. If we fail to accurately foresee our customers needs and future activities, we may invests heavily in research, and development of products that do not lead to significant sales. In addition, some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions, which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications. For example, some of our license agreements are limited to the field of life sciences research, and exclude clinical diagnostics applications. Our substantial debt may adversely affect our cash flow and may restrict our investment opportunities. We have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness. As of December 29, 2002, we had approximately $805.5 million in outstanding indebtedness including $186.5 million in outstanding zero coupon 38 Table of Contents debentures, excluding obligations under our accounts receivable securitization facility. Also, we have $100.0 million in borrowing capacity available to us under our revolving credit facility. Our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate sufficient cash to pay the principal or interest in respect of our indebtedness. We may also obtain additional long term debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage. Our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences, including: increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing, limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through acquisitions or licensing, requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we compete, and placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources. A significant portion of our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates. As a result, our interest payment obligations on this indebtedness will increase if interest rates increase. Our ability to satisfy our obligations, and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations or to successfully execute our business strategy. If we are unable to service our debt and fund our business, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, seek additional financing or equity capital, restructure or refinance our debt or sell assets. We may not be able to obtain additional financing or refinance existing debt or sell assets on terms acceptable to us or at all. Restrictions in our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our 8 7/8% notes may limit our activities. Our senior credit facility and the indenture relating to our 8 7/8% notes contain, and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may contain, restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company, including restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to: incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock, make investments, create liens, sell assets, in the case of our restricted subsidiaries, incur obligations that restrict their ability to make dividend or other payments to us, in the case of our restricted subsidiaries, guarantee or secure indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliates, create unrestricted subsidiaries, and 39 Table of Contents consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. We are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of our senior credit facility. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology and changes in the level of competition. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date. Also, an acceleration of the debt under our senior credit facility would trigger an event of default under our 8 7/8% notes, and a default under our 8 7/8% notes would trigger an event of default under the senior credit facility and possibly other debt. If an event of default occurs, we may not have sufficient funds available to make the required payments under our indebtedness. If we are unable to repay amounts owed under our senior credit facility, those lenders may be entitled to foreclose on and sell the collateral that secures our borrowings under that agreement. Our inability to repay amounts owed under our senior credit facility may also cause a default under other of our obligations including our accounts receivable securitization facility. Economic, political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales. Because we sell our products worldwide, our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Our sales originating outside the United States represented 66% of our total sales in the fiscal year ended December 29, 2002. We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales. In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities, employees and suppliers are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including: changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in a countrys or regions political or economic conditions, particularly in developing or emerging markets, longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, differing tax laws and changes in those laws, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differing labor laws and changes in those laws, differing protection of intellectual property and changes in that protection, and differing regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements. Our quarterly operating results are subject to significant fluctuation, and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate. Given the nature of the markets in which we participate, we cannot reliably predict future sales and profitability. Changes in competitive, market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations, and we can offer no assurance of our ability to make such adjustments or to make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions. A high proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to our significant sales, 40 Table of Contents research and development and manufacturing costs. Thus, small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter. Factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include: demand for and market acceptance of our products, competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices, adverse changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which we do business, adverse changes in industries, such as pharmaceutical, biomedical, semiconductors and aerospace, on which we are particularly dependent, changes in the portions of our sales represented by our various products and customers, delays or problems in the introduction of new products, our competitors announcement or introduction of new products, services or technological innovations, increased costs of raw materials or supplies, and changes in the volume or timing of product orders. We may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or license technologies, integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing business or make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable. We have in the past, and may in the future, supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines, such as our acquisition of Packard BioScience Company in November 2001. We may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons, including: competition among buyers and licensees, the need for regulatory and other approvals, our inability to raise capital to fund these acquisitions, the high valuations of businesses and technologies, and restrictions in the instruments governing our indebtedness, including the indenture governing the notes and our new senior credit facility. Some of the businesses we may seek to acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable. Accordingly, the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings. For these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability, we must improve their management, operations, products and market penetration. We may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations. To finance our acquisitions, we may have to raise additional funds, either through public or private financings. We may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us. If we do not successfully integrate our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments business units, we may not achieve the benefits we anticipate we will derive from the combination of these businesses. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we announced the combination of our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments business units into a new integrated business named Life and Analytical Sciences, representing 66% of our total sales for 2002. This combination is subject to various integration risks, and the integration of these two business units may not achieve the benefits we anticipate it will achieve. As a result of the combination, we may experience a loss of productivity, sales and key personnel. In addition, the information technology systems of the two businesses may not be fully compatible. If any of these potential difficulties were to occur and persist, the business results of our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments reporting segments could suffer. 41 Table of Contents We are targeting annualized cost savings from the combination of our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses of between $30.0 million and $45.0 million. Because we anticipate that the benefits of the combination of these businesses will not be fully realized until 2004, we are targeting cost savings of between $12.0 million and $25.0 million in 2003. While we believe these cost savings to be reasonable, they are estimates that are inherently difficult to predict and are necessarily speculative in nature. In addition, unforeseen factors may offset some or all of the estimated cost savings or other benefits from the integration. As a result, our actual cost savings, if any, could differ or be delayed, compared to our estimates. Our loss of licenses may require us to stop selling products or lose competitive advantage. We may not be able to renew our existing licenses or licenses we may obtain in the future on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology, we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products, redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage. Potential competitors could in license technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share. Our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations. If we fail to comply with these obligations we could lose important rights under a license, such as the right to exclusivity in a market. In some cases, we could lose all rights under the license. In addition, rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control. For example, the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons, including invalidity of the licensed patent, or a third party could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses. If we do not compete effectively, our business will be harmed. We encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business. We may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors. To remain competitive, we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products. We anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive. In addition, new competitors, technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines. If we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the United States Food and Drug Administration and other governmental agencies, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties. Some of the products produced by our Life and Analytical Sciences business unit are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration and similar international agencies. In addition, some of the activities of our Fluid Sciences business unit are subject to regulation by the United States Federal Aviation Administration. These regulations govern a wide variety of product activities, from design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales, resales and distribution. If we fail to comply with those regulations or those of similar international agencies, we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution. In addition, we could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution. Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. We compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal, state, local and foreign regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products. Obtaining and enforcing patent protection for our proprietary products, processes and technologies may be difficult and expensive; we may infringe intellectual property rights of third parties. Patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing and marketing new technologies and products is time consuming and expensive. We own many United States and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents to cover our products. We may not obtain issued patents from any pending or 42 Table of Contents future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. The claims allowed under any issued patents may not be broad enough to protect our technology. Third parties may seek to challenge, invalidate or circumvent issued patents owned by or licensed to us or claim that our products and operations infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights. In addition to our patents, we possess an array of unpatented proprietary technology and know how and we license intellectual property rights to and from third parties. The measures that we employ to protect this technology and these rights may not be adequate. Moreover, in some cases, the licensor can terminate a license or convert it to a non exclusive arrangement if we fail to meet specified performance targets. We may incur significant expense in any legal proceedings to protect our proprietary rights or to defend infringement claims by third parties. In addition, claims of third parties against us could result in awards of substantial damages or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing, using, importing or selling our products in the United States or abroad. Our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets. As of December 29, 2002, our total assets included $1.4 billion of net intangible assets. Net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights, trademark rights and technology licenses, net of accumulated amortization. These assets have historically been amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives. In connection with our adoption of SFAS No. 142, we discontinued the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets beginning in fiscal 2002. Instead, we will test these items, at a minimum, on an annual basis for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned. During the second quarter of 2002, we completed our transitional implementation of the impairment testing provisions of SFAS No. 142, which resulted in a $117.8 million before and after tax charge for goodwill associated with our lighting business. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, we took this charge as the effect of an accounting change as of the beginning of fiscal 2002. Future impairment testing may result in additional intangible asset write offs, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 43 Table of Contents
