Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This annual report on Form 10 K, including the following managements discussion and analysis, contains forward looking information that you should read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements that we have included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. For this purpose, any statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements. Words such as believes, plans, anticipates, expects, will and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from the plans, intentions or expectations we disclose in the forward looking statements we make. We have included important factors below under the heading Forward Looking Information and Factors Affecting Future Performance that we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements we make. We are not obligated to publicly update any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Overview We are a leading provider of scientific instruments, consumables and services to the pharmaceutical, biomedical, environmental testing and general industrial markets. We design, manufacture, market and service products and systems within three businesses, each constituting one reporting segment: Life and Analytical Sciences. We are a leading provider of drug discovery, genetic screening, and environmental and chemical analysis tools, including instruments, reagents, consumables and services. Optoelectronics. We provide a broad range of digital imaging, sensor and specialty lighting components used in the biomedical, consumer products and other specialty end markets. Fluid Sciences. We provide critical fluid control and containment solutions for highly demanding environments such as turbine engines and semiconductor fabrication facilities. 17 Table of Contents Formation of our Life and Analytical Sciences Business Unit We combined our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses to form our Life and Analytical Sciences business in the fourth quarter of 2002 to improve our operational scale, which we believe will enable us to better serve our customers and more fully capitalize on the strengths of the combined businesses sales, service and research and development organizations. In the second quarter of 2003, we completed many of the changes involved in combining the two businesses, including the integration of facilities and management reporting and other systems. We have now aggregated the two segments into one reporting segment for financial statement purposes, as discrete financial information is now only available on a combined basis. For comparative purposes we have disclosed our Life and Analytical Sciences business as one reporting segment for all periods presented. In connection with the combination of our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments business units, we recorded a $26.0 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2002 as a result of workforce reductions, facility closures and contract terminations. These actions occurred during 2003 with the exception of lease commitment payouts and other spending, which we expect to complete in 2004. We achieved in excess of the original range of $12 to $25 million in pre tax cost savings in fiscal 2003 from the combination of our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses relative to our fiscal 2002 cost levels. We are targeting additional pre tax cost savings, from the combination, of between $5 million and $20 million in fiscal 2004 for combined pre tax cost savings of between $30 million and $45 million relative to our fiscal 2002 cost levels. Unforeseen factors may offset some or all of the estimated cost savings or other benefits from the integration. As a result, our actual cost savings, if any, could differ or be delayed, compared to our estimates. Consolidated Results of Continuing Operations Sales 2003 Compared to 2002. Sales for 2003 were $1,535.2 million, versus $1,505.0 million during 2002, an increase of $30.2 million, or 2%. Changes in foreign exchange rates, primarily the Euro, increased sales by approximately $73 million in 2003, as compared to 2002. This increase in sales reflects a $12.0 million, or 1%, increase in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment sales, which grew from $991.7 million in 2002 to $1,003.7 in 2003, and includes approximately $62.0 million in sales attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates compared to 2002. Our Optoelectronics segment sales grew $28.0 million, or 9%, from $323.8 million in 2002 to $351.8 million in 2003, including approximately $10.0 million in sales attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates compared to 2002. The increased sales in our Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics segments were offset by a decrease in sales of $9.8 million, or 5%, in our Fluid Sciences segment, which declined from $189.5 million in 2002 to $179.7 million in 2003. 2002 Compared to 2001. Sales for 2002 were $1,505.0 million, versus $1,525.3 million during 2001, a decrease of $20.3 million, or 1%. Changes in foreign exchange rates, primarily the Euro, increased sales by approximately $22 million in 2002, as compared to 2001. This decrease in sales reflects a $56.4 million, or 15%, decrease in our Optoelectronics segment sales, which declined from $380.2 million in 2001 to $323.8 million in 2002. The decrease in Optoelectronics sales in 2002 was primarily due to the absence of sales from our specialty lighting businesses and other discontinued product lines which we divested in 2001 that had accounted for $39.4 million in sales for 2001. Our Fluid Sciences segment sales declined by $41.1 million, or 18%, from $230.6 million in 2001 to $189.5 million in 2002. The decrease in sales in our Optoelectronics and Fluid Sciences segments were offset in part by an increase in sales of $77.2 million, or 8%, in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment, which grew from $914.5 million in 2001 to $991.7 million in 2002. This increase includes approximately $18.0 million in sales attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates compared to 2001. Also contributing to the increased sales in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment were sales from a full year of Packard, which we acquired in November 2001. In 2001, we included only two months, or $40 million, of sales from Packard in our results of operations. The increase in sales for 2002 in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment, was offset in part by our divestiture in the fourth quarter of 2001 of our Instruments for Research and Applied Science business, which contributed $47.4 million in sales in 2001. 18 Table of Contents Cost of Sales 2003 Compared to 2002. Cost of sales for 2003 was $906.3 million, versus $904.1 million for 2002, an increase of $2.2 million, or 0.2%. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased to 59% in 2003 from 60% in 2002, resulting in an increase in gross margin of 100 basis points from 40% in 2002 to 41% in 2003. The 100 basis point increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to a 2002 $17.2 million inventory adjustment charge recorded within our Optoelectronics segment. We did not record a similar charge in 2003. Apart from this adjustment, the gross margin percentages for the Life and Analytical Sciences, Optoelectronics and Fluid Sciences reporting segments were substantially unchanged in 2003, as compared to 2002. 2002 Compared to 2001. Cost of sales for 2002 was $904.1 million, versus $849.4 million for 2001, an increase of $54.7 million, or 6%. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased to 60% in 2002 from 56% in 2001, resulting in a decrease in gross margin of 400 basis points from 44% in 2001 to 40% in 2002. Of the 400 basis point decrease in gross margin approximately a 350 basis point was due to a decrease in gross margin in our Optoelectronics segment, resulting primarily from a 2002 $17.2 million inventory adjustment, and 150 basis point to a decrease in gross margin in our Fluid Sciences segment, offset in part by a 100 basis point increase in gross margin in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment. Research and Development Expenses 2003 Compared to 2002. Research and development expenses for 2003 were $83.1 million versus $86.5 million in 2002, a decrease of $3.4 million, or 4%. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses decreased to 5.4% in 2003 from 5.7% in 2002, primarily due to the consolidation of research and development activities to take advantage of increased synergies and corresponding cost savings as a result of fewer sites. We directed research and development efforts during 2003 and 2002 primarily toward genetic screening and biopharmaceutical end markets within our Life and Analytical Sciences reporting segment and medical digital imaging and industrial sensors within our Optoelectronics reporting segment. We expect our research and development efforts to continue to emphasize the health sciences end markets. We expect our research and development spending for fiscal 2004 to remain substantially similar to our historical levels in fiscal 2003 and 2002. 2002 Compared to 2001. Research and development expenses for 2002 were $86.5 million versus $80.1 million in 2001, an increase of $6.4 million or 8%. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses increased to 5.7% in 2002 from 5.3% in 2001, principally as a result of the inclusion of spending associated with the Packard operations. We directed research and development efforts during 2002 and 2001 primarily toward drug discovery tools and genetic screening applications as well as biopharmaceutical end markets within our Life and Analytical Sciences reporting segment and biomedical end markets within our Optoelectronics reporting segment. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2003 Compared to 2002. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2003 were $386.4 million, versus $431.3 million for 2002, a decrease of $44.9 million, or 10%. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 350 basis points to 25.2% in 2003 from 28.7% in 2002. Proportionately, the decrease as a percentage of sales of 350 basis points in 2003 was due to a 200 basis point decrease attributable to reduced expenses in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment, a 100 basis point decrease attributable to reduced expenses in our Optoelectronics segment and a 50 basis point decrease attributable to reduced expenses in our Fluid Sciences segment. The overall decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to productivity improvements throughout our company, including cost savings we derived from restructuring actions. 2002 Compared to 2001. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2002 were $431.3 million, versus $376.9 million for 2001, an increase of $54.4 million, or 14%. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 400 basis points to 28.7% in 2002 from 24.7% in 2001. Proportionately, the increase as a percentage of sales of 400 basis points was due to a 250 basis point increase attributable to increased expenses in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment primarily due to integration costs and an 19 Table of Contents overall decline in sales, a 20 basis point increase attributable to increased expenses in our Optoelectronics segment and a 130 basis point increase attributable to a decline in sales in our Fluid Sciences segment. Restructuring (Reversals) Charges, Net 2003 Compared to 2002. Restructuring (reversals) charges, net for 2003 was a reversal of $3.5 million, the combination of our 2003 changes in estimate of $5.8 million and our 2003 charges of $2.3 million, versus a charge of $35.7 million during 2002. The following table summarizes our restructuring accrual balances and related activity by restructuring plan during 2003, 2002 and 2001: 2001 2002 2003 Amounts 2001 Amounts 2002 Amounts 2003 Balance at paid and Changes in 2001 Balance at paid and Changes in 2002 Balance at paid and Changes in 2003 Balance at 1/1/2001 incurred Estimates Charges 12/30/2001 incurred Estimates Charges 12/29/2002 incurred Estimates Charges 12/28/2003 (In thousands) Pre 2001 plans $ 21,044 $ (16,904 ) $ (2,189 ) $ $ 1,951 $ (1,022 ) $ (929 ) $ $ $ $ $ $ Q4 2001 plan (1,603 ) 9,189 7,586 (4,891 ) 1,380 4,075 (3,434 ) 1,830 2,471 Q1 2002 plan (8,046 ) 9,198 1,152 (52 ) (1,000 ) 100 Q4 2002 plan (1,697 ) 26,049 24,352 (13,813 ) (6,239 ) 4,300 Q2 2003 plan (1,582 ) (381 ) 2,251 288 Total $ 21,044 $ (18,507 ) $ (2,189 ) $ 9,189 $ 9,537 $ (15,656 ) $ 451 $ 35,247 $ 29,579 $ (18,881 ) $ (5,790 ) $ 2,251 $ 7,159 Q2 2003 Plan: During 2003, we incurred a $2.3 million restructuring charge in our Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics segments, which we refer to as our Q2 2003 Plan. The purpose of the restructuring was to further improve performance and take advantage of synergies between our former Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses which we began integrating in the fourth quarter of 2002. The principal actions in this restructuring plan included lower headcount due to the continued integration of Life and Analytical Sciences business in a European manufacturing and customer care center as well as headcount reduction at one of the Optoelectronics manufacturing facilities to reflect recent declining demand for several product lines. We planned to reduce headcount by 120. We recorded restructuring charges by segment for 2003 as follows: Life and (In millions) Analytical Sciences Optoelectronics Total Q2 2003 Plan $ 2.0 $ 0.3 $ 2.3 This restructuring charge was primarily recorded in the second quarter of 2003. However, we recorded additional charges of $0.5 million and $0.1 million in the third and fourth quarters of 2003, as required by SFAS 146, as some employees who were notified of their employment termination in the second quarter were required to work for a period of time prior to receiving their severance. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded a pre tax restructuring reversal of $0.4 million due to 30 fewer employee terminations as a result of higher attrition rates in several countries prior to ultimate termination and, accordingly, lower severance costs. We completed all actions under the Q2 2003 Plan by December 28, 2003, with the exception of nine headcount reductions that we expect to complete by the second quarter of 2004. Q4 2002 Plan: In connection with our decision to combine our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses in order to reduce costs and achieve operational efficiencies, we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of $26.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2002, which we refer to as our Q4 2002 Plan. The Q4 2002 Plan allowed us to combine many business functions worldwide, with the intention to better serve our customers and more fully capitalize on the strengths of the businesses sales, service and research and development organizations. The principal actions in the Q4 2002 Plan included planned workforce reductions of 546 people, closure of approximately 20 facilities and disposal of underutilized assets. 20 Table of Contents The Q4 2002 Plan resulted in the integration of our United States Life and Analytical Sciences sales, service and customer care centers, the integration of European customer care and finance centers, the merging of a former Life Sciences European manufacturing facility with a former Analytical Instruments European manufacturing facility, and the merging of a portion of a former Life Sciences research and development facility in Europe with a former Analytical Instruments facility in Europe. During 2003, we expended $13.8 million to execute these actions. In addition, we recorded a reversal of $6.2 million in the Q4 2002 Plan due to both higher than expected employee attrition rates in several countries prior to ultimate termination and lower severance costs for actual terminations. The remaining liability associated with the Q4 2002 Plan represents severance related to 65 employees and lease commitments. We expect to settle the remaining severance liability by the second quarter of 2004. The lease commitments on unoccupied buildings extend until 2005. Q1 2002 Plan: During the first quarter of 2002, our management developed a plan to restructure several businesses. We refer to these activities as our Q1 2002 Plan. The plan resulted in pre tax restructuring charges totaling $9.2 million. The principal actions in the Q1 2002 Plan included planned workforce and overhead reductions resulting from reorganization activities, including the closure of a manufacturing facility, disposal of underutilized assets and general cost reductions. Q1 2002 Plan charges in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment totaled $5.5 million. These charges comprised $4.4 million in severance costs, $1.0 million in asset impairments and $.1 million in lease commitments. The charges were a result of actions we took as a response to decreased sales of components in our Life and Analytical Sciences business. These actions under the charges primarily included the downsizing of an additional manufacturing location and streamlining of the global sales and research and development organizations, primarily in Europe, Japan and the Pacific Rim. We took these actions to reduce the number of employees in components of our business that had experienced declining demand. Q1 2002 Plan charges in our Optoelectronics segment totaled $3.7 million, comprising $3.5 million in severance costs and $0.2 million in asset write offs. This charge was primarily due to the removal of a layer of management structure within our Optoelectronics reporting segment which led to a flatter and less expensive organization structure. Total headcount was reduced by 276. During 2003, we recorded a restructuring reversal of $1.0 million in the Q1 2002 Plan primarily due to lower than expected employee separation costs associated with our Optoelectronics segment. The remaining $0.1 million represented lease commitments on a closed facility and will be paid in the first quarter of 2004. Q4 2001 Plan: During the fourth quarter of 2001, in connection with the integration of Packard and a restructuring of our sales offices in Europe, we recorded a restructuring charge of $9.2 million in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment. We refer to these activities as our Q4 2001 Plan. The principal actions in the Q4 2001 Plan included the closing or consolidation of several leased sales and services offices in Europe, as well as costs associated with the closure of a manufacturing facility in Europe, the closure of leased manufacturing facilities in the United States and the disposal of related assets. These actions were designed to streamline the organization and take advantage of the synergies offered by the Packard acquisition as they relate to the legacy Life and Analytical Science segment. We terminated a total of 272 employees. In 2003, we recorded an additional pre tax restructuring charge associated with the Q4 2001 Plan of $1.8 million. This charge was primarily due to additional severance and severance related benefits of the previously identified employees associated with the closure of our European manufacturing facility in the Life and Analytical Sciences segment, and will be paid in 2004. 21 Table of Contents In Process Research and Development Expenses: In process research and development expenses for 2001 were $71.5 million and consisted primarily of in process research and development expenses related specifically to projects we acquired in our acquisition of Packard within our Life and Analytical Sciences reporting segment. We determined the value of these projects based on discounted probable future cash flows on a project by project basis. We prepared revenue and expense projections as well as technology assumptions through 2008. We discounted the projected cash flows using discount rates specific to each project derived from a cost of capital adjusted upward for the stage of completion. These adjusted discount rates ranged between 20 37% based upon the remaining effort and risk of completion. The efforts required to develop the in process technologies into commercially viable products principally relate to the completion of all planning, designing, prototyping, verification and testing activities that were necessary to establish that the products could be designed to meet their design specifications, including function, features and technical performance requirements. Failure to complete any of these projects has not had a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition. We classified Packard acquisition projects for which the charge is associated as follows: Liquid Handling and Sample Preparation: Packards liquid handling and sample preparation products enable users to automatically manage liquid handling processes for drug discovery and research applications using robotic devices for sample preparation and dispensing of liquids. Approximately $34.1 million of the in process research and development charge related to liquid handling and sample preparation projects, with individual projects ranging from $1.0 million to $16.5 million in value and 30% to 80% complete. The majority of the liquid handling and sample preparation research and development projects included in this charge were completed at December 28, 2003. Biochip Systems: Packards biochip systems included instruments and software used in the production, detection and analysis of simultaneous gene and protein assays in microarray or biochip formats, both of which are chips containing dense grids of genes or proteins. Approximately $19.3 million of the in process research and development charge related to biochip system projects, with individual projects ranging from $0.1 million to $11.7 million in value and 10% to 90% complete. All of the biochip systems research and development projects included in this charge were completed at December 28, 2003. Microplate Readers and Plate Imaging Systems: Packards microplate readers and plate imaging systems are used in life science laboratories for the high throughput analysis of samples in an effort to measure biological interactions. Approximately $7.6 million of the in process research and development charge related to microplate readers and plate imaging system projects, with individual projects ranging from $0.1 million to $5.5 million in value and 30% to 90% complete. The majority of the microplate readers and plate imaging systems research and development projects included in this charge were completed at December 28, 2003. Drug Discovery Reagents: Packards drug discovery reagent offerings include non isotopic drug screening and detection reagents. Approximately $8.1 million of the in process research and development charge related to drug discovery reagent projects, with individual projects ranging from $0.1 million to $6.3 million in value and 50% to 80% complete. All of the drug discovery reagents research and development projects included in this charge were completed at December 28, 2003. Gains on Dispositions 2003 Compared to 2002. Dispositions resulted in a net gain of $2.7 million in 2003 versus a net gain of $5.2 million in 2002. Gains on dispositions in 2003 included $2.2 million from sales of facilities and $0.5 million from post closing adjustments relating to the resolution of contingencies related to the sale of our Instruments for Research and Applied Sciences business, which we refer to as IRAS. Gains on dispositions in 2002 included $4.4 million from the sale of facilities and $0.8 million from post closing entries relating to our sale of our IRAS business, which was formerly part of our Life and Analytical Sciences segment. 22 Table of Contents 2002 Compared to 2001. Dispositions resulted in a net gain of $5.2 million in 2002 versus a net gain of $33.2 million in 2001. Gains on dispositions in 2002 included $4.4 million from sales of facilities and $0.8 million from post closing adjustments relating to the sale of our IRAS business. Gains on dispositions in 2001 included $32.3 million from the sale of our IRAS business and $7.2 million from dispositions within our Optoelectronics and Life and Analytical Sciences reporting segments, offset in part by a $6.3 million loss on the sale of our Voltarc Technologies business, formerly part of our Optoelectronics reporting segment. Amortization of Intangible Assets 2003 Compared to 2002. Amortization of intangible assets was $28.3 million for both 2003 and 2002. Slight increases in the Life and Analytical Sciences segment amortization due to the effect of foreign exchange offset by slight decreases in amortization in the Optoelectronics and Fluid Sciences segments in 2003 compared to 2002. 2002 Compared to 2001. Amortization of intangible assets for 2002 was $28.3 million versus $43.9 million for 2001, a decrease of $15.6 million or 36%. The 2001 amortization expense included $27.1 million related to the amortization of goodwill. We discontinued the amortization of goodwill upon adoption of SFAS No. 142 at the beginning of 2002. The year over year increase in intangible asset amortization was the result of the amortization on intangible assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets that arose from the acquisition of Packard. Interest and Other Expense, Net Interest and other expense, net consisted of the following: 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands) Interest income $ (2,488 ) $ (3,161 ) $ (3,730 ) Interest expense 52,586 32,096 37,730 Losses (gains) on sale of investments, net 2,391 1,987 (4,274 ) Extinguishment of debt 1,953 353 Other 1,945 1,593 (561 ) $ 56,387 $ 32,868 $ 29,165 2003 Compared to 2002. Interest and other expense, net for 2003 was $56.4 million versus $32.9 million for 2002, an increase of $23.5 million or 71%. The increase in interest and other expense, net in 2003 as compared to 2002, was due primarily to higher average borrowing rates resulting from our December 2002 financing. A more complete discussion of our liquidity and our prospective costs to borrow can be seen under the heading Liquidity and Capital Resources. The remaining increase in interest and other expense, net of $3.0 million was due primarily to our increased acceleration of the amortization of debt issuance costs of $1.9 million resulting from partial prepayments of our term debt during 2003 versus $0.4 million in 2002 and $0.6 million of transaction costs we incurred in the fourth quarter of 2003 in connection with amending our credit facility to reduce the interest rate margin applicable to our term loan. In January 2004, $100 million of our outstanding fixed rate debt was swapped to a floating rate with swap instruments that reset semi annually in arrears based on six month USD Libor. We expect interest expense in 2004 to decrease due to lower outstanding debt balances, lower interest rate margin on our term loan due to the amendment of our credit facility in the fourth quarter of 2003 and the expected benefit derived from our January 2004 swap instruments identified above. 2002 Compared to 2001. Interest and other expense, net for 2002 was $32.9 million versus $29.2 million for 2001, an increase of $3.7 million or 13%. The increase in interest and other expense, net in 2002, as compared to 2001, was due primarily to losses on sales of investments in 2002, as compared to gains in 2001 of $4.3 million. This increase was offset in part by a decline in interest expense to $32.1 million in 2002 from $37.7 million in 2001 resulting from decreased levels of indebtedness and lower associated interest rates. The 23 Table of Contents $0.4 million in debt extinguishment in 2002 is comprised of (1) $3.2 million in fees and previously capitalized issuance costs written off in connection with our December 2002 debt refinancing transactions; (2) a $5.6 million call premium paid in the first quarter of 2002 upon our extinguishment of the debt we assumed in our acquisition of Packard; and (3) an offsetting $8.4 million gain realized on our repurchase of a portion of our zero coupon convertible debentures. Provision/ Benefit for Income Taxes 2003 Compared to 2002. The 2003 provision for income taxes was $25.9 million, versus a benefit of $4.4 million in 2002. Our effective tax rate is primarily attributable to geographic income patterns. Our 2003 effective tax rate was 32% as compared to our 2002 effective tax rate of 52%. The change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a relatively high ratio of permanent tax differences to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes. 2002 Compared to 2001. The benefit for income taxes for 2002 was $4.4 million, versus a provision of $59.1 million during 2001. As mentioned above, our effective tax rate is primarily attributable to geographic income patterns. Our 2002 effective tax rate was 52% as compared to our 2001 effective tax rate of 59%. The change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced profitability in 2002 and in process research and development charges associated with our Packard acquisition, which were not deductible for tax purposes. Discontinued Operations We recorded the following gains and losses, which we report as the loss on dispositions of discontinued operations, during the years ended December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002: 2003 2002 (In thousands) (Loss) gain on the sale of the Security and Detection Systems business $ (2,414 ) $ 14,960 Gain on the resolution of contingencies associated with the Technical Services business 6,535 Loss on Entertainment Lighting business (1,957 ) (2,100 ) Loss on Telecommunications Components business (2,383 ) (18,386 ) Net loss on disposition of discontinued operations before income taxes (219 ) (5,526 ) Provision for income taxes (238 ) (7,934 ) Loss on disposition of discontinued operations, net of income taxes $ (457 ) $ (13,460 ) During 2003, we settled various claims under certain long term contracts and transition services with our Technical Services business, which we sold in August 1999. The net settlement and the reversal of certain previously established contingencies resulted in a pre tax gain of $6.5 million that we recognized in 2003 and included in gain (loss) on dispositions of discontinued operations. In June 2002, we completed the sale of our Security and Detection Systems business for cash consideration of approximately $100.0 million and a net working capital adjustment, the amount of which has yet to be finalized. We recorded a net pre tax gain of approximately $15.0 million pursuant to this transaction in 2002 as a gain on the disposition of a discontinued operation. We accounted for our Security and Detection Systems business as a discontinued operation in accordance with APB No. 30, and accordingly, the results of operations and related cash flows of this business through the disposal date have been segregated from continuing operations and reported as a separate line on our consolidated income statements. We present the resulting gain from the sale as a component of net income within dispositions of discontinued operations, net of income tax on our 2002 consolidated income statement. Adjustments relating to this sale resulted in a pre tax loss from discontinued operations of $2.4 million in 2003, primarily due to revised estimates of the working capital adjustment. 24 Table of Contents Also in June 2002, our Board of Directors approved a plan to shut down our Telecommunications Components business and a plan to sell our Entertainment Lighting business as part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities. We have reflected both businesses as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements. As of June 29, 2003, we had exited our Entertainment Lighting business completing the sale of a substantial portion of that business for cash consideration of $1.4 million and abandoned the remaining assets. Sales and losses from discontinued operations for 2003 until that time were $5.6 million and $1.6 million respectively. As of June 30, 2002, we had shut down our Telecommunications Components business. Effect of Accounting Change As required by SFAS 142, we completed the transitional impairment analysis of our recorded goodwill as of January 1, 2002. In connection with the adoption of this standard, we reviewed our forecasts and projections of all of our reporting units and determined that, based on decreased demand for certain specialty lamps resulting from a downturn in the printed circuit board production worldwide and other smaller markets, the fair value of the lighting reporting unit was less than its carrying value. With the assistance of valuation specialists and using a discounted cash flow model, we determined that the carrying value of the recorded goodwill was in excess of the fair value of that goodwill. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge totaling $117.8 million as a cumulative effect of an accounting change. The entire transition adjustment related to our lighting reporting unit within our Optoelectronics reporting segment. In addition, as part of our ongoing compliance with SFAS No. 142, we completed our annual assessment of goodwill using a measurement date of January 1, 2003. This annual assessment did not result in an impairment charge. Acquisitions and Divestitures Significant Acquisitions In November 2001, we completed our acquisition of Packard for a purchase price of approximately $764.0 million, in exchange for approximately 22 million shares of our common stock and our assumption of approximately $118.2 million in debt that we subsequently redeemed in March 2002. The acquisition extended our capabilities in automated liquid handling and sample preparation and strengthened our position as a global provider of comprehensive drug discovery tools and solutions. In connection with the Packard acquisition, we initially recorded approximately $33 million for integration charges. The Packard integration plans included initiatives to integrate the operations of Packard, and principally comprise amounts related to employee separation costs for approximately 200 individuals, the termination of leases and other contractual obligations and asset write offs in connection with these actions. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we finalized our estimates of severance costs and determined that our initial estimates were too high, principally due to actual severance costs per employee being lower than planned. As a result, we reversed $11.9 million of severance costs in the integration accrual in the fourth quarter of 2002 with the offsetting amount recorded to goodwill. We also reversed $4.0 million related to the termination of leases and other contractual obligations in the fourth quarter of 2002 with the offsetting amount recorded to goodwill due to changes in our estimate of our lease obligations. The total reversal in the fourth quarter of 2002 was $15.9 million. Therefore, the net integration charge related to our purchase of Packard totaled $17.1 million. The integration activities were completed in early 2003 with the exception of $0.9 million in remaining payments due on leased facilities exited in 2001 that will be paid through 2004. These integration activities are linked to the Q4 2001 Plan and are disclosed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K. 25 Table of Contents The following table summarizes integration reserve activity during 2003, 2002 and 2001 related to the acquisition of Packard: Abandonment of Excess Total Cash Asset Severance Facilities Charges Impairment Total (In millions) Packard Integration Plan Balance at December 30, 2001 $ 20.0 $ 7.6 $ 27.6 $ 5.4 $ 33.0 Amounts paid (7.3 ) (0.4 ) (7.7 ) (5.4 ) (13.1 ) Changes in estimates (11.9 ) (4.0 ) (15.9 ) (15.9 ) Balance at December 29, 2002 .8 3.2 4.0 4.0 Amounts paid (.8 ) (2.3 ) (3.1 ) (3.1 ) Balance at December 28, 2003 $ $ 0.9 $ 0.9 $ $ 0.9 In July 2000, we completed our acquisition of NEN Life Sciences, Inc., a provider of drug discovery products, services, reagents and technologies to the life sciences industry. We recorded a $4.0 million integration reserve related to the acquisition of NEN. The NEN restructuring plan included approximately $3.8 million in termination and employment related costs of individuals principally based in NENs headquarters and operations center and $.2 million of lease termination costs. $3.4 million of the termination and employment related costs remained as of the end of fiscal 2000. The integration activities occurred concurrently with our restructuring activities of 2000. The following table summarizes integration reserve activity during 2001 related to the acquisition of NEN: Abandonment of Excess Severance Facilities Total (In millions) NEN Integration Plan Balance at January 1, 2001 $ 3.4 $ 0.2 $ 3.6 Amounts paid (3.4 ) (0.2 ) (3.6 ) Balance at December 30, 2001 $ $ $ In May 1999, we completed our acquisition of the Analytical Instruments Division of PE Corp. for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $425 million. As part of the Analytical Instruments acquisition, we incurred integration charges to merge the Analytical Instruments business with our existing business. The Analytical Instruments integration plan included initiatives to integrate the operations of the acquired businesses and reduce overhead. The primary components of these plans related to: (1) employee termination benefits and related costs for approximately 600 individuals, (2) consolidation or shutdown of certain operational facilities worldwide, and (3) termination of certain leases and other contractual obligations. The integration activities were completed in 2002. 26 Table of Contents The following table summarizes integration reserve activity during 2002 and 2001 related to our acquisition of Analytical Instruments: Abandonment of Excess Severance Facilities Total (In millions) Analytical Instruments Integration Plan Balance at January 1, 2001 $ 25.0 $ 3.7 $ 28.7 Amounts paid (15.8 ) (3.7 ) (19.5 ) Balance at December 30, 2001 9.2 9.2 Amounts paid (9.2 ) (9.2 ) Balance at December 29, 2002 $ $ $ Contingencies We are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party for certain waste disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. We have accrued $6.2 million as of December 28, 2003, representing our managements estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters. This amount is not discounted and does not reflect any recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. These cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the timeframe over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party, our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. We expect that such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. While it is possible that a material loss exceeding the amounts recorded may be incurred, we do not expect the potential exposure to be materially different from the amounts we recorded. We and certain of our officers have been named as defendants in a class action lawsuit in which the plaintiffs have alleged various statements made by us were misleading with respect to our prospects and future operating results. We believe we have meritorious defenses to the lawsuits and we intend to contest the actions vigorously. We are currently unable, however, to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss, if any, that may result from the resolution of these matters. We have received a notice from the Internal Revenue Service asserting federal income tax deficiencies for 1997 and 1998. We are challenging many of the proposed adjustments. We believe that the ultimate outcome of the notices will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. Reporting Segment Results of Continuing Operations Life and Analytical Sciences 2003 Compared to 2002. Sales for 2003 were $1,003.7 million, versus $991.7 million in 2002, an increase of $12.0 million, or 1%. Changes in foreign exchange rates, primarily the Euro, increased sales by approximately $61 million in 2003, as compared to 2002. The favorable effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations was offset in part by reduced unit sales volume. The following analysis compares selected sales by 27 Table of Contents market and product type for 2003, as compared to 2002, and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Sales to environmental and chemical analysis customers increased $22.7 million, sales to genetic screening customers increased $6.3 million and our OneSourceTM laboratory service sales increased by $14.8 million. These increases were offset by a $31.8 million decrease in sales to biopharmaceutical customers, primarily in sales of liquid handling instruments and radiochemical reagents, as general biopharmaceutical market demand remained weak throughout 2003. Sales by type of product included increases in sales of consumables of $23.5 million, and service of $14.8 million, partially offset by decreases in sales of instruments of $26.3 million. Operating profit for 2003 was $94.7 million, versus $27.4 million in 2002, an increase of $67.3 million. The increase in 2003 as compared to 2002, was primarily the result of approximately $43.0 million of overall cost savings in 2003 associated with restructuring and integration activities, mainly due to a reduction in the number of employees and the elimination of excess facilities. The increase in operating profit in 2003, as compared to 2002, was also due to approximately $31.5 million of net restructuring charges included in our results for 2002, compared to a net restructuring credit of $1.9 million in 2003. Amortization of intangibles was $26.0 million for the year ended December 28, 2003, versus $25.5 million for the year ended December 29, 2002. 2002 Compared to 2001. Sales for 2002 were $991.7 million, versus $914.5 million in 2001, an increase of $77.2 million, or 8%. The increase in sales in 2002, as compared to 2001, was primarily because our results for 2002 included a full year of results from Packard, which we acquired in November 2001, and our results for 2001 included only two months, or $40 million, of results from Packard. Sales by Packard for the first ten months of 2001 prior to acquisition were approximately $165 million. Partially offsetting the effects in 2002 of including the results of Packard was the absence of results in 2002 from our IRAS business, which we divested in the fourth quarter of 2001. Sales from that business were $47.4 million in 2001. Changes in foreign exchange rates, primarily the Euro, increased sales by approximately $18 million in 2002 compared to 2001. The following analysis compares selected sales by market and product type for 2002, as compared to 2001, and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Sales to biopharmaceutical customers increased $99.4 million, due to the full year impact of the Packard acquisition, service sales increased by $33.6 million, and sales to genetic screening customers increased $8.5 million. These increases were offset in part by a $16.9 million decrease in sales to environmental and chemical analysis customers and our IRAS divestiture. Sales by type of product included increases in sales of consumables of $40.1 million, service of $33.6 million and instruments of $50.9 million, all partially offset by the absence of sales from our divested IRAS business. Sales of our IRAS business in 2001 were $47.4 million. Operating profit for 2002 was $27.4 million, versus $31.4 million in 2001, a decrease of $4.0 million, or 13%. Items contributing to this decrease in operating profit included restructuring charges in 2002 which were $31.5 million, versus $8.7 million in 2001 and gains from dispositions of businesses which were only $5.2 million in 2002, versus $32.1 million in 2001. Increases in operating profit year over year included charges primarily related to the integration and reorganization of Packard, which decreased from $27.8 million in 2001 to $4.8 million in 2002. Operating profit for 2001 also included a $69.0 million charge associated with acquired in process research and development associated with our acquisition of Packard. The favorable impact on operating profit in 2002 from additional sales volume was more than offset by the inclusion of additional costs related to Packard for the full year. Goodwill and intangible asset amortization expenses were $25.6 million for 2002 and $34.2 million for 2001. Optoelectronics 2003 Compared to 2002. Sales for 2003 were $351.8 million, versus $323.8 million for 2002, an increase of $28.0 million, or 9%. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by approximately $10.0 million, or 3%. The following analysis compares selected sales by product line for 2003, as compared to 2002, and includes the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. Sales of specialty lighting products increased by $20.2 million due to growth in sales of flash products and sales of digital imaging products increased by $17.7 million due to increased sales of diagnostic and radiotherapy digital x ray detector products. These 28 Table of Contents increases were offset in part by sales decreases totaling $9.9 million in our sensors, lithography, and fiber optic test product lines due to limited demand in these end markets. Operating profit for 2003 was $42.2 million, versus an operating loss of $4.0 million for 2002, an increase of $46.2 million. The operating loss for 2002 includes a charge of $17.2 million for an inventory write down which was not repeated in 2003. 2003 included a net restructuring reversal of $1.8 million compared to a net restructuring charge of $3.7 million in 2002. Increased sales and productivity improvements, including improved manufacturing performance and reduced operating expenses, and a headcount reduction of more than 200, contributed a total of approximately $20.0 million in additional operating profit in 2003 compared to 2002. Amortization of intangible assets was $1.2 million for 2003 and $1.3 million for 2002. 2002 Compared to 2001. Sales for 2002 were $323.8 million, versus $380.2 million for 2001, a decrease of $56.4 million, or 15%. The decrease in sales in 2002 was primarily due to the absence of sales from divested specialty lighting businesses and product lines which accounted for $39.4 million in sales for 2001. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by approximately $3.0 million, or 1%. The following analysis compares selected sales by product line for 2002, as compared to 2001, and includes the effects of changes in foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Sales of digital imaging products increased by $30.2 million due primarily to increased sales of digital x ray detector products. Sales of sensor products decreased by $12.3 million and sales within our fiber optic test and lithography businesses decreased $35.6 million as a result of weak market demand. Sales decreased by $38.7 million in our specialty lighting products business, mainly due to the previously referenced divested businesses and product lines. Operating loss for 2002 was $4.0 million, versus an operating profit of $51.3 million for 2001, a decrease of $55.3 million. The decrease in 2002 operating profit was primarily the result of lower sales, the inclusion in 2002 of an inventory write down of $17.2 million and a restructuring charge of $3.7 million. Goodwill and intangible asset amortization was $1.3 million for 2002 and $7.0 million for 2001. Fluid Sciences 2003 Compared to 2002. Sales for 2003 were $179.7 million, versus $189.5 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.8 million, or 5%. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by approximately $2 million, or 1%. The following analysis compares selected sales by product line for 2003, as compared to 2002, and includes the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. Sales declines of $4.4 million in our semiconductor products due to declining demand, and $2.7 million in our energy technology products, were the most significant contributors to the reduction in sales in 2003 compared to 2002. In addition, sales to our aerospace and fluid testing customers declined modestly by $1.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively, in two difficult markets. Operating profit for 2003 was $17.9 million, versus $17.5 million for 2002, an increase of $0.4 million, or 2%. The increase in operating profit resulted primarily from shifting production to lower cost locations in Asia, cost controls, cost reduction actions and other productivity improvements resulting from Six Sigma and lean manufacturing initiatives that more than offset an operating profit decrease due to reduced sales. Amortization of intangible assets was $1.1 million for 2003 and $1.5 million for 2002. 2002 Compared to 2001. Sales for 2002 were $189.5 million, versus $230.6 million for 2001, a decrease of $41.1 million, or 18%. The decrease in sales in 2002, as compared to 2001, was primarily attributable to a reduction in sales of $31.6 million in aerospace products where market conditions deteriorated in the wake of the events of September 11. Sales decreases of $6.1 million in the fluid testing business and $3.6 million in the semiconductor business also contributed to the sales decline in 2002 compared to 2001. These decreases were offset by a $0.2 million increase in our energy technology business in 2002, as compared to 2001. Operating profit for 2002 was $17.5 million, versus $57.3 million for 2001, a decrease of $39.8 million, or 69%. The decrease in operating profit in 2002, as compared to 2001, was due primarily to the 2002 sales decline discussed above and associated underutilization of capacity, as well as the cost of relocating manufacturing facilities to lower cost locations. The 2001 operating profit included $6.6 million in gains from the sale of two businesses during the first half of 2001. Goodwill and intangible asset amortization expenses were $1.5 million for 2002 and $2.7 million for 2001. 29 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources We require cash to pay our operating expenses, make capital expenditures, service our debt and other long term liabilities and pay dividends on our common stock. Our principal sources of funds are from our operations and the capital markets, particularly the debt markets. In the next twelve months, we anticipate that our operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures, interest payments on our debt and dividends on our common stock. Beyond the next twelve months, we expect to use internally generated funds and external sources to satisfy our debt and other long term liabilities. Principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include: deterioration of sales due to weakness in markets in which we sell our products and services, changes in our working capital requirements, and our ability to successfully repatriate cash balances from our foreign subsidiaries for use in settling domestic obligations. Principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include: financial covenants contained in our borrowings that limit our total borrowing capacity, increases in interest rates applicable to our outstanding variable rate debt, a ratings downgrade that would limit our ability to borrow under our accounts receivable facility and our overall access to the corporate debt market, volatility in the markets for corporate debt, a decrease in the market price for our common stock, and volatility in the public equity markets. Cash Flows Fiscal Year 2003 Operating Activities. Net cash generated by continuing operations was $160.4 million in 2003. Contributing to the generation of cash from operating activities during 2003 was net income from continuing operations of $55.0 million and a decrease in working capital accounts of $72.2 million. Contributing to the decrease in working capital in 2003 were reductions in accounts receivable of $43.4 million and inventory of $28.2 million. In general, accounts receivable and inventory levels declined due to our focus on customer payment terms as well as enhanced inventory management. Accounts receivable also decreased as a result of increased use of our accounts receivable securitization facility, which increased $16 million, from $29 million at December 29, 2002 to $45 million at December 28, 2003. Cash outlays for accrued expenses, restructuring and other assets and liabilities totaled $51.9 million during 2003, primarily as a result of payments toward restructuring plans and other obligations. We expect our restructuring expenditures to be reduced in 2004. Investing Activities. In 2003, we withdrew $187.5 million of cash held in escrow to retire substantially all of our remaining outstanding indebtedness under our zero coupon convertible debentures. In 2003, we made capital expenditures of $16.6 million mainly in the areas of tooling and productivity improvements along with system and facility costs related to integration activities. Net proceeds from the dispositions of businesses and fixed assets during 2003 were $4.4 million. We derived $3.3 million of these proceeds from the sale of a building made redundant due to integration activities. In 2004, we expect to incur approximately $40 million in capital expenditures. Financing Activities. In 2003, we used $298.4 million of net cash for financing activities. We expended $187.5 million of cash withdrawn from our designated escrow account along with approximately $2.4 million of available cash to redeem our outstanding zero coupon convertible debentures. Debt reductions during 2003 also included $70.0 million of cash used to repay a portion of our term loan. In December 2003, we amended our credit facility to, among other things, reduce the interest rate applicable to our term loan. We paid 30 Table of Contents $4.4 million in transaction fees during 2003 in connection with that amendment. We also paid $35.4 million in dividends and received net cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $3.6 million in 2003. Fiscal Year 2002 Operating Activities. Net cash generated by continuing operations was $114.5 million in 2002. Contributing to the generation of cash from operating activities during 2002 was a decrease in working capital of $97.4 million. The working capital decrease during 2002 reflects improved working capital management as well as a $17.2 million inventory adjustment within our Optoelectronics reporting segment, offset in part by a net decrease of $8.0 million in proceeds from our receivable securitization program. We decreased inventory levels by $48.2 million during 2002, including a $17.2 million Optoelectronics inventory adjustment, on lower sales volume. Cash outlays for accrued expenses, restructuring and other assets and liabilities totaled $49.2 million during 2002, primarily as a result of payments toward restructuring plans and the settlement of payroll, professional fees, hedging and other obligations. Investing Activities. In 2002, our investing activities used $150.8 million of cash, including placing $186.5 million of cash in escrow, for the purpose of retiring some of our outstanding indebtedness under our zero coupon convertible debentures. We made capital expenditures of $37.8 million mainly in the areas of tooling and process improvement for our drug discovery tools business and other products for biopharmaceutical applications. We also expended $30.0 million in the settlement of a lease obligation on our Fremont, California facility resulting in our purchase of this facility. Net proceeds from the dispositions of businesses and fixed assets during 2002 of $126.0 million were primarily from approximately $96.2 million in net proceeds received from the sale of our Security and Detection Systems business during the second quarter of 2002 and approximately $29.8 million associated with the sale of facilities. Cash outflows of $22.5 million associated with acquisitions related primarily to the settlement of liabilities incurred in connection with the Packard acquisition. Financing Activities. In 2002, we generated $24.5 million of net cash from financing activities. Our gross debt levels increased by $81.4 million to $805.5 million at December 29, 2002. Included in this amount was $186.5 million of our outstanding indebtedness under the zero coupon convertible debentures which were not tendered by holders as part of our 2002 refinancing transactions for which we had $186.5 million of cash held in escrow at December 29, 2002 for the purpose of retiring the untendered indebtedness. Reductions in debt included $110.3 million of 6.8% notes due in 2005 and $304.3 million of zero coupon convertible debentures, both of which we repurchased as part of our 2002 debt refinancing transactions. Debt reductions in 2002 also included $118.2 million of 9.375% senior subordinated ten year notes issued by Packard in March 1997, which we repurchased at a rate of 104.688%, and $5.5 million in other credit facilities we paid down during 2002. Offsetting these reductions was our December 2002 issuance of senior subordinated notes which generated proceeds of $297.5 million and our establishment of a term loan which generated proceeds of $315.0 million. In connection with these debt issuances and terminations, we paid $15.8 million in fees during 2002. We also paid $35.3 million in dividends and received net cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $12.9 million in 2002. Borrowing Arrangements Senior Secured Credit Facility. In December 2002, we entered into a senior credit facility. This facility is comprised of a six year term loan in the amount of $315.0 million and a $100.0 million five year revolving credit facility. In 2003, we made $70 million of principal payments on the term loan. Accordingly, at December 28, 2003 we had $245 million outstanding under our term loan with no outstanding principal balance under our revolving credit facility at December 28, 2003 or at any other time during the year. This credit facility is secured primarily by a portion of our subsidiaries domestic assets. In April 2003, we amended our senior credit facility to (1) allow for the sale of our Entertainment Lighting business under the final negotiated terms of that sale and (2) to ensure conformity between the credit agreement governing the facility and the financial covenants negotiated with the lead arranger, Merrill Lynch. The amendment corrected a drafting error in the definition of consolidated interest expense. Under the initial 31 Table of Contents agreement, consolidated interest expense was erroneously defined as being calculated using pro forma, annualized interest expense beginning in the first quarter of 2003 compared to the intended calculation using a rolling quarter methodology as originally agreed. The definition of consolidated interest expense under the amended agreement was changed to properly state the calculation as a rolling four quarter methodology. In December 2003, we amended our senior credit facility to reduce the margin paid on the term loan as well as to amend several restrictive covenants. Interest rates under the senior credit facility applicable to the term loan and to the revolving credit facility are determined as a margin over either the Eurodollar rate or the base rate. The base rate is the higher of (1) the corporate base rate announced from time to time by Bank of America, N.A. and (2) the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points. The applicable margin for the term loan was amended to 225 basis points for the Eurodollar rate, from the original 400 basis points, and to 125 basis points for the base rate, from the original 300 basis points. The applicable margins for the term loan and the revolving credit facility vary based upon our leverage ratio at the end of the prior quarter. We may allocate all or a portion of our indebtedness under the senior credit facility to interest based upon the margin over the Eurodollar rate or the base rate. At December 28, 2003, the Eurodollar rate was approximately 114 basis points and the base rate was 400 basis points resulting in an Eurodollar interest rate on the senior credit facility of 339 basis points. The term loan is repayable in mandatory nominal quarterly installments of $0.8 million of the outstanding balance until December 2007, and thereafter in four equal quarterly installments of 25% of the then outstanding balance until December 2008. Additionally, annual payments of 50% of excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement are payable six months following the end of each fiscal year. In 2003, we made $70 million in principal payments on the term loan. The revolving credit facility is available to us through December 2007 for our working capital needs. At no point in fiscal 2003, did we have any outstanding principal balance under the revolving credit facility. Our senior credit facility contains covenants that require us to maintain specific financial ratios, including: a minimum interest coverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a maximum senior leverage ratio, and a maximum total leverage ratio. As of December 28, 2003, and at all other times during fiscal 2003, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. 8 7/8% Notes. In December 2002, we issued and sold ten year senior subordinated notes at a rate of 8 7/8% with a face value of $300.0 million. We received $297.5 million in gross proceeds from the issuance. We recorded deferred issuance costs of $7.0 million as a non current asset. The debt, which matures in January 2013, is unsecured but is guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries. Interest on our 8 7/8% notes is payable semi annually on January 15 and July 15. Interest payments began on July 15, 2003. In January 2004, we swapped the fixed rate on $100 million of these notes to a floating rate using swap instruments which reset semi annually in arrears based upon six month USD LIBOR. If a change of control occurs, each holder of 8 7/8% notes may require us to repurchase some or all of its notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued interest. Before January 15, 2006, we may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of our 8 7/8% notes with the net proceeds of specified public equity offerings at 108.875% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued interest, if at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes remains outstanding after the redemption. We may redeem some or all of our 8 7/8% notes at any time on or after January 15, 2008, at a redemption price of 104.438%. The redemption price decreases to 102.958% on January 15, 2009, to 101.479% on January 15, 2010 and to 100% on January 15, 2011. The debt is subordinated to our senior credit facility. Our 8 7/8% notes contain financial and other covenants. Most of these covenants terminate if the notes obtain an investment grade rating by 32 Table of Contents Standard & Poors Rating Services and Moodys Investors Service. At December 28, 2003, and at all times during fiscal 2003, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures. Through the first quarter of 2003, we repurchased $344.7 million in accreted amount of our zero coupon convertible debentures due 2020 in open market purchases and through a December 2002 tender offer. We redeemed the remaining $157.4 million of accreted value of zero coupon debentures on August 7, 2003 in accordance with their terms. We used approximately $155.0 million held in escrow pursuant to the terms of our senior secured credit facility along with available cash of approximately $2.4 million, to redeem the zero coupon convertible debentures. As of December 28, 2003 the zero coupon convertible debentures have been fully retired. 6.8% Notes. In December 2002, we initiated a tender offer for all of our outstanding 6.8% notes. We completed the tender offer and repurchased all but $4.7 million of these notes as of December 26, 2002. We paid consent payments pursuant to a consent solicitation we made concurrently with the tender offer. The consent solicitation eliminated substantially all of the restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing our 6.8% notes as of December 29, 2002. We may from time to time repurchase outstanding 6.8% notes through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. These notes are due to be paid in 2005. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Receivables Securitization Facility In December 2001, we established a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary to purchase, on a revolving basis, certain of our accounts receivable balances and simultaneously sell an undivided interest in this pool of receivables to a financial institution. In September 2003, we amended the facility to increase total funding capacity from $50 million to $65 million to expand our sources of liquidity. Amounts funded under this facility were $45.0 million at December 28, 2003 and $29.0 million at December 29, 2002. As of December 28, 2003, we had approximately $20 million of undrawn capacity available under the facility. The facility had an effective interest rate of approximately LIBOR plus 120 basis points as of December 28, 2003. The facility includes conditions that require us to maintain a senior unsecured credit rating of BB or above, as defined by Standard & Poors Rating Services, and Ba2 or above, as defined by Moodys Investors Service. At December 28, 2003, we had a senior unsecured credit rating of BB+ with a stable outlook from Standard & Poors Rating Services, and of Ba2 with a stable outlook from Moodys Investors Service. In January 2004, we entered into an agreement to extend the term of our accounts receivable securitization facility to January 28, 2005 as well as reduce the underlying cost of the facility. Cost reductions in the new agreement would result in an effective interest rate of approximately LIBOR plus 90 basis points based on the drawn balance of $45 million as of December 28, 2003. We expect to renew this facility again in January 2005 as it currently provides us a vehicle to accelerate the cash collection of customer receivables. Dividends Our Board of Directors declared regular quarterly cash dividends of seven cents per share in each quarter of 2003 and 2002, resulting in an annual dividend rate of 28 cents per share. Our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our outstanding 8 7/8% senior subordinated notes contain restrictions that may limit our ability to pay our regular quarterly cash dividend in the future. 33 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 28, 2003: 8.875% Sr. Operating 6.8% Unsecured Subordinated Other Revolving Leases Notes Due 2005 Term Note Notes Due 2013 Debt Facilities Total (In thousands) 2004 $ 33,616 $ $ 3,150 $ $ 2,017 $ 38,783 2005 24,987 4,687 3,150 32,824 2006 22,579 3,150 25,729 2007 13,797 3,150 16,947 2008 12,806 232,400 245,206 2009 and beyond 129,660 $ 297,770 427,430 Total $ 237,445 $ 4,687 $ 245,000 $ 297,770 $ 2,017 $ 786,919 During 2004, we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately $40 million primarily to introduce new products, to improve operating processes, to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations and to reflect investments in information technology. We expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures. New Accounting Pronouncements In January and December 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 and No. 46, revised (FIN 46R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. These statements, which address accounting for entities commonly known as special purpose or off balance sheet entities, require consolidation of certain interests or arrangements by virtue of holding a controlling financial interest in such entities. Certain provisions of FIN 46R related to interests in special purpose entities were applicable for the period ended December 31, 2003. We must apply FIN 46R to our interests in all entities subject to the interpretation as of the first interim or annual period ending after March 15, 2004. We have considered the application of FIN 46 and FIN46R to our investments, receivables securitization program and other business relationships and concluded that the adoption of this new method of accounting for variable interest entities did not and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, income taxes, restructuring, pensions and other post retirement benefits, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue recognition. We record product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and recognition of installation revenue is delayed until the installation is complete. For sales that include customer specified acceptance criteria, revenue is recognized only after the acceptance criteria have been met. Revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the 34 Table of Contents contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. When arrangements include multiple elements, we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element, all in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. Because the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than long term customized projects, we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates. Further, we have not experienced any significant product returns or refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation. Allowances for doubtful accounts. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by (1) applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible; and (2) specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty. Therefore, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts. This would reduce our earnings. Inventory valuation. We initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase and or manufacture. We periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost. Generally, reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand or technological obsolescence of the inventory. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and, when necessary, record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements or historical trailing usage of the product. If our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels, we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory. This would reduce our earnings. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold, resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period. Value of long lived assets, including intangibles. We carry a variety of long lived assets on our balance sheet including property and equipment, investments, identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. We periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based, in part, upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows. We undertake this review (1) on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and non amortizing intangible assets and (2) on a periodic basis for other long lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from those assets may be diminished. Any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings. The 2002 initial assessment of goodwill recoverability under SFAS No. 142 resulted in a $117.8 million charge to our earnings. This charge, relating to goodwill in our lighting reporting unit within our Optoelectronics business segment, was caused by expected declines in profitability and cash flows as a result of softness in key end markets. We completed the annual impairment tests of goodwill for 2003 and concluded that there was no impairment. While we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable, different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets. In addition, we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our intangible assets that are not being amortized at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. If events or circumstances indicate that the useful life of nonamortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite, the assets will be tested for impairment in accordance with SFAS 142. These intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization. Employee compensation and benefits. Retirement and post retirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made by us. We are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied to determine service cost and interest cost to arrive at pension income or expense for the year. As of December 28, 2003, we estimated the expected long term 35 Table of Contents rate of return in the United States was 8.5% percent, and ranged from 2.5% to 7.5% percent for our plans outside the United States. We have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets as well as our current expectations for long term rates of returns for our pension assets. Our management will continue to assess the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption for each plan based on relevant market conditions and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate. Discount rate assumptions were based on the prevailing market long term interest rates at the measurement date. If any of our assumptions were to change, our pension plan expenses would also change. A one percent decrease in the estimated return on plan assets would increase pre tax pension expense by $2.2 million for 2004 in the United States and by $0.6 million for 2004 for all plans outside the United States. Retirement and post retirement benefit plan expense is allocated to cost of sales, research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations. We incurred expenses of $6.2 million in 2003, $3.9 million in 2002 and $2.4 million in 2001 for our retirement and post retirement plans. We expect expenses of approximately $8.4 million in 2004 for our retirement and post retirement plans. We have reduced the volatility in our health care costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature. Under the defined dollar plan feature, our total annual liability for health care costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount, regardless of the nature or cost of the health care needs of that retiree. Our future liability therefore, cannot be impacted by future changes in the cost of health care. Restructuring activities. Our financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals. Our restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of (1) severance benefits to be granted to employees, based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades, (2) costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of sub rental income, and (3) asset impairments as discussed above under Value of Long Lived Assets, Including Intangibles. Because these accruals are estimates, they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention. For example, actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected. In addition, unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates. When such changes in estimates occur, they are reflected in our financial statements on the income statement line entitled restructuring charges, net. Gains or losses on dispositions. When we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation, we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition. This estimate is based on a variety of factors, including current interest in the market, alternative markets for the assets and other relevant factors. If anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation, we record a loss. If anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation, we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated. Accordingly, we may realize amounts different than were first estimated. During the year ended December 28, 2003, we recognized $1.6 million in losses from the dispositions of divested businesses classified as discontinued operations and $2.7 million in gains from the disposition of assets, comprised largely of excess facilities. The $1.6 million included additional losses from the final disposition of our Telecommunications Components and Entertainment Lighting businesses as well as working capital adjustments related to the sale of our Security and Detection business. These losses were offset by gains from the resolution of contingencies associated with the 1999 divestiture of the Technical Services business. Any such changes decrease or increase current earnings and are recorded either against the gains on disposition or discontinued operations line items appearing in our income statement. Income taxes. Our business operations are global in nature, and we are subject to taxes in more than 40 countries. Tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries. We report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law. Our tax provision contemplates tax rates in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax position. Any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of 36 Table of Contents taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change. Such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate. In addition, we have established valuation allowances against a variety of tax attributes, including net operation loss carryforwards, foreign tax credits and other credits. Valuation allowances take into consideration among other things, limitations imposed upon the use of the tax attributes and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed to be recoverable. Improvements or other changes in our operations, domestically and internationally could increase our ability to utilize these tax attributes in the future. The release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our effective tax rate. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks Financial Instruments Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments, marketable securities and accounts receivable. We believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of December 28, 2003. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Transactions covered by hedge contracts include inter company and third party receivables and payables. The contracts are primarily in European and Asian currencies, have maturities that do not exceed 12 months, have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Credit risk is minimal as the foreign exchange instruments are contracted with major banking institutions. Unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and, for hedges designated as cash flow, the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs. For the year ended December 28, 2003, we did not engage in hedges designated as cash flow. The notional amount of the outstanding foreign currency contracts was approximately $168.5 million at December 28, 2003 and $103.0 million as of December 29, 2002, and the approximate fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts designated as fair value hedges was insignificant. The duration of the foreign currency derivative contracts is generally 30 day for 2003. Market Risk Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk, including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures. Foreign Exchange Risk. As a multinational corporation, we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. These exposures can take a variety of different forms: (1) As our international sales grow, exposure to volatility in exchange rates could have a material impact on our financial results. Reported sales made in foreign currencies by our international subsidiaries, when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, can fluctuate due to exchange rate movement. While exchange rate fluctuations can impact reported revenues and earnings, this impact is purely a result of the translation effect and does not materially impact our short term cash flows. (2) In all parts of the world, our subsidiaries, on occasion, invoice third party customers in foreign currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business. We refer to primary business currency as the functional currencies. Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency 37 Table of Contents result in both realized and unrealized transaction gains or losses that directly impact our cash flows and our results of operations. (3) Our manufacturing and distribution organization is worldwide. Accordingly, inventories may be manufactured in one location, stored in another, and distributed in a third location. This results in a wide array of intercompany transactions transactions that are billed and paid in many different currencies. Our cash flows and our results of operations are therefore directly impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates of currencies involved. (4) The cash flow needs of each of our foreign subsidiaries vary through time. Accordingly, there may be times when a subsidiary lends to or borrows from either the parent company or another affiliate. These advances, again being denominated in currencies other than a particular entitys functional currency, can expose it to fluctuations in exchange rates that can impact both our cash flows and results of operations. (5) In order to repay debt or satisfy operational needs, we may remit cash from our foreign locations to the United States. When this occurs, we are liquidating foreign currency net asset positions and converting them into United States dollars. Our cash flows and our results of operations are therefore also impacted by these transactions. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. The derivative instruments held by us are not leveraged and are not held for trading purposes. We specifically use forward contracts to hedge our foreign denominated assets and liabilities and use a combination of forward and option contracts to hedge anticipated cash flows. Our hedging activity is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on assets, liabilities and cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. The success of our hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in various currencies. To the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility, we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses. The principal currencies hedged are the British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen, and Singapore Dollar. In those currencies where there is a liquid, cost effective forward market, we maintain hedge coverage between our established minimum and maximum percentages of our anticipated transaction exposure for periods not to exceed one year. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposure. Foreign Currency Risk Value at Risk Disclosure We utilize a Value at Risk model to determine the potential earning/fair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments. As discussed above, we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program. Our Value at Risk computation is based on the Monte Carlo simulation, utilizing a 95% confidence interval and a holding period of 30 days. As of December 28, 2003, this computation estimated that there is a 5% chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than $0.1 million. This Value at Risk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program. Specifically, during each of the four quarters of fiscal 2003, the Value at Risk ranged between $0.1 million and $1.0 million, and averaged approximately $0.5 million. Interest Rate Risk. As described above, our debt portfolio includes both fixed rate and variable rate instruments. Fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our short term cash flows (as they relate to interest) and our earnings. In January 2004, we initiated, for a portion of our fixed rate debt portfolio, interest rate swaps that in effect convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. These swaps have been designated as fair value hedges. These swaps will be marked to market in our consolidated financial statements so that fair value movements in these swaps will be offset by the fair value movement in the debt. Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity As of December 28, 2003, our debt portfolio is comprised of 55% fixed rate debt and 45% variable rate debt. After giving effect to the interest rate swap entered into in January 2004, 37% of our debt portfolio is fixed and 63% is variable. Our current debt covenants require that we 38 Table of Contents maintain at least 30% of our debt portfolio in fixed rate debt as defined in the credit agreement. Our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows: (1) changes in interest rates can cause interest charges on our variable rate debt comprised of $245 million of term loan and $100 million of swapped 8 7/8% notes to fluctuate. A 10% increase or approximately 40 basis points in current interest rates would cause an additional pre tax charge to our earnings of $1.4 million for fiscal year 2004. (2) changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt to fluctuate. As described above, an increase of 10% or approximately 40 basis points in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by $1.4 million for fiscal year 2004. (3) changes in interest rates can cause the value of our fixed rate debt to change. However, such a value change has no impact on either our earnings or our cash flows unless we determine that we wish to retire this debt in the open market. Forward Looking Information and Factors Affecting Future Performance The following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations: Our operating results may continue to be harmed by cyclical downturns affecting several of the industries into which we sell our products. Some of the industries and markets into which we sell our products are cyclical. Industry downturns are often characterized by reduced product demand, excess manufacturing capacity and erosion of average selling prices and profits. Significant downturns in our customers markets and in general economic conditions have resulted in a reduced demand for several of our products and have hurt our operating results. For example, during 2003, our operating results were adversely affected by downturns in many of the markets we serve, including the pharmaceutical, biomedical, semiconductor and aerospace markets. Current economic conditions have caused a decrease in capital spending by many of our customers, which in turn has adversely affected our sales and business. If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our products could become obsolete and our operating results would suffer. We sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements, our products could become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our sales and operating results would suffer. The success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors, including our ability to: accurately anticipate customer needs, innovate and develop new technologies and applications, successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, price our products competitively and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time, and differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings. Many of our products are used by our customers to develop, test and manufacture their products. Therefore, we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers products. In developing new products, we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product. If we fail to accurately foresee our customers needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant sales. 39 Table of Contents In addition, some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions, which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications. For example, some of our license agreements are limited to the field of life sciences research, and exclude clinical diagnostics applications. Our debt may adversely affect our cash flow and may restrict our investment opportunities. As of December 28, 2003, we had approximately $549.5 million in outstanding indebtedness, excluding obligations under our accounts receivable securitization facility. Our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate sufficient cash to pay the principal or interest in respect of our indebtedness. We have $100.0 million in additional borrowing capacity available to us under our revolving credit facility. We may also obtain additional long term debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage. Our leverage could have negative consequences, including: increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing, limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through acquisitions or licensing, requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we compete, and placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources. A significant portion of our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates. As a result, our interest payment obligations on this indebtedness will increase if interest rates increase. Our ability to satisfy our obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations or to successfully execute our business strategy. If we are unable to service our debt and fund our business, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, seek additional financing or equity capital, restructure or refinance our debt or sell assets. We may not be able to obtain additional financing or refinance existing debt or sell assets on terms acceptable to us or at all. Restrictions in our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our 8 7/8% notes may limit our activities. Our senior credit facility and the indenture relating to our 8 7/8% notes contain, and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may contain, restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company, including restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to: incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock, make investments, create liens, sell assets, 40 Table of Contents in the case of our restricted subsidiaries, incur obligations that restrict their ability to make dividend or other payments to us, in the case of our restricted subsidiaries, guarantee or secure indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliates, create unrestricted subsidiaries, and consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. We are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of our senior credit facility. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology and changes in the level of competition. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date. Also, an acceleration of the debt under our senior credit facility would trigger an event of default under our 8 7/8% notes, and a default under our 8 7/8% notes would trigger an event of default under the senior credit facility and possibly other debt. If an event of default occurs, we may not have sufficient funds available to make the required payments under our indebtedness. If we are unable to repay amounts owed under our senior credit facility, those lenders may be entitled to foreclose on and sell the collateral that secures our borrowings under that agreement. Our inability to repay amounts owed under our senior credit facility may also cause a default under other of our obligations including our accounts receivable securitization facility. Economic, political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales. Because we sell our products worldwide, our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Our sales originating outside the United States represented more than 50% of our total sales in the fiscal year ended December 28, 2003. We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales. In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities, employees and suppliers are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including: changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in a countrys or regions political or economic conditions, particularly in developing or emerging markets, longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, differing tax laws and changes in those laws, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differing labor laws and changes in those laws, differing protection of intellectual property and changes in that protection, and differing regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements. 41 Table of Contents Our quarterly operating results are subject to significant fluctuation, and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate. Given the nature of the markets in which we participate, we cannot reliably predict future sales and profitability. Changes in competitive, market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations, and we can offer no assurance of our ability to make such adjustments or to make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions. A high proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to our significant sales, research and development and manufacturing costs. Thus, small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter. Factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include: demand for and market acceptance of our products, competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices, adverse changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which we do business, adverse changes in industries, such as pharmaceutical, biomedical, semiconductors and aerospace, on which we are particularly dependent, changes in the portions of our sales represented by our various products and customers, delays or problems in the introduction of new products, our competitors announcement or introduction of new products, services or technological innovations, increased costs of raw materials or supplies, and changes in the volume or timing of product orders. We may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or license technologies, integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing business or make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable. We have in the past, and may in the future, supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines, such as our acquisition of Packard BioScience Company in November 2001. We may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons, including: competition among buyers and licensees, the need for regulatory and other approvals, our inability to raise capital to fund these acquisitions, the high valuations of businesses and technologies, and restrictions in the instruments governing our indebtedness, including the indenture governing the notes and our new senior credit facility. Some of the businesses we may seek to acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable. Accordingly, the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings. For these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability, we must improve their management, operations, products and market penetration. We may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations. To finance our acquisitions, we may have to raise additional funds, either through public or private financings. We may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us. 42 Table of Contents If we do not successfully integrate our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments business units, we may not achieve the benefits we anticipate we will derive from the combination of these businesses. In 2003, we achieved in excess of the original range of $12 to $25 million in pre tax cost savings from the combination of our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses, announced in the fourth quarter of 2002. In 2004, we are targeting additional pre tax cost savings of between $5.0 million and $20.0 million, for a combined pre tax cost savings of between $30.0 million and $45.0 million relative to fiscal 2002 cost levels. While we believe these cost savings to be reasonable, they are estimates that are inherently difficult to predict, are necessarily speculative in nature and are subject to various integration risks. The integration risks include the possibility that we may experience a loss of productivity, sales and key personnel and that the information technology systems of these two businesses may not be fully compatible. If any of the potential difficulties were to occur and persist, the business results of our Life and Analytical Sciences reporting segment could suffer. In addition, unforeseen factors may offset some or all of the estimated cost savings or other benefits from the integration. As a result of these integration risks and possible unforeseen factors, our actual cost savings, if any, could differ or be delayed, compared to our estimates. Moreover, our capability to more fully capitalize, through their combination, on the strengths of our former Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses sales, service and research and development organizations may be compromised. Our loss of licenses may require us to stop selling products or lose competitive advantage. We may not be able to renew our existing licenses or licenses we may obtain in the future on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology, we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products, redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage. Potential competitors could in license technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share. Our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations. If we fail to comply with these obligations we could lose important rights under a license, such as the right to exclusivity in a market. In some cases, we could lose all rights under the license. In addition, rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control. For example, the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons, including invalidity of the licensed patent, or a third party could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses. If we do not compete effectively, our business will be harmed. We encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business. We may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors. To remain competitive, we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products. We anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive. In addition, new competitors, technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines. If we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the United States Food and Drug Administration and other governmental agencies, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties. Some of the products produced by our Life and Analytical Sciences business unit are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration and similar international agencies. In addition, some of the activities of our Fluid Sciences business unit are subject to regulation by the United States Federal Aviation Administration. These regulations govern a wide variety of product activities, from design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales, resales and distribution. If we fail to comply with those regulations or those of similar international agencies, we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution. In addition, we could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution. 43 Table of Contents Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. We compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal, state, local and foreign regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products. Obtaining and enforcing patent protection for our proprietary products, processes and technologies may be difficult and expensive; we may infringe intellectual property rights of third parties. Patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing and marketing new technologies and products is time consuming and expensive. We own many United States and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents to cover our products. We may not obtain issued patents from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. The claims allowed under any issued patents may not be broad enough to protect our technology. Third parties may seek to challenge, invalidate or circumvent issued patents owned by or licensed to us or claim that our products and operations infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights. In addition to our patents, we possess an array of unpatented proprietary technology and know how and we license intellectual property rights to and from third parties. The measures that we employ to protect this technology and these rights may not be adequate. Moreover, in some cases, the licensor can terminate a license or convert it to a non exclusive arrangement if we fail to meet specified performance targets. We may incur significant expense in any legal proceedings to protect our proprietary rights or to defend infringement claims by third parties. In addition, claims of third parties against us could result in awards of substantial damages or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing, using, importing or selling our products in the United States or abroad. Our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets. As of December 28, 2003, our total assets included $1.5 billion of net intangible assets. Net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights, trademark rights and technology licenses, net of accumulated amortization. These assets have historically been amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives. In connection with our adoption of SFAS No. 142, we discontinued the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets beginning in fiscal 2002. Instead, we test these items, at a minimum, on an annual basis for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned. Future impairment testing may result in additional intangible asset write offs, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 44 Table of Contents
