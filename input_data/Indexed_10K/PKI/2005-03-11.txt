Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This annual report on Form 10 K, including the following managements discussion and analysis, contains forward looking information that you should read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements that we have included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. For this purpose, any statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements. Words such as believes, plans, anticipates, expects, will and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from the plans, intentions or expectations we disclose in the forward looking statements we make. We have included important factors below under the heading Forward Looking Information and Factors Affecting Future Performance that we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements we make. We are not obligated to publicly update any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Overview We are a leading provider of scientific instruments, consumables and services to the pharmaceutical, biomedical, environmental testing and general industrial markets. We design, manufacture, market and service products and systems within three businesses, each constituting one reporting segment: Life and Analytical Sciences. We are a leading provider of drug discovery, genetic screening and environmental and chemical analysis tools, including instruments, reagents, consumables and services. Optoelectronics. We provide a broad range of digital imaging, sensor and specialty lighting components used in the biomedical, consumer products and other specialty end markets. Fluid Sciences. We provide a variety of precision valves, seals, bellows and pneumatic joints for critical control and containment systems for highly demanding environments such as turbine engines and semiconductor fabrication equipment. Formation of our Life and Analytical Sciences Business Unit We combined our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses to form our Life and Analytical Sciences business in the fourth quarter of 2002 to improve our operational scale, which we believe is enabling us to better serve our customers and more fully capitalize on the strengths of the combined businesses sales, service and research and development organizations. In the second quarter of 2003, we completed many of the changes involved in combining the two businesses, including the integration of facilities and management reporting and other systems. Accounting Period Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest December 31. We report fiscal years under a 52/53 week format. Under this method, certain years will contain 53 weeks. The fiscal year ended January 2, 2005 included 53 weeks. The fiscal years ended December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002 included 52 weeks. We believe that this additional week of operations had a $2.9 million beneficial impact on revenue and an immaterial impact on operating profit. Consolidated Results of Continuing Operations Sales 2004 Compared to 2003. Sales for 2004 were $1,687.2 million, versus $1,532.1 million during 2003, an increase of $155.1 million, or 10%. Changes in foreign exchange rates, primarily the Euro, increased sales by approximately $47.1 million in 2004, as compared to 2003. The overall increase in sales reflects a $59.1 million, or 6%, increase in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment sales, which grew from $1,003.7 million in 2003 to 18 Table of Contents $1,062.8 in 2004, and reflects approximately $39.2 million in sales attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates, as compared to 2003. Our Optoelectronics segment sales grew $31.9 million, or 9%, from $348.7 million in 2003 to $380.6 million in 2004, including approximately $6.5 million in sales attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates, as compared to 2003. The Fluid Sciences segment grew sales by $64.1 million, or 36%, from $179.7 million in 2003 to $243.8 million in 2004, including approximately $1.4 attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates, as compared to 2003. 2003 Compared to 2002. Sales for 2003 were $1,532.1 million, versus $1,501.0 million during 2002, an increase of $31.1 million, or 2%. Changes in foreign exchange rates, primarily the Euro, increased sales by approximately $73.0 million in 2003, as compared to 2002. The overall increase in sales reflects a $12.0 million, or 1%, increase in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment sales, which grew from $991.7 million in 2002 to $1,003.7 in 2003, and includes approximately $61.0 million in sales attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates, as compared to 2002. Our Optoelectronics segment sales grew $28.9 million, or 9%, from $319.8 million in 2002 to $348.7 million in 2003, including approximately $10.0 million in sales attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates, as compared to 2002. The increased sales in our Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics segments were offset by a decrease in sales of $9.8 million, or 5%, in our Fluid Sciences segment, which declined from $189.5 million in 2002 to $179.7 million in 2003. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased Fluid Sciences segment sales by approximately $2.4 million in 2003, as compared to 2002. Cost of Sales 2004 Compared to 2003. Cost of sales for 2004 was $1,006.7 million, versus $900.8 million for 2003, an increase of $105.9 million, or 11.8%. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased to 59.7% in 2004 from 58.8% in 2003, resulting in a decrease in gross margin of 90 basis points from 41.2% in 2003 to 40.3% in 2004. The decrease in gross margin was largely attributable to greater revenue contribution, as a percentage of overall sales, from Optoelectronics and Fluid Sciences versus Life and Analytical Sciences. Although our Optoelectronics and Fluid Sciences segments have lower gross margins than our Life and Analytical Sciences segment, they also have lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales. 2003 Compared to 2002. Cost of sales for 2003 was $900.8 million, versus $898.5 million for 2002, an increase of $2.3 million, or 0.2%. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased to 58.8% in 2003 from 59.9% in 2002, resulting in an increase in gross margin of 110 basis points from 40.1% in 2002 to 41.2% in 2003. The 110 basis point increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to a 2002 $17.2 million inventory adjustment charge recorded within our Optoelectronics segment. We did not record a similar charge in 2003. Research and Development Expenses 2004 Compared to 2003. Research and development expenses for 2004 were $87.1 million versus $81.4 million in 2003, an increase of $5.7 million, or 7%. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses decreased to 5.2% in 2004 from 5.3% in 2003, due to the increase in sales. We directed research and development efforts during 2004 and 2003 primarily toward genetic screening and biopharmaceutical end markets within our Life and Analytical Sciences reporting segment and medical digital imaging and Cermax lighting within our Optoelectronics reporting segment. We expect our research and development spending to increase in 2005 and to continue to emphasize the health sciences end markets. 2003 Compared to 2002. Research and development expenses for 2003 were $81.4 million versus $85.0 million in 2002, a decrease of $3.6 million, or 4%. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses decreased to 5.3% in 2003 from 5.7% in 2002, primarily due to our consolidation of research and development activities to take advantage of increased synergies and corresponding cost savings as a result of fewer sites. We directed research and development efforts during 2003 and 2002 primarily toward genetic screening and biopharmaceutical end markets within our Life and Analytical Sciences reporting segment, and medical digital imaging and industrial sensors within our Optoelectronics reporting segment. 19 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2004 Compared to 2003. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2004 were $387.5 million, versus $386.0 million for 2003, an increase of $1.5 million, or 0.4%. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 220 basis points to 23.0% in 2004 from 25.2% in 2003. The decrease as a percentage of sales of 220 basis points in 2004 was predominately due to net productivity improvements and cost reductions in our Life and Analytical Sciences reporting segment. 2003 Compared to 2002. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2003 were $386.0 million, versus $430.8 million for 2002, a decrease of $44.8 million, or 10%. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 350 basis points to 25.2% in 2003 from 28.7% in 2002. Proportionately, the decrease as a percentage of sales of 350 basis points in 2003 was due to a 200 basis point decrease attributable to reduced expenses in Life and Analytical Sciences, a 100 basis point decrease in Optoelectronics and a 50 basis point decrease in Fluid Sciences. The overall decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to productivity improvements throughout our company, including cost savings we derived from restructuring actions. Restructuring (Reversals) Charges, Net 2004 Compared to 2003. Restructuring charges for 2004 were zero versus $3.5 million of net reversals for 2003. The 2003 reversals comprised a combination of our 2003 changes in estimates of $5.8 million and our 2003 charges of $2.3 million. The following table summarizes our restructuring accrual balances and related activity by restructuring plan during 2004, 2003 and 2002: Balance at 12/31/2001 2002 Charges 2002 Amountspaid andincurred 2002 Changes in Estimates Balance at 12/29/2002 2003 Charges 2003 Amountspaid andincurred 2003 Changes in Estimates Balance at 12/28/2003 2004 Amountspaid Balance at 1/02/2005 (In thousands) Pre 2001 plans $ 1,951 $ $ (1,022 ) $ (929 ) $ $ $ $ $ $ $ Q4 2001 plan 7,586 (4,891 ) 1,380 4,075 (3,434 ) 1,830 2,471 (965 ) 1,506 Q1 2002 plan 9,198 (8,046 ) 1,152 (52 ) (1,000 ) 100 (100 ) Q4 2002 plan 26,049 (1,697 ) 24,352 (13,813 ) (6,239 ) 4,300 (3,330 ) 970 Q2 2003 plan 2,251 (1,582 ) (381 ) 288 (86 ) 202 Total $ 9,537 $ 35,247 $ (15,656 ) $ 451 $ 29,579 $ 2,251 $ (18,881 ) $ (5,790 ) $ 7,159 $ (4,481 ) $ 2,678 Q2 2003 Plan: During 2003, we incurred a $2.3 million restructuring charge in Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics, which we refer to as our Q2 2003 Plan. The purpose of the restructuring was to further improve performance and take advantage of synergies between our former Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses which we began integrating in the fourth quarter of 2002. The principal actions in this restructuring plan included lower headcount due to the continued integration of the Life and Analytical Sciences business in a European manufacturing and customer care center as well, as headcount reduction at one of the Optoelectronics manufacturing facilities to reflect recent declining demand for several product lines. We planned to reduce headcount by 120. We recorded restructuring charges by segment for 2003 as follows: (In millions) Life and Analytical Sciences Optoelectronics Total Q2 2003 Plan $2.0 $0.3 $2.3 This restructuring charge was primarily recorded in the second quarter of 2003. However, we recorded additional charges of $0.5 million and $0.1 million in the third and fourth quarters of 2003, as required by SFAS 146, as some employees who were notified of their employment termination in the second quarter were required to work for a period of time prior to receiving their severance. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2003, we 20 Table of Contents recorded a pre tax restructuring reversal of $0.4 million due to 30 fewer employee terminations as a result of higher attrition rates in several countries prior to ultimate termination and, accordingly, lower severance costs. During 2004, we completed all actions under the Q2 2003 Plan, with the exception of a headcount reduction of one person that we expect to complete by the second quarter of 2005. Q4 2002 Plan: In connection with our decision to combine our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses in order to reduce costs and achieve operational efficiencies, we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of $26.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2002, which we refer to as our Q4 2002 Plan. The Q4 2002 Plan allowed us to combine many business functions worldwide, with the intention to better serve our customers and more fully capitalize on the strengths of the businesses sales, service and research and development organizations. The principal actions in the Q4 2002 Plan included planned workforce reductions of 546 people, closure of approximately 20 facilities and disposal of underutilized assets. The Q4 2002 Plan resulted in the integration of our United States Life and Analytical Sciences sales, service and customer care centers, the integration of European customer care and finance centers, the merging of a former Life Sciences European manufacturing facility with a former Analytical Instruments European manufacturing facility, and the merging of a portion of a former Life Sciences research and development facility in Europe with a former Analytical Instruments facility in Europe. During 2003, we expended $13.8 million to execute these actions. In addition, we recorded a reversal of $6.2 million in the Q4 2002 Plan due to 182 fewer terminations as a result of higher than expected employee attrition rates in several countries prior to ultimate termination and lower severance costs for actual terminations. During 2004, we expended an additional $3.3 million to execute these actions. The remaining liability associated with the Q4 2002 Plan represents severance related to 11 employees and ongoing lease commitments. We expect to settle the remaining severance liability by the end of the first quarter of 2005. Our current estimate is that our lease commitments on unoccupied buildings vary in length but primarily extend until mid 2005. Q1 2002 Plan: During the first quarter of 2002, our management developed a plan to restructure several businesses. We refer to these activities as our Q1 2002 Plan. The plan resulted in pre tax restructuring charges totaling $9.2 million. The principal actions in the Q1 2002 Plan included planned workforce and overhead reductions resulting from reorganization activities, including the closure of a manufacturing facility, disposal of underutilized assets and general cost reductions. Q1 2002 Plan charges in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment totaled $5.5 million. These charges comprised $4.4 million in severance costs, $1.0 million in asset impairments and $0.1 million in lease commitments. The charges were a result of actions we took as a response to decreased sales of components in our Life and Analytical Sciences business. These actions under the charges primarily included the downsizing of an additional manufacturing location and streamlining of the global sales and research and development organizations, primarily in Europe, Japan and the Pacific Rim. We took these actions to reduce the number of employees in components of our business that had experienced declining demand. Q1 2002 Plan charges in our Optoelectronics segment totaled $3.7 million, comprising $3.5 million in severance costs and $0.2 million in asset write offs. This charge was primarily due to the removal of a layer of management structure within our Optoelectronics reporting segment which led to a flatter and less expensive organization structure. Total headcount was reduced by 276. 21 Table of Contents During 2003, we recorded a restructuring reversal of $1.0 million in the Q1 2002 Plan primarily due to lower than expected employee separation costs associated with our Optoelectronics segment. During 2004, we expended $0.1 million to complete the remaining actions associated with the Q1 2002 Plan. Q4 2001 Plan: During the fourth quarter of 2001, in connection with the integration of Packard and a restructuring of our sales offices in Europe, we recorded a restructuring charge of $9.2 million in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment and incurred $1.6 million in charges in 2002. We refer to these activities as our Q4 2001 Plan. The principal actions in the Q4 2001 Plan included the closing or consolidation of several leased sales and services offices in Europe, as well as costs associated with the closure of a manufacturing facility in Europe, the closure of leased manufacturing facilities in the United States and the disposal of related assets. In 2003, we recorded an additional pre tax restructuring charge associated with the Q4 2001 Plan of $1.8 million. This charge was primarily due to additional severance and severance related benefits of the previously identified employees associated with the closure of our European manufacturing facility in the Life and Analytical Sciences segment. In 2004, we expended $1.0 million to execute the actions associated with the Q4 2001 Plan. We will pay the remaining balance in 2005 for previously identified employees associated with the closure of our European manufacturing facility in the Life and Analytical Sciences segment. (Losses) Gains on Dispositions 2004 Compared to 2003. Dispositions resulted in a net loss of $0.4 million in 2004 versus a net gain of $2.7 million in 2003. Loss on dispositions in 2004 included a $0.7 million loss from the sale of a business and was partially offset by a $0.3 million gain from the sale of facilities. Gains on dispositions in 2003 included $2.2 million from sales of facilities and $0.5 million from post closing adjustments relating to the resolution of contingencies related to the sale of our Instruments for Research and Applied Sciences business, which we refer to as IRAS. 2003 Compared to 2002. Dispositions resulted in a net gain of $2.7 million in 2003 versus a net gain of $5.2 million in 2002. Gains on dispositions in 2002 included $4.4 million from the sale of facilities and $0.8 million from post closing entries relating to our sale of our IRAS business, which was formerly part of our Life and Analytical Sciences segment. Amortization of Intangible Assets 2004 Compared to 2003. Amortization of intangible assets was $28.5 million in 2004 and $28.3 million in 2003. Slight increases in the Life and Analytical Sciences amortization due to the effect of foreign exchange were partially offset by slight decreases in Fluid Sciences amortization. 2003 Compared to 2002. Amortization of intangible assets was $28.3 million for both 2003 and 2002. Slight increases in the Life and Analytical Sciences amortization due to the effect of foreign exchange were offset by slight decreases in Optoelectronics and Fluid Sciences amortization. 22 Table of Contents Interest and Other Expense, Net Interest and other expense, net consisted of the following: 2004 2003 2002 (In thousands) Interest income $ (2,394 ) $ (2,488 ) $ (3,161 ) Interest expense 37,952 52,586 32,096 Losses on sale of investments, net 300 2,391 1,987 Extinguishment of debt 4,143 1,953 353 Other 322 1,954 1,585 $ 40,323 $ 56,396 $ 32,860 2004 Compared to 2003. Interest and other expense, net for 2004 was $40.3 million versus $56.4 million for 2003, a decrease of $16.1 million or 29%. The decrease in interest and other expense, net in 2004 as compared to 2003, was due primarily to approximately $100.0 million of lower average outstanding term loan balances combined with lower interest rates applicable to our term loan due to an amendment of our credit facility in the fourth quarter of 2003. A more complete discussion of our liquidity is set forth below under the heading, Liquidity and Capital Resources. The remaining decrease in interest and other expense was the result of (i) swapping $100 million of our 8.875% Notes from fixed rate debt to a floating rate based on six month USD Libor in January 2004, resulting in a $2.2 million decrease in interest expense, and (ii) $2.3 million of net interest expense not incurred in 2004 as it was related to our zero coupon convertible debentures which we redeemed in 2003. The decrease in interest and other expense was partially offset by our increased acceleration of debt issuance costs of $4.1 million resulting from partial prepayments of our term debt during 2004 versus $1.9 million in 2003. We expect interest expense in 2005 to decrease due to lower outstanding debt balances and the expected benefit derived from the January 2005 swapping of an additional $100 million of our 8.875% Notes from fixed rate debt to a floating rate based on six month USD Libor. 2003 Compared to 2002. Interest and other expense, net for 2003 was $56.4 million versus $32.9 million for 2002, an increase of $23.5 million or 71%. The increase in interest and other expense, net in 2003 as compared to 2002, was due primarily to higher average borrowing rates resulting from our financing completed in December 2002. The remaining increase in interest and other expense, net of $3.0 million was due primarily to our increased acceleration of the amortization of debt issuance costs of $1.9 million resulting from partial prepayments of our term debt during 2003 versus $0.4 million in 2002 and $0.6 million of transaction costs we incurred in the fourth quarter of 2003 in connection with amending our credit facility to reduce the margin applicable to our term loan. Provision/Benefit for Income Taxes 2004 Compared to 2003. The 2004 provision for income taxes was $38.5 million, versus a provision of $27.5 million in 2003. The 2004 effective tax rate was 28.2% as compared to the 2003 effective tax rate of 32.2%. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily due to $10.4 million of benefit associated with the resolution of our successful appeal in 2004 of an Internal Revenue Service audit finding with respect to our 1997 and 1998 taxes, additional benefits resulting from the conclusion of Canadian and U.K. tax audits, reduction in state tax expense and our use of existing, and our reduced generation of new, net operating losses. These benefits were partially offset by an accrual of $8.7 million for the estimated U.S. tax cost of repatriation calculated under the homeland investment provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. 2003 Compared to 2002. The 2003 provision for income taxes was $27.5 million, versus a benefit of $3.5 million in 2002. Our 2003 effective tax rate was 32.2% as compared to our 2002 effective tax rate of 69.7%. The change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a relatively high ratio in 2002 of permanent tax differences to loss from continuing operations before income taxes. 23 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations We recorded the following gains and losses, which we report as the loss on dispositions of discontinued operations, during the years ended January 2, 2005 and December 28, 2003: 2004 2003 (in thousands) Loss on Electroformed Products business $ (1,606 ) $ Loss on Computer To Plate business (951 ) Gain on the resolution of contingencies associated with the Technical Services business 1,487 6,535 Loss on the sale of the Security and Detection Systems business (2,414 ) Loss on Entertainment Lighting business 255 (1,957 ) Loss on Telecommunications Component business (1 ) (2,383 ) Net loss on disposition of discontinued operations before income taxes (816 ) (219 ) Benefit (provision) for income taxes 321 (229 ) Loss on disposition of discontinued operations, net of income taxes $ (495 ) $ (448 ) As part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities, in June 2004, we approved a plan to shut down our Electroformed Products business and sell our Ultraviolet Lighting business. In September 2004, we approved a plan to shut down our Computer To Plate business. We previously had reported the results of all three of these businesses as part of the Optoelectronics reporting segment. We have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations in accordance with SFAS No. 144 and, accordingly, have presented the results of operations and related cash flows as part of discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of these businesses have been presented separately and are reflected within the assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying balance sheets as of January 2, 2005 and December 28, 2003. The net assets of the Electroformed Products business were written off resulting in a $1.6 million pre tax loss for the year ended January 2, 2005. We sold the fixed assets and inventory of the Ultraviolet Lighting business in July 2004 for their approximate book value. The abandonment of the Computer To Plate business resulted in a $1.0 million write down of fixed assets and inventory which we recognized in our loss on dispositions for the year ended January 2, 2005. During 2004 and 2003, we settled various claims under certain long term contracts and transition services with our Technical Services business, which we sold in August 1999. The net settlement and the reversal of certain previously established contingencies resulted in pre tax gains of $1.5 million in 2004 and $6.5 million in 2003 that are included in gain (loss) on dispositions of discontinued operations. We reversed contingencies in the period in which the related issues were resolved. We may increase or reverse remaining contingencies in the future, pending resolution of the underlying matters. In June 2002, we completed the sale of our Security and Detection Systems business for cash consideration of approximately $100.0 million and a net working capital adjustment. We recorded a net pre tax gain of approximately $15.0 million pursuant to this transaction in 2002 as a gain on the disposition of discontinued operations. We accounted for our Security and Detection Systems business as a discontinued operation in accordance with APB No. 30, and accordingly, the results of operations and related cash flows of this business through the disposal date were segregated from continuing operations and reported as a separate line on our consolidated income statements. We have presented the resulting gain from the sale as a component of net income within dispositions of discontinued operations, net of income tax on our 2002 consolidated income statement. Adjustments relating to this sale resulted in a pre tax loss from discontinued operations of $2.4 million in 2003, primarily due to revised estimates of the working capital adjustment. In June 2002, our Board of Directors approved a plan to shut down our Telecommunications Components business as of June 30, 2002 and a plan to sell our Entertainment Lighting business as part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities. We have reflected both businesses as discontinued operations in 24 Table of Contents our consolidated financial statements. As of June 29, 2003, we had exited our Entertainment Lighting business, completing the sale of a substantial portion of that business for cash consideration of $1.4 million and abandoning the remaining assets. We recorded a gain of $0.3 million in fiscal 2004 and a net loss of $2.0 million in fiscal 2003 pursuant to this transaction. Summary operating results of the discontinued operations of the Security and Detection Systems, Telecommunications Component, Entertainment Lighting, Electroformed Products, Ultraviolet Lighting and Computer To Plate businesses for the periods prior to disposition were as follows: 2004 2003 (In thousands) Sales $ 3,394 $ 7,388 Costs and expenses 6,298 14,650 Operating loss from discontinued operations (2,904 ) (7,262 ) Other expense (214 ) (283 ) Loss from discontinued operations before income taxes (2,690 ) (6,979 ) Benefit from income taxes (976 ) (2,453 ) Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes $ (1,714 ) $ (4,526 ) Effect of Accounting Change As required by SFAS 142, we completed the transitional impairment analysis of our recorded goodwill as of January 1, 2002. In connection with the adoption of this standard, we reviewed our forecasts and projections of all of our reporting units and determined that, based on decreased demand for certain specialty lamps resulting from a downturn in the printed circuit board production worldwide and other smaller markets, the fair value of the lighting reporting unit was less than its carrying value. With the assistance of valuation specialists and using a discounted cash flow model, we determined that the carrying value of the recorded goodwill was in excess of the fair value of that goodwill. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge totaling $117.8 million as a cumulative effect of an accounting change. The entire transition adjustment related to our lighting reporting unit within our Optoelectronics reporting segment. In addition, as part of our ongoing compliance with SFAS No. 142, we completed our annual assessment of goodwill using a measurement date of January 3, 2005. This annual assessment did not result in an impairment charge. Acquisitions and Divestitures In February 2005, we acquired Elcos AG, a leading European designer and manufacturer of custom light emitting diode, or LED, solutions for biomedical and industrial applications. The transaction combines Elcos visible LED technology platform and strong customer and application base with our global sales, application and support organization, therefore expanding the sales growth opportunities for the Elcos technology. Consideration for the transaction was approximately $15.1 million in cash at the time of closing with additional consideration of approximately $1.4 million due through fiscal 2007. In addition, potential earn out payments of up to approximately $8.2 million may be made based on the future performance of the business. In November 2001, we completed our acquisition of Packard BioScience Company. The integration activities are complete with the exception of $0.4 million in remaining payments due on leased facilities exited in 2001 that will be paid through 2005. These integration activities are linked to the Q4 2001 Plan and are disclosed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K. 25 Table of Contents The following table summarizes integration reserve activity during 2004, 2003 and 2002 related to the acquisition of Packard: Severance Abandonment of Excess Facilities Total CashCharges AssetImpairment Total (In millions) Packard Integration Plan Balance at December 29, 2002 0.8 3.2 4.0 4.0 Amounts paid (0.8 ) (2.3 ) (3.1 ) (3.1 ) Balance at December 28, 2003 $ $ 0.9 $ 0.9 $ $ 0.9 Amounts paid (0.5 ) (0.5 ) (0.5 ) Balance at January 2, 2005 $ $ 0.4 $ 0.4 $ $ 0.4 Contingencies We are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party for certain waste disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. We have accrued $3.8 million as of January 2, 2005, representing our managements estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters. This amount is not discounted and does not reflect any recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. These cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the timeframe over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party, our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. We expect that such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. While it is possible that a material loss exceeding the amounts recorded may be incurred, we do not expect the potential exposure to be materially different from the amounts we recorded. We and certain of our officers have been named as defendants in a class action lawsuit filed in July 2002, and we and certain officers and directors have been named as defendants in purported derivative lawsuits filed in June and July 2004. The plaintiffs in all of these suits have alleged, among other things, various statements made by the Company and management, during the same time period for all three suits, were misleading with respect to our prospects and future operating results. Further information with respect to these lawsuits is contained in Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this annual report. We believe we have meritorious defenses to these lawsuits and are contesting the actions vigorously. We are currently unable, however, to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss, if any, that may result from the resolution of these matters. We previously received a notice from the Internal Revenue Service asserting federal income tax deficiencies for 1997 and 1998. The Company and the Internal Revenue Service resolved these matters in 2004. As a result of the settlement, we have reversed the reserves of $10.4 million that had been established in accordance with FAS 5 based on our previous assessment of the resolution of these matters, which assessment was less favorable than the ultimate outcome. We are under regular examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities in the United States and other countries, such as Canada, Finland, and the United Kingdom, and states in which we have significant business operations, such as California and New York. The tax years under examination vary by 26 Table of Contents jurisdiction; for example, the IRS is currently examining 1999 through 2002. Assuming current progress, we expect the IRS examination to be completed in fiscal 2005. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from these and subsequent years examinations. Tax reserves have been established, which we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted as information becomes available and when an event occurs requiring a change to the reserves. The resolution of tax matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition, although such settlement could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and consolidated statement of income for a particular future period. Reporting Segment Results of Continuing Operations Life and Analytical Sciences 2004 Compared to 2003. Sales for 2004 were $1,062.8 million, versus $1,003.7 million in 2003, an increase of $59.1 million, or 6%. Changes in foreign exchange rates, primarily the Euro, increased sales by approximately $39.2 million in 2004, as compared to 2003. The following analysis compares significant sales by market and product type for 2004, as compared to 2003, and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Sales to environmental and chemical analysis customers increased $24.8 million, OneSource service sales increased by $20.4 million, sales to genetic screening customers increased $11.4 million, and sales to biopharmaceutical customers increased $2.5 million. Service revenue included approximately $2.9 million for the additional week in the 2004 fiscal year. Sales by type of product included increases in sales of instruments of $33.5 million, service of $20.4 million, and consumables of $5.2 million. Operating profit for 2004 was $103.6 million, versus $94.7 million in 2003, an increase of $8.9 million. Research and development increased $3.5 million in 2004, as compared to 2003. Contributing to the increase were net cost savings associated with various productivity initiatives, including our restructuring and integration activities which resulted in a reduction of employees and the elimination of excess facilities. Offsetting these net cost savings were a $1.9 million restructuring reversal in 2003 for which there was no similar reversal in 2004, and dispositions which created a $0.8 million loss in 2004 versus dispositions which created a $1.6 million gain in 2003. Amortization of intangibles was $26.4 million for the year ended January 2, 2005, versus $26.0 million for the year ended December 28, 2003. 2003 Compared to 2002. Sales for 2003 were $1,003.7 million, versus $991.7 million in 2002, an increase of $12.0 million, or 1%. Changes in foreign exchange rates, primarily the Euro, increased sales by approximately $61.0 million in 2003, as compared to 2002. The favorable effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations was offset in part by reduced unit sales volume. The following analysis compares significant sales by market and product type for 2003, as compared to 2002, and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Sales to environmental and chemical analysis customers increased $22.7 million, sales to genetic screening customers increased $6.3 million and our OneSource laboratory service sales increased by $14.8 million. These increases were offset by a $31.8 million decrease in sales to biopharmaceutical customers, primarily in sales of liquid handling instruments and radiochemical reagents, as general biopharmaceutical market demand remained weak throughout 2003. Sales by type of product included increases in sales of consumables of $23.5 million, and service of $14.8 million, partially offset by decreases in sales of instruments of $26.3 million. Operating profit for 2003 was $94.7 million, versus $27.4 million in 2002, an increase of $67.3 million. The increase in 2003 as compared to 2002, was primarily the result of approximately $43.0 million of overall cost savings in 2003 associated with restructuring and integration activities, mainly due to a reduction of employees and the elimination of excess facilities. The increase in operating profit in 2003, as compared to 2002, was also due to approximately $31.5 million of net restructuring charges included in our results for 2002, compared to a net restructuring credit of $1.9 million in 2003. Amortization of intangibles was $26.0 million for the year ended December 28, 2003, versus $25.5 million for the year ended December 29, 2002. 27 Table of Contents Optoelectronics 2004 Compared to 2003. Sales for 2004 were $380.6 million, versus $348.7 million for 2003, an increase of $31.9 million, or 9%. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by approximately $6.5 million. The following analysis of significant sales by product line for 2004, as compared to 2003, includes the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. Sales of digital imaging products increased by $21.4 million due to increased sales of diagnostic and radiotherapy digital x ray products. Sales of sensors, lithography, and fiber optic test product lines increased $15.0 million. Sales of specialty lighting products decreased by $4.5 million due to lower photoflash sales into single use cameras. Operating profit for 2004 was $57.4 million, versus $46.8 million for 2003, an increase of $10.6 million. The increase in operating profit was primarily the result of increased sales volume, which increased operating profit by approximately $11.5 million, and net productivity improvements and cost reduction actions of $14.0 million, both offset in part by pricing reductions of approximately $14.9 million. Amortization of intangible assets was $1.2 million for 2004 and 2003. 2003 Compared to 2002. Sales for 2003 were $348.7 million, versus $319.8 million for 2002, an increase of $28.9 million, or 9%. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by approximately $10.0 million. The following analysis of significant sales by product line for 2003, as compared to 2002, includes the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. Sales of specialty lighting products increased by $18.5 million due to growth in sales of flash products, and sales of digital imaging products increased by $18.9 million due to increased sales of diagnostic and radiotherapy digital x ray products. These increases were offset in part by sales decreases totaling $8.5 million in our sensors, lithography, and fiber optic test product lines due to limited demand in these end markets. Operating profit for 2003 was $46.8 million, versus an operating loss of $0.5 million for 2002, an increase of $47.3 million. The operating loss for 2002 includes a charge of $17.2 million for an inventory write down which was not repeated in 2003. Fiscal 2003 included a net restructuring reversal of $1.8 million compared to a net restructuring charge of $3.7 million in 2002. Increased sales and productivity improvements, including improved manufacturing performance and reduced operating expenses, and a headcount reduction of more than 200, reduced expenses by a total of approximately $20.0 million in 2003 compared to 2002. Amortization of intangible assets was $1.2 million for 2003 and $1.3 million for 2002. Fluid Sciences 2004 Compared to 2003. Sales for 2004 were $243.8 million, versus $179.7 million for 2003, an increase of $64.1 million, or 36%. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by approximately $1.4 million. The following analysis of significant sales by product line for 2004, as compared to 2003, includes the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. Sales increased $30.5 million in our semiconductor products due to increased demand, $28.9 million in aerospace products, and $4.7 million in fluid testing and energy technology products. Operating profit for 2004 was $38.2 million, versus $17.9 million for 2003, an increase of $20.3 million, or 113%. The increase in operating profit resulted primarily from increased sales, shifting production to lower cost locations in Asia, other productivity improvements resulting from Six Sigma and lean manufacturing initiatives. Amortization of intangible assets was $.9 million for 2004 and $1.1 million for 2003. 2003 Compared to 2002. Sales for 2003 were $179.7 million, versus $189.5 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.8 million, or 5%. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by approximately $2.4 million. The following analysis of significant sales by product line for 2003, as compared to 2002, includes the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. Sales decreased $4.4 million in our semiconductor products due to declining demand, and $2.7 million in our energy technology products. In addition, sales to our aerospace and fluid testing customers declined modestly by $1.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively, in two difficult markets. 28 Table of Contents Operating profit for 2003 was $17.9 million, versus $17.5 million for 2002, an increase of $0.4 million, or 2%. The increase in operating profit resulted primarily from shifting production to lower cost locations in Asia, cost controls, cost reduction actions and other productivity improvements resulting from Six Sigma and lean manufacturing initiatives that more than offset an operating profit decrease due to reduced sales. Amortization of intangible assets was $1.1 million for 2003 and $1.5 million for 2002. Liquidity and Capital Resources We require cash to pay our operating expenses, make capital expenditures, service our debt and other long term liabilities and pay dividends on our common stock. Our principal sources of funds are from our operations and the capital markets, particularly the debt markets. In the near term, we anticipate that our operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures, interest payments on our debt and dividends on our common stock. In the long term, we expect to use internally generated funds and external sources to satisfy our debt and other long term liabilities. Principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include: deterioration of sales due to weakness in markets in which we sell our products and services, changes in our working capital requirements, and our ability to successfully repatriate cash balances from our foreign subsidiaries for use in settling domestic obligations. Principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include: financial covenants contained in our borrowings that limit our total borrowing capacity, increases in interest rates applicable to our outstanding variable rate debt, a ratings downgrade that would limit our ability to borrow under our accounts receivable facility and our overall access to the corporate debt market, volatility in the markets for corporate debt, a decrease in the market price for our common stock, and volatility in the public equity markets. Cash Flows Fiscal Year 2004 Operating Activities. Net cash generated by continuing operations operating activities was $199.5 million in 2004. Contributing to the generation of cash from operating activities during 2004 was net income from continuing operations of $98.3 million, depreciation and amortization of $76.2 million, and a decrease in working capital accounts of $4.9 million. Contributing to the decrease in working capital in 2004 were decreases in accounts receivable of $14.6 million and inventory of $1.9 million, offset by decreases in accounts payable of $11.6 million. In general, accounts receivable collections increased due primarily to our focus on improved processes and collections, whereas inventory balances decreased primarily due to improved logistics and inventory management processes. Accounts payable decreased primarily due to timing of payments. There was no incremental use of our accounts receivable securitization facility during 2004. The outstanding amount under this facility totaled $45.0 million at both January 2, 2005 and December 28, 2003. As discussed under Off Balance Sheet Arrangements, we had approximately $20 million of undrawn capacity available under the facility at January 2, 2005. Investing Activities. Investing activities related to continuing operations used $12.3 million in 2004. In 2004, we made capital expenditures of $19.0 million, mainly for tooling and productivity improvements and for 29 Table of Contents system and facility costs. We derived $3.4 million from sales of a building and equipment and $2.8 million from the settlement of an escrow related to an entity acquired in 2000. Financing Activities. In 2004, we used $195.9 million of net cash in financing activities. Debt reductions during 2004 totaled $175.2 million, primarily comprising $175.0 million used to repay a portion of our term loan. We also paid $35.8 million in dividends and received net cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $15.0 million in 2004. Fiscal Year 2003 Operating Activities. Net cash generated by continuing operations operating activities was $163.7 million in 2003. Contributing to the generation of cash from operating activities during 2003 was net income from continuing operations of $57.9 million, depreciation and amortization of $79.5 million and a decrease in working capital accounts of $70.9 million. Contributing to the decrease in working capital in 2003 were reductions in accounts receivable of $43.4 million and inventory of $28.2 million. In general, accounts receivable and inventory levels declined due to our focus on customer payment terms as well as enhanced inventory management. Accounts receivable also decreased as a result of increased use of our accounts receivable securitization facility, which increased $16 million, from $29 million at December 29, 2002 to $45 million at January 2, 2005. Cash outlays for accrued expenses, restructuring and other assets and liabilities totaled $46.0 million during 2003, primarily as a result of payments toward restructuring plans and other obligations. We expect our restructuring expenditures to be reduced in 2004. Investing Activities. In 2003, we withdrew $187.5 million of cash held in escrow to retire substantially all of our remaining outstanding indebtedness under our zero coupon convertible debentures. In 2003, we made capital expenditures of $16.6 million mainly in the areas of tooling and productivity improvements along with system and facility costs related to integration activities. Net proceeds from the dispositions of businesses and fixed assets during 2003 were $4.4 million. We derived $4.9 million of these proceeds from the sale of a building made redundant due to integration activities. Financing Activities. In 2003, we used $298.4 million of net cash in financing activities. We expended $187.5 million of cash withdrawn from our designated escrow account along with approximately $2.4 million of available cash to redeem our outstanding zero coupon convertible debentures. Debt reductions during 2003 also included $70.0 million of cash used to repay a portion of our term loan. In December 2003, we amended our credit facility to, among other things, reduce the interest rate applicable to our term loan. We paid $4.4 million transaction in fees during 2003 in connection with that amendment. We also paid $35.4 million in dividends and received net cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $3.6 million in 2003. Borrowing Arrangements Senior Secured Credit Facility. In December 2002, we entered into a senior credit facility. This facility comprises a six year term loan in the amount of $315.0 million and a $100.0 million five year revolving credit facility. In 2004, we made $175.0 million of principal payments on the term loan. Accordingly, at January 2, 2005 we had $70.0 million outstanding under our term loan and no outstanding principal balance under our revolving credit facility at January 2, 2005 or at any other time. Interest rates under the senior credit facility applicable to the term loan and to the revolving credit facility are determined as a margin over either the Eurodollar rate or the base rate. The base rate is the higher of (1) the corporate base rate announced from time to time by Bank of America, N.A. and (2) the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points. The applicable margins for the term loan and the revolving credit facility vary based upon our leverage ratio at the end of the prior quarter. The applicable margin as of January 2, 2005 was 200 basis points for the Eurodollar rate and 100 basis points for the base rate. We may allocate all or a portion of our indebtedness under the senior credit facility to interest based upon the margin over the Eurodollar rate or the base rate. At 30 Table of Contents January 2, 2005, the Eurodollar rate was approximately 247 basis points and the base rate was 525 basis points resulting in a Eurodollar interest rate on the senior credit facility of 447 basis points. In October 2004, we amended our senior credit facility to allow greater flexibility regarding acquisitions, stock repurchases, debt reduction and cash repatriation. The amount of permitted acquisitions and any related indebtedness was raised from $125 million to $250 million. The amount of indebtedness related to acquisitions is subject to compliance with all financial covenants. The term loan is repayable in mandatory nominal quarterly installments of $0.8 million of the outstanding balance until December 2007, and thereafter in four equal quarterly installments of 25% of the then outstanding balance until December 2008. Additionally, annual principal payments as a percentage of excess cash flow, defined as a ratio based on our cash flow and leverage ratio in the credit agreement, are payable six months following the end of each fiscal year. We are not required to make any such principal payment in 2005, with respect to our 2004 excess cash flow. In 2004, we made $175 million in principal payments on the term loan. The revolving credit facility is available to us through December 2007 for our working capital needs. At no point in fiscal 2004 nor at any other time, did we have any outstanding principal balance under the revolving credit facility. Our senior credit facility contains covenants that require us to maintain specific financial ratios, including: a minimum interest coverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a maximum senior leverage ratio, and a maximum total leverage ratio. As of January 2, 2005, and at all other times during fiscal 2004, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. 8 7/8% Notes. In December 2002, we issued and sold ten year senior subordinated notes at a rate of 8 7/8% with a face value of $300.0 million. We received $297.5 million in gross proceeds from the issuance. We recorded deferred issuance costs of $7.0 million as a non current asset. The debt, which matures in January 2013, is unsecured but is guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries. Interest on our 8 7/8% notes is payable semi annually on January 15 and July 15. In January 2004, we swapped the fixed rate on $100 million of these notes to a floating rate using swap instruments which reset semi annually in arrears based upon six month USD LIBOR and an applicable spread as defined in the swap agreements. In January 2005, we swapped an additional $100 million of these notes from fixed rate to floating rate at similar terms to the January 2004 swap, and therefore we now pay the applicable six month USD LIBOR rate, plus the applicable spread, on $200 million of our obligations represented by the notes. If a change of control of our company occurs, each holder of 8 7/8% notes may require us to repurchase some or all of its notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued interest. Before January 15, 2006, we may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount with the net proceeds of specified public equity offerings at 108.875% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued interest, if at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes remains outstanding after the redemption. We may redeem some or all of our 8 7/8% notes at any time on or after January 15, 2008, at a redemption price of 104.438%. The redemption price decreases to 102.958% on January 15, 2009, to 101.479% on January 15, 2010 and to 100% on January 15, 2011. The debt is subordinated to our senior credit facility. These notes contain financial and other covenants. Most of these covenants terminate if the notes obtain an investment grade rating by Standard & Poors Rating Services and Moodys Investors Service. At January 2, 2005, and at all times during fiscal 2004, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures. Through the first quarter of 2003, we repurchased $344.7 million in accreted amount of our zero coupon convertible debentures due 2020 in open market purchases and through a 31 Table of Contents December 2002 tender offer. We redeemed the remaining $157.4 million of accreted value of zero coupon debentures on August 7, 2003 in accordance with their terms. We used approximately $155.0 million held in escrow pursuant to the terms of our senior secured credit facility along with available cash of approximately $2.4 million, to redeem the zero coupon convertible debentures. As of December 28, 2003 the zero coupon convertible debentures had been fully retired. 6.8% Notes. In December 2002, we initiated a tender offer for all of our outstanding 6.8% notes. We completed the tender offer and repurchased all but $4.7 million of these notes as of December 26, 2002. We paid consent payments pursuant to a consent solicitation we made concurrently with the tender offer. The consent solicitation eliminated substantially all of the restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing our 6.8% notes as of December 29, 2002. We may from time to time repurchase outstanding 6.8% notes through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The remaining $4.7 million in notes are due to be paid in October 2005. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Receivables Securitization Facility In December 2001, we established a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary to purchase, on a revolving basis, certain of our accounts receivable balances and simultaneously sell an undivided interest in this pool of receivables to a financial institution. In September 2003, we amended the facility to increase total funding capacity from $50.0 million to $65.0 million to expand our sources of liquidity. Amounts funded under this facility were $45.0 million at both January 2, 2005 and December 28, 2003. As of January 2, 2005, we had approximately $20 million of undrawn capacity available under the facility. The facility had an effective interest rate of approximately LIBOR plus 74 basis points as of January 2, 2005. The facility includes conditions that require us to maintain a senior unsecured credit rating of BB or above, as defined by Standard & Poors Rating Services, and Ba2 or above, as defined by Moodys Investors Service. At January 2, 2005, we had a senior unsecured credit rating of BB+ with a stable outlook from Standard & Poors Rating Services, and of Ba2 with a positive outlook from Moodys Investors Service. The facility expires on January 27, 2006. Dividends Our Board of Directors declared regular quarterly cash dividends of seven cents per share in each quarter of 2004 and 2003, resulting in an annual dividend rate of 28 cents per share. Our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our outstanding 8 7/8% senior subordinated notes contain restrictions that may limit our ability to pay our regular quarterly cash dividend in the future if we are unable to comply with certain financial covenants that primarily relate to cash flow. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at January 2, 2005: Operating Leases 6.8% Unsecured Notes due2005 TermNote 8.875% Sr. Subordinated Notes due2013 OtherRevolvingDebtFacilities Total (In thousands) 2005 $ 30,496 $ 4,681 $ 3,150 $ 1,883 $ 40,210 2006 25,541 3,150 7 28,698 2007 17,099 3,150 20,249 2008 13,798 60,550 74,348 2009 12,461 12,461 2010 and beyond 122,176 $ 298,017 420,193 Total $ 221,571 $ 4,681 $ 70,000 $ 298,017 $ 1,890 $ 596,159 32 Table of Contents Capital Expenditures During 2005, we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately $25 million to $35 million primarily to introduce new products, to improve our operating processes, to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations, and to capitalize expenses related to internally developed information technology. We expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures. Future Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued FASB No. 123R, Share Based Payment. This Statement is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion, or APB, No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance. SFAS No. 123R focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions. The Statement requires entities to recognize stock compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards, with limited exceptions. SFAS No. 123R is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. We expect to adopt SFAS No. 123R using the Statements modified prospective application method. We expect our adoption of SFAS No. 123R to increase stock compensation expense. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will have on our financial results. On November 29, 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. Statement 151 clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material. Statement 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We are evaluating the potential impact, if any, the adoption of Statement 151 will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, income taxes, restructuring, pensions and other post retirement benefits, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue recognition. We record product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, we recognize product revenue upon delivery, and we delay recognition of installation revenue until the installation is complete. For sales that include customer specified acceptance criteria, we recognize revenue only after the acceptance criteria have been met. We defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period or as we render services and the customer accepts them. When arrangements include multiple elements, we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element, all in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. Because the majority of our sales relate to specific 33 Table of Contents manufactured products or units rather than long term customized projects, we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates. Further, we have not experienced any significant product returns or refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation. Allowances for doubtful accounts. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by (1) applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible; and (2) specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty. Therefore, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates, we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts. This would reduce our earnings. Inventory valuation. We initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase and or manufacture. We periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost. Generally, reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand or technological obsolescence of the inventory. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and, when necessary, record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements or historical trailing usage of the product. If our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels, we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory. This would reduce our earnings. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold, resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period. Value of long lived assets, including intangibles. We carry a variety of long lived assets on our balance sheet including property and equipment, investments, identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. We periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based, in part, upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows. We undertake this review (1) on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and non amortizing intangible assets and (2) on a periodic basis for other long lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from those assets may be diminished. Any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings. The 2002 initial assessment of goodwill recoverability under SFAS No. 142 resulted in a $117.8 million charge to our earnings. This charge, relating to goodwill in our lighting reporting unit within our Optoelectronics business segment, was caused by expected declines in profitability and cash flows as a result of softness in key end markets. We completed the annual impairment tests of goodwill for 2003 and 2004 and concluded that there was no impairment. While we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable, different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets. In addition, we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our intangible assets that are not being amortized at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. If events or circumstances indicate that the useful life of nonamortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite, the assets will be tested for impairment in accordance with SFAS 142. These intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization. Employee compensation and benefits. Retirement and post retirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. Retirement and post retirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of sales, research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations. We incurred expenses of $9.1 million in 2004, $6.2 million in 2003 and $3.9 million in 2002 for our retirement and post retirement plans. We expect expenses of approximately $12.8 million in 2005 for our retirement and post retirement plans. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made. We are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied to determine service cost and interest cost to arrive at pension income or 34 Table of Contents expense for the year. As of January 2, 2005, we estimated the expected long term rate of return of assets in our pension portfolios in the United States was 8.5% percent, and was 7.5% percent for plans outside the United States. We have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets as well as our current expectations for long term rates of returns for our pension assets. Our management will continue to assess the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption for each plan based on relevant market conditions and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate. Discount rate assumptions have been, and continue to be based on the prevailing market long term interest rates at the measurement date. If any of our assumptions were to change, our pension plan expenses would also change. A one percent decrease in the estimated return on plan assets would increase our pre tax pension expense by $2.1 million for 2005 in the United States and by $0.7 million for 2005 for all plans outside the United States. We have reduced the volatility in our health care costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature. Under the defined dollar plan feature, our total annual liability for health care costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount, regardless of the nature or cost of the health care needs of that retiree. Our maximum future liability therefore, cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of health care. Restructuring activities. Our financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals. Our restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of (1) severance benefits to be granted to employees, based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades, (2) costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of sub rental income and (3) asset impairments as discussed above under Value of Long Lived Assets, Including Intangibles. Because these accruals are estimates, they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention. For example, actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected. In addition, unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates. When such changes in estimates occur, they are reflected in our financial statements on the income statement line entitled restructuring charges, net. Gains or losses on dispositions. When we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation, we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition. This estimate is based on a variety of factors, including current interest in the market, alternative markets for the assets and other relevant factors. If anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation, we record a loss. If anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation, we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated. Accordingly, we may realize amounts different than were first estimated. During the year ended January 2, 2005, we recognized $0.4 million in losses from disposition of a business and excess facilities. We also recorded $0.5 million in losses from the disposition of discontinued operations comprised of gains from the final disposition of our Telecommunications Components and Technical Services businesses. These gains were offset by losses associated with the disposition of our Electroformed Products and Computer To Plate businesses. Any such changes decrease or increase current earnings and are recorded either against the gains on disposition or discontinued operations line items appearing in our income statement. Income taxes. Our business operations are global in nature, and we are subject to taxes in more than 40 countries. Tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries. We report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law. Our tax provision contemplates tax rates in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax position. Any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change. Such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate. Our tax positions are consistently subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world. Where appropriate, we reserve for tax matters where we believe that there is a significant likelihood of an 35 Table of Contents incremental liability being incurred. Any significant changes as a result of changes in underlying facts, law, tax rates, tax audit or review could lead to adjustments in our effective tax rate or cash flow. In addition, we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, foreign tax credits and other credits. Valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to ultimately use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed to be recoverable. Improvements or other changes in our operations, domestically and internationally, could increase our ability to utilize these tax attributes in the future. The release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our effective tax rate. The FASB also issued FASB Staff Position, or FSP, No. 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The American Jobs Creation Act introduces a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of specified foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer, provided criteria are met. FSP 109 2 provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision. Until the Treasury Department or Congress provides additional clarifying language on key elements of the repatriation provision, the total amount of foreign earnings to be repatriated by us cannot be determined and the presumption that such unremitted earnings will not be repatriated cannot be overcome. FSP 109 2 grants an enterprise additional time beyond the year ended December 31, 2004, in which the Act was enacted, to evaluate the effects of the Act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted earnings. FSP 109 2 calls for enhanced disclosures of, among other items, the status of a companys evaluations, the effects of completed evaluations, and the potential range of income tax effects of repatriations. Such disclosures are included in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. Forward Looking Information and Factors Affecting Future Performance The following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations: Economic, political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales. Because we sell our products worldwide, our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Our sales originating outside the United States represented more than 50% of our total sales in the fiscal year ended January 2, 2005. We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales. In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities, employees and suppliers are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including: changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in a countrys or regions political or economic conditions, particularly in developing or emerging markets, longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, differing tax laws and changes in those laws, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differing labor laws and changes in those laws, differing protection of intellectual property and changes in that protection, and differing regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements. 36 Table of Contents If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our products could become obsolete and our operating results would suffer. We sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product and service introductions, and evolving industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements, our products could become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our sales and operating results would suffer. The success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors, including our ability to: accurately anticipate customer needs, innovate and develop new technologies and applications, successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, price our products competitively and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time, and differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings. Many of our products are used by our customers to develop, test and manufacture their products. Therefore, we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers products. In developing new products, we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product. If we fail to accurately foresee our customers needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant sales. In addition, some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions, which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications. For example, some of our license agreements are limited to the field of life sciences research, and exclude clinical diagnostics applications. Our debt may adversely affect our cash flow and may restrict our investment opportunities. As of January 2, 2005, we had approximately $374.6 million in outstanding indebtedness. We have $100.0 million in additional borrowing capacity available to us under our revolving credit facility and $20 million under our receivable securitization program. We may also obtain additional long term debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage. Our leverage could have negative consequences, including: increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing, limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through acquisitions or licensing, and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we compete. Approximately $70 million of our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates pursuant to the terms of the original agreements. However, after giving effect to the interest rate swaps entered into in January 2004 and January 2005, approximately $270 million of our indebtedness now bears interest at floating rates. As a result, our interest payment obligations on this indebtedness will increase if interest rates increase. Our ability to satisfy our obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not 37 Table of Contents generate sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations or to successfully execute our business strategy. If we are unable to service our debt and fund our business, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures or research and development expenditures, seek additional financing or equity capital, restructure or refinance our debt or sell assets. We may not be able to obtain additional financing or refinance existing debt or sell assets on terms acceptable to us or at all. Restrictions in our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our 8 7/8% notes may limit our activities. Our senior credit facility and the indenture relating to our 8 7/8% notes contain, and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may contain, restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company, including restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to: incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock, make investments, create liens, sell assets, in the case of our restricted subsidiaries, incur obligations that restrict their ability to make dividend or other payments to us, in the case of our restricted subsidiaries, guarantee or secure indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliates, create unrestricted subsidiaries, and consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. We are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of our senior credit facility. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology and changes in the level of competition. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date. Also, an acceleration of the debt under our senior credit facility would trigger an event of default under our 8 7/8% notes, and a default under our 8 7/8% notes would trigger an event of default under the senior credit facility and possibly other debt. If an event of default occurs, we may not have sufficient funds available to make the required payments under our indebtedness. If we are unable to repay amounts owed under our senior credit facility, those lenders may be entitled to foreclose on and sell the collateral that secures our borrowings under that agreement. Our inability to repay amounts owed under our senior credit facility may also cause a default under other of our obligations including our accounts receivable securitization facility. Our operating results may could be harmed by cyclical downturns affecting several of the industries into which we sell our products. Some of the industries and markets into which we sell our products are cyclical. Industry downturns are often characterized by reduced product demand, excess manufacturing capacity and erosion of average selling 38 Table of Contents prices and profits. In the past, significant downturns in our customers markets and in general economic conditions have resulted in a reduced demand for several of our products and have hurt our operating results. For example, during 2002, our operating results were reduced by downturns in many of the markets we serve, including the pharmaceutical, biomedical, semiconductor and aerospace markets. Our quarterly operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation, and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate. Given the nature of the markets in which we participate, we cannot reliably predict future sales and profitability. Changes in competitive, market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations, and we may not be able to make those adjustments or to make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions. A high proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to our significant sales, research and development and manufacturing costs. Thus, small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter. Factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include: demand for and market acceptance of our products, competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices, adverse changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which we do business, adverse changes in industries, such as pharmaceutical, biomedical, semiconductors and aerospace, on which we are particularly dependent, changes in the portions of our sales represented by our various products and customers, delays or problems in the introduction of new products, our competitors announcement or introduction of new products, services or technological innovations, increased costs of raw materials or supplies, and changes in the volume or timing of product orders. We may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or license technologies, integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing business or make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable. We have in the past, and may in the future, supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines, such as our acquisition of Elcos AG in February 2005. However, we may be unable to identify, complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons, including: competition among buyers and licensees, the need for regulatory and other approvals, our inability to raise capital to fund these acquisitions, the high valuations of businesses and technologies, and restrictions in the instruments governing our indebtedness, including the indenture governing our 8 7/8% notes and our new senior credit facility. Some of the businesses we may seek to acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable. Accordingly, the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings. For these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability, we must improve their management, operations, products and market penetration. We may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations, such as incompatible management, information or other systems or cultural differences. 39 Table of Contents To finance our acquisitions, we may have to raise additional funds, either through public or private financings. We may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us. If we are unable to renew our licenses or otherwise lose our licensed rights, we may have to stop selling products or we may lose competitive advantage. We may not be able to renew our existing licenses or licenses we may obtain in the future on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology, we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products, redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage. Potential competitors could in license technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share. Our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations. If we fail to comply with these obligations we could lose important rights under a license, such as the right to exclusivity in a market. In some cases, we could lose all rights under the license. In addition, rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control. For example, the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons, including invalidity of the licensed patent, or a third party could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses. If we do not compete effectively, our business will be harmed. We encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business. We may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors. To remain competitive, we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products. We anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive. In addition, new competitors, technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines. If we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the United States Food and Drug Administration and other governmental agencies, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties. Some of the products produced by our Life and Analytical Sciences business unit are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration and similar international agencies. In addition, some of the activities of our Fluid Sciences business unit are subject to regulation by the United States Federal Aviation Administration. These regulations govern a wide variety of product activities, from design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales, resales and distribution. If we fail to comply with those regulations or those of similar international agencies, we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution. We had to do this on a temporary basis in 2004 in response to an FDA directive at one of our Life and Analytical Sciences locations until we were able to resolve the matter by implementing additional testing and labeling conditions on the relevant product. In addition, we could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution. Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. We compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal, state, local and foreign regulations, such as environmental, health and safety, and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products. Obtaining and enforcing patent protection for our proprietary products, processes and technologies may be difficult and expensive; we may infringe intellectual property rights of third parties. Patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing and marketing new technologies and products is time consuming and expensive. We own many United States and foreign patents and intend to 40 Table of Contents apply for additional patents to cover our products. We may not obtain issued patents from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. The claims allowed under any issued patents may not be broad enough to protect our technology. Third parties may seek to challenge, invalidate or circumvent issued patents owned by or licensed to us or claim that our products and operations infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights. In addition to our patents, we possess an array of unpatented proprietary technology and know how and we license intellectual property rights to and from third parties. The measures that we employ to protect this technology and these rights may not be adequate. Moreover, in some cases, the licensor can terminate a license or convert it to a non exclusive arrangement if we fail to meet specified performance targets. We may incur significant expense in any legal proceedings to protect our proprietary rights or to defend infringement claims by third parties. In addition, claims of third parties against us, such as the pending actions by, respectively, Enzo Biochem, Inc. and Enzo Life Sciences, Inc., and by Amersham Biosciences Corp. and Amersham Plc, could result in awards of substantial damages or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing, using, importing or selling our products in the United States or abroad. Our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets. As of January 2, 2005, our total assets included $1.5 billion of net intangible assets. Net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights, trademark rights and technology licenses, net of accumulated amortization. We test these items on an annual basis for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned. Adverse changes in our business or the failure to grow our Life and Analytical Sciences business may result in impairment of our intangible assets which could adversely affect our results of operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks Financial Instruments Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments, marketable securities and accounts receivable. We believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of January 2, 2005. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Transactions covered by hedge contracts include inter company and third party receivables and payables. The contracts are primarily in European and Asian currencies, have maturities that do not exceed 12 months, have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Credit risk is minimal as the foreign exchange instruments are contracted with major banking institutions. Unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and, for hedges designated as cash flow, the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs. For the year ended January 2, 2005, we did not engage in any designated cash flow hedges. The notional amount of the outstanding foreign currency contracts was approximately $166.8 million at January 2, 2005 and $168.5 million as of December 28, 2003, and the approximate fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant. The duration of the foreign currency derivative contracts was generally 30 days for 2004. 41 Table of Contents Market Risk Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk, including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures. Foreign Exchange Risk. As a multinational corporation, we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. These exposures can take a variety of different forms: (1) As our international sales grow, exposure to volatility in exchange rates could have a material impact on our financial results. Reported sales made in foreign currencies by our international subsidiaries, when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, can fluctuate due to exchange rate movements. While exchange rate fluctuations can impact reported revenues and earnings, this impact is purely a result of the translation effect and does not materially impact our short term cash flows. (2) In all parts of the world our subsidiaries, on occasion, invoice third party customers in foreign currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business. We refer to our subsidiaries primary business currencies as the functional currencies. Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency result in both realized and unrealized transaction gains or losses that directly impact our cash flows and our results of operations. (3) Our manufacturing and distribution organization is worldwide. Accordingly, inventories may be manufactured in one location, stored in another, and distributed in a third location. This results in a wide array of intercompany transactions transactions that are billed and paid in many different currencies. Our cash flows and our results of operations are therefore directly impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates of currencies involved. (4) The cash flow needs of each of our foreign subsidiaries vary through time. Accordingly, there may be times when a subsidiary lends to or borrows from either the parent company or another affiliate. These advances, again being denominated in currencies other than a particular entitys functional currency, can expose it to fluctuations in exchange rates that can impact both our cash flows and results of operations. (5) In order to repay debt or satisfy operational needs, we may remit cash from our foreign locations to the United States. When this occurs, we are liquidating foreign currency net asset positions and converting them into United States dollars. Our cash flows and our results of operations are therefore also impacted by these transactions. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. The derivative instruments held by us are not leveraged and are not held for trading purposes. We specifically use forward contracts to hedge our foreign denominated assets and liabilities and use a combination of forward and option contracts to hedge anticipated cash flows. Our hedging activity is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on assets, liabilities and cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. The success of our hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in various currencies. To the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility, we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses. The principal currencies we hedge are the British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen, and Singapore Dollar. In those currencies where there is a liquid, cost effective forward market, we maintain hedge coverage between our established minimum and maximum percentages of our anticipated transaction exposure for periods not to exceed one year. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposure. Foreign Currency Risk Value at Risk Disclosure We utilize a Value at Risk model to determine the potential earning/fair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments. As discussed above, we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program. Our Value at Risk computation is based on the Monte Carlo simulation, utilizing a 95% confidence interval and a holding period of 30 days. As of January 2, 2005, this computation estimated that there is a 5% chance that the market value of the 42 Table of Contents underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than $0.1 million. This Value At Risk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program. Specifically, during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal 2004, the Value At Risk ranged between $0.1 million and $0.3 million, and averaged approximately $0.2 million. Interest Rate Risk. As described above, our debt portfolio includes both fixed rate and variable rate instruments. Fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our short term cash flows, as they relate to interest, and our earnings. In January 2005 and January 2004, we effected, for a portion of our fixed rate debt portfolio, interest rate swaps that in effect convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. These swaps have been designated as fair value hedges. These swaps are marked to market in our consolidated financial statements. The fair value movements in these swaps are offset by the fair value movement in the debt. Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity As of January 2, 2005, our debt portfolio was comprised of $304.6 million fixed rate debt and $70.0 million of variable rate debt. After giving effect to the interest rate swaps entered into in January 2004 and January 2005, $104.6 million of our debt portfolio is fixed and $270.0 million is variable. In addition, our cash and cash equivalents, for which we receive interest at variable rates, were $197.5 million at January 2, 2005. Our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows: (1) changes in interest rates can cause interest charges on our variable rate debt comprised of $70 million of term loan and $200 million of swapped 8 7/8% notes to fluctuate. A 10% increase, or approximately 64 basis points, in current interest rates would cause an additional pre tax charge to our earnings of $1.7 million for fiscal year 2005. (2) changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt to fluctuate. As described above, an increase of 10%, or approximately 64 basis points, in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by $1.7 million for fiscal year 2005. (3) changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest received to fluctuate. (4) changes in interest rates can cause the value of our fixed rate debt to change. However, such a value change has no impact on either our earnings or our cash flows unless we determine that we wish to retire this debt in the open market. 43 Table of Contents
