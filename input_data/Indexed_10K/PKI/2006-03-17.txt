We are a leading provider of drug discovery and development, genetic screening and environmental and chemical analysis tools, including instruments, reagents, consumables and services. Optoelectronics. We provide a broad range of digital imaging, sensor and specialty lighting components used in the biomedical, consumer products and other specialty end markets. 25 Table of Contents Accounting Period Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest December 31. We report fiscal years under a 52/53 week format. Under this method, certain years will contain 53 weeks. The fiscal year ended January 1, 2006 included 52 weeks. The fiscal year ended January 2, 2005 included 53 weeks. The fiscal year ended December 28, 2003 included 52 weeks. In fiscal 2004, the fourth quarter average weekly sales were approximately $29.4 million. Consolidated Results of Continuing Operations Sales 2005 Compared to 2004. Sales for 2005 were $1,473.8 million, versus $1,429.1 million during 2004, an increase of $44.7 million, or 3%. Acquisitions increased 2005 sales by $12.1 million over 2004, whereas changes in foreign exchange rates had an immaterial impact on sales on a year over year basis. Fiscal 2005 had 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in fiscal 2004. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, an average weeks sales represented $29.4 million. The following analysis compares significant sales for 2005 as compared to 2004 and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the previously mentioned extra week during 2004. The overall increase in sales reflects an $18.3 million, or 2%, increase in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment sales, which grew from $1,062.8 million in 2004 to $1,081.1 in 2005. Our Optoelectronics segment sales grew $26.4 million, or 7%, from $366.3 million in 2004 to $392.7 million in 2005. 2004 Compared to 2003. Sales for 2004 were $1,429.1 million, versus $1,344.5 million during 2003, an increase of $84.6 million, or 6%. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by $45.7 million over 2003. Fiscal 2004 had 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2003. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, an average weeks sales represented $29.4 million. The following analysis compares significant sales for 2004 as compared to 2003 and includes the previously mentioned extra week during 2004. The overall increase in sales reflects a $59.1 million, or 6%, increase in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment sales, which grew from $1,003.7 million in 2003 to $1,062.8 in 2004, and reflects approximately $39.2 million in sales attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates, as compared to 2003. Our Optoelectronics segment sales grew $25.5 million, or 7%, from $340.8 million in 2003 to $366.3 million in 2004, including approximately $6.5 million in sales attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates, as compared to 2003. Cost of Sales 2005 Compared to 2004. Cost of sales for 2005 was $859.3 million, versus $846.3 million for 2004, an increase of $13.0 million, or 2%. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased to 58.3% in 2005 from 59.2% in 2004, resulting in an increase in gross margin of 90 basis points from 40.8% in 2004 to 41.7% in 2005. The increase in gross margin was largely attributable to higher sales volume enabling better leveraging of fixed costs and increased manufacturing productivity, offset somewhat by a higher contribution of Optoelectronics revenue as a percentage of overall sales. While Optoelectronics does have lower gross margins than Life and Analytical Sciences, it also has lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales. 2004 Compared to 2003. Cost of sales for 2004 was $846.3 million, versus $781.1 million for 2003, an increase of $65.2 million, or 8%. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased to 59.2% in 2004 from 58.1% in 2003, resulting in a decrease in gross margin of 110 basis points from 41.9% in 2003 to 40.8% in 2004. The decrease in gross margin was partially attributable to greater revenue contribution, as a percentage of overall sales, from Optoelectronics versus Life and Analytical Sciences. 26 Table of Contents Research and Development Expenses 2005 Compared to 2004. Research and development expenses for 2005 were $87.4 million versus $82.4 million in 2004, an increase of $5.0 million, or 6%. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses increased to 5.9% in 2005 from 5.8% in 2004. We directed research and development efforts during 2005 and 2004 primarily toward genetic screening, biopharmaceutical, and environmental and chemical end markets within our Life and Analytical Sciences reporting segment, and medical digital imaging and Cermax lighting within our Optoelectronics reporting segment. We expect our research and development spending to increase on both an absolute and percentage of sales basis in 2006 and to continue to emphasize the health sciences end markets. 2004 Compared to 2003. Research and development expenses for 2004 were $82.4 million versus $76.8 million in 2003, an increase of $5.6 million, or 7%. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses increased to 5.8% in 2004 from 5.7% in 2003. We directed research and development efforts during 2004 and 2003 primarily toward genetic screening and biopharmaceutical end markets within our Life and Analytical Sciences reporting segment, and medical digital imaging and Cermax lighting within our Optoelectronics reporting segment. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2005 Compared to 2004. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2005 were $365.5 million, versus $362.3 million for 2004, an increase of $3.2 million, or 1%. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 60 basis points to 24.8% in 2005 from 25.4% in 2004. The decrease as a percentage of sales of 60 basis points in 2005 was primarily due to net productivity improvements and cost reductions in both our Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics reporting segments. 2004 Compared to 2003. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2004 were $362.3 million, versus $365.0 million for 2003, a decrease of $2.7 million, or 1%. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 170 basis points to 25.4% in 2004 from 27.1% in 2003. The decrease as a percentage of sales of 170 basis points in 2004 was primarily due to net productivity improvements and cost reductions in our Life and Analytical Sciences reporting segment. Restructuring (Reversals) and Integration Charges, Net 2005 Compared to 2004. Restructuring and integration charges for 2005 were $22.1 million versus zero for 2004. The following table summarizes our restructuring accrual balances and related activity by restructuring plan during 2005, 2004 and 2003: Balance at12/29/2002 2003Charges 2003Amountspaid andincurred 2003Changes inEstimates Balance at12/28/2003 2004Amountspaid Balance at1/02/2005 2005Charges 2005Amountspaid andincurred 2005Changes inEstimates Balance at1/1/2006 (In thousands) Q4 2001 plan $ 4,075 $ $ (3,434 ) $ 1,830 $ 2,471 $ (965 ) $ 1,506 $ $ (401 ) $ $ 1,105 Q1 2002 plan 1,152 (52 ) (1,000 ) 100 (100 ) Q4 2002 plan 22,662 (12,868 ) (5,494 ) 4,300 (3,330 ) 970 (1,543 ) 5,632 5,059 Q2 2003 plan 2,251 (1,582 ) (381 ) 288 (86 ) 202 (202 ) Q2 2005 plan 8,251 (5,510 ) (403 ) 2,338 Q4 2005 plan 8,223 (6,077 ) 2,146 Restructuring 27,889 2,251 (17,936 ) (5,045 ) 7,159 (4,481 ) 2,678 16,474 (13,531 ) 5,027 10,648 Integration 4,020 (3,146 ) 874 (507 ) 367 564 (337 ) 594 Total Restructuring and Integration $ 31,909 $ 2,251 $ (21,082 ) $ (5,045 ) $ 8,033 $ (4,988 ) $ 3,045 $ 17,038 $ (13,868 ) $ 5,027 $ 11,242 27 Table of Contents Q4 2005 Plan: During the fourth quarter of 2005, we incurred an $8.2 million restructuring charge in Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics, which we refer to as our Q4 2005 Plan. The principal actions in the Q4 2005 Plan included planned workforce reductions resulting from our resource shift towards product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy, as well the closure of manufacturing and administrative facilities in order to consolidate certain operations in our North American and European territories. As part of our Q4 2005 Plan, we reduced headcount by 44. We anticipate that all remaining Q4 2005 Plan actions will be completed by December 2006. We recorded restructuring charges by segment for the Q4 2005 Plan as follows: (In millions) Life and Analytical Sciences Optoelectronics Total Severance $2.1 $0.1 $2.2 Abandonment of Excess Facilities 0.2 5.8 6.0 Total $2.3 $5.9 $8.2 Q2 2005 Plan: During the second quarter of 2005, we recognized an $8.2 million restructuring charge in Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics, which we refer to as our Q2 2005 Plan. The purpose of these restructuring actions was to shift resources into geographic regions and product lines that were more consistent with our growth strategy. The principal actions in the Q2 2005 Plan comprised headcount reductions resulting from reorganization activities. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we recorded a pre tax restructuring reversal of $0.4 million relating to this plan due to lower than expected employee separation costs associated with the Life and Analytical Sciences segment. As part of our Q2 2005 Plan, we reduced headcount by 228. We anticipate that all remaining severance costs will be paid by the end of the second quarter in 2006. The following table summarizes the Q2 2005 restructuring charges recognized in 2005 by segment: (In millions) Life and Analytical Sciences Optoelectronics Total Severance $5.3 $2.9 $8.2 Q2 2003 Plan: During 2003, we incurred a $2.3 million restructuring charge in Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics, which we refer to as our Q2 2003 Plan. The purpose of the restructuring was to further improve performance and take advantage of synergies between our former Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses which we began integrating in the fourth quarter of 2002. The principal actions in this restructuring plan included lower headcount due to the continued integration of the Life and Analytical Sciences business in a European manufacturing and customer care center, as well as headcount reduction at one of the Optoelectronics manufacturing facilities to reflect recent declining demand for several product lines. We planned to reduce headcount by 120. We recorded restructuring charges by segment for 2003 as follows: (In millions) Life and Analytical Sciences Optoelectronics Total Q2 2003 Plan $2.0 $0.3 $2.3 28 Table of Contents This restructuring charge was primarily recorded in the second quarter of 2003. However, we recorded additional charges of $0.5 million and $0.1 million in the third and fourth quarters of 2003, as required by SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, as some employees who were notified of their employment termination in the second quarter were required to work for a period of time prior to receiving their severance. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded a pre tax restructuring reversal of $0.4 million due to 30 fewer employee terminations as a result of higher attrition rates in several countries prior to ultimate termination, and accordingly, lower severance costs. Q4 2002 Plan: In connection with our decision to combine our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses in order to reduce costs and achieve operational efficiencies, we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of $26.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2002, which we refer to as our Q4 2002 Plan. The Q4 2002 Plan allowed us to combine many business functions worldwide, with the intention to better serve our customers and more fully capitalize on the strengths of the businesses sales, service, and research and development organizations. The principal actions in the Q4 2002 Plan included planned workforce reductions of 546 people, closure of approximately 20 facilities, and disposal of underutilized assets. The Q4 2002 Plan resulted in the integration of our United States Life and Analytical Sciences sales, service and customer care centers, the integration of European customer care and finance centers, the merging of a former Life Sciences European manufacturing facility with a former Analytical Instruments European manufacturing facility, and the merging of a portion of a former Life Sciences research and development facility in Europe with a former Analytical Instruments facility in Europe. During 2003, we expended $12.9 million to execute these actions. In addition, we recorded a reversal of $5.5 million in the Q4 2002 Plan due to 182 fewer terminations as a result of higher than expected employee attrition rates in several countries prior to ultimate termination and lower severance costs for actual terminations. During 2004, we expended an additional $3.3 million to execute these actions. During 2005, we expended $1.5 million to execute these actions. In addition, we recorded a restructuring charge of $5.6 million in the Q4 2002 Plan due to higher than expected costs associated with the closure of facilities, primarily in Europe. The remaining liability associated with the Q4 2002 Plan represents severance related to 2 employees and ongoing lease commitments. We expect to settle the remaining severance liability by the end of the first quarter of 2006. Our current estimate is that our lease commitments on unoccupied buildings extend until 2014. Q1 2002 Plan: During the first quarter of 2002, our management developed a plan to restructure several businesses and we recorded a restructuring charge of $9.2 million. We refer to these activities as our Q1 2002 Plan. The principal actions in the Q1 2002 Plan included planned workforce and overhead reductions resulting from reorganization activities, including the closure of a manufacturing facility, disposal of underutilized assets, and general cost reductions. Total headcount was reduced by 276. During 2003, we recorded a restructuring reversal of $1.0 million in the Q1 2002 Plan primarily due to lower than expected employee separation costs associated with our Optoelectronics segment. Q4 2001 Plan: During the fourth quarter of 2001, in connection with the integration of Packard BioScience Company and a restructuring of our sales offices in Europe, we recorded a restructuring charge of $9.2 million in our Life and 29 Table of Contents Analytical Sciences segment and incurred $1.6 million in charges in 2002. We refer to these activities as our Q4 2001 Plan. The principal actions in the Q4 2001 Plan included the closing or consolidation of several leased sales and services offices in Europe, as well as costs associated with the closure of a manufacturing facility in Europe, the closure of leased manufacturing facilities in the United States, and the disposal of related assets. In 2003, we recorded an additional pre tax restructuring charge associated with the Q4 2001 Plan of $1.8 million. This charge was primarily due to additional severance and severance related benefits of the previously identified employees associated with the closure of our European manufacturing facility in the Life and Analytical Sciences segment. In 2004, we expended $1.0 million to execute the actions associated with the Q4 2001 Plan. We expect to pay the remaining balance in 2006 for previously identified employees associated with the closure of our European manufacturing facility in the Life and Analytical Sciences segment. Integration: In November 2001, we completed our acquisition of Packard BioScience Company. The integration activities are complete with the exception of $0.6 million in remaining payments due on leased facilities exited in 2001 that will be paid through 2011. The following table summarizes integration reserve activity during 2005 and 2004 related to the acquisition of Packard BioScience Company: Abandonment of Excess Facilities Total CashCharges (In millions) Packard Integration Plan Balance at December 28, 2003 $ 874 $ 874 Amounts paid (507 ) (507 ) Balance at January 2, 2005 $ 367 $ 367 Provision 564 564 Amounts paid (337 ) (337 ) Balance at January 1, 2006 $ 594 $ 594 Gains (Losses) on Dispositions 2005 Compared to 2004. Dispositions resulted in a net gain of $1.5 million in 2005 versus a net loss of $0.4 million in 2004. Gain on dispositions in 2005 included a $2.0 million gain from an insurance reimbursement due to fire damage in certain manufacturing facilities offset by a $0.5 million loss on disposal of fixed assets due to a facilities upgrade. Loss on dispositions in 2004 included a $0.7 million loss from the sale of a business and was partially offset by a $0.3 million gain from the sale of facilities. 2004 Compared to 2003. Dispositions resulted in a net loss of $0.4 million in 2004 versus a net gain of $2.5 million in 2003. Gains on dispositions in 2003 included $2.2 million from sales of facilities and $0.5 million from post closing adjustments associated with the resolution of contingencies related to the sale of our Instruments for Research and Applied Sciences business, which we refer to as IRAS. 30 Table of Contents Interest and Other Expense, Net Interest and other expense, net consisted of the following: 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Interest income $ (3,321 ) $ (2,401 ) $ (2,479 ) Interest expense 27,291 36,203 50,213 (Gains) losses on sale of investments, net (5,844 ) 300 2,391 Extinguishment of debt 54,886 4,143 1,953 Other 1,279 87 1,435 $ 74,291 $ 38,332 $ 53,513 2005 Compared to 2004. Interest and other expense, net for 2005 was $74.3 million versus $38.3 million for 2004, an increase of $36.0 million or 94%. The increase in interest and other expense, net in 2005 as compared to 2004, was due primarily to the fees associated with the extinguishment of approximately $300 million of our Senior Subordinated Notes, which included premium fees of $36.3 million, an $8.9 million accelerated amortization of term loan and Senior Subordinated Notes issuance fees, and $8.5 million in charges associated with terminating interest rate swaps. The increase was partially offset by a corresponding decrease in interest expense on our Senior Subordinated Notes that were purchases pursuant to our tender offer in the fourth quarter of 2005, as well as a lower average outstanding term loan balance (which was approximately $120 million). In addition, we recognized a gain on sale of investments of $5.8 million associated with the liquidation of an investment. We anticipate that interest expense will decrease in 2006 as compared to 2005 due to the repayment of the Senior Subordinate Notes in 2005. A more complete discussion of our liquidity is set forth below under the heading, Liquidity and Capital Resources. 2004 Compared to 2003. Interest and other expense, net for 2004 was $38.3 million versus $53.5 million for 2003, a decrease of $15.2 million or 28%. The decrease in interest and other expense, net in 2004 as compared to 2003, was due primarily to a lower average outstanding term loan balance, by about $100 million. Interest and other expense also declined as a result of lower interest rates applicable to our term loan which are attributable to an amendment of our credit facility in the fourth quarter of 2003. The remaining decrease in interest and other expense was the result of (i) swapping $100 million of our Senior Subordinated Notes from fixed rate debt to a floating rate based on six month USD Libor in January 2004, resulting in a $2.2 million decrease in interest expense, and (ii) $2.3 million of net interest expense not incurred in 2004 as it was related to our zero coupon convertible debentures which we redeemed in 2003. The decrease in interest and other expense was partially offset by our increased acceleration of debt issuance costs of $4.1 million resulting from partial prepayments of our term debt during 2004, versus $1.9 million in 2003. Provision/Benefit for Income Taxes 2005 Compared to 2004. The 2005 provision for income taxes from continuing operations was $0.1 million, versus a provision of $23.5 million in 2004. The 2005 effective tax rate from continuing operations was 0.19% as compared to the 2004 effective tax rate of 23.6%. The reduction in the effective tax rate between the years was due to (i) an incremental $17 million benefit associated with the conclusion of audits with the Internal Revenue Service and Revenue Canada with respect to the years 1999 through 2002; and (ii) the use in 2005 of federal, state, and foreign tax attributes (current year state and foreign net operating losses, federal current year research and experimental credits, and state current year income tax credits) enabled by the sale of our Fluid Sciences business unit. These benefits were partially offset by an incremental accrual of $6.8 million for the tax cost of the domestic reinvestment plan repatriation calculated in accordance with the homeland investment provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. 2004 Compared to 2003. The 2004 provision for income taxes was $23.5 million, versus a provision of $22.7 million in 2003. The 2004 effective tax rate was 23.6% as compared to the 2003 effective tax rate of 31 Table of Contents 30.9%. The reduction to the effective tax rate was primarily due to a $10.4 million benefit associated with the resolution of an appeal of Internal Revenue Service audit findings with respect to our 1997 and 1998 taxes; additional benefits resulting from the conclusion of tax audits in Canada and the U.K.; reduction of our state tax expense; and the use of existing foreign net operating losses. These benefits were partially offset by an accrual of $8.7 million for the estimated U.S. tax cost of repatriation calculated in accordance with the homeland investment provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Discontinued Operations We recorded the following gains and losses, which we report as the gain (loss) on dispositions of discontinued operations, during the years ended January 1, 2006 and January 2, 2005: 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Gain on the sale of Aerospace business $ 250,638 $ $ Gain on the sale of Fluid Testing business 30,281 Loss on the sale of Fiber Optics Test Equipment business (5,184 ) Loss on the sale of Lithography business (3,307 ) Gain on the resolution of contingencies associated with the Technical Services business 900 1,487 6,535 Gain (loss) on other discontinued businesses 497 (2,303 ) (6,757 ) Net gain (loss) on disposition of discontinued operations before income taxes 273,825 (816 ) (222 ) Provision (benefit) for income taxes 87,463 (321 ) 226 Gain (loss) on disposition of discontinued operations, net of income taxes $ 186,362 $ (495 ) $ (448 ) In September 2005, our Board of Directors approved a plan to divest our Fluid Sciences business segment to increase our strategic focus on our higher growth markets within the Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics businesses. The Fluid Sciences business segment consisted of three businesses Aerospace, Fluid Testing and Semiconductor. In November 2005 we sold the Fluid Testing business to Caleb Brett USA Inc. for approximately $34.5 million, resulting in a net pre tax gain of $30.3 million. In December 2005, we sold the Aerospace business to Eaton Corporation for approximately $333 million, resulting in a net pre tax gain of $250.6 million. We recognized these gains during fiscal 2005. We received total cash proceeds in these transactions of approximately $360 million. On February 27, 2006, we sold substantially all of the assets of our Semiconductor business to an entity affiliated with Tara Capital, Inc. for approximately $26.5 million (subject to a net working capital adjustment) and additional contingent consideration that could bring the total proceeds received to more than $30 million. We are currently in the process of computing the gain on the transaction and will record such amount in the first quarter of 2006. As part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth markets, in December 2005, our Board of Directors also approved a plan to sell our Lithography business. We received proceeds of $0.5 million upon the sale of the business and recognized a pre tax loss of $3.3 million. We previously had reported the results of this business as part of the Optoelectronics reporting segment. In June 2005, our Board of Directors approved a plan to shut down our Fiber Optics Test Equipment business as part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities. We previously had reported the results of this business as part of the Optoelectronics reporting segment. The shut down of this business resulted in a $5.2 million loss related to lease and severance costs and the reduction of fixed assets and inventory to net realizable value. In August 2005, certain assets that were previously written down were subsequently sold resulting in a gain of $0.1 million. As part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities, in June 2004, our Board of Directors approved a plan to shut down our Electroformed Products business and sell our Ultraviolet Lighting 32 Table of Contents business. In September 2004, our Board of Directors approved a plan to shut down our Computer To Plate business. We previously had reported the results of all three of these businesses as part of the Optoelectronics reporting segment. The net assets of the Electroformed Products business were written off resulting in a $1.6 million pre tax loss for the year ended January 2, 2005. We sold the fixed assets and inventory of the Ultraviolet Lighting business in July 2004 for their approximate book value. The abandonment of the Computer To Plate business resulted in a $1.0 million write down of fixed assets and inventory. During 2005 and 2004, we settled various claims under certain long term contracts and transition services with our Technical Services business, which we sold in August 1999. The net settlement and the reversal of certain previously established contingencies resulted in pre tax gains of $0.9 million in 2005 and $1.5 million in 2004. Summary operating results of the discontinued operations were as follows: 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Sales $ 223,997 $ 261,535 $ 194,899 Costs and expenses 200,156 225,045 187,276 Operating income from discontinued operations 23,841 36,490 7,623 Other expense 1,314 1,778 2,600 Income from discontinued operations before income taxes 22,527 34,712 5,023 Provision for income taxes 7,313 14,053 2,371 Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes $ 15,214 $ 20,659 $ 2,652 Acquisitions In February 2005, we acquired Elcos AG, a leading European designer and manufacturer of custom light emitting diode, or LED, solutions for biomedical and industrial applications. Consideration for the transaction was approximately $15.4 million in cash at the time of closing, $0.3 million of additional payments in 2005 and approximately $1.1 million due through fiscal 2007. Also, we estimate that under an earn out provision in the acquisition agreement we will make an additional cash payment of approximately $3.1 million in 2006 to reflect the performance of the business in 2005, with the potential for additional earn out payments being made in 2007 and 2008 based on the performance of the business in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Contingencies, Including Tax Matters We are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party for certain waste disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. We have accrued $3.7 million as of January 1, 2006, representing our managements estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters. This amount is not discounted and does not reflect any recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. These cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the timeframe over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party, our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. We expect that such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. While it is possible that a material loss exceeding the amounts recorded may be incurred, we do not expect the potential exposure to be materially different from the amounts we recorded. 33 Table of Contents In papers dated October 23, 2002, Enzo Biochem, Inc. and Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. (Enzo) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Civil Action No. 02 8448, against Amersham PLC, Amersham BioSciences, PerkinElmer, Inc., PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc., Sigma Aldrich Corporation, Sigma Chemical Company, Inc., Molecular Probes, Inc., and Orchid BioSciences, Inc. The complaint alleges that we have breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with Enzo, infringed Enzos patents, engaged in unfair competition and fraud, and committed torts against Enzo by, among other things, engaging in commercial development and exploitation of Enzos patented products and technology, separately and together with the other defendants. Enzo seeks injunctive and monetary relief. On May 28, 2003, the Court severed the lawsuit and ordered Enzo to serve individual complaints against the five defendants. Enzo served its new complaint on July 16, 2003, and we subsequently filed an answer denying the substantive allegations and including a counterclaim alleging that several of Enzos patents are invalid. During the last half of 2005, fact discovery was largely completed and a Markman hearing was conducted regarding the construction of the claims in Enzos patents. The court has not yet issued its decision regarding claim construction or set a date for trial. On October 17, 2003, Amersham Biosciences Corp. filed a complaint, which was subsequently amended, in the United States District Court for New Jersey, Civil Action No. 03 4901, against one of our subsidiaries alleging that our ViewLux and certain of our Image FlashPlates infringe three of Amershams patents related to high throughput screening (the NJ case). On August 18, 2004, Amersham Plc filed a complaint against two of our United Kingdom based subsidiaries in the Patent Court of the English High Court of Justice, Case No. 04C02688, alleging that the same products infringe Amershams European (United Kingdom) patent granted in August 2004 (the UK case). Amersham seeks injunctive and monetary relief in both cases. We subsequently filed answers in both cases denying the substantive allegations and including affirmative defenses and counterclaims. On October 29, 2003, we filed a complaint, which was subsequently amended, against Amersham Biosciences Corp. in the United States District Court for Massachusetts, Civil Action No. 03 12098, alleging that Amershams IN Cell Analyzer, LEADseeker Multimodality Imaging system and certain Cyclic AMP and IP3 assays infringe two of our patents related to high throughput screening (the MA case). We seek injunctive and monetary relief. Amersham subsequently filed an answer denying the substantive allegations and including affirmative defenses and counterclaims. Trial in the UK case was completed in December 2005. In February 2006, the court ruled that Amershams patent in question was invalid in the United Kingdom and awarded costs to us. In the NJ case, discovery regarding issues of liability, which have been bifurcated from issues of damages, has largely been completed and a Markman hearing on claim construction is anticipated in early 2006. No trial date has been set. In the MA case, discovery is ongoing. We believe we have meritorious defenses to these lawsuits and other proceedings, and we are contesting the actions vigorously in all of the above matters. We are currently unable, however, to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, if any, that may result from the resolution of these matters or to determine whether resolution of any of these matters will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. In 2005, we resolved certain claims, including the securities litigation described in Part I of this annual report on Form 10 K under Item 3. Legal Proceedings. The resolution of these claims did not have a material impact on our financial statements. During 2005, the Internal Revenue Service concluded its audit of federal income taxes for the years 1999 through 2002. We have agreed to all matters with the exception of one, and have filed a single issue protest with the Appeals Division of the Internal Revenue Service, and expect to resolve the matter in 2006. Regardless of the outcome of this matter, we do not expect final resolution to significantly impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows in 2006. We are under regular examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities in the United States and other countries, such as Germany, the United Kingdom, and states in which we have significant business operations, such as California and New York. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction; with the most significant one being that undertaken by the German tax authority for the years 1999 through 2003. 34 Table of Contents During the year, in addition to the IRS audit described above, we concluded audits concerning income tax matters affecting certain of our subsidiaries with Texas, Illinois, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Belgium. As a result of concluding the federal, state, and foreign audits during 2005, we recognized a benefit of $27.5 million. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from these and subsequent years examinations. Tax reserves have been established, which we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted as information becomes available and when an event occurs requiring a change to the reserves. The resolution of current tax audits is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition, although adjustments related to the examination process or audit settlement could have a material impact on our income tax expense, cash flow, and consolidated statement of income for a particular future period. We are also subject to various other claims, legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. Each of these matters is subject to uncertainties, and it is possible that some of theses matters may be resolved unfavorably to us. In the opinion of our management, based on its review of the information available at this time, the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at January 1, 2006 should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. Reporting Segment Results of Continuing Operations Life and Analytical Sciences 2005 Compared to 2004. Sales for 2005 were $1,081.1 million, versus $1,062.8 million in 2004, an increase of $18.3 million, or 2%. Changes in foreign exchange rates had an immaterial impact on sales and operating profit. Fiscal 2005 had 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in fiscal 2004. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, an average weeks sales represented $22.3 million. The following analysis compares significant sales by market and product type for 2005, as compared to 2004, and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the previously mentioned extra week during 2004: sales to genetic screening customers increased $17.1 million, OneSource service sales increased by $15.1 million, sales to environmental and chemical analysis customers increased $5.5 million, and sales to biopharmaceutical customers decreased $19.4 million. Sales by type of product included increases in sales of instruments of $9.0 million, service of $15.1 million, offset by decreases in consumables of $5.8 million. Operating profit for 2005 was $110.2 million, versus $103.6 million in 2004, an increase of $6.6 million or 6%. Increases in operating profit resulting from increased sales volume, productivity initiatives and restructuring activities were offset by a restructuring charge of $12.9 million and a $1.7 million increase in research and development spending. Amortization of intangibles was $26.2 million for the year ended January 1, 2006, versus $26.4 million for the year ended January 2, 2005. 2004 Compared to 2003. Sales for 2004 were $1,062.8 million, versus $1,003.7 million in 2003, an increase of $59.1 million, or 6%. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by $39.2 million over 2003. Fiscal 2004 had 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2003. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, an average weeks sales represented $22.3 million. The following analysis compares significant sales by market and product type for 2004, as compared to 2003, and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the previously mentioned extra week during 2004. Sales to environmental and chemical analysis customers increased $24.8 million, OneSource service sales increased by $20.4 million, sales to genetic screening customers increased $11.4 million, and sales to biopharmaceutical customers increased $2.5 million. Sales by type of product included increases in sales of instruments of $33.5 million, service of $20.4 million, and consumables of $5.2 million. 35 Table of Contents Operating profit for 2004 was $103.6 million, versus $94.7 million in 2003, an increase of $8.9 million or 9%. Research and development increased $3.5 million in 2004, as compared to 2003. Contributing to the increase were net cost savings associated with various productivity initiatives, including our restructuring and integration activities which resulted in a reduction of employees and the elimination of excess facilities. Offsetting these net cost savings were a $1.9 million restructuring reversal in 2003 for which there was no similar reversal in 2004, and dispositions which created a $0.8 million loss in 2004 versus dispositions which created a $1.6 million gain in 2003. Amortization of intangibles was $26.4 million for the year ended January 2, 2005, versus $26.0 million for the year ended December 28, 2003. Optoelectronics 2005 Compared to 2004. Sales for 2005 were $392.7 million, versus $366.3 million for 2004, an increase of $26.4 million, or 7%. Acquisitions increased 2005 sales by $12.1 million over 2004. Changes in foreign exchange rates had an immaterial impact on sales and operating profit. Fiscal 2005 had 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in fiscal 2004. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, an average weeks sales represented $7.1 million. The following analysis of significant sales by product line for 2005, as compared to 2004, includes the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates and the previously mentioned extra week during 2004. Sales of specialty lighting products increased by $10.2 million, sales of digital imaging products increased by $9.4 million due to increased sales of diagnostic and radiotherapy digital x ray products, and sales of sensors increased $6.8 million. Operating profit for 2005 was $58.4 million, versus $59.1 million for 2004, a decrease of $0.7 million, or 1%. The decrease in operating profit was primarily the result of increases in operating profit from increased sales volume, net productivity improvements and cost reduction actions, which were more than offset by pricing reductions and a $9.2 million restructuring charge. Amortization of intangible assets increased to $2.6 million in 2005 from $1.2 million in 2004 due to the acquisition of Elcos in the beginning of 2005. 2004 Compared to 2003. Sales for 2004 were $366.3 million, versus $340.8 million for 2003, an increase of $25.5 million, or 7%. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by $6.5 million over 2003. Fiscal 2004 had 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2003. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, an average weeks sales represented $7.1 million. The following analysis of significant sales by product line for 2004, as compared to 2003, includes the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates and the previously mentioned extra week during 2004. Sales of digital imaging products increased by $21.4 million due to increased sales of diagnostic and radiotherapy digital x ray products. Sales of sensors increased $8.6 million, and sales of specialty lighting products decreased by $4.5 million due to lower photoflash sales into single use cameras. Operating profit for 2004 was $59.1 million, versus $52.7 million for 2003, an increase of $6.4 million or 12%. The increase in operating profit was primarily the result of increased sales volume and net productivity improvements and cost reduction actions, offset in part by pricing reductions. Amortization of intangible assets was $1.2 million for both 2004 and 2003. Liquidity and Capital Resources We require cash to pay our operating expenses including funding our research and development, make capital expenditures, service our debt and other long term liabilities, and pay dividends on our common stock. Our principal sources of funds are from our operations and the capital markets, particularly the debt markets. In the near term, we anticipate that our operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures, interest payments on our debt, and dividends on our common stock. In the long term, we expect to use internally generated funds and external sources to satisfy our debt and other long term liabilities. Principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include: deterioration of sales due to weakness in markets in which we sell our products and services, and changes in our working capital requirements. 36 Table of Contents Principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include: financial covenants contained in our borrowings that limit our total borrowing capacity, increases in interest rates applicable to our outstanding variable rate debt, a ratings downgrade that would limit our ability to borrow under our accounts receivable facility and our overall access to the corporate debt market, volatility in the markets for corporate debt, a decrease in the market price for our common stock, and volatility in the public equity markets. Cash Flows Fiscal Year 2005 Operating Activities. Net cash generated by continuing operations operating activities was $193.4 million in 2005. Contributing to the generation of cash from operating activities during 2005 were net income from continuing operations of $66.5 million, amortization of deferred debt issuance costs, accretion of discounts and extinguishment of debt of $57.4 million, depreciation and amortization of $67.0 million, non cash restructuring expense of $22.1 million, stock based compensation of $9.8 million and a decrease in working capital accounts of $12.5 million, offset by $27.8 million from the resolution of prior year tax contingencies and $13.5 million from accrued expenses and other. Contributing to the decrease in working capital accounts in 2005 was an increase in accounts payable of $23.2 million, offset by increases in accounts receivable of $10.4 million and inventory of $0.3 million. There was no incremental use of our accounts receivable securitization facility during 2005. The outstanding amount under this facility totaled $45.0 million at both January 1, 2006 and January 2, 2005. As discussed under Off Balance Sheet Arrangements, we had approximately $20 million of undrawn capacity available under the facility at January 1, 2006. Investing Activities. Investing activities related to continuing operations contributed $333.3 million in 2005. In 2005, we received $366.6 million from the disposition of businesses, primarily comprising Fluid Sciences proceeds of $359.1 million. We also received $9.4 million from dispositions of property, plant and equipment. Also in 2005, we made capital expenditures of $25.1 million, mainly for tooling and productivity improvements and for system and facility costs. In addition, we used $17.6 million for acquisitions and investments, primarily for our acquisition of Elcos for $13.2 million and the settlement of earn outs for $1.8 million. Financing Activities. In 2005, we used $217.6 million of net cash in continuing operations financing activities. Debt reductions during 2005 totaled $374.7 million, primarily comprising $300.0 million used to repay our senior subordinated debt, and $70.0 million to repay our term loan. In addition, we paid $36.3 million of premium related to the prepayment of our senior subordinated debt and $8.5 million to settle interest rate swaps on this debt. We also paid $36.3 million in dividends and $24.4 million to purchase our common stock pursuant to a stock repurchase program we implemented in 2005. We borrowed $244.3 million related to the repatriation of funds under the American Jobs Creation Act and received $19.4 million from the exercise of employee stock options. Fiscal Year 2004 Operating Activities. Net cash generated by continuing operations operating activities was $173.0 million in 2004. Contributing to the generation of cash from operating activities during 2004 was net income from continuing operations of $75.9 million, depreciation and amortization of $67.6 million, a net change in deferred taxes of $21.9 million, stock based compensation of $8.4 million, amortization of deferred debt issuance costs, 37 Table of Contents accretion of discounts and extinguishment of debt of $8.1 million, and a decrease in working capital accounts of $9.1 million, offset by a decrease of $10.8 million in accrued expenses and other and a net change of $8.0 million from the resolution of prior year tax contingencies. Contributing to the decrease in working capital in 2004 were decreases in accounts receivable of $18.0 million and inventory of $5.6 million, offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $14.4 million. In general, accounts receivable collections increased due primarily to our focus on improved processes and collections, whereas inventory balances decreased primarily due to improved logistics and inventory management processes. Accounts payable decreased primarily due to timing of payments. There was no incremental use of our accounts receivable securitization facility during 2004. Investing Activities. Investing activities related to continuing operations used $9.2 million in 2004. In 2004, we made capital expenditures of $15.8 million, mainly for tooling and productivity improvements and for system and facility costs. We derived $3.4 million from sales of a building and equipment and $2.8 million from the settlement of an escrow related to an entity acquired in 2000. Financing Activities. In 2004, we used $195.7 million of net cash in financing activities related to continuing operations. Debt reductions during 2004 totaled $175.0 million, comprised of $175.0 million used to repay a portion of our term loan. We also paid $35.8 million in dividends and received net cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $15.0 million in 2004. Current Borrowing Arrangements Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. On October 31, 2005, we entered into a new $350 million five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility. This facility replaced our existing $100 million five year revolving credit facility. Letters of credit in the aggregate amount of approximately $15 million, originally issued under our previous credit agreement, will be treated as issued under this new agreement. The new senior unsecured credit facility will be used for general corporate purposes which may include fulfilling working capital needs, refinancing existing indebtedness, making capital expenditures, repurchasing shares, or consummating acquisitions and strategic alliances. The interest rates under the senior unsecured credit facility are based on the Eurocurrency rate at the time of borrowing plus a margin, or the base rate from time to time. The base rate is the higher of (1) the corporate base rate announced from time to time by Bank of America, N.A. and (2) the Federal funds rate plus 50 basis points. We may allocate all or a portion of our indebtedness under the senior credit facility to interest based upon the Eurocurrency rate plus a margin or the base rate. The Eurocurrency margin as of January 1, 2006 was 60 basis points; the weighted average Eurocurrency rate was 2.51%. There were approximately $243 million of borrowings under the facility as of January 1, 2006 with interest based on the above described Eurocurrency rate. At year end, the borrowings were undertaken by certain foreign subsidiaries of ours and the funds were borrowed in the subsidiaries functional currencies of Euro (EUR), Canadian Dollars (CAD) and Japanese Yen (JPY). The effective rates of the borrowings as of January 1, 2006 were as follows: EUR: 3.04%; CAD: 3.97% and JPY: .67%. Our senior credit facility contains covenants that require us to maintain specific financial ratios, including: A minimum interest coverage ratio, and A maximum total leverage ratio. At all times during 2005, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. 38 Table of Contents Prior to the fourth quarter of 2005, we had a number of borrowings from a number of different sources. These included our: Senior Secured Credit Facility which was established in December 2002. This facility was the predecessor to the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility described above and was terminated in October 2005. This facility comprised a six year term loan in the amount of $315.0 million and a $100.0 million five year secured revolving credit facility. In 2005, prior to the above described refinancing, we made $70.0 million of principal payments on the term loan. Interest rates under the senior credit facility applicable to the term loan and to the revolving credit facility were determined as a margin over either the Eurodollar rate or the base rate. The base rate was the higher of (1) the corporate base rate announced from time to time by Bank of America, N.A. and (2) the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points. The applicable margins for the term loan and the revolving credit facility varied based upon our leverage ratio at the end of the prior quarter. In October 2004, we amended the senior credit facility to allow greater flexibility regarding acquisitions, stock repurchases, debt reduction and cash repatriation. Our prior revolving credit facility was available to us through December 2007 for our working capital needs. At no point in fiscal 2005, nor at any other time, did we have any outstanding principal balance under this prior revolving credit facility. Our senior credit facility which terminated in October 2005 contained covenants that required us to maintain specific financial ratios, including: a minimum interest coverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, and a maximum senior leverage ratio. At all times during 2005, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. Senior Subordinated Notes issued in December 2002. These were ten year senior subordinated notes issued at a rate of 8 7/8% with a face value of $300.0 million (the Senior Subordinated Notes). In the second quarter of 2005, we repurchased $30.0 million of this debt. The Senior Subordinated Notes had an outstanding balance as of October 2, 2005 of $270 million. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we commenced and substantially completed a cash tender offer and consent solicitation for any and all of our outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes. On November 14, 2005, as part of an initial settlement under the tender offer, we repurchased $269.9 million of the Senior Subordinated Notes. We completed the tender offer and repurchased all but $25 thousand of these notes as of November 23, 2005. The source of funds for the tender offer was comprised of proceeds from the sale of our Fluid Testing business, our cash and cash equivalents, and our new unsecured credit facility. In connection with the tender offer, we solicited consents to amend the indenture under which the Senior Subordinated Notes were issued and removed most of the restrictive covenants from the indenture. In January 2004, we swapped the fixed rate on $100 million of the Senior Subordinated Notes to a floating rate using swap instruments which reset semi annually in arrears based upon six month USD LIBOR and an applicable spread as defined in the swap agreements. In January 2005, we swapped an additional $100 million of these notes from fixed rate to floating rate at similar terms to the January 2004 swap, and therefore we were obligated to pay the applicable six month USD LIBOR rate, plus the applicable spread, on $200 million of our obligations represented by the notes. On November 10, 2005, we terminated the interest rate swaps in conjunction with our tender of the Senior Subordinated Notes at a cost of $8.5 million. 6.8% Notes issued by one of our acquired companies. In December 2002, we initiated a tender offer for all of our outstanding 6.8% notes. We completed the tender offer and repurchased all but $4.7 million of these notes as of December 26, 2002. The remaining principal balance of $4.7 million matured and was paid in the fourth quarter of 2005. 39 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Receivables Securitization Facility Through a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, we purchase, on a revolving basis, certain of our accounts receivable balances and simultaneously sell an undivided interest in this pool of receivables to a financial institution. The total funding capacity under this facility is $65.0 million. Amounts funded under this facility were $45.0 million at both January 1, 2006 and January 2, 2005. As of January 1, 2006, we had approximately $20 million of undrawn capacity available under the facility. The facility had an effective interest rate of approximately LIBOR plus 53 basis points as of January 1, 2006. The facility includes conditions that require us to maintain a senior unsecured credit rating of BB or above, as defined by Standard & Poors Rating Services, and Ba2 or above, as defined by Moodys Investors Service. At January 1, 2006, we had a senior unsecured credit rating of BBB with a stable outlook from Standard & Poors Rating Services, and of Baa3 with a stable outlook from Moodys Investors Service. The facility expires on January 26, 2007. Dividends Our Board of Directors declared regular quarterly cash dividends of seven cents per share in each quarter of 2005 and 2004, resulting in an annual dividend rate of 28 cents per share. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at January 1, 2006: Operating Leases Sr. Unsecured Credit FacilityMaturing 2010 8.875% Sr. Subordinated Notes due2013 OtherRevolvingDebtFacilities Total (In thousands) 2006 $ 30,568 $ $ $ 1,131 $ 31,699 2007 22,399 22,399 2008 18,752 18,752 2009 15,652 15,652 2010 13,732 243,257 256,989 2011 and beyond 61,637 25 61,662 Total $ 162,740 $ 243,257 $ 25 $ 1,131 $ 407,153 Because the credit facility borrowings are considered to carry variable interest rates, the above table does not contemplate interest obligations. Capital Expenditures During 2006, we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately $35 million to $45 million primarily to introduce new products, to improve our operating processes, to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations, to relocate certain administrative facilities, and to capitalize expenses related to internally developed information technology. We expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures. Other Potential Liquidity Considerations In February 2005, we acquired Elcos AG, a leading European designer and manufacturer of custom light emitting diode, or LED, solutions for biomedical and industrial applications. The transaction combines Elcos visible LED technology platform and strong customer and application base with our global sales, application and support organization, therefore expanding the sales growth opportunities for the Elcos technology. We paid 40 Table of Contents approximately $15.4 million in cash at the time of closing, $0.3 million in additional payments in 2005, and are required to make future cash payments of approximately $1.1 million through fiscal 2007. Also, we estimate that under an earn out provision in the acquisition agreement we will make an additional cash payment of approximately $3.1 million in 2006 to reflect the performance of the business in 2005, with the potential for additional earn out payments being made in 2007 and 2008 based on the performance of the business in 2006 and 2007, respectively. On October 21, 2005 our Board of Directors reaffirmed our authority to repurchase up to 10.0 million shares of our common stock, which we publicly disclosed on November 14, 2005 (the Program). This Program will expire on October 21, 2008, unless it is earlier terminated by our Board of Directors. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of our common stock in the open market under the Program at an aggregate cost of $24.4 million. Subsequent to year end, we repurchased 5.0 million shares of our common stock in the open market under the Program at an average cost of $23.25 per share. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R). SFAS 123R supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. This statement addressed the accounting for share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options. Under the new standard, companies will no longer be able to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25. Instead, companies will be required to account for such transactions using a fair value method and recognize the related expense associated with share based payments in the statement of operations. SFAS 123R is effective for us as of January 1, 2006. We historically accounted for share based payments to employees under APB Opinion No. 25s intrinsic value method. As such, we have not recognized compensation expense for options granted to employees. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R under the modified prospective method, in which compensation cost for all share based payments granted or modified after the effective date is recognized based upon the requirements of SFAS 123R, and compensation cost for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that are unvested as of the effective date of SFAS 123R is recognized based on SFAS 123. Tax benefits will be recognized related to the cost for share based payments to the extent the equity instrument would ordinarily result in a future tax deduction under existing law. Tax expense will be recognized to write off excess deferred tax assets when the tax deduction upon settlement of a vested option is less than the expense recorded in the statement of operations (to the extent not offset by prior tax credits for settlements where the tax deduction was greater than the fair value cost). Our current estimates associated with 2006 indicate that we will recognize stock option compensation expense of approximately 6 cents per share. This amount is subject to revisions as we finalize certain assumptions related to 2006, including the size and nature of awards and forfeiture rates. SFAS 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financial cash flow rather than as operating cash flow as was required. We cannot estimate what the future tax benefits will be as the amounts depend on, among other factors, future employee stock option exercises. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107 regarding the Staffs interpretation of SFAS 123R. This interpretation provides the Staffs views regarding interactions between SFAS 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations, and provides interpretations of the valuation of share based payments for public companies. The interpretive guidance is intended to assist companies in applying the provisions of SFAS 123R, and investors and users of the financial statements in analyzing the information provided. We will follow the guidance prescribed in SAB No. 107 in connection with our adoption of SFAS 123R. On November 29, 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. Statement 151 clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material. Statement 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred beginning after January 1, 2006. We have evaluated the adoption of Statement 151 and have determined it will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 41 Table of Contents Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, income taxes, restructuring, pensions and other post retirement benefits, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue recognition. We record product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, we recognize product revenue upon delivery, and we delay recognition of installation revenue until the installation is complete. For sales that include customer specified acceptance criteria, we recognize revenue only after the acceptance criteria have been met. We defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period or as we render services and the customer accepts them. When arrangements include multiple elements, we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element, all in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. Because the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than long term customized projects, we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates. Further, we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation. Allowances for doubtful accounts. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by (1) applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible; and (2) specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty. Therefore, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates, we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts. This would reduce our earnings. Inventory valuation. We initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase and or manufacture. We periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost. Generally, reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand or technological obsolescence of the inventory. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and, when necessary, record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements or historical trailing usage of the product. If our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels, we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory. This would reduce our earnings. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold, resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period. Value of long lived assets, including intangibles. We carry a variety of long lived assets on our balance sheet including property and equipment, investments, identifiable intangible assets, and goodwill. We periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based, in part, upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows. We undertake this review (1) on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and non amortizing intangible assets and (2) on a periodic basis for other long lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from those assets may be diminished. Any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings. We completed the annual impairment tests of goodwill 42 Table of Contents for 2005 and 2004 and concluded that there were no impairments. While we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable, different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets. In addition, we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our non amortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. If events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of non amortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite, the assets will be tested for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142. These intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization. Employee compensation and benefits. Retirement and post retirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. Retirement and post retirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of sales, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations. We incurred expenses of $11.9 million in 2005, $9.1 million in 2004 and $6.2 million in 2003 for our retirement and post retirement plans. We expect expenses of approximately $11.7 million in 2006 for our retirement and post retirement plans. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made. We are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied, to determine service cost and interest cost, in order to arrive at pension income or expense for the year. As of January 1, 2006, we estimated the expected long term rate of return of assets in our pension portfolios in the United States was 8.5%, and was 7.5% for plans outside the United States. We have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets, as well as our current expectations for long term rates of returns for our pension assets. Our management will continue to assess the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumptions for each plan based on relevant market conditions and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate. Discount rate assumptions have been, and continue to be, based on the prevailing market long term interest rates at the measurement date. If any of our assumptions were to change, our pension plan expenses would also change. A one quarter percent increase in the discount rate would decrease our net periodic benefit cost by $0.6 million for 2006 in the United States and by $0.2 million for 2006 for all plans outside the United States. A one percent decrease in the estimated return on plan assets would increase our pre tax pension expense by $2.0 million for 2006 in the United States and by $0.8 million for 2006 for all plans outside the United States. We have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature. Under the defined dollar plan feature, our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount, regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree. Our maximum future liability, therefore, cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare. Restructuring activities. Our financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals. Our restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of (1) severance benefits to be granted to employees, based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades, (2) costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of sub rental income and (3) asset impairments as discussed above under Value of Long Lived Assets, Including Intangibles. Because these accruals are estimates, they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention. For example, actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance, or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected. In addition, unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates. When such changes in estimates occur, they are reflected in our financial statements on the income statement line entitled restructuring charges, net. 43 Table of Contents Gains or losses on dispositions. When we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation, we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition. This estimate is based on a variety of factors, including current interest in the market, alternative markets for the assets and other relevant factors. If anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation, we record a loss. If anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation, we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated. Accordingly, we may realize amounts different than were first estimated. During the year ended January 1, 2006, we recognized $1.5 million in gains from disposition of fixed assets. We also recorded $186.4 million in gains from the disposition of discontinued operations, which was comprised of gains from the final disposition of our Aerospace, Fluid Testing, Telecommunications Components and Technical Services businesses, offset by losses associated with the disposition of our Fiber Optics Test Equipment and Lithography businesses. Any such changes decrease or increase current earnings, and are recorded either against the gains on disposition or discontinued operations line items appearing in our income statement. Income taxes. Our business operations are global in nature, and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries. We report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law. Our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax provisions. Any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change. Such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are operational decisions, transactions, facts and circumstances, and calculations in which the ultimate tax determination is not certain. Furthermore, our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world. Where appropriate, we reserve for tax matters when we believe that the likelihood of an incremental liability being incurred is probable in accordance with the provisions of FAS 5 and FAS 109. Any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts, law, tax rates, tax audit, or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense, our effective tax rate, or our cash flow. Additionally, in accordance with FAS 109 we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, foreign tax credits, and other income tax credits. Valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable. Improvements or other changes in our operations, domestically and internationally, could increase our ability to utilize these tax attributes in the future. The release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our effective tax rate. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks Financial Instruments Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments, marketable securities and accounts receivable. We believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of January 1, 2006. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Transactions covered by hedge contracts include inter company and third party receivables and payables. The contracts are primarily in European and Asian currencies, have maturities that do not exceed 44 Table of Contents 12 months, have no cash requirements until maturity, and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Credit risk is minimal as the foreign exchange instruments are contracted with major banking institutions. Unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and, for hedges designated as cash flow, the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs. For the year ended January 1, 2006, we did not engage in any designated cash flow hedges. The notional amount of the outstanding foreign currency contracts was approximately $197.6 million at January 1, 2006 and $166.8 million as of January 2, 2005, and the approximate fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant. The duration of the foreign currency derivative contracts was generally 30 days for 2005. Market Risk Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk, including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures. Foreign Exchange Risk. As a multinational corporation, we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. These exposures can take a variety of different forms: (1) As our international sales grow, exposure to volatility in exchange rates could have a material impact on our financial results. Reported sales made in foreign currencies by our international subsidiaries, when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, can fluctuate due to exchange rate movements. While exchange rate fluctuations can impact reported revenues and earnings, this impact is purely a result of the translation effect and does not materially impact our short term cash flows. (2) In all parts of the world, our subsidiaries, on occasion, invoice third party customers in foreign currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business. We refer to our subsidiaries primary business currencies as the functional currencies. Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency result in both realized and unrealized transaction gains or losses that directly impact our cash flows and our results of operations. (3) Our manufacturing and distribution organization is worldwide. Accordingly, inventories may be manufactured in one location, stored in another, and distributed in a third location. This results in a wide array of intercompany transactions transactions that are billed and paid in many different currencies. Our cash flows and our results of operations are therefore directly impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates of currencies involved. (4) The cash flow needs of each of our foreign subsidiaries vary through time. Accordingly, there may be times when a subsidiary lends to or borrows from either the parent company or another affiliate. These advances, again being denominated in currencies other than a particular entitys functional currency, can expose it to fluctuations in exchange rates that can impact both our cash flows and results of operations. (5) In order to repay debt or satisfy operational needs, we may remit cash from our foreign locations to the United States. When this occurs, we are liquidating foreign currency net asset positions and converting them into United States dollars. Our cash flows and our results of operations are therefore also impacted by these transactions. We may use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. The derivative instruments held by us are not leveraged and are not held for trading purposes. We specifically use forward contracts to hedge our foreign denominated assets and liabilities and may use a combination of forward and option contracts to hedge anticipated cash flows. Our hedging activity is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on assets, liabilities and cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. The success of our hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in various currencies. To the extent 45 Table of Contents that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility, we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses. The principal currencies we hedge are the British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen, and Singapore Dollar. In those currencies where there is a liquid, cost effective forward market, we maintain hedge coverage between our established minimum and maximum percentages of our anticipated transaction exposure for periods not to exceed one year. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposure. Foreign Currency Risk Value at Risk Disclosure. We utilize a Value at Risk model to determine the potential earning/fair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments. As discussed above, we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program. Our Value at Risk computation is based on the Monte Carlo simulation, utilizing a 95% confidence interval and a holding period of 30 days. As of January 1, 2006, this computation estimated that there is a 5% chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than $0.1 million. This Value At Risk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program. Specifically, during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal 2005, the Value At Risk ranged between $0.1 million and $0.7 million, and averaged approximately $0.3 million. Interest Rate Risk. As described above, our debt portfolio includes variable rate instruments. Fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our short term cash flows, as they relate to interest, and our earnings. In January 2005 and January 2004, we effected, for a portion of our fixed rate debt portfolio, interest rate swaps that in effect convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. These swaps were designated as fair value hedges, and were marked to market in our consolidated financial statements, while they remained outstanding. The fair value movements in these swaps were offset by the fair value movement in the debt. Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity. As of January 1, 2006, our debt portfolio was comprised of $244.4 million of variable rate debt. In addition, our cash and cash equivalents, for which we receive interest at variable rates, were $502.3 million at January 1 2006. Our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows: (1) Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges on our variable rate debt, consisting of $244.4 million of revolving debt facilities, to fluctuate. An increase of 10%, or approximately 31 basis points, in current interest rates would cause an additional pre tax charge to our earnings of $.8 million for fiscal year 2006. (2) Changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt to fluctuate. As described above, an increase of 10%, or approximately 31 basis points, in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by $.8 million for fiscal year 2006. (3) Changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest received to fluctuate. 46 Table of Contents
