We are a leading provider of drug discovery, genetic screening and environmental and chemical analysis tools, including instruments, reagents, consumables, and services. Optoelectronics. We provide a broad range of digital imaging, sensor and specialty lighting components used in the biomedical, consumer products and other specialty end markets. The health sciences markets include all of the businesses in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment and the medical imaging business, as well as elements of the medical sensors and lighting businesses in our Optoelectronics segment. The photonics markets include the remaining businesses in our Optoelectronics segment. Accounting Period Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest December 31. We report fiscal years under a 52/53 week format. Under this method, certain years will contain 53 weeks. The fiscal years ended December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006 included 52 weeks. The fiscal year ended January 2, 2005 included 53 weeks. Consolidated Results of Continuing Operations Sales 2006 Compared to 2005. Sales for 2006 were $1,546.4 million versus $1,473.8 million during 2005, an increase of $72.6 million, or 5%. Acquisitions increased 2006 sales by $21.6 million over 2005. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by $9.8 million over 2005. The analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares segment sales for 2006 as compared to 2005 and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions. The total increase in sales includes a $63.5 million, or 6%, increase in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment sales, which grew from $1,081.1 million in 2005 to $1,144.6 in 2006 primarily due to increases in sales of service of $31.8 million, instruments of $29.8 and consumables and reagents of $1.9 million. Our Optoelectronics segment sales grew $9.1 million, or 2%, from $392.7 million in 2005 to $401.8 million in 2006 primarily due to sales of our digital imaging products increasing by $15.1 million, while sales within our sensors and specialty lighting product lines decreased $6.0 million. 28 Table of Contents 2005 Compared to 2004. Sales for 2005 were $1,473.8 million, versus $1,429.1 million during 2004, an increase of $44.7 million, or 3%. Acquisitions increased 2005 sales by $12.1 million over 2004, whereas changes in foreign exchange rates had an immaterial impact on sales on a year over year basis. Fiscal 2005 had 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in fiscal 2004. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, an average weeks sales represented $29.4 million. The analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares significant sales for 2005 as compared to 2004 and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the previously mentioned extra week during 2004. The total increase in sales reflects an $18.3 million, or 2%, increase in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment sales, which grew from $1,062.8 million in 2004 to $1,081.1 in 2005. Our Optoelectronics segment sales grew $26.4 million, or 7%, from $366.3 million in 2004 to $392.7 million in 2005. Cost of Sales 2006 Compared to 2005. Cost of sales for 2006 was $918.3 million, versus $859.3 million for 2005, an increase of $59.0 million, or 7%. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased to 59.4% in 2006 from 58.3% in 2005, resulting in a decrease in gross margin of 110 basis points to 40.6% in 2006 from 41.7% in 2005. This decrease was primarily attributable to unfavorable product and geography mix of sales, pricing pressures and inflation, including commodity costs during 2006. Partially offsetting these items were efficiencies gained through increased production volume and successful execution of productivity initiatives. Amortization of intangible assets was $29.2 million in 2006 as compared to $27.8 million in 2005. With the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), cost of sales for 2006 also included stock option expense of $1.3 million. No stock option expense was recorded in 2005. 2005 Compared to 2004. Cost of sales for 2005 was $859.3 million, versus $846.3 million for 2004, an increase of $13.0 million, or 2%. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased to 58.3% in 2005 from 59.2% in 2004, resulting in an increase in gross margin of 90 basis points to 41.7% in 2005 from 40.8% in 2004. The increase in gross margin was largely attributable to higher sales volume enabling better leveraging of fixed costs and increased manufacturing productivity, offset by pricing pressures and inflation, including commodity costs in 2005 and higher contribution of Optoelectronics revenue as a percentage of overall sales. While Optoelectronics does have lower gross margins than Life and Analytical Sciences, it also has lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales. Amortization of intangible assets was $27.8 million in 2005 as compared to $27.6 million in 2004. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2006 Compared to 2005. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2006 were $376.9 million, versus $365.5 million for 2005, an increase of $11.4 million, or 3%. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 40 basis points to 24.4% in 2006 from 24.8% in 2005. This decrease was the result of increased fixed cost leverage and cost controls, offset in part by increased investment in business development activities, stock option expense and an increase in the number of sales employees in emerging markets and higher growth product lines. Amortization of intangible assets was $3.0 million in 2006 as compared to $0.8 million in 2005. With the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), selling, general and administrative expenses for 2006 also included $7.2 million of stock option expense whereas no stock option expense was recorded in 2005. 2005 Compared to 2004. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2005 were $365.5 million, versus $362.3 million for 2004, an increase of $3.2 million, or 1%. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 60 basis points to 24.8% in 2005 from 25.4% in 2004. The decrease as a percentage of sales of 60 basis points in 2005 was primarily due to net productivity improvements and cost reductions in both our Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics segments. Amortization of intangible assets was $0.8 million in 2005. 29 Table of Contents Research and Development Expenses 2006 Compared to 2005. Research and development expenses for 2006 were $99.7 million versus $87.4 million in 2005, an increase of $12.3 million, or 14%. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses increased to 6.4% in 2006 from 5.9% in 2005. Amortization of intangible assets was $1.6 million in 2006 as compared to $0.1 million in 2005. With the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), research and development expenses for 2006 also included $0.7 million of stock option expense whereas no stock option expense was recorded in 2005. We directed research and development efforts during 2006 and 2005 primarily toward genetic screening, biopharmaceutical, and environmental and chemical end markets within our Life and Analytical Sciences segment and medical digital imaging within our Optoelectronics segment in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives. We expect our research and development spending to increase on both an absolute and percentage of sales basis in 2007, and to continue to emphasize these same markets. 2005 Compared to 2004. Research and development expenses for 2005 were $87.4 million versus $82.4 million in 2004, an increase of $5.0 million, or 6%. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses increased to 5.9% in 2005 from 5.8% in 2004. Amortization of intangible assets was $0.1 million in 2005. We directed research and development efforts during 2005 and 2004 primarily toward drug discovery, genetic screening and environmental and chemical analysis tools within our Life and Analytical Sciences segment, and medical digital imaging and Cermax&reg; lighting within our Optoelectronics segment. Restructuring (Reversals) and Integration Charges, Net 2006 Compared to 2005. Restructuring and integration (reversals) and charges, net, for 2006 were ($3.6) million versus $22.1 million for 2005. The following table summarizes our restructuring accrual balances and related activity by restructuring plan during 2006, 2005 and 2004: Balance at12/28/2003 2004Amountspaid Balance at1/02/2005 2005Charges 2005Amountspaid andincurred 2005Changes inEstimates Balance at1/1/2006 2006Charges 2006Amountspaid andincurred 2006Changes inEstimates Balance at12/31/2006 (In thousands) 2001 to 2003 plans $ 7,159 $ (4,481 ) $ 2,678 $ $ (1,944 ) $ 5,430 $ 6,164 $ $ (2,001 ) $ (2,651 ) $ 1,512 Q2 2005 plan 8,251 (5,510 ) (403 ) 2,338 (1,358 ) (577 ) 403 Q4 2005 plan 8,223 (6,077 ) 2,146 (789 ) (1,167 ) 190 Q2 2006 plan 755 (650 ) 105 Restructuring 7,159 (4,481 ) 2,678 16,474 (13,531 ) 5,027 10,648 755 (4,798 ) (4,395 ) 2,210 Integration 874 (507 ) 367 564 (337 ) 594 (73 ) 521 Total Restructuring and Integration $ 8,033 $ (4,988 ) $ 3,045 $ 17,038 $ (13,868 ) $ 5,027 $ 11,242 $ 755 $ (4,871 ) $ (4,395 ) $ 2,731 Q2 2006 Plan: During the second quarter of 2006, we recognized a $0.8 million pre tax restructuring charge in the Life and Analytical Sciences segment, which we refer to as the Q2 2006 Plan. The principal actions in the Q2 2006 Plan were workforce reductions resulting from reorganization activities to shift resources into product lines that were more consistent with our growth strategy. As part of our Q2 2006 Plan, we reduced headcount by 23. All actions related to the Q2 2006 Plan were completed by the end of the second quarter of 2006, and we anticipate that the remaining payments of $0.1 million will be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2007. 30 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the components of the Q2 2006 Plan activity recognized in 2006 by segment: Life and Analytical Sciences Optoelectronics Total (Dollars in thousands) Severance $ 755 $ $ 755 Q4 2005 Plan: During the fourth quarter of 2005, we recognized an $8.2 million pre tax restructuring charge in both Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics, which we refer to as the Q4 2005 Plan. The principal actions in the Q4 2005 Plan were workforce reductions resulting from our resource shift toward product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy, as well the closure of manufacturing and administrative facilities in order to consolidate certain operations in our North American and European territories. During 2006, we recorded a pre tax restructuring reversal, net, of $1.2 million relating to our Q4 2005 Plan due to the completion in June 2006 of the sale of a building previously reserved for in the Q4 2005 Plan, partially offset by higher than expected severance costs. The amount of the proceeds from the sale of the building in excess of the current book value of the building was recorded as a pre tax restructuring reversal within our Optoelectronics segment. As part of the Q4 2005 Plan, we reduced headcount by 44. All actions related to the Q4 2005 Plan have been completed and we anticipate that the remaining payments of $0.2 million will be completed by the end of 2008. The following table summarizes the Q4 2005 Plan pre tax restructuring charges recognized in 2005 by segment: Life and Analytical Sciences Optoelectronics Total (Dollars in thousands) Severance $ 2,029 $ 114 $ 2,143 Abandonment of Excess Facilities 240 5,840 6,080 Total $ 2,269 $ 5,954 $ 8,223 Q2 2005 Plan: During the second quarter of 2005, we recognized an $8.2 million pre tax restructuring charge in Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics, which we refer to as the Q2 2005 Plan. The principal actions in the Q2 2005 Plan were workforce reductions resulting from reorganization activities to shift resources into geographic regions and product lines that were more consistent with our growth strategy. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we recorded a pre tax restructuring reversal of $0.4 million relating to this plan due to lower than expected employee separation costs associated with the Life and Analytical Sciences segment. During 2006, we recorded a pre tax restructuring reversal of $0.6 million relating to this plan due to lower than expected employee separation costs associated with both the Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics segments. As part of the Q2 2005 Plan, we reduced headcount by 228. All actions related to the Q2 2005 Plan have been completed and we anticipate that the remaining payments of $0.4 million will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2008. 31 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the Q2 2005 pre tax restructuring charges recognized in 2005 by segment: Life and Analytical Sciences Optoelectronics Total (Dollars in thousands) Severance $ 5,320 $ 2,791 $ 8,111 Abandonment of Excess Facilities 140 140 Total $ 5,320 $ 2,931 $ 8,251 2001 to 2003 Restructuring and Integration Plans: The principal actions in these restructuring plans were workforce reductions related to the integration of our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses in order to reduce costs and achieve operational efficiencies as well as workforce reductions at one of the Optoelectronics manufacturing facilities to reflect declining demand for several product lines. We have approximately $2.0 million of remaining liabilities associated with 2001 to 2003 restructuring and integration plans, primarily relating to workforce severance benefits associated with the closure of our European manufacturing facility in the Life and Analytical Sciences segment and remaining lease obligations of closed facilities. The remaining terms of these leases vary in length and will be paid through 2014. During 2006, we recorded a pre tax restructuring reversal of $2.7 million relating to the Q4 2002 Plan due to the completion in December 2006 of the sale of a building previously reserved for in the Q4 2002 Plan. The amount of the proceeds from this sale in excess of the current book value of the property was recorded as a pre tax restructuring reversal within our Life and Analytical Sciences segment. Impairment of Assets 2006 Compared to 2005. Impairment of assets was $3.2 million in 2006 and zero in 2005. The 2006 impairment was recorded within the Life and Analytical Sciences segment, which included a $2.8 million loss related to a manufacturing facility, and a $0.4 million loss on impairment of a license agreement. Gains (Losses) on Dispositions 2006 Compared to 2005. Dispositions resulted in a net gain of $1.5 million in 2006 and in 2005. Gain on dispositions in 2006 included a $0.6 million gain from an insurance reimbursement due to fire damage in a certain manufacturing facility and a $0.9 million gain on disposal of fixed assets. Gain on dispositions in 2005 included a $2.0 million gain from an insurance reimbursement due to fire damage in certain manufacturing facilities offset by a $0.5 million loss on disposal of fixed assets due to a facility upgrade. 2005 Compared to 2004. Dispositions resulted in a net gain of $1.5 million in 2005 versus a net loss of $0.4 million in 2004. Loss on dispositions in 2004 included a $0.7 million loss from the sale of a business and was partially offset by a $0.3 million gain from the sale of facilities. 32 Table of Contents Interest and Other Expense, Net Interest and other expense, net consisted of the following: 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Interest income $ (9,390 ) $ (3,321 ) $ (2,401 ) Interest expense 9,157 27,291 36,203 (Gains) losses on sale of investments, net (2,296 ) (5,844 ) 300 Extinguishment of debt 54,886 4,143 Other 5,195 1,279 87 $ 2,666 $ 74,291 $ 38,332 2006 Compared to 2005. Interest and other (income) expense, net for 2006 was $2.7 million versus $74.3 million for 2005, a decrease of $71.6 million or 96%. The decrease in interest and other (income) expense, net in 2006 as compared to 2005, was due primarily to the overall reduction in outstanding debt, lower borrowing costs, an increase in outstanding cash balances and extinguishment of debt from 2005. Interest income increased $6.1 million due to higher cash balances and higher investment rates. In addition, interest expense decreased $18.1 million primarily due to the repurchase of our senior subordinated 8 7/8% notes due 2013, which we repurchased through a tender offer in the fourth quarter of 2005, and the repayment of the remainder of our term loan. The decrease in interest expense resulting from the debt reduction in 2005 was partially offset by $151.5 million in debt outstanding as of December 31, 2006 under our new senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which we also entered into during the fourth quarter of 2005. We also recognized a net gain on dispositions of investments of $2.3 million associated with the dissolution of certain investments. We incurred a nonrecurring charge of $54.9 million in 2005 to repay our senior subordinated 8 7/8% notes due 2013. Other expenses in 2006 and 2005 consisted primarily of expense related to foreign currency translation. A more complete discussion of our liquidity is set forth below under the heading, Liquidity and Capital Resources. 2005 Compared to 2004. Interest and other expense, net for 2005 was $74.3 million versus $38.3 million for 2004, an increase of $36.0 million or 94%. The increase in interest and other expense, net in 2005 as compared to 2004, was due primarily to the fees associated with the extinguishment of approximately $300 million of our senior subordinated 8 7/8% notes due 2013, which included premium fees of $36.3 million, an $8.9 million accelerated amortization of term loan and senior subordinated 8 7/8% notes due 2013 issuance fees, and $8.5 million in charges associated with terminating interest rate swaps. The increase was partially offset by a corresponding decrease in interest expense on our senior subordinated 8 7/8% notes due 2013 that were purchased pursuant to our tender offer in the fourth quarter of 2005, as well as a lower average outstanding term loan balance (which was approximately $120 million). In addition, we recognized a gain on sale of investments of $5.8 million associated with the liquidation of an investment. Provision/Benefit for Income Taxes 2006 Compared to 2005. The 2006 provision for income taxes from continuing operations was $32.4 million, versus a provision of $0.1 million in 2005. The 2006 effective tax rate from continuing operations was 21.5% as compared to the 2005 effective tax rate of 0.2%. The lower effective tax rate in 2005 was primarily due to (i) a benefit from the settlement of income tax audits for prior years in 2005 offset by the tax cost of the domestic reinvestment plan repatriation calculated in accordance with the homeland investment provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004; and (ii) the use in 2005 of federal, state, and foreign tax attributes (current year state and foreign net operating losses, federal current year research and experimental credits, and state current year income tax credits) enabled by the sale of our Fluid Sciences segment. Our effective tax rate, excluding one time discrete items, for 2006 was 23.7% compared to 23.5% for 2005. The slight difference in the rates was due to differences in the geographical distribution of income in 2006 versus 2005. 33 Table of Contents In December 2006, the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (the Tax Act) was enacted. The Tax Act retroactively restored the expired research and experimental tax credit provisions of the law from January 1, 2006, and extended the credit through December 31, 2007. As a result of the Tax Act, we recorded a benefit for the research and experimental tax credit in 2006 in the amount of $1.6 million. 2005 Compared to 2004. The 2005 provision for income taxes from continuing operations was $0.1 million, versus a provision of $23.5 million in 2004. The 2005 effective tax rate from continuing operations was 0.2% as compared to the 2004 effective tax rate of 23.6%. The reduction in the effective tax rate between the years was due to (i) an incremental $17.0 million benefit associated with the conclusion of audits with the Internal Revenue Service and Revenue Canada with respect to the years 1999 through 2002; and (ii) the use in 2005 of federal, state, and foreign tax attributes (current year state and foreign net operating losses, federal current year research and experimental credits, and state current year income tax credits) enabled by the sale of our Fluid Sciences segment. These benefits were partially offset by an incremental accrual of $6.8 million for the tax cost of the domestic reinvestment plan repatriation calculated in accordance with the homeland investment provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Discontinued Operations As part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities, we have discontinued certain businesses and accounted for them as discontinued operations in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. Accordingly, the results of operations and related cash flows have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of these businesses have been presented separately and are reflected within the assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006. We recorded the following gains and losses, which we report as the gain (loss) on dispositions of discontinued operations, during the three years ended December 31, 2006: 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Gain on the sale of Semiconductor business $ 3,750 $ $ Gain on the sale of Aerospace business 532 250,638 (Loss) gain on the sale of Fluid Testing business (234 ) 30,281 Loss on the sale of Lithography business (1,720 ) (3,307 ) Gain on contract settlements associated with the Technical Services business 1,227 900 1,487 Loss on the sale of Fiber Optics Test Equipment business (36 ) (5,184 ) Net (loss) gain on dispositions of other discontinued operations (197 ) 497 (2,303 ) Net (loss) gain on disposition of discontinued operations before income taxes 3,322 273,825 (816 ) Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 889 87,463 (321 ) Gain (loss) on disposition of discontinued operations, net of income taxes $ 2,433 $ 186,362 $ (495 ) In September 2005, our Board of Directors approved a plan to divest our Fluid Sciences segment. The Fluid Sciences segment consisted of three businesses Aerospace, Fluid Testing and Semiconductor. In November 2005, we sold the Fluid Testing division for approximately $34.5 million, resulting in a net pre tax gain of $30.3 million. In December 2005, we sold the Aerospace division for approximately $333.0 million, resulting in a net pre tax gain of $250.6 million. These gains were recognized during fiscal 2005 as gains on the dispositions of discontinued operations. We received total cash proceeds in these transactions of approximately $360.0 million. During 2006, we finalized the net working capital adjustments associated with the sales of these businesses, settled a claim related to an employee benefit program, and ceased future benefit accruals to a postretirement medical plan. In 2006, these actions resulted in the recognition of a gain of $0.5 million and a loss of $0.2 million relative to the Aerospace business and the Fluid Testing business, respectively. In February 2006, we sold 34 Table of Contents substantially all of the assets of our Semiconductor business for approximately $26.5 million, subject to a net working capital adjustment, plus potential additional contingent consideration. We recognized a pre tax gain of $3.8 million, exclusive of additional contingent consideration in 2006. In December 2005, our Board of Directors approved a plan to sell our Lithography business. In June 2005, our Board of Directors approved a plan to shut down our Fiber Optics Test Equipment business. The results of these businesses were previously reported as part of the Optoelectronics segment. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we substantially completed the remediation of an environmental matter within the Lithography business, resulting in recognition of a pre tax loss of $1.7 million. The completion of the shutdown of the Fiber Optics Test Equipment business resulted in a pre tax loss of $5.2 million related to lease and severance costs and the reduction of fixed assets and inventory to net realizable value. We recognized the net loss during fiscal 2005. In September 2004, our Board of Directors approved a plan to shut down our Computer To Plate business. In June 2004, our Board of Directors approved a plan to shut down our Electroformed Products business and sell our Ultraviolet Lighting business. The results of these businesses were previously reported as part of the Optoelectronics reporting segment. The abandonment of the Computer To Plate business resulted in a $1.0 million write down of certain fixed assets and inventory for the year ended January 2, 2005. The net assets of the Electroformed Products business were written off resulting in a $1.6 million pre tax loss in 2004. The fixed assets and inventory of the Ultraviolet Lighting business were sold in July 2004 for their approximate book value. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, we settled various claims under certain long term contracts and transition services with our Technical Services business, which we sold in August 1999. The net settlement and the reversal of certain previously established contingencies resulted in pre tax gains of $1.2 million in 2006, $0.9 million in 2005 and $1.5 million in 2004. Summary operating results of the discontinued operations for the periods prior to disposition were as follows: 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Sales $ 8,705 $ 223,997 $ 261,535 Costs and expenses 9,706 200,156 225,045 Operating (loss) income from discontinued operations (1,001 ) 23,841 36,490 Other expenses, net 397 1,314 1,778 (Loss) income from discontinued operations before income taxes (1,398 ) 22,527 34,712 (Benefit from) provision for income taxes (224 ) 7,313 14,053 (Loss) income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes $ (1,174 ) $ 15,214 $ 20,659 Acquisitions Acquisition of Agilix Corporation. In February 2006, we acquired specified assets of Agilix Corporation (Agilix) for approximately $8.7 million in cash plus potential additional contingent consideration, which we expect to be immaterial to us. Assets acquired primarily relate to Agilixs core technology which centers around labeling technology using isobaric mass tags that allow for the simultaneous quantification of molecules, such as proteins, from multiple samples. Acquisition of Spectral Genomics, Inc. In April 2006, we acquired specified assets and assumed specified liabilities of Spectral Genomics, Inc. (Spectral), a leader in molecular karyotyping technology used to evaluate chromosomal abnormalities. Consideration for the transaction was approximately $12.1 million in cash plus 35 Table of Contents potential additional contingent consideration, which we expect to be immaterial to us. We will make a $1.9 million payment in the first quarter of 2007, as well as royalty payments based on future sales, to license additional intellectual property rights from a third party. Acquisition of Clinical & Analytical Service Solutions Ltd. In June 2006, we acquired the stock of Clinical & Analytical Service Solutions Ltd. (C&A), a scientific equipment asset and managed maintenance company serving the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and healthcare markets. Consideration for the transaction was approximately $12.4 million in cash, net of cash acquired, plus potential additional contingent consideration, which we expect to be immaterial to us. Acquisition of J.N. Macri Technologies LLC and NTD Laboratories, Inc. In July 2006, we acquired specified assets and assumed specified liabilities of J.N. Macri Technologies LLC (Macri) and acquired the stock of NTD Laboratories, Inc. (NTD). Macri holds and licenses global patents related to free beta Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (free Beta hCG). Free Beta hCG is a peptide hormone produced in the early stage of pregnancy that is widely recognized as an important biomarker for first trimester prenatal risk assessment. NTD is a laboratory specializing in prenatal risk assessment and offers laboratory developed and validated testing under the brand name UltraScreen&reg;, of which free Beta hCG is an important component. Aggregate consideration for these transactions was $55.2 million in cash, net of cash acquired. Acquisition of Avalon Instruments Limited. In September 2006, we acquired the stock of Avalon Instruments Limited (Avalon). The acquisition of Avalon expands and complements our molecular spectroscopy product portfolio by adding a family of innovative bench top dispersive Raman spectrometers. Raman spectroscopy identifies and characterizes the composition of both organic and inorganic materials in a wide range of applications. Consideration for this transaction was $5.4 million in cash, net of cash acquired, plus potential additional contingent consideration, which we expect to be immaterial to us. Acquisition of Triton Technology Ltd. In December 2006, we acquired specified assets of Triton Technology Ltd (Triton). We acquired from Triton a line of Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) products. The DMA products offer a thermal analysis tool that is used by scientists in the polymers, pharmaceuticals and food industries for diverse applications ranging from simple quality control to advanced research. Consideration for this transaction was $2.3 million in cash at the closing, plus additional cash payments of $1.6 million in 2007. Acquisition of Evotec Technologies GmbH. In January 2007, we acquired the stock of Evotec Technologies GmbH (Evotec). The acquisition is intended to allow us to provide our customers in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and academic arenas with Evotecs high content screening (HCS) instruments and software. These analysis tools determine the composition of cells and cell structure, a critical step in moving potential drug targets quickly through the discovery process. Consideration for this transaction was approximately $33.0 million in cash, subject to a net working capital adjustment. Acquisition of Euroscreen Products S.A. In January 2007, we acquired the stock of Euroscreen Products S.A. (Euroscreen), a developer of the AequoScreen cellular assay platform. The AequoScreen platform from Euroscreen is based on an innovative luminescence technology that generates higher quality data, while reducing the number of false positives in G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) screening applications. Consideration for this transaction was approximately $18.1 million in cash. The operations for each of these acquisitions completed in 2006 are reported within the results of our Life and Analytical Sciences segment from the acquisition date. The operations subsequent to the acquisitions, individually and in the aggregate, did not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. These acquisitions were accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and we have accordingly allocated the purchase prices of the acquisitions based upon the preliminary fair values of the 36 Table of Contents assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The purchase prices and related allocations have not been finalized and may be revised as a result of adjustments made to the purchase prices, additional information regarding liabilities assumed, including contingent liabilities, and revisions of preliminary estimates of fair values made at the dates of purchase. In connection with the fair valuing of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we, assisted by valuation consultants, performed assessments of intangible assets using customary valuation procedures and techniques. Contingencies, Including Tax Matters We are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party (PRP) for certain waste disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. We have accrued $3.5 million as of December 31, 2006, representing our managements estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters. This amount is not discounted and does not reflect any recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. These cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where we have been named a PRP, our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. We expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded. In papers dated October 23, 2002, Enzo Biochem, Inc. and Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. (collectively, Enzo) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Civil Action No. 02 8448, against Amersham plc, Amersham BioSciences, PerkinElmer, Inc., PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc., Sigma Aldrich Corporation, Sigma Chemical Company, Inc., Molecular Probes, Inc., and Orchid BioSciences, Inc. The complaint alleges that we have breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with Enzo, infringed Enzos patents, engaged in unfair competition and fraud, and committed torts against Enzo by, among other things, engaging in commercial development and exploitation of Enzos patented products and technology, separately and together with the other defendants. Enzo seeks injunctive and monetary relief. In 2003, the court severed the lawsuit and ordered Enzo to serve individual complaints against the five defendants. We subsequently filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that Enzos patents are invalid. In July 2006, the court issued a decision regarding the construction of the claims in Enzos patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain of those claims and, we believe, excludes certain of our products from the coverage of Enzos patents. Discovery is ongoing. No trial date has been set, but summary judgment motions were filed by the defendants in January 2007. On October 17, 2003, Amersham Biosciences Corp. filed a complaint, which was subsequently amended, in the United States District Court for New Jersey, Civil Action No. 03 4901, against our subsidiary, alleging that our ViewLux and certain of its Image FlashPlate products infringe three of Amershams patents related to high throughput screening (the NJ case). On August 18, 2004, Amersham plc filed a complaint against two of our United Kingdom based subsidiaries in the Patent Court of the English High Court of Justice, Case No. 04C02688, alleging that our same products infringe one corresponding Amersham patent in the United Kingdom, which was granted in August 2004 (the UK case). Amersham seeks injunctive and monetary relief in both cases. We filed answers and counterclaims in both cases. On October 29, 2003, we filed a complaint, which was subsequently amended, against Amersham in the United States District Court for Massachusetts, Civil 37 Table of Contents Action No. 03 12098, alleging that Amershams IN Cell Analyzer, and LEADseeker Multimodality Imaging system and certain Cyclic AMP and IP3 assays infringe two of our patents related to high throughput screening (the MA case). We seek injunctive and monetary relief. Amersham subsequently filed an answer and counterclaims. After a trial in the UK case in December 2005, the court ruled in February 2006 that Amershams patent in question was invalid in the United Kingdom and awarded costs to us. Amersham initiated an appeal of the ruling in the UK case but withdrew that appeal in January 2007. In May 2006, the court in the NJ case issued a decision regarding the construction of the claims in Amershams patents that adopted many of Amershams claim construction positions. Our motion asking the court to reconsider that decision was denied. Discovery has not yet been completed in either the NJ or MA case, nor has a trial date been set in either case. A voluntary mediation occurred in September 2006, but did not result in a resolution of these matters. Fact discovery, which was stayed pending the mediation, has now resumed. At the suggestion of the court in the NJ case, additional mediation is being scheduled. We believe we have meritorious defenses to these lawsuits and other proceedings, and we are contesting the actions vigorously in all of the above matters. We are currently unable, however, to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, if any, that may result from the resolution of these matters or to determine whether resolution of any of these matters will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. During 2005, the Internal Revenue Service concluded its audit of federal income taxes for the years 1999 through 2002. We have agreed to the conclusions of the Internal Revenue Service in all matters with the exception of one, and have filed a single issue protest with the Appeals Division of the Internal Revenue Service. We expect to resolve the matter in the first half of 2007. Regardless of the outcome of the protest, we do not expect the final resolution to significantly impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are under regular examination by tax authorities in the United States and other countries (such as Germany and the United Kingdom) in which we have significant business operations. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from these and subsequent years examinations. We have established income tax reserves which we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted as additional information becomes available and when an event occurs requiring a change to the reserves. The resolution of tax matters is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition. We are also subject to various other claims, legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. Each of these matters is subject to uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us. We have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable. In the opinion of our management, based on our review of the information available at this time, the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at December 31, 2006, should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. Reporting Segment Results of Continuing Operations Life and Analytical Sciences 2006 Compared to 2005. Sales for 2006 were $1,144.6 million, versus $1,081.1 million in 2005, an increase of $63.5 million, or 6%. The effect of acquisitions increased our sales for 2006 by $21.6 million, as compared to 2005. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by approximately $8.3 million in 2006, as compared to 2005. The following analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares selected sales by market and product type for 2006, as compared to 2005, and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions. Our OneSource laboratory service sales increased by $31.8 million, sales to genetic screening customers increased by $24.8 million, and sales to environmental and chemical analysis customers increased by 38 Table of Contents $16.7 million, while sales to biopharmaceutical customers decreased by $9.9 million. Sales by type of product included increases in sales of service of $31.8 million, instruments of $29.8, and consumables and reagents of $1.9 million. Operating profit for 2006 was $115.4 million, versus $110.2 million for 2005, an increase of $5.2 million, or 5%. The increase in operating profit in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily the result of increased sales volume and a decrease in pre tax restructuring charges in 2005 partially offset by a decrease in gross margin and an increase in stock option, amortization, selling, general and administrative, and research and development expenses. Pre tax restructuring charges decreased from a $12.9 million in 2005 to a reversal of $1.7 million in 2006. The decrease in gross margin is due to unfavorable product and geography mix of sales, pricing pressures and inflation, including commodity costs during 2006, partially offset by efficiencies gained through increased production volume and successful execution of productivity initiatives. Fiscal 2006 includes stock option expense of $3.2 million. Amortization of intangible assets was $31.3 million for 2006 and $26.2 million for 2005. 2005 Compared to 2004. Sales for 2005 were $1,081.1 million, versus $1,062.8 million in 2004, an increase of $18.3 million, or 2%. Changes in foreign exchange rates had an immaterial impact on sales and operating profit. Fiscal 2005 had 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in fiscal 2004. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, an average weeks sales represented $22.3 million. The following analysis compares significant sales by market and product type for 2005, as compared to 2004, and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the previously mentioned extra week during 2004. Sales to genetic screening customers increased $17.1 million, OneSource service sales increased by $15.1 million, sales to environmental and chemical analysis customers increased $5.5 million, and sales to biopharmaceutical customers decreased $19.4 million. Sales by type of product included increases in sales of instruments of $9.0 million, service of $15.1 million, offset by decreases in reagent consumables of $5.8 million. Operating profit for 2005 was $110.2 million, versus $103.6 million in 2004, an increase of $6.6 million or 6%. Increases in operating profit resulting from increased sales volume and productivity initiatives were offset by a pre tax restructuring charge of $12.9 million and a $1.7 million increase in research and development spending. Amortization of intangibles was $26.2 million for the year ended January 1, 2006, versus $26.4 million for the year ended January 2, 2005. Optoelectronics 2006 Compared to 2005. Sales for 2006 were $401.8 million, versus $392.7 million for 2005, an increase of $9.1 million, or 2%. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by approximately $1.5 million in 2006, as compared to sales in 2005. The analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares selected sales by product type for 2006, as compared to 2005, and includes the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations and acquisitions. Sales of our digital imaging products increased by $15.1 million while sales within our sensors and specialty lighting product lines decreased $6.1 million due to a decrease in Cermax&reg; video and specific military platforms. Operating profit for 2006 was $70.0 million, versus $58.4 million for 2005, an increase of $11.6 million, or 20%. The increase in operating profit in 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily the result of a $1.9 million pre tax restructuring reversal in 2006 as compared to the $9.2 million pre tax restructuring charge in 2005, offset by a decrease in gross margin. The decrease in gross margin is due to an unfavorable product mix and pricing pressures, inflation, including commodity costs during 2006, and capacity issues within the amorphous silicon business, offset by successful execution of productivity initiatives. Fiscal 2006 includes stock option expense of $1.6 million. Amortization of intangible assets was $2.5 million for 2006 and $2.6 million for 2005. Fiscal 2005 also included a $0.2 million charge for in process research and development related to the acquisition of the capital stock of Elcos AG, or Elcos, a leading European designer and manufacturer of custom light emitting diode, or LED, solutions for biomedical and industrial applications. 39 Table of Contents 2005 Compared to 2004. Sales for 2005 were $392.7 million, versus $366.3 million for 2004, an increase of $26.4 million, or 7%. Acquisitions increased 2005 sales by $12.1 million over 2004 sales. Changes in foreign exchange rates had an immaterial impact on sales and operating profit. Fiscal 2005 had 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in fiscal 2004. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, an average weeks sales represented $7.1 million. The following analysis of significant sales by product line for 2005, as compared to 2004, includes the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates and the previously mentioned extra week during 2004. Sales of specialty lighting products increased by $10.2 million, sales of digital imaging products increased by $9.4 million due to increased sales of diagnostic and radiotherapy digital x ray products, and sales of sensors increased $6.8 million. Operating profit for 2005 was $58.4 million, versus $59.1 million for 2004, a decrease of $0.7 million, or 1%. The decrease in operating profit was primarily the result of increases in operating profit from increased sales volume, net productivity improvements and cost reduction actions, which were more than offset by pricing reductions and a $9.2 million pre tax restructuring charge. Amortization of intangible assets increased to $2.6 million in 2005 from $1.2 million in 2004 due to the acquisition of Elcos in the beginning of 2005. Liquidity and Capital Resources We require cash to pay our operating expenses, make capital expenditures, service our debt and other long term liabilities and pay dividends on our common stock. Our principal sources of funds are from our operations and the capital markets, particularly the debt markets. In the near term, we anticipate that our operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures, interest payments on our debt and dividends on our common stock. In the long term, we expect to use internally generated funds and external sources to satisfy our debt and other long term liabilities. Principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include: deterioration of sales due to weakness in markets in which we sell our products and services, and changes in our working capital requirements. Principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include: financial covenants contained in the financial instruments controlling our borrowings that limit our total borrowing capacity, increases in interest rates applicable to our outstanding variable rate debt, a ratings downgrade that would limit our ability to borrow under our accounts receivable facility and our overall access to the corporate debt market, volatility in the markets for corporate debt, a decrease in the market price for our common stock, and volatility in the public equity markets. Cash Flows Fiscal Year 2006 Operating Activities. Net cash generated by continuing operations operating activities was $127.0 million in 2006, compared to net cash generated by continuing operations operating activities of $192.9 million in 2005. Principal contributors to the generation of cash from operating activities during 2006 were net income from continuing operations of $118.3 million and depreciation and amortization of $69.2 million. These amounts were offset in part by taxes paid on divestitures of $60.3 million and a net increase in working capital of $9.4 million. Contributing to the net increase in working capital in 2006, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate 40 Table of Contents fluctuations, was an increase in inventory of $11.1 million and a decrease in accounts payable of $1.7 million, offset in part by a decrease in accounts receivable of $3.3 million. Strong performance in accounts receivable collections in the Life and Analytical Sciences segment was partially offset by increased accounts payable disbursements in both the Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics segments. The increase in inventory is primarily the result of expanding the amount of inventory held at service locations within the Life and Analytical Sciences segment. There was no incremental use of our accounts receivable securitization facility during 2006, which totaled $45.0 million at both December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006. Changes in accrued expenses, other assets and liabilities and other items totaled $9.2 million during 2006, and primarily relates to timing of payments for tax, restructuring and salary and benefits. Also included in the $9.2 million above are the net gain from dispositions of property, plant and equipment of $1.5 million and the net gain from settlement of investments of $2.3 million. Investing Activities. Net cash used in continuing operations investing activities was $140.0 million in 2006, compared to $333.3 million of cash provided by continuing operations investing activities in 2005. Included in 2006 was $25.0 million of net proceeds received from the sale of our Semiconductor business unit and $6.6 million of net proceeds from the sale of investments. This was offset by approximately $129.0 million of net cash used for acquisitions. In addition, we incurred $12.1 million of business development transaction costs, earn out payments and other costs in connection with these and previous transactions. Capital expenditures in 2006 were $44.5 million, mainly in the areas of tooling and other capital equipment purchases, in addition to facility improvements. These cash outflows were partially offset by $5.3 million from the advance and settlement of an insurance claim, $4.9 million received from the sale of property, plant and equipment, and $3.8 million from the settlement of life insurance policies. Financing Activities. Net cash used in continuing operations financing activities was $313.5 million in 2006, compared to $217.6 million in 2005, an increase of $95.9 million, or 44%. In 2006, we repurchased in the open market 8.9 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of $190.1 million, including commissions. Debt reductions during 2006 totaled $110.7 million, compared to reductions in 2005 of $374.7 million. These uses of cash were offset by proceeds from common stock option exercises of $21.5 million and the related tax benefit of $2.2 million. In addition, we paid $35.5 million in dividends during 2006. Fiscal Year 2005 Operating Activities. Net cash generated by continuing operations operating activities was $192.9 million in 2005. Contributing to the generation of cash from operating activities during 2005 were depreciation and amortization of $67.0 million, net income from continuing operations of $66.5 million, amortization of deferred debt issuance costs, accretion of discounts and extinguishment of debt of $57.4 million, , non cash restructuring expense of $22.1 million, a decrease in working capital accounts of $12.5 million and stock based compensation of $9.8 million, offset by $27.8 million from the resolution of prior year tax contingencies and $14.6 million from accrued expenses and other. Contributing to the decrease in working capital accounts in 2005, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, was an increase in accounts payable of $23.2 million, offset by increases in accounts receivable of $10.4 million and inventory of $0.3 million. There was no incremental use of our accounts receivable securitization facility during 2005. The outstanding amount under this facility totaled $45.0 million at both January 1, 2006 and January 2, 2005. Investing Activities. Investing activities related to continuing operations contributed $333.3 million in 2005. In 2005, we received $366.6 million from the disposition of businesses, primarily comprising Fluid Sciences proceeds of $359.1 million. We also received $9.4 million from dispositions of property, plant and equipment and $2.9 million from the advance and settlement of an insurance claim. In 2005, we also made capital expenditures of $28.0 million, mainly for tooling and productivity improvements and for system and facility costs. In addition, we used $17.6 million for acquisitions and investments, primarily for our acquisition of Elcos for $13.2 million and the settlement of earnouts for $1.8 million. 41 Table of Contents Financing Activities. In 2005, we used $217.6 million of net cash in continuing operations financing activities. Debt reductions during 2005 totaled $374.7 million, primarily comprising $300.0 million used to repay our senior subordinated debt, and $70.0 million to repay our term loan. In addition, we paid $36.3 million of premium related to the prepayment of our senior subordinated debt and $8.5 million to settle interest rate swaps on this debt. We also paid $36.3 million in dividends and $24.4 million to purchase our common stock pursuant to a stock repurchase program we implemented in 2005. We borrowed $244.3 million related to the repatriation of funds under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and received $19.4 million from the exercise of employee stock options. Current Borrowing Arrangements Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. On October 31, 2005, we entered into a $350.0 million five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Letters of credit in the aggregate amount of approximately $15.0 million, originally issued under our previous credit agreement, are treated as issued under this agreement. We use the senior unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes which may include working capital, refinancing existing indebtedness, capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions and strategic alliances. The interest rates under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility are based on the Eurocurrency rate at the time of borrowing plus a margin or the base rate from time to time. The base rate is the higher of (1) the corporate base rate announced from time to time by Bank of America, N.A. and (2) the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points. We may allocate all or a portion of our indebtedness under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility to interest based upon the Eurocurrency rate plus a margin or the base rate. The Eurocurrency margin as of December 31, 2006 was 60 basis points; the weighted average Eurocurrency rate was 3.62%. There were approximately $151.5 million of borrowings under the facility as of December 31, 2006 with interest based on the above described Eurocurrency rate. At year end, the borrowings were undertaken by certain foreign subsidiaries of ours and the funds were borrowed in the subsidiaries functional currencies of Euro (EUR), Canadian Dollars (CAD) and Japanese Yen (JPY). The effective rates of the borrowings as of December 31, 2006 were as follows: EUR: 4.27%; CAD: 4.88% and JPY: 1.09%. Our senior unsecured revolving credit facility contains covenants that require us to maintain specific financial ratios, including: A minimum interest coverage ratio, and A maximum total leverage ratio. At all times during 2006, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. Senior Subordinated Notes. In December 2002 we issued ten year senior subordinated notes at a rate of 8 7/8% with a face value of $300.0 million (the Senior Subordinated Notes). In the fourth quarter of 2005, we commenced and substantially completed a tender offer and consent solicitation for any and all of the Senior Subordinated Notes. We repurchased all but $25 thousand of these notes as of November 23, 2005. In connection with the tender offer, we solicited consents to amend the indenture under which the Senior Subordinated Notes were issued and removed most of the restrictive covenants from the indenture. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Receivables Securitization Facility. During 2001, we established a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary to maintain a receivables purchase agreement with a third party financial institution. Under this arrangement, we sold, on a revolving basis, certain of our accounts receivable balances to the consolidated subsidiary which simultaneously sold an undivided percentage ownership interest in designated pools of receivables to a third party financial institution. As collections reduce the balance of sold accounts receivable, new receivables are sold. Our consolidated subsidiary retains the risk of credit loss on the receivables. Accordingly, the full amount 42 Table of Contents of the allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided for on our balance sheet. The amount of receivables sold and outstanding with the third party financial institution may not exceed $65.0 million. Under the terms of this arrangement, our consolidated subsidiary retains collection and administrative responsibilities for the balances. The amount of receivables sold to the consolidated subsidiary was $67.8 million as of December 31, 2006 and $91.0 million as of January 1, 2006. At each of December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006, an undivided interest of $45.0 million in the receivables had been sold to the third party financial institution under this arrangement. The remaining interest in receivables of $22.8 million and $46.0 million that were sold to and held by the consolidated subsidiary were included in accounts receivable in the consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006, respectively. The agreement requires the third party financial institution to be paid interest during the period from the date the receivable is sold to its maturity date. At December 31, 2006, the effective interest rate was LIBOR plus approximately 50 basis points. The servicing fees received constitute adequate compensation for services performed. No servicing asset or liability is therefore recorded. The agreement also includes conditions that require us to maintain a senior unsecured credit rating of BB or above, as defined by Standard & Poors Rating Services, and Ba2 or above, as defined by Moodys Investors Service. At December 31, 2006, we had a senior unsecured credit rating of BBB with a stable outlook from Standard & Poors Rating Services, and of Baa3 with a stable outlook from Moodys Investors Service. In January 2007, our consolidated subsidiary entered into an agreement to extend the term of the accounts receivable securitization facility to January 25, 2008. Dividends Our Board of Directors declared regular quarterly cash dividends of seven cents per share in each quarter of 2006 and 2005, resulting in an annual dividend rate of 28 cents per share. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2006: Operating Leases Sr. UnsecuredRevolvingCredit FacilityMaturing 2010 8.875% Sr.SubordinatedNotes due2013 OtherRevolvingDebtFacilities EmployeeBenefitPlans Total (In thousands) 2007 $ 31,883 $ $ $ 1,373 $ 22,434 $ 55,690 2008 23,240 22,650 45,890 2009 17,964 23,166 41,130 2010 14,000 151,536 23,661 189,197 2011 11,474 24,435 35,909 Thereafter 119,183 25 135,405 254,613 Total $ 217,744 $ 151,536 $ 25 $ 1,373 $ 251,751 $ 622,429 Because the credit facility borrowings carry variable interest rates, the above table does not contemplate interest obligations. Capital Expenditures During 2007, we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately $40.0 million to $45.0 million primarily to introduce new products, to improve our operating processes, to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations, to increase capacity in the amorphous silicon business and to develop information technology. We expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures. 43 Table of Contents Other Potential Liquidity Considerations During 2006, we repurchased in the open market 8.9 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $190.1 million, including commissions. These repurchases were made pursuant to our stock repurchase program announced in November 2005 (the Program). The repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares, with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value. On November 6, 2006, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to 10.0 million additional shares of our common stock under a new stock repurchase program (the New Program). The New Program will expire on October 25, 2010 unless this authorization is terminated earlier by our Board. The New Program may also be suspended or discontinued at any time. From January 1, 2007 through February 23, 2007, we repurchased 2.4 million shares of our common stock in the open market under the New Program at an aggregate cost of $57.0 million, including commissions. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with corporate programs. If we continue to repurchase shares, the repurchase program will be funded using our existing financial resources, including cash and cash equivalents and our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2006, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $191.1 million. During 2005 and 2006, we have received advance payments toward business interruption and building damage from an insurance claim for a chemical fire that occurred within our Life and Analytical Sciences facility in Boston, Massachusetts in early 2005. The incident occurred during non business hours and no employee casualties or injuries were reported. We expect that we will reach final settlement with the insurer in 2007 and believe we have sufficient insurance so that any gain or loss incurred by us in connection with this fire and environmental clean up should not have a material effect on our results of operations. Effects of Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), which requires compensation costs related to stock based transactions, including employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on fair value. SFAS No. 123(R) revises SFAS No. 123, as amended, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS No. 123), and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) on January 2, 2006, and prior to adoption we applied the intrinsic value based method prescribed in APB Opinion No. 25, as permitted by SFAS No. 123, in accounting for employee stock based compensation. We generally did not recognize compensation expense in connection with the grant of stock options because the options granted had an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. In transitioning from APB Opinion No. 25 to SFAS No. 123(R), we have applied the modified prospective method. Accordingly, periods prior to adoption have not been restated and are not directly comparable to periods after adoption. Under the modified prospective method, compensation cost recognized in periods after adoption includes (i) compensation cost for all stock based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 2, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, less estimated forfeitures, and (ii) compensation cost for all stock based payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), less estimated forfeitures. The total pre tax stock based compensation expense for the cost of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance units was $17.5 million in 2006. The total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for stock based compensation was $6.1 million in 2006, respectively. At December 31, 2006, total unrecognized stock based compensation expense, expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.6 fiscal years, amounted to $10.6 million. Total unrecognized stock based compensation expense will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures, if any. 44 Table of Contents Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we presented all excess tax benefits related to stock compensation as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. SFAS No. 123(R) requires the cash flows resulting from these tax benefits to be classified as cash flows from financing activities. In 2006, the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options was $2.2 million, which was classified as cash flows from financing activities, as compared to $5.3 million in 2005, which was classified as cash flows from operating activities. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), unearned compensation was recorded in a contra equity account and established at the date restricted stock was granted, representing the amount of unrecognized restricted stock expense that would be reduced as expense is recognized. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), the recognition of unearned compensation at the date restricted stock is granted is no longer required. Therefore, in the first quarter of 2006, the $6.4 million of unrecognized restricted stock that had been recorded in Unearned compensation in the consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2006 was reclassified to Capital in excess of par value. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be taken into consideration when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements for purposes of determining whether the current years financial statements are materially misstated. We were required to adopt SAB 108 in 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158 which requires companies to recognize a net liability or asset and an offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income to report the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Additionally, SFAS No. 158 requires companies to measure plan assets and obligations at their year end balance sheet date. SFAS No. 158 requires prospective application and was effective for us as of the end of fiscal year 2006. The impact of adopting SFAS No. 158 was a reduction to accumulated other comprehensive income of $32.7 million, a reduction to other assets of $26.6 million, an increase to current liabilities of $7.3 million, an increase to current assets of $0.7 million and a reduction to long term liabilities of $0.4 million, with no impact to our consolidated statements of operations or statements of cash flows. There was also no impact from the adoption of SFAS No. 158 on our compliance with the financial covenants contained in our loan agreement, described in more detail in Note 16 of our consolidated financial statements. Effects of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN No. 48). FIN No. 48 was issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The new interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We are required to adopt FIN No. 48 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007. We are currently evaluating the requirements of FIN No. 48 and have not yet determined the impact on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. Under the standard, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. We will be required to adopt SFAS No. 157 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. We are currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS No. 157 and have not yet determined the impact, if any, of its adoption on our consolidated financial statements. 45 Table of Contents In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 provides entities with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value, with the objective to reduce both the complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently. We will be required to adopt SFAS No. 159 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. We are currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS No. 159 and have not yet determined the impact, if any, of its adoption on our consolidated financial statements. Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, income taxes, restructuring, pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue recognition. We record product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, we recognize product revenue upon delivery, and we delay recognition of installation revenue until the installation is complete. For sales that include customer specified acceptance criteria, we recognize revenue only after the acceptance criteria have been met. We defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period or as we render services and the customer accepts them. When arrangements include multiple elements, we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element, all in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. Because the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than long term customized projects, we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates. Further, we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation. Warranty Costs. We provide for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale. Warranty liabilities are based on estimated future repair costs using historical labor and material incurred in the warranty period. Allowances for doubtful accounts. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by (1) applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible; and (2) specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty. Therefore, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates, we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts. This would reduce our earnings. Inventory valuation. We initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase and or manufacture. We periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost. Generally, reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand or technological obsolescence of the inventory. We regularly review inventory quantities on 46 Table of Contents hand and, when necessary, record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements or historical trailing usage of the product. If our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels, we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory. This would reduce our earnings. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold, resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period. Business Combinations. The allocation of purchase price for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair value for purchase price allocation purposes. In connection with the fair valuing of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we are assisted by valuation consultants, and assessments of intangible assets using customary valuation procedures and techniques are performed. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite lived intangible assets. Value of long lived assets, including intangibles. We carry a variety of long lived assets on our balance sheet including property and equipment, investments, identifiable intangible assets, and goodwill. We periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based, in part, upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows. We undertake this review (1) on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and non amortizing intangible assets and (2) on a periodic basis for other long lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from those assets may be diminished. Any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings. We completed the annual impairment tests of goodwill for 2006 and 2005 and concluded that there were no impairments. While we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable, different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets. In addition, we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our non amortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. If events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of non amortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite, the assets will be tested for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142. These intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization. Employee compensation and benefits. Retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. Retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of sales, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses, in our consolidated statement of operations. We incurred expenses of $10.2 million in 2006, $11.9 million in 2005 and $9.1 million in 2004 for our retirement and postretirement plans. We expect expenses of approximately $12.0 million in 2007 for our retirement and postretirement plans. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made. We are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied, to determine service cost and interest cost, in order to arrive at pension income or expense for the year. As of December 31, 2006, we estimated the expected long term rate of return of assets in our pension portfolios in the United States was 8.5%, and was 7.6% for plans outside the United States. We have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets, as well as our current expectations for long term rates of returns for our pension assets. Our management will continue to assess the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumptions for each plan based on relevant market conditions, and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate. Discount rate assumptions have been, and continue to be, based on the prevailing market long term interest rates at the measurement date. If any of our 47 Table of Contents assumptions were to change, our pension plan expenses would also change. A one quarter percent increase in the discount rate would decrease our net periodic benefit cost by $0.4 million for 2007 in the United States and by $0.1 million for 2007 for all plans outside the United States. A one percent decrease in the estimated return on plan assets would increase our pre tax pension expense by $2.1 million for 2007 in the United States and by $1.0 million for 2007 for all plans outside the United States. We have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature. Under the defined dollar plan feature, our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount, regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree. Our maximum future liability, therefore, cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare. Restructuring activities. Our financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals in accordance with SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. Our pre tax restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of (1) severance benefits to be granted to employees, based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades, (2) costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of sub rental income and (3) asset impairments as discussed above under Value of Long Lived Assets, Including Intangibles. Because these accruals are estimates, they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention. For example, actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance, or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected. In addition, unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates. When such changes in estimates occur, they are reflected in our financial statements on the income statement line entitled restructuring and integration (reversals) charges, net. Gains or losses on dispositions. When we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation, we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition. This estimate is based on a variety of factors, including current interest in the market, alternative markets for the assets, and other relevant factors. If anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation, we record a loss. If anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation, we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated. Accordingly, we may realize amounts different than were first estimated. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized $1.5 million in gains from disposition of fixed assets. We also recorded $2.4 million in gains from the disposition of discontinued operations, which consisted of gains from the final disposition of our Aerospace, Fluid Testing, Telecommunications Components and Technical Services businesses, offset by losses associated with the disposition of our Fiber Optics Test Equipment and Lithography businesses. Any such changes decrease or increase current earnings, and are recorded either against the gains on disposition or discontinued operations line items appearing in our income statement. Income taxes. Our business operations are global in nature, and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries. We report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law. Our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax provisions. Any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change. Such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are operational decisions, transactions, facts and circumstances, and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is not certain. Furthermore, our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world. Where appropriate, we reserve for tax matters when we believe that the likelihood of an incremental liability being incurred is probable in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, 48 Table of Contents and SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts, law, tax rates, tax audit, or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense, our effective tax rate, or our cash flow. Additionally, in accordance with SFAS No. 109 we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, foreign tax credits, other income tax credits and certain pension accruals. Valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable. Improvements or other changes in our operations, domestically and internationally, could increase our ability to utilize these tax attributes in the future. The release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our effective tax rate. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks Financial Instruments Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments, marketable securities and accounts receivable. We believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of December 31, 2006. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and third party receivables and payables. The contracts are primarily in European and Asian currencies, have maturities that do not exceed 12 months, have no cash requirements until maturity, and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Credit risk is insignificant as the foreign exchange instruments are contracted with major banking institutions. Unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and, for hedges designated as cash flow, the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not engage in any designated cash flow hedges. Principal hedged currencies include the British Pound (GBP), Canadian Dollar (CAD), Euro (EUR), Japanese Yen (JPY), and Singapore Dollar (SGD). We held forward foreign exchange contracts with U.S. equivalent notional amounts totaling $174.8 million at December 31, 2006 and $197.6 million as of January 1, 2006. The approximate fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant. The gains and losses realized on foreign currency derivative contracts are not material and the duration of these contracts was generally 30 days for 2006. We do not enter into derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes, nor do we use leveraged financial instruments. 49 Table of Contents Market Risk Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk, including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures. Foreign Exchange Risk. The potential change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us, as approximately 62% of our business is conducted outside of the United States, generally in foreign currencies. Our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures. The intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures, with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures. Moreover, we are able to partially mitigate the impact that fluctuations in currencies have on our net income as a result of our manufacturing facilities located in countries outside the United States, material sourcing and other spending which occur in countries outside the U.S resulting in a natural hedge. Although we attempt to manage our foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities, when the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact business, generally sales and net income will be positively but not proportionately impacted. Foreign Currency Risk Value at Risk Disclosure. We utilize a Value at Risk model to determine the potential earning/fair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments. As discussed above, we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program. Our Value at Risk computation is based on the Monte Carlo simulation, utilizing a 95% confidence interval and a holding period of 30 days. As of December 31, 2006, this computation estimated that there is a 5% chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than $0.1 million. This Value At Risk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program. Specifically, during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal 2006 the Value At Risk was $0.1 million, with an average of approximately $0.1 million. Interest Rate Risk. As described above, our debt portfolio includes variable rate instruments. Fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our short term cash flows, as they relate to interest, and our earnings. Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity. As of December 31, 2006, our debt portfolio consisted of $151.8 million of variable rate debt. In addition, our cash and cash equivalents, for which we receive interest at variable rates, were $191.1 million at December 31, 2006. Our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows: (1) Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges on our variable rate debt, consisting of $151.8 million of revolving debt facilities, to fluctuate. An increase of 10%, or approximately 42 basis points, in current interest rates would cause an additional pre tax charge to our earnings of $0.6 million for fiscal year 2007. (2) Changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt to fluctuate. As described above, an increase of 10%, or approximately 42 basis points, in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by $0.6 million for fiscal year 2007. (3) Changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest received to fluctuate. 50 Table of Contents
