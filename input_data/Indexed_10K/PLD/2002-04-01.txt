Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Risks for a complete discussion of the various risks that could adversely affect us. Item 2. Properties We operate industrial and retail properties nationwide and manage our business both by property type and by market. Industrial properties consist primarily of warehouse distribution facilities suitable for single or multiple customers and are typically comprised of multiple buildings that are leased to customers engaged in various types of businesses. As of December 31, 2001, we operated industrial properties in eight hub and gateway markets in addition to 18 other markets nationwide. As of December 31, 2001, we operated retail properties in Miami, Atlanta, Chicago, the San Francisco Bay Area, Boston, and Baltimore. Retail properties are generally leased to one or more anchor customers, such as grocery and drug stores, and various retail businesses. See Item 14. Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for segment information related to our operations. INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES As of December 31, 2001, we owned 905 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 81.6 million rentable square feet, located in 26 markets nationwide. Our industrial properties accounted for $494.9 million, or 96.8%, of our total annualized base rent as of December 31, 2001. Our industrial properties were 94.5% leased to over 2,900 customers, the largest of which accounted for no more than 1.3% of our annualized base rent from our industrial properties. Property Characteristics. Our industrial properties, which consist primarily of warehouse distribution facilities suitable for single or multiple customers, are typically comprised of multiple buildings. The following table identifies type and characteristics of our industrial buildings: Building Type Description % of Portfolio Warehouse 15,000 75,000 SF, single or multi customer 40.3% Bulk Warehouse Over 75,000 SF, single or multi customer 37.8% Flex Industrial May include assembly or R&D, single or multi customer, higher parking ratios 9.6% Light Industrial Smaller customers, 15,000 SF or less, higher office finish 7.3% Trans Shipment Unique configurations for truck terminals and specialized cross docking 1.8% Air Cargo On tarmac or airport land for transfer of air cargo goods 1.6% Office Single or multi customer, used strictly for office 1.5% Lease Terms. Our industrial properties are typically subject to lease on a triple net basis, in which customers pay their proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance, and operating costs, or are subject to leases on a modified gross basis, in which customers pay expenses over certain threshold levels. Lease terms typically range from three to ten years, with an average of six years, excluding renewal options. The majority of the industrial leases do not include renewal options. 5 Table of Contents Overview of Major Target Markets. Our industrial properties are located near key passenger and air cargo airports, key interstate highways, and sea ports in major metropolitan areas, such as Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas/ Fort Worth, Northern New Jersey, the San Francisco Bay Area, Southern California, Miami, and Seattle. We believe our industrial properties strategic location, transportation network and infrastructure, and large consumer and manufacturing bases support strong demand for industrial space. Within these metropolitan areas, our industrial properties are concentrated in locations with limited new construction opportunities within established, relatively large submarkets, which we believe should provide a higher rate of occupancy and rent growth than properties located elsewhere. These in fill locations are typically near major passenger and air cargo facilities, seaports or convenient to major highways and rail lines, and are proximate to a diverse labor pool. There is typically broad demand for industrial space in these centrally located submarkets due to a diverse mix of industries and types of industrial uses, including warehouse distribution, light assembly and manufacturing. We generally avoid locations at the periphery of metropolitan areas where there are fewer supply constraints. Industrial Market Operating Statistics As of December 31, 2001, we operated in eight hub and gateway markets, in addition to 18 other markets nationwide.

Properties Held Through Joint Ventures, Limited Liability Companies, and Partnerships Consolidated: As of December 31, 2001, we held interests in joint ventures, limited liability companies, and partnerships with third parties, which are consolidated in our consolidated financial statements. Such investments are consolidated because: (1) we own a majority interest; or (2) we exercise significant control over major operating decisions such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, and changes in financing. Under the agreements governing the joint ventures, we and the other party to the joint venture may be required to make additional capital contributions, and subject to certain limitations, the joint ventures may incur additional debt. Such agreements also impose certain restrictions on the transfer of joint venture interests by us or the other party to the joint venture and provide certain rights to us or the other party to the joint venture to sell its interest to the joint venture or to the other joint venture partner on terms specified in the agreement. All of the joint ventures terminate in 2024 or later, but may end earlier if a joint venture ceases to hold any interest in or have any obligations relating to the property held by the joint venture.

Prior to November 26, 1997 (our initial public offering date), AMB Property Corporations predecessor provided real estate investment management services to institutional investors.

(2) The historical 1997 results represent our predecessors historical financial and other data for the period January 1, 1997 through November 25, 1997. The financial and other data of AMB Property Corporation and the properties acquired in our formation transactions have been included from November 26, 1997 to December 31, 1997. (3) Basic and diluted net income per share equals the net income available to common stockholders divided by 84,174,644 and 85,214,066 shares, respectively for 2001; 83,697,170 and 84,155,306 shares, respectively, for 2000; 86,271,862 and 86,347,487 shares, respectively, for 1999; 85,876,383 and 86,235,176 shares, respectively, for 1998; and pro forma net income divided by 85,874,513 and 86,156,556 shares, respectively, for 1997. (4) EBITDA is computed as income before divestiture of properties, net of minority interests and impairment charges, and minority interests plus interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. We believe that in addition to cash flows and net income, EBITDA is a useful financial performance measure for assessing the operating performance of a real estate investment trust because, together with net income and cash flows, EBITDA provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate the ability of a real estate investment trust to incur and service debt and to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures. Includes our pro rata share of EBITDA in an unconsolidated joint venture. EBITDA is not a measurement of operating performance calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should not be considered as a substitute for operating income, net income, cash flows from operations, or other statement of operations or cash flow data prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. EBITDA may not be indicative of our historical operating results nor our potential future results. While EBITDA is frequently used as a measure of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements, it is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other real estate investment trusts. (5) Operating earnings represents income before gains from dispositions of real estate, net of minority interests and impairment reserves on properties held for divestiture and operating properties, less minority interests share of net income and preferred stock dividends. It excludes the preferred unit redemption premium. We believe that in addition to cash flows and net income, operating earnings is a useful financial performance measure for assessing the operating performance of a real estate investment trust because, together with 17 Table of Contents net income and cash flows, operating earnings provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate the ability of a real estate investment trust to incur and service debt and to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures. Operating earnings is not a measurement of operating performance calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should not be considered as a substitute for operating income, net income, cash flows from operations, or other statement of operations or cash flow data prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Operating earnings may not be indicative of our historical operating results nor our potential future results. While operating earnings is frequently used as a measure of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements, it is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other real estate investment trusts. (6) Funds from Operations, or FFO, is defined as income from operations before minority interest, gains or losses from sale of real estate, and extraordinary losses plus real estate depreciation and adjustment to derive our pro rata share of the FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures, less minority interests pro rata share of the FFO of consolidated joint ventures and preferred stock dividends. In accordance with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust White Paper on funds from operations, we include the effects of straight line rents in funds from operations. We believe that funds from operations is an appropriate measure of performance for a real estate investment trust. While funds from operations is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and it should not be considered as an alternative to these indicators in evaluating liquidity or operating performance. Further, funds from operations as disclosed by other real estate investment trusts may not be comparable. (7) Secured debt includes unamortized debt premiums of approximately $6.8 million, $9.9 million, $10.1 million, $15.2 million, and $18.3 million as of December 31, 2001, 2000, 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively. See Notes 2 and 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations You should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements. Statements contained in this discussion that are not historical facts may be forward looking statements. Such statements relate to our future performance and plans, results of operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and operating improvements and costs. You can identify forward looking statements by the use of forward looking terminology such as believes, expects, may, will, should, seeks, approximately, intends, plans, pro forma, estimates, or anticipates or the negative of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases. You can also identify forward looking statements by discussions of strategy, plans, or intentions. Forward looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties and you should not rely upon them as predictions of future events. There is no assurance that the events or circumstances reflected in forward looking statements will occur or be achieved. Forward looking statements are necessarily dependent on assumptions, data, or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise and we may not be able to realize them. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward looking statements: defaults or non renewal of leases by customers; increased interest rates and operating costs; our failure to obtain necessary outside financing; difficulties in identifying properties to acquire and in effecting acquisitions; our failure to successfully integrate acquired properties and operations; our failure to divest of properties that we have contracted to sell or to timely reinvest proceeds from any such divestitures; risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including construction delays, cost overruns, our inability to obtain necessary permits, and public opposition to these activities); our failure to qualify and maintain our status as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; environmental uncertainties; risks related to natural disasters; 18 Table of Contents financial market fluctuations; changes in real estate and zoning laws; increases in real property tax rates; and risks of doing business internationally. Our success also depends upon economic trends generally, including interest rates, income tax laws, governmental regulation, legislation, population changes, and those other risk factors discussed in the section entitled Business Risks in this report. We caution you not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements, which reflect our analysis only and speak as of the date of this report or as of the dates indicated in the statements. GENERAL We commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company in connection with the completion of our initial public offering on November 26, 1997, and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with our initial tax return for the year ended December 31, 1997. AMB Property Corporation and the operating partnership were formed shortly before the consummation of our initial public offering. We generate revenue primarily from rent received from customers at our properties, including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs. In addition, our growth is, in part, dependent on our ability to increase occupancy rates or increase rental rates at our properties and our ability to continue the acquisition and development of additional properties. Our income would be adversely affected if a significant number of customers were unable to pay rent or if we were unable to rent our industrial space on favorable terms. Certain significant expenditures associated with an investment in real estate (such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes, and maintenance costs) generally do not decline when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property. Moreover, as the general partner of the operating partnership, we generally will be liable for all of the operating partnerships unsatisfied obligations other than non recourse obligations, including the operating partnerships obligations as the general partner of the co investment joint ventures. Any such liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. REIT Compliance. We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1997. We currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code and believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify. 19 Table of Contents Qualification as a real estate investment trust requires us to satisfy numerous requirements (some on an annual and others on a quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. For example, in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we must derive at least 95% of our gross income in any year from qualifying sources. In addition, we must pay dividends to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis. These provisions and the applicable treasury regulations are more complicated in our case because we hold our assets through the operating partnership. Legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations, or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a real estate investment trust or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. However, we are not aware of any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect our ability to operate as a real estate investment trust. If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment trust for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost qualification. If we lose our real estate investment trust status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved and we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. In addition, our annual fee on our unsecured credit facility may increase and certain rights that preferred limited partnership unitholders in our affiliates have to exchange their preferred units for shares of our preferred stock may be triggered. Investments in Real Estate. Investments in real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a property by property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable. Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying amount of the property. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future market conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying amount of our long lived assets could occur in the future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to income. We evaluated our properties held for divestiture and operating properties for impairment and reduced their carrying value by $18.6 million and $5.9 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. We believe that there are no additional impairments of the carrying values of our investments in real estate at December 31, 2001. Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. We have non controlling limited partnership interests in three separate unconsolidated joint ventures. We account for the joint ventures using the equity method of accounting. We have a 56.1% interest in a joint venture, which owns an aggregate of 36 industrial buildings totaling approximately 4.0 million square feet. We also have a 50% interest in each of two other operating and development alliance joint ventures. Our net equity investment in these joint ventures is shown as Investment in unconsolidated joint ventures on our consolidated balance sheets. Investments in Other Companies. Investments in other companies were accounted for on a cost basis and realized gains and losses were included in current earnings. For our investments in private companies, we periodically reviewed our investments to determine if the value of such investments had been permanently impaired. During 2001, we recognized a loss on our investments in other companies totaling $20.8 million, including our investment in Webvan Group, Inc. We had previously recognized gains and losses on our investment in Webvan Group, Inc. as a component of other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2001, we had realized a loss on 100% of our investments in other companies. 20 Table of Contents Rental Revenues. We record rental revenue from long term operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our bad debt reserves, then we may have to recognize additional bad debt charges in future periods. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The analysis below includes changes attributable to acquisitions, development activity and divestitures and the changes resulting from properties that we owned during both the current and prior year reporting periods, excluding development properties prior to being stabilized (generally defined as 90% leased or 12 months after we receive a certificate of occupancy for the building). We refer to these properties as the same store properties. For the comparison between the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the same store industrial properties consisted of properties aggregating approximately 60.2 million square feet. The properties acquired in 2000 consisted of 145 buildings, aggregating approximately 10.5 million square feet, and the properties acquired during 2001 consisted of 65 buildings, aggregating 6.8 million square feet. In 2000, property divestitures consisted of one retail center and 25 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 2.5 million square feet, and property divestitures during 2001 consisted of 24 industrial and two retail buildings, aggregating approximately 3.2 million square feet. Our future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition of additional properties and dispositions. Our future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical rates. For the Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 Rental Revenues 2001 2000 $ Change % Change (Dollars in millions) Same store $ 400.2 $ 376.7 $ 23.5 6.2 % 2000 acquisitions 97.1 25.6 71.5 279.3 % 2001 acquisitions 22.8 22.8 Developments 27.0 14.6 12.4 84.9 % Divestitures 10.9 37.1 (26.2 ) (70.6 )% Straight line rents 10.1 10.2 (0.1 ) (1.0 )% Total $ 568.1 $ 464.2 $ 103.9 22.4 % The growth in rental revenues in same store properties resulted primarily from the incremental effect of cash rental rate increases on renewals and rollovers, fixed rent increases on existing leases, and reimbursement of expenses, partially offset by lower average occupancies.

The $9.8 million increase in interest and other income was primarily due to interest income from our mortgage note on the retail center that we sold in 2000 and from interest income resulting from higher average cash balances. 21 Table of Contents Property Operating Expenses and Real Estate Taxes 2001 2000 $ Change % Change (Exclusive of depreciation and amortization) Rental expenses $ 69.0 $ 50.6 $ 18.4 36.4 % Real estate taxes 69.2 57.2 12.0 21.0 % Property operating expenses $ 138.2 $ 107.8 $ 30.4 28.2 % Same store $ 93.2 $ 87.2 $ 6.0 6.9 % 2000 acquisitions 27.9 7.1 20.8 293.0 % 2001 acquisitions 4.4 4.4 Developments 9.6 4.3 5.3 123.3 % Divestitures 3.1 9.2 (6.1 ) (66.3 )% Total $ 138.2 $ 107.8 $ 30.4 28.2 % The increase in same store properties operating expenses primarily relates to increases in common area maintenance expenses of $2.3 million, real estate taxes of $2.5 million, and insurance expense of $0.8 million.

The secured debt issuances were primarily for our co investment joint ventures properties. The increase in depreciation expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased personnel and occupancy costs. In addition, the consolidation of AMB Investment Management, Inc. (predecessor in interest to AMB Capital Partners, LLC) and Headlands Realty Corporation on May 31, 2001, resulted in an increase in general and administrative expenses of $4.9 million. During 2001, we recognized $20.8 million of losses on investments in other companies, related to our investment in Webvan Group, Inc. and other technology related companies. The loss reflects a 100% write down of the book value of the investments. During 2001, we retired $55.2 million of secured debt prior to maturity primarily in connection with property divestitures and early prepayments. We recognized a net extraordinary loss of $0.6 million related to the early retirement of debt, resulting from prepayment penalties, partially offset by the write off of debt premiums.

The increase in depreciation expense was primarily due to lower than normal depreciation expense in 1999 and increases in our investments in real estate. Under the required accounting for assets held for sale, we discontinued depreciation of a substantial portion of our retail portfolio after we committed to dispose of a portion of the portfolio in March 1999. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was due to increased allocations to AMB Investment Management, Inc. (predecessor in interest to AMB Capital Partners, LLC), partially offset by increased personnel costs. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for acquisitions, development, expansion, and renovation of properties will include: (1) cash flow from operations; (2) borrowings under our unsecured credit facility; (3) other forms of secured or unsecured financing; (4) proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the operating partnership (including issuances of limited partnership units in the operating partnership or its subsidiaries); and (5) net proceeds from divestitures of properties. Additionally, we believe that our private capital co investment program will also continue to serve as a source of capital for acquisitions and developments. We believe that our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow 23 Table of Contents from operations and borrowings available under our unsecured credit facility, and our ability to access private and public debt and equity capital, are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. Capital Resources Property Divestitures. In 2001, we divested ourselves of 24 industrial and two retail buildings for an aggregate price of $193.4 million, with a resulting net gain of $24.1 million, net of minority interest partners share. Properties Held for Divestiture. We have decided to divest ourselves of three industrial properties and seven retail centers, which are not in our core markets or which do not meet our strategic objectives. The divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. As of December 31, 2001, the net carrying value of the properties held for divestiture was $157.2 million. Co investment Joint Ventures. We consolidate the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of our five co investment joint ventures. We consolidate these joint ventures for financial reporting purposes because we are the sole managing general partner and, as a result, control all of the major operating decisions. Third party equity interests in the joint ventures are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2001, we owned approximately 26.9 million square feet of our properties through these entities. We may make additional investments through these joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. The inability to obtain new joint venture partners could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. During 2001, we contributed $539.2 million in operating properties, consisting of 111 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 10.8 million square feet, to three of our co investment joint ventures. We recognized a gain of $17.8 million related to these contributions, representing the portion of the contributed properties acquired by the third party co investors. We formed AMB Institutional Alliance Fund II, L.P. to acquire, develop, and redevelop distribution facilities nationwide, in which AMB Institutional Alliance REIT II, Inc. became a partner on June 28, 2001. As of December 31, 2001, the Alliance Fund II had received total equity commitments from third party investors of $195.4 million, which, when combined with anticipated debt financings and our investment, creates a total planned capitalization of $488.6 million. We are the managing general partner of the Alliance Fund II and owned, as of December 31, 2001, approximately 20% of the co investment joint venture. We formed AMB SGP, L.P. with a subsidiary of GIC Real Estate Pte Ltd., the real estate investment subsidiary of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, to own and operate, through a private real estate investment trust, distribution facilities nationwide. On March 23, 2001, AMB SGP, L.P. received an equity contribution from GIC of $75.0 million, which, when combined with anticipated debt financings and our investment, creates a total planned capitalization of $335.0 million. We are the managing general partner of AMB SGP, L.P. and owned, as of December 31, 2001, approximately 50.3% of the co investment joint venture. We formed AMB Partners II, L.P. with the City and County of San Francisco Employees Retirement System to acquire, develop, and redevelop distribution facilities nationwide. On February 14, 2001, Partners II received an equity contribution from CCSFERS of $50.0 million, which, when combined with anticipated debt financings and our investment, creates a total planned capitalization of $250.0 million. We are the managing general partner of Partners II and owned, as of December 31, 2001, approximately 50% of the co investment joint venture. The operating partnership, together with one of our other affiliates, owns, as of December 31, 2001, approximately 21% of the partnership interests in AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P. The Alliance Fund I is a co investment partnership between the operating partnership and AMB Institutional Alliance REIT I, Inc., which includes 15 institutional investors as stockholders, and is engaged in the acquisition, ownership, operation, management, renovation, expansion, and development of industrial buildings in target markets 24 Table of Contents nationwide. As of December 31, 2001, the Alliance Fund I had received equity contributions from third party investors totaling $169.0 million, which, when combined with debt financings and our investment, creates a total capitalization of $378.0 million. The operating partnership, together with one of our other affiliates, owns, as of December 31, 2001, approximately 50% of the partnership interests in AMB/ Erie. L.P. Erie is a co investment partnership between the operating partnership and various entities related to Erie Indemnity Company, and is engaged in the acquisition, ownership, operation, management, renovation, expansion, and development of industrial buildings in target markets nationwide. As of December 31, 2001, Erie had received equity contributions from third party investors totaling $13.7 million, which, when combined with debt financings and our investment, created a total capitalization of $129.0 million. Credit Facilities. In May 2000, the operating partnership entered into a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit agreement. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations under the credit facility. The credit facility matures in May 2003, has a one year extension option, and is subject to a 15 basis point annual facility fee, which is based on our credit rating. The operating partnership has the ability to increase available borrowings to $700.0 million by adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase its commitments. We use our unsecured credit facility principally for acquisitions and for general working capital requirements. Borrowings under our credit facility currently bear interest at LIBOR plus 75 basis points, which is based on our credit rating. Increases in interest rates on this indebtedness could increase our interest expense, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Accordingly, in the future, we may engage in transactions to limit our exposure to rising interest rates. As of December 31, 2001, there was an outstanding balance of $12.0 million on our unsecured credit facility. Monthly debt service payments on our credit facility are interest only. The total amount available under our credit facility fluctuates based upon the borrowing base, as defined in the agreement governing the credit facility. At December 31, 2001, the remaining amount available under our unsecured credit facility was $488.0 million (excluding the additional $200.0 million of potential additional capacity). In July 2001, the Alliance Fund II obtained a $150.0 million credit facility from Bank of America N.A. Borrowings currently bear interest at LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points. As of December 31, 2001, the outstanding balance was $123.5 million and the remaining amount available was $26.5 million. The credit facility is secured by the unfunded capital commitments of the third party investors in the Alliance REIT II and the Alliance Fund II. Equity. In December 2001, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, repurchased all of its outstanding 2,200,000 8.75% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units from three institutional investors. The units were redeemed for an aggregate cost of $115.7 million, including accrued and unpaid dividends totaling $1.3 million and a premium of $4.4 million. The Series C Preferred Units had a par value of $110.0 million. In September 2001, the operating partnership issued and sold 800,000 7.95% Series J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units at a price of $50.00 per unit in a private placement. Distributions are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable quarterly in arrears. The Series J Preferred Units are redeemable by the operating partnership on or after September 21, 2006, subject to certain conditions, for cash at a redemption price equal to $50.00 per unit, plus accumulated and unpaid distributions thereon, if any, to the redemption date. The Series J Preferred Units are exchangeable, at specified times and subject to certain conditions, on a one for one basis, for shares of our Series J Preferred Stock. The operating partnership used the net proceeds of $38.9 million for general corporate purposes, which may include the partial repayment of indebtedness or the acquisition or development of additional properties. In March 2001, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, issued and sold 510,000 8.00% Series I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units at a price of $50.00 per unit in a private placement. Distributions are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable quarterly in arrears at a rate per unit equal to $4.00 per annum. The Series I Preferred Units are redeemable by AMB Property II, L.P. on or after March 21, 2006, subject to certain conditions, for cash at a redemption price equal to $50.00 per unit, 25 Table of Contents plus accumulated and unpaid distributions thereon, if any, to the redemption date. The Series I Preferred Units are exchangeable, at specified times and subject to certain conditions, on a one for one basis, for shares of our Series I Preferred Stock. AMB Property II, L.P. used the net proceeds of $24.9 million to repay advances from the operating partnership and to make a loan to the operating partnership. The operating partnership used the funds to partially repay borrowings under its unsecured credit facility and for general corporate purposes. The loan bears interest at 8.0% per annum and is payable on demand. During 2001, we redeemed 223,092 and 635,798 common limited partnership units of the operating partnership for cash and shares of our common stock, respectively. Our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program in 1999 for the repurchase of up to $100.0 million worth of our common stock. During 2001, we repurchased 1,392,600 shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of $23.62 per share under the program. Under the program to date, we have repurchased 2,836,200 shares our common stock at an average purchase price of $21.22 per share. Our stock repurchase program expired in December 2001. Our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $100.0 million worth of our common stock. The new stock repurchase program expires in December 2003 and no repurchases were made under the new program in 2001. Debt. As of December 31, 2001, the aggregate principal amount of our secured debt was $1.2 billion, excluding unamortized debt premiums of $6.8 million. The secured debt bears interest at rates varying from 4.0% to 10.6% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 7.3%) and final maturity dates ranging from February 2002 to June 2023. All of the secured debt bears interest at fixed rates, except for three loans with an aggregate principal amount of $52.4 million as of December 31, 2001, which bear interest at variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 3.8% at December 31, 2001). In August 2000, the operating partnership commenced a medium term note program for the issuance of up to $400.0 million in principal amount of medium term notes, which will be guaranteed by us. As of December 31, 2001, the operating partnership had issued $380.0 million of medium term notes under this program, leaving $20.0 million available for issuance. However, on January 14, 2002, the operating partnership issued and sold the remaining $20.0 million of the notes under this program to Lehman Brothers, Inc., as principal. We have guaranteed the notes, which mature on January 17, 2007, and bear interest at 5.90% per annum. The operating partnership used the net proceeds of $19.9 million for general corporate purposes, to partially repay indebtedness, and to acquire and develop additional properties. In January 2001, the operating partnership issued and sold $25.0 million of the notes under this program to A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc., as principal. We have guaranteed the notes, which mature on January 30, 2006, and bear interest at 6.90% per annum. The operating partnership used the net proceeds of $24.9 million for general corporate purposes, to partially repay indebtedness, and to acquire and develop additional properties. In March 2001, the operating partnership issued and sold $50.0 million of the notes under this program to First Union Securities, Inc., as principal. We have guaranteed the notes, which mature on March 7, 2011, and bear interest at 7.00% per annum. The operating partnership used the net proceeds of $49.7 million for general corporate purposes, to partially repay indebtedness, and to acquire and develop additional properties. In September 2001, the operating partnership issued and sold $25.0 million of the notes under this program to Lehman Brothers, Inc., as principal. We have guaranteed the notes, which mature on September 6, 2011, and bear interest at 6.75% per annum. The operating partnership used the net proceeds of $24.8 million for general corporate purposes and to acquire and develop additional properties. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to the senior debt securities. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds of other capital transactions, then we expect that our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repay all such maturing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. In addition, if we mortgage one or more of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments, 26 Table of Contents then the property could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income and asset value. A foreclosure on one or more of our properties could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Mortgage Receivables. In September 2000, we sold our retail center located in Los Angeles, California. As of December 31, 2001, we carried a 9.50% mortgage note in the principal amount of $74.0 million on the retail center. The maturity date of the mortgage note, which was originally scheduled to mature on October 1, 2001, has been extended to September 30, 2002. Through a wholly owned subsidiary, we also hold a mortgage loan receivable on AMB Pier One, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture. The note bears interest at 13.0% and matures in May 2026. As of December 31, 2001, the outstanding balance on the note was $13.2 million. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, we presently intend to operate with a debt to total market capitalization ratio of approximately 45% or less. At December 31, 2001, our debt to total market capitalization ratio was 44.7%. Additionally, we currently intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. In spite of these policies, our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our board of directors could alter or eliminate these policies or circumstances could arise that could render us unable to comply with these policies.

We also had $26.5 million of additional available borrowing under our Alliance Fund II credit facility. To fund acquisitions, development activities, and capital expenditures and to provide for general working capital requirements, we intend to use: (1) cash from operations; (2) borrowings under our credit facility; (3) other forms of secured and unsecured financing; (4) proceeds from any future debt or equity offerings by us or the operating partnership (including issuances of limited partnership units in the operating partnership or its subsidiaries); (5) proceeds from divestitures of properties; and (6) private capital. The unavailability of capital would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. 28 Table of Contents Our board of directors declared a regular cash dividend for the quarter ending December 31, 2001, of $0.395 per share of common stock and the operating partnership declared a regular cash distribution for the quarter ending December 31, 2001, of $0.395 per common unit. The dividends and distributions were payable on December 24, 2001, to stockholders and unitholders of record on December 14, 2001. The Series A, B, E, F, G, and J preferred stock and unit dividends and distributions were also payable on January 15, 2002, to stockholders and unitholders of record on January 4, 2002. The Series D, H, and I preferred unit distributions were payable on December 25, 2001, to unitholders of record on December 10, 2001.

Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock.

In addition to recurring capital expenditures, which consist of building improvements and leasing costs incurred to renew or re tenant space, as of December 31, 2001, we are developing 12 projects representing a total estimated investment of $154.4 million upon completion and two development projects available for sale representing a total estimated investment of $50.0 million upon completion. Of this total, $127.3 million had been funded as of December 31, 2001, and an estimated $77.1 million is required to complete current and planned projects. We expect to fund these expenditures with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facility, debt or equity issuances, and net proceeds from property divestitures, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow. We may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms for development projects and we may not complete construction on schedule or within budget, resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs and delays in leasing such properties and generating cash flow. This could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We have no other material capital commitments. Acquisitions. During 2001, we invested $428.3 million in 65 operating industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 6.8 million rentable square feet. We funded these acquisitions and initiated development and renovation projects through private capital contributions, borrowings under our credit facility, cash, debt and equity issuances, and net proceeds from property divestitures. 29 Table of Contents Lease Commitments. We have entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels with periods up to 40 years and a lease on a building in New York City. Future minimum rental payments required under non cancelable operating leases in effect as of December 31, 2001, were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2002 $ 6,823 2003 7,720 2004 7,921 2005 8,159 2006 8,480 Thereafter 146,335 $ 185,438 These operating lease payments are being amortized ratably over the terms of the related leases. Captive Insurance Company. We have responded to recent trends towards increasing costs and decreasing coverage availability in the insurance markets by obtaining higher deductible property insurance from third party insurers and by forming a wholly owned captive insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd. in December 2001. Arcata will generally provide insurance coverage for losses below the increased deductible under the third party policies. Premiums paid to Arcata have a retrospective component, so that if expenses, including losses, are less than premiums collected, the excess will be returned to the property owners (and, in turn, as appropriate, to the customers) and conversely, if expenses, including losses, are greater than premiums collected, an additional premium, not in excess of the difference, will be charged. Through this structure, we believe that we have been able to obtain insurance for our portfolio with more comprehensive coverage at a projected overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market. Potential Unknown Liabilities. Unknown liabilities may include the following: (1) liabilities for clean up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; (2) claims of customers, vendors, or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to our formation transactions that had not been asserted prior to our formation transactions; (3) accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; (4) tax liabilities; and (5) claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these entities. Funds From Operations We believe that funds from operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, is an appropriate measure of performance for a real estate investment trust. While funds from operations is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and it should not be considered as an alternative to those indicators in evaluating liquidity or operating performance. Further, funds from operations as disclosed by other real estate investment trusts may not be comparable. FFO is defined as income from operations before minority interest, gains or losses from sale of real estate, and extraordinary items plus real estate depreciation and adjustment to derive our pro rata share of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures, less minority interests pro rata share of FFO of consolidated joint ventures and perpetual preferred stock dividends. In accordance with the NAREIT White Paper on funds from operations, we include the effects of straight line rents in funds from operations. Further, we do not adjust FFO to eliminate the effects of non recurring charges. 30 Table of Contents The following table reflects the calculation of funds from operations for the years ended December 31, (dollars in thousands): 2001 2000 1999 Income before minority interests $ 165,672 $ 165,599 $ 159,321 Gains on developments held for sale 13,169 Real estate related depreciation and amortization: Total depreciation and amortization 111,414 90,358 67,035 Furniture, fixtures, and equipment depreciation and ground lease amortization(1) (1,963 ) (1,114 ) (1,002 ) FFO attributable to minority interests(2) (40,144 ) (15,055 ) (8,182 ) Adjustments to derive FFO in unconsolidated joint venture(3): Our share of net income (5,467 ) (5,212 ) (4,701 ) Our share of FFO 8,014 7,188 6,677 Series A preferred stock dividends (8,500 ) (8,500 ) (8,500 ) Preferred unit distributions (28,682 ) (24,613 ) (19,501 ) FFO $ 213,513 $ 208,651 $ 191,147 (1) Ground lease amortization represents the amortization of our investments in ground lease properties, for which we do not have a purchase option. (2) Represents FFO attributable to minority interests in consolidated joint ventures whose interests are not exchangeable into common stock. The minority interests share of net operating income for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, was $65.0 million, $25.0 million, and $12.5 million, respectively. (3) Our share of net operating income for years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, was $10.2 million, $8.3 million, and $8.0 million, respectively. BUSINESS RISKS Our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences to us. These risks include, among others: General Real Estate Risks There Are Factors Outside of Our Control that Affect the Performance and Value of Our Properties Real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk. The yields available from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of income earned and capital appreciation generated by the related properties as well as the expenses incurred in connection with the properties. If our properties do not generate income sufficient to meet operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, then our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders could be adversely affected. Income from, and the value of, our properties may be adversely affected by the general economic climate, local conditions such as oversupply of industrial space, or a reduction in demand for industrial space, the attractiveness of our properties to potential customers, competition from other properties, our ability to provide adequate maintenance and insurance, and an increase in operating costs. Periods of economic slowdown or recession in the United States and in other countries, rising interest rates, or declining demand for real estate, or public perception that any of these events may occur would result in a general decrease in rents or an increased occurrence of defaults under existing leases, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Future terrorist attacks in the United States may result in declining economic activity, which could harm the demand for and the value of our properties. To the extent that our customers are impacted by future attacks, their businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to honor their existing leases. Our properties are currently concentrated predominantly in the industrial real estate sector. Our concentration in a certain property type exposes us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a 31 Table of Contents greater extent than if our portfolio also included other property types. As a result of such concentration, economic downturns in the industrial real estate sector could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. In addition, revenues from properties and real estate values are also affected by factors such as the cost of compliance with regulations, the potential for liability under applicable laws (including changes in tax laws), interest rate levels, and the availability of financing. Our income would be adversely affected if a significant number of customers were unable to pay rent or if we were unable to rent our industrial space on favorable terms. Certain significant expenditures associated with an investment in real estate (such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes, and maintenance costs) generally do not decline when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property. We May Be Unable to Renew Leases or Relet Space as Leases Expire We are subject to the risks that leases may not be renewed, space may not be relet, or the terms of renewal or reletting (including the cost of required renovations) may be less favorable than current lease terms. Leases on a total of 14.9% of our industrial properties (based on annualized base rent) as of December 31, 2001, will expire on or prior to December 31, 2002. In addition, numerous properties compete with our properties in attracting customers to lease space, particularly with respect to retail centers. The number of competitive commercial properties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space in our properties and on the rents that we are able to charge. Our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and our ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected if we are unable to promptly relet or renew the leases for all or a substantial portion of expiring leases, if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting is significantly lower than expected, or if our reserves for these purposes prove inadequate. Real Estate Investments are Illiquid Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions is limited. The limitations in the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations on a real estate investment trust holding property for sale may affect our ability to sell properties without adversely affecting dividends to our stockholders. The relative illiquidity of our holdings and Internal Revenue Code prohibitions and related regulations could impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our investments and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and our ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. A Significant Number of Our Properties Are Located in California Our industrial properties located in California as of December 31, 2001, represented approximately 28.7% of the aggregate square footage of our industrial operating properties as of December 31, 2001, and 35.9% of our annualized base rent. Annualized base rent means the monthly contractual amount under existing leases as of December 31, 2001, multiplied by 12. This amount excludes expense reimbursements and rental abatements. Our revenue from, and the value of, our properties located in California may be affected by a number of factors, including local real estate conditions (such as oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties) and the local economic climate. Business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns, changing demographics, and other factors may adversely impact the local economic climate. A downturn in either the California economy or in California real estate conditions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and our ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Certain of our properties are also subject to possible loss from seismic activity. Some Potential Losses Are not Covered by Insurance We carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage, and rental loss insurance covering all of our properties, with policy specifications and insured limits that we believe are adequate and appropriate under the circumstances given relative risk of loss, the cost of such coverage, and industry practice. There are, however, certain losses that are not generally insured because it is not economically feasible to insure against them, 32 Table of Contents including losses due to acts of terrorism, riots or acts of war. Certain losses such as losses due to floods or seismic activity may be insured subject to certain limitations including large deductibles or co payments and policy limits. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties, then we could lose the capital we invested in the properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the properties and, in the case of debt, which is with recourse to us, we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties. Moreover, as the general partner of the operating partnership, we generally will be liable for all of the operating partnerships unsatisfied obligations other than non recourse obligations, including any obligations incurred by the operating partnership as the general partner of the co investment joint ventures. Any such liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. A number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to earthquake activity, including California where, as of December 31, 2001, 291 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 23.4 million square feet (representing 28.7% of our industrial operating properties based on aggregate square footage and 35.9% based on annualized base rent) are located. We carry replacement cost earthquake insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable. This insurance coverage also applies to the properties managed by AMB Capital Partners, LLC, with a single aggregate policy limit and deductible applicable to those properties and our properties. Through an annual analysis prepared by outside consultants, we evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage in light of current industry practice and determine the appropriate amount of earthquake insurance to carry. We may incur material losses in excess of insurance proceeds and we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance at commercially reasonable rates. We Are Subject to Risks and Liabilities In Connection With Properties Owned Through Joint Ventures, Limited Liability Companies, and Partnerships As of December 31, 2001, we had ownership interests in several joint ventures, limited liability companies, or partnerships with third parties, as well as interests in three unconsolidated entities. As of December 31, 2001, we owned approximately 34.1 million square feet (excluding three unconsolidated joint ventures) of our properties through these entities. We may make additional investments through these ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. Such partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions. Partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture investments may involve risks such as the following: (1) our partners, co members, or joint venturers might become bankrupt (in which event we and any other remaining general partners, members, or joint venturers would generally remain liable for the liabilities of the partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture); (2) our partners, co members, or joint venturers might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals; (3) our partners, co members, or joint venturers may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions, requests, policies, or objectives, including our current policy with respect to maintaining our qualification as a real estate investment trust; and (4) agreements governing joint ventures, limited liability companies, and partnerships often contain restrictions on the transfer of a joint venturers, members, or partners interest or buy sell or other provisions, which may result in a purchase or sale of the interest at a disadvantageous time or on disadvantageous terms. We will, however, generally seek to maintain sufficient control of our partnerships, limited liability companies, and joint ventures to permit us to achieve our business objectives. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in partnerships, limited liability companies, or joint ventures. The occurrence of one or more of the events described above could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We May be Unable to Consummate Acquisitions on Advantageous Terms We intend to continue to acquire primarily industrial properties. Acquisitions of properties entail risks that investments will fail to perform in accordance with expectations. Estimates of the costs of improvements 33 Table of Contents necessary for us to bring an acquired property up to market standards may prove inaccurate. In addition, there are general investment risks associated with any real estate investment. Further, we anticipate significant competition for attractive investment opportunities from other major real estate investors with significant capital including both publicly traded real estate investment trusts and private institutional investment funds. We expect that future acquisitions will be financed through a combination of borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the operating partnership (including issuances of limited partnership units by the operating partnership or its subsidiaries), and proceeds from property divestitures, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow. We may not be able to acquire additional properties. Our inability to finance any future acquisitions on favorable terms or the failure of acquisitions to conform with our expectations or investment criteria, or our failure to timely reinvest the proceeds from property divestitures could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We May be Unable to Complete Renovation and Development on Advantageous Terms The real estate development business, including the renovation and rehabilitation of existing properties, involves significant risks. These risks include the following: (1) we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms for development projects and we may not complete construction on schedule or within budget, resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs and delays in leasing such properties and generating cash flow; (2) we may not be able to obtain, or we may experience delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy, and other required governmental permits and authorizations; (3) new or renovated properties may perform below anticipated levels, producing cash flow below budgeted amounts; (4) substantial renovation as well as new development activities, regardless of whether or not they are ultimately successful, typically require a substantial portion of managements time and attention that could divert managements time from our day to day operations; and (5) activities that we finance through construction loans involve the risk that, upon completion of construction, we may not be able to obtain permanent financing or we may not be able to obtain permanent financing on advantageous terms. These risks could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We May be Unable to Complete Divestitures on Advantageous Terms We have decided to divest ourselves of four retail centers and one industrial property, which are not in our core markets or which do not meet our strategic objectives. The divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. Our ability to dispose of properties on advantageous terms is dependent upon factors beyond our control, including competition from other owners (including other real estate investment trusts) that are attempting to dispose of industrial and retail properties and the availability of financing on attractive terms for potential buyers of our properties. Our inability to dispose of properties on favorable terms or our inability to redeploy the proceeds of property divestitures in accordance with our investment strategy could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Debt Financing We Could Incur More Debt We operate with a policy of incurring debt, either directly or through our subsidiaries, only if upon such incurrence our debt to total market capitalization ratio would be approximately 45% or less. The aggregate amount of indebtedness that we may incur under our policy varies directly with the valuation of our capital stock and the number of shares of capital stock outstanding. Accordingly, we would be able to incur additional indebtedness under our policy as a result of increases in the market price per share of our common stock or other outstanding classes of capital stock, and future issuance of shares of our capital stock. However, our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our board of directors could alter or eliminate this policy. If we change this policy, then we could 34 Table of Contents become more highly leveraged, resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Scheduled Debt Payments Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition We are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risks that cash flow will be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders, that we will be unable to refinance existing indebtedness on our properties (which in all cases will not have been fully amortized at maturity) and that the terms of refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness. As of December 31, 2001, we had total debt outstanding of approximately $2.1 billion. In addition, we guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to the senior debt securities referenced in our financial statements. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds of other capital transactions, then we expect that our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repay all such maturing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. In addition, if we mortgage one or more of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments, then the property could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income and asset value. A foreclosure on one or more of our properties could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Rising Interest Rates Could Adversely Affect Our Cash Flow As of December 31, 2001, we had $123.5 million outstanding under our Alliance Fund II secured credit facility, $12.0 million outstanding under our unsecured credit facility, and we had four secured loans with an aggregate principal amount of $52.4 million, which bear interest at variable rates (with weighted average interest rate of 3.8% as of December 31, 2001). In addition, we may incur other variable rate indebtedness in the future. Increases in interest rates on this indebtedness could increase our interest expense, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Accordingly, in the future, we may engage in transactions to limit our exposure to rising interest rates. We Are Dependent on External Sources of Capital In order to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code, we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain) and we are subject to tax on our income to the extent it is not distributed. Because of this distribution requirement, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs, including capital needs in connection with acquisitions, from cash retained from operations. As a result, to fund capital needs, we rely on third party sources of capital, which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms or at all. Our access to third party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors, including: (1) general market conditions; (2) the markets perception of our growth potential; (3) our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; and (4) the market price of our capital stock. Additional debt financing may substantially increase our debt to total capitalization ratio. We Could Default on Cross Collateralized and Cross Defaulted Debt As of December 31, 2001, we had 22 non recourse secured loans, which are cross collateralized by 48 properties. As of December 31, 2001, we had $551.9 million (not including unamortized debt premium) outstanding on these loans. If we default on any of these loans, then we could be required to repay the 35 Table of Contents aggregate of all indebtedness, together with applicable prepayment charges, to avoid foreclosure on all the cross collateralized properties within the applicable pool. Foreclosure on our properties, or our inability to refinance our loans on favorable terms, could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. In addition, our credit facilities and the senior debt securities of the operating partnership contain certain cross default provisions, which are triggered in the event that our other material indebtedness is in default. These cross default provisions may require us to repay or restructure the credit facilities and the senior debt securities in addition to any mortgage or other debt that is in default, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Contingent or Unknown Liabilities Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition Our predecessors have been in existence for varying lengths of time up to 18 years. At the time of our formation we acquired the assets of these entities subject to all of their potential existing liabilities. There may be current liabilities or future liabilities arising from prior activities that we are not aware of and therefore have not disclosed in this report. We assumed these liabilities as the surviving entity in the various merger and contribution transactions that occurred at the time of our formation. Existing liabilities for indebtedness generally were taken into account in connection with the allocation of the operating partnerships limited partnership units or shares of our common stock in the formation transactions, but no other liabilities were taken into account for these purposes. We do not have recourse against our predecessors or any of their respective stockholders or partners or against any individual account investors with respect to any unknown liabilities. Unknown liabilities might include the following: (1) liabilities for clean up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; (2) claims of customers, vendors, or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to the formation transactions that had not been asserted prior to the formation transactions; (3) accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; (4) tax liabilities; and (5) claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these entities. Certain customers may claim that the formation transactions gave rise to a right to purchase the premises that they occupy. We do not believe any such claims would be material and, to date, no such claims have been filed. See Government Regulations We Could Encounter Costly Environmental Problems below regarding the possibility of undisclosed environmental conditions potentially affecting the value of our properties. Undisclosed material liabilities in connection with the acquisition of properties, entities and interests in properties, or entities could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Our Access to Timely Financial Reporting and to Capital Markets May be Impaired if Arthur Andersen LLP is Unable to Perform Required Audit Related Services On March 14, 2002, our independent public accountant, Arthur Andersen LLP, was indicted on federal obstruction of justice charges arising from the U.S. governments investigation of Enron Corporation. Arthur Andersen LLP has indicated that it intends to contest vigorously the indictment. The Securities and Exchange Commission has said that it will continue accepting financial statements audited by Arthur Andersen LLP, and interim financial statements reviewed by it, so long as Arthur Andersen LLP is able to make certain representations to its clients. Our access to the capital markets and our ability to make timely filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission could be impaired if the Securities and Exchange Commission ceases accepting financial statements audited by Arthur Andersen LLP, if Arthur Andersen LLP becomes unable to make the required representations to us or if for any other reason Arthur Andersen LLP is unable to perform required audit related services for us. However, we believe that our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow from operations and borrowings available under our unsecured credit facility, are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. 36 Table of Contents Conflicts of Interest Some of Our Directors and Executive Officers Are Involved in Other Real Estate Activities and Investments Some of our executive officers own interests in real estate related businesses and investments. These interests include minority ownership of Institutional Housing Partners, L.P., a residential housing finance company, and ownership of Aspire Development, Inc. and Aspire Development, L.P., developers that own property not suitable for ownership by us. Aspire Development, Inc. and Aspire Development, L.P. have agreed not to initiate any new development projects not contemplated at our initial public offering in November 1997. These entities have also agreed that they will not make any further investments in industrial properties other than those currently under development at the time of our initial public offering. The continued involvement in other real estate related activities by some of our executive officers and directors could divert managements attention from our day to day operations. Most of our executive officers have entered into non competition agreements with us pursuant to which they have agreed not to engage in any activities, directly or indirectly, in respect of commercial real estate, and not to make any investment in respect of industrial real estate, other than through ownership of not more than 5% of the outstanding shares of a public company engaged in such activities or through the existing investments referred to in this report. State law may limit our ability to enforce these agreements. Certain of Our Executive Officers and Directors May Have Conflicts of Interest with Us in Connection with Other Properties that They Own or Control As of December 31, 2001, Aspire Development, L.P. owns interests in three retail development projects in the U.S., one of which is a single freestanding Walgreens drugstore and two of which are Walgreens drugstores plus shop buildings, which are less than 10,000 feet. In addition, Messrs. Moghadam and Burke, each a founder and director, own less than 1% interests in two partnerships that own office buildings in various markets; these interests have negligible value. Luis A. Belmonte, an executive officer, owns less than a 10% interest, representing an estimated value of $150,000, in a limited partnership, which owns an office building located in Oakland, California. In addition, several of our executive officers individually own: (1) less than 1% interests in the stocks of certain publicly traded real estate investment trusts; (2) certain interests in and rights to developed and undeveloped real property located outside the United States; and (3) certain other de minimus holdings in equity securities of real estate companies. Thomas W. Tusher, a member of our board of directors, is a limited partner in a partnership in which Messrs. Moghadam and Burke are general partners and which owns a 75% interest in an office building. Mr. Tusher owns a 20% interest in the partnership, valued at approximately $1.7 million. Messrs. Moghadam and Burke each have a 26.7% interest in the partnership, each valued at approximately $2.2 million. We believe that the properties and activities set forth above generally do not directly compete with any of our properties. However, it is possible that a property in which an executive officer or director, or an affiliate of an executive officer or director, has an interest may compete with us in the future if we were to invest in a property similar in type and in close proximity to that property. In addition, the continued involvement by our executive officers and directors in these properties could divert managements attention from our day to day operations. Our policy prohibits us from acquiring any properties from our executive officers or their affiliates without the approval of the disinterested members of our board of directors with respect to that transaction. Our Role as General Partner of the Operating Partnership May Conflict with the Interests of Stockholders As the general partner of the operating partnership, we have fiduciary obligations to the operating partnerships limited partners, the discharge of which may conflict with the interests of our stockholders. In addition, those persons holding limited partnership units will have the right to vote as a class on certain amendments to the partnership agreement of the operating partnership and individually to approve certain 37 Table of Contents amendments that would adversely affect their rights. The limited partners may exercise these voting rights in a manner that conflicts with the interests of our stockholders. In addition, under the terms of the operating partnerships partnership agreement, holders of limited partnership units will have certain approval rights with respect to certain transactions that affect all stockholders but which they may not exercise in a manner that reflects the interests of all stockholders. Our Directors, Executive Officers, and Significant Stockholders Could Act in a Manner that is Not in the Best Interest of All Stockholders As of March 20, 2002, we believe that our two largest stockholders, Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc. (with respect to various client accounts for which Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc. serves as investment advisor) and ABP Investments U.S. (with respect to various client accounts for which ABP Investments U.S. serves as investment advisor) beneficially owned 14.0% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, our executive officers and directors beneficially owned 4.3% of our outstanding common stock as of March 20, 2002, and will have influence on our management and operation and, as stockholders, will have influence on the outcome of any matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. This influence might be exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with the interests of other stockholders. Although there is no understanding or arrangement for these directors, officers, and stockholders and their affiliates to act in concert, these parties would be in a position to exercise significant influence over our affairs if they choose to do so. Government Regulations Many laws and governmental regulations are applicable to our properties and changes in these laws and regulations, or their interpretation by agencies and the courts, occur frequently. Costs of Compliance with Americans with Disabilities Act Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, places of public accommodation must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act might require us to remove structural barriers to handicapped access in certain public areas where such removal is readily achievable. If we fail to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, then we might be required to pay fines to the government or damages to private litigants. The impact of application of the Americans with Disabilities Act to our properties, including the extent and timing of required renovations, is uncertain. If we are required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, then our cash flow and the amounts available for dividends to our stockholders may be adversely affected. We Could Encounter Environmental Problems Federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment impose liability on a current or previous owner or operator of real estate for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at the property. A current or previous owner may be required to investigate and clean up contamination at or migrating from a site. These laws typically impose liability and clean up responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean up costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury, property damage, or other costs, including investigation and clean up costs, resulting from environmental contamination present at or emanating from that site. Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance, and removal of asbestos. These laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, that they adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos, and that they undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or 38 Table of Contents demolition of a building. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failing to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers. Some of our properties may contain asbestos containing building materials. Some of our properties are leased or have been leased, in part, to owners and operators of businesses that use, store, or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. These operations create a potential for the release of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. Some of our properties are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, certain of our properties are on, are adjacent to, or are near other properties upon which others, including former owners or customers of the properties, have engaged or may in the future engage in activities that may release petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. From time to time, we may acquire properties, or interests in properties, with known adverse environmental conditions where we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and the acquisition will yield a superior risk adjusted return. Environmental issues for each property are evaluated and quantified prior to acquisition. The costs of environmental investigation, clean up, and monitoring are underwritten into the cost of the acquisition and appropriate environmental insurance is obtained for the property. In connection with certain divested properties, we have agreed to remain responsible for, and to bear the cost of, remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties. All of our properties were subject to a Phase I or similar environmental assessments by independent environmental consultants at the time of acquisition. Phase I assessments are intended to discover and evaluate information regarding the environmental condition of the surveyed property and surrounding properties and include an historical review, a public records review, an investigation of the surveyed site and surrounding properties, and preparation and issuance of a written report. We may perform additional Phase II testing if recommended by the independent environmental consultant. Phase II testing may include the collection and laboratory analysis of soil and groundwater samples, completion of surveys for asbestos containing building materials, and any other testing that the consultant considers prudent in order to test for the presence of hazardous materials. None of the environmental assessments of our properties has revealed any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. Furthermore, we are not aware of any such material environmental liability. Nonetheless, it is possible that the assessments do not reveal all environmental liabilities and that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware or that known environmental conditions may give rise to liabilities that are materially greater than anticipated. Moreover, the current environmental condition of our properties may be affected by customers, the condition of land, operations in the vicinity of the properties (such as releases from underground storage tanks), or by third parties unrelated to us. If the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations exceed our budgets for these items, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. Our Financial Condition Could be Adversely Affected if We Fail to Comply with Other Regulations Our properties are also subject to various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, then we might incur fines by governmental authorities or be required to pay awards of damages to private litigants. We believe that our properties are currently in substantial compliance with all such regulatory requirements. However, these requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed, which could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us. Any such unanticipated expenditure could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. 39 Table of Contents Federal Income Tax Risks Our Failure to Qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust Would Have Serious Adverse Consequences to Stockholders We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1997. We currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code and believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify. Qualification as a real estate investment trust requires us to satisfy numerous requirements (some on an annual and others on a quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. For example, in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we must derive at least 95% of our gross income in any year from qualifying sources. In addition, we must pay dividends to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis. These provisions and the applicable treasury regulations are more complicated in our case because we hold our assets through the operating partnership. Legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations, or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a real estate investment trust or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. However, we are not aware of any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect our ability to operate as a real estate investment trust. If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment trust for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost qualification. If we lose our real estate investment trust status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved. In addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. We Pay Some Taxes Even if we qualify as a real estate investment trust, we will be required to pay certain state and local taxes on our income and property. In addition, we will be required to pay federal and state income tax on the net taxable income, if any, from the activities conducted through AMB Capital Partners, LLC and Headlands Realty Corporation. AMB Capital Partners, LLC and Headlands Realty Corporation, as taxable REIT subsidiaries, are also subject to tax on their income, reducing their cash available for distribution to us. Certain Property Transfers May Generate Prohibited Transaction Income From time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. Under the Internal Revenue Code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction. We would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on that income. Since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we believe that any transfer or disposal of property by us would not be deemed by the Internal Revenue Service to be a prohibited transaction with any resulting gain allocable to us being subject to a 100% penalty tax. However, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. While we believe that the Internal Revenue Service would not prevail in any such dispute, if the IRS were to successfully argue that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay 40 Table of Contents a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction. In addition, any income from a prohibited transaction may adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes. We Are Dependent On Our Key Personnel We depend on the efforts of our executive officers. While we believe that we could find suitable replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers. We May Be Unable to Manage Our Growth Our business has grown rapidly and continues to grow through property acquisitions and developments. If we fail to effectively manage our growth, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. We May Be Unable to Effectively Manage Our International Growth We may acquire properties in foreign countries. Local markets affect our operations and, therefore, we would be subject to economic fluctuations in foreign locations. Our international operations also would be subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as the revaluation of currencies, revisions in tax treaties or other laws governing the taxation of revenues, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and, in certain parts of the world, political instability. We cannot predict the likelihood that any such developments may occur. Further, we may enter into agreements with non U.S. entities that are governed by the laws of, and are subject to dispute resolution in, the courts of another country or region. We cannot accurately predict whether such a forum would provide us with an effective and efficient means of resolving disputes that may arise. Even if we are able to obtain a satisfactory decision through arbitration or a court proceeding, we could have difficulty enforcing any award or judgment on a timely basis. Our business has grown rapidly and continues to grow through property acquisitions and developments. If we fail to effectively manage our international growth, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. Ownership of Our Stock Limitations in Our Charter and Bylaws Could Prevent a Change in Control Certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay, defer, or prevent a change in control or other transaction that could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for the common stock. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock may be owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code to include certain entities) during the last half of a taxable year after the first taxable year for which a real estate investment trust election is made. Furthermore, our common stock must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a 12 month taxable year (or a proportionate part of a short tax year). In addition, if we, or an owner of 10% or more of our stock, actually or constructively owns 10% or more of one of our customers (or a tenant of any partnership in which we are a partner), then the rent received by us (either directly or through any such partnership) from that tenant will not be qualifying income for purposes of the real estate investment trust gross income tests of the Internal Revenue Code. To facilitate maintenance of our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, we will prohibit the ownership, actually or by virtue of the constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, by any single person of more than 9.8% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock and more than 9.8% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the issued and outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, and we will also prohibit the ownership, actually or constructively, of any shares of our other preferred stock by any single 41 Table of Contents person so that no such person, taking into account all of our stock so owned by such person, may own in excess of 9.8% of our issued and outstanding capital stock. We refer to this limitation as the ownership limit. Shares acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary. Any person who acquires shares in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any dividends on the shares or be entitled to vote the shares or receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the shares in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the shares or the amount realized from the sale. A transfer of shares in violation of the above limits may be void under certain circumstances. The ownership limit may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control and, therefore, could adversely affect our stockholders ability to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for the shares of our common stock in connection with such transaction. Our charter authorizes us to issue additional shares of common and preferred stock and to establish the preferences, rights, and other terms of any series or class of preferred stock that we issue. Although our board of directors has no intention to do so at the present time, it could establish a series or class of preferred stock that could delay, defer, or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. Our charter and bylaws and Maryland law also contain other provisions that may delay, defer, or prevent a transaction, including a change in control, that might involve payment of a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. Those provisions include the following: (1) the provision in the charter that directors may be removed only for cause and only upon a two thirds vote of stockholders, together with bylaw provisions authorizing the board of directors to fill vacant directorships; (2) the provision in the charter requiring a two thirds vote of stockholders for any amendment of the charter; (3) the requirement in the bylaws that the request of the holders of 50% or more of our common stock is necessary for stockholders to call a special meeting; (4) the requirement of Maryland law that stockholders may only take action by written consent with the unanimous approval of all stockholders entitled to vote on the matter in question; and (5) the requirement in the bylaws of advance notice by stockholders for the nomination of directors or proposal of business to be considered at a meeting of stockholders. These provisions may impede various actions by stockholders without approval of our board of directors, which in turn may delay, defer or prevent a transaction involving a change of control. We Could Change Our Investment and Financing Policies without a Vote of Stockholders Subject to our current investment policy to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust (unless a change is approved by our board of directors under certain circumstances), our board of directors will determine our investment and financing policies, our growth strategy and our debt, capitalization, distribution, and operating policies. Although the board of directors has no present intention to revise or amend these strategies and policies, the board of directors may do so at any time without a vote of stockholders. Accordingly, stockholders will have no control over changes in our strategies and policies (other than through the election of directors), and any such changes may not serve the interests of all stockholders and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations, including our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. If We Issue Additional Securities, then the Investment of Existing Stockholders Will Be Diluted We have authority to issue shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities in exchange for property or otherwise. Similarly, we may cause the operating partnership to issue additional limited partnership units in exchange for property or otherwise. Existing stockholders will have no preemptive right to acquire any additional securities issued by us or the operating partnership and any issuance of additional equity securities could result in dilution of an existing stockholders investment. 42 Table of Contents The Large Number of Shares Available for Future Sale Could Adversely Affect the Market Price of Our Common Stock We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of our common stock, or the availability of shares of our common stock for future sale, will have on its market price. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market (or upon exchange of limited partnership units in the operating partnership) or the perception that such sales (or exchanges) might occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. All shares of common stock issuable upon the redemption of limited partnership units in the operating partnership will be deemed to be restricted securities within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act and may not be transferred unless registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from registration is available, including any exemption from registration provided under Rule 144. In general, upon satisfaction of certain conditions, Rule 144 permits the holder to sell certain amounts of restricted securities one year following the date of acquisition of the restricted securities from us and, after two years, permits unlimited sales by persons unaffiliated with us. Commencing generally on the first anniversary of the date of acquisition of common limited partnership units (or such other date agreed to by the operating partnership and the holders of the units), the operating partnership may redeem common limited partnership units at the request of the holders for cash (based on the fair market value of an equivalent number of shares of common stock at the time of redemption) or, at the option of the operating partnership, exchange the common limited partnership units for an equal number of shares of our common stock, subject to certain antidilution adjustments. The operating partnership had issued and outstanding 4,969,027 common limited partnership units as of December 31, 2001. As of December 31, 2001, we had reserved 8,072,818 shares of common stock for issuance under our Stock Option and Incentive Plan (not including shares that we have already issued) and, as of December 31, 2001, we had granted to certain directors, officers, and employees options to purchase 7,437,219 shares of common stock (excluding forfeitures and 330,176 shares that we have issued pursuant to the exercise of options). As of December 31, 2001, we had granted 549,738 restricted shares of common stock, 2,732 of which have been forfeited. In addition, we may issue additional shares of common stock and the operating partnership may issue additional limited partnership units in connection with the acquisition of properties. In connection with the issuance of common limited partnership units to other transferors of properties, and in connection with the issuance of the performance units, we have agreed to file registration statements covering the issuance of shares of common stock upon the exchange of the common limited partnership units. We have also filed a registration statement with respect to the shares of common stock issuable under our Stock Option and Incentive Plan. These registration statements and registration rights generally allow shares of common stock covered thereby, including shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of limited partnership units, including performance units, or the exercise of options or restricted shares of common stock, to be transferred or resold without restriction under the Securities Act. We may also agree to provide registration rights to any other person who may become an owner of the operating partnerships limited partnership units. Future sales of the shares of common stock described above could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The existence of the operating partnerships limited partnership units, options, and shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon exchange of limited partnership units, and the exercise of options and registration rights referred to above, also may adversely affect the terms upon which we are able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities. Various Market Conditions Affect the Price of Our Stock As with other publicly traded equity securities, the market price of our stock will depend upon various market conditions, which may change from time to time. Among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our stock are the following: (1) the extent of investor interest in us; (2) the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate based companies); (3) our financial performance; (4) general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of our stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends; and 43 Table of Contents (5) terrorist activity may adversely affect the markets in which our securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending. Other factors such as governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws could also have a significant impact on the future market price of our stock. Earnings and Cash Dividends, Asset Value, and Market Interest Rates Affect the Price of Our Stock The market value of the equity securities of a real estate investment trust generally is based primarily upon the markets perception of the real estate investment trusts growth potential and its current and potential future earnings and cash dividends. It is based secondarily upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets. For that reason, shares of our stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share. To the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working capital reserves, or other purposes, these retained funds, while increasing the value of our underlying assets, may not correspondingly increase the market price of our stock. Our failure to meet the markets expectations with regard to future earnings and cash dividends likely would adversely affect the market price of our stock. Another factor that may influence the price of our stock will be the distribution yield on the stock (as a percentage of the price of the stock) relative to market interest rates. An increase in market interest rates might lead prospective purchasers of our stock to expect a higher distribution yield, which would adversely affect the market price of the stock. If the market price of our stock declines significantly, then we might breach certain covenants with respect to debt obligations, which might adversely affect our liquidity and ability to make future acquisitions and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. Item 7a. Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevalent market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing, and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes: (1) interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings; and (2) our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2001, we had no interest rate caps or swaps. See Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources Market Capitalization. The table below summarizes the market risks associated with our fixed and variable rated debt outstanding before unamortized debt premiums of $6.8 million as of December 31, 2001: Expected Maturity Date Total 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Thereafter Debt Fixed rate debt(1) $ 73,603 $ 89,319 $ 92,364 $ 350,029 $ 186,452 $ 1,149,166 $ 1,940,933 Average interest rate 8.3 % 7.8 % 8.0 % 7.3 % 7.3 % 7.5 % 7.5 % Variable rate debt(2) $ 23,093 $ 136,053 $ 20,526 $ 594 $ 7,629 $ 187,895 Average interest rate 3.5 % 2.8 % 4.1 % 3.5 % 3.5 % 3.0 % (1) Represents 91.2% of all outstanding debt. (2) Represents 8.9% of all outstanding debt. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased by 10% (or 30 basis points), then the increase in interest expense on the variable rate debt would be $0.6 million annually. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations You should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements. Statements contained in this discussion that are not historical facts may be forward looking statements. Such statements relate to our future performance and plans, results of operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and operating improvements and costs. You can identify forward looking statements by the use of forward looking terminology such as believes, expects, may, will, should, seeks, approximately, intends, plans, pro forma, estimates, or anticipates or the negative of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases. You can also identify forward looking statements by discussions of strategy, plans, or intentions. Forward looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties and you should not rely upon them as predictions of future events. There is no assurance that the events or circumstances reflected in forward looking statements will occur or be achieved. Forward looking statements are necessarily dependent on assumptions, data, or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise and we may not be able to realize them. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward looking statements: defaults or non renewal of leases by customers; increased interest rates and operating costs; our failure to obtain necessary outside financing; difficulties in identifying properties to acquire and in effecting acquisitions; our failure to successfully integrate acquired properties and operations; our failure to divest of properties that we have contracted to sell or to timely reinvest proceeds from any such divestitures; risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including construction delays, cost overruns, our inability to obtain necessary permits, and public opposition to these activities); our failure to qualify and maintain our status as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; environmental uncertainties; risks related to natural disasters; 18 Table of Contents financial market fluctuations; changes in real estate and zoning laws; increases in real property tax rates; and risks of doing business internationally. Our success also depends upon economic trends generally, including interest rates, income tax laws, governmental regulation, legislation, population changes, and those other risk factors discussed in the section entitled Business Risks in this report. We caution you not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements, which reflect our analysis only and speak as of the date of this report or as of the dates indicated in the statements. GENERAL We commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company in connection with the completion of our initial public offering on November 26, 1997, and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with our initial tax return for the year ended December 31, 1997. AMB Property Corporation and the operating partnership were formed shortly before the consummation of our initial public offering. We generate revenue primarily from rent received from customers at our properties, including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs. In addition, our growth is, in part, dependent on our ability to increase occupancy rates or increase rental rates at our properties and our ability to continue the acquisition and development of additional properties. Our income would be adversely affected if a significant number of customers were unable to pay rent or if we were unable to rent our industrial space on favorable terms. Certain significant expenditures associated with an investment in real estate (such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes, and maintenance costs) generally do not decline when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property. Moreover, as the general partner of the operating partnership, we generally will be liable for all of the operating partnerships unsatisfied obligations other than non recourse obligations, including the operating partnerships obligations as the general partner of the co investment joint ventures. Any such liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. REIT Compliance. We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1997. We currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code and believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify. 19 Table of Contents Qualification as a real estate investment trust requires us to satisfy numerous requirements (some on an annual and others on a quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. For example, in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we must derive at least 95% of our gross income in any year from qualifying sources. In addition, we must pay dividends to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis. These provisions and the applicable treasury regulations are more complicated in our case because we hold our assets through the operating partnership. Legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations, or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a real estate investment trust or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. However, we are not aware of any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect our ability to operate as a real estate investment trust. If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment trust for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost qualification. If we lose our real estate investment trust status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved and we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. In addition, our annual fee on our unsecured credit facility may increase and certain rights that preferred limited partnership unitholders in our affiliates have to exchange their preferred units for shares of our preferred stock may be triggered. Investments in Real Estate. Investments in real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a property by property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable. Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying amount of the property. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future market conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying amount of our long lived assets could occur in the future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to income. We evaluated our properties held for divestiture and operating properties for impairment and reduced their carrying value by $18.6 million and $5.9 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. We believe that there are no additional impairments of the carrying values of our investments in real estate at December 31, 2001. Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. We have non controlling limited partnership interests in three separate unconsolidated joint ventures. We account for the joint ventures using the equity method of accounting. We have a 56.1% interest in a joint venture, which owns an aggregate of 36 industrial buildings totaling approximately 4.0 million square feet. We also have a 50% interest in each of two other operating and development alliance joint ventures. Our net equity investment in these joint ventures is shown as Investment in unconsolidated joint ventures on our consolidated balance sheets. Investments in Other Companies. Investments in other companies were accounted for on a cost basis and realized gains and losses were included in current earnings. For our investments in private companies, we periodically reviewed our investments to determine if the value of such investments had been permanently impaired. During 2001, we recognized a loss on our investments in other companies totaling $20.8 million, including our investment in Webvan Group, Inc. We had previously recognized gains and losses on our investment in Webvan Group, Inc. as a component of other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2001, we had realized a loss on 100% of our investments in other companies. 20 Table of Contents Rental Revenues. We record rental revenue from long term operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our bad debt reserves, then we may have to recognize additional bad debt charges in future periods. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The analysis below includes changes attributable to acquisitions, development activity and divestitures and the changes resulting from properties that we owned during both the current and prior year reporting periods, excluding development properties prior to being stabilized (generally defined as 90% leased or 12 months after we receive a certificate of occupancy for the building). We refer to these properties as the same store properties. For the comparison between the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the same store industrial properties consisted of properties aggregating approximately 60.2 million square feet. The properties acquired in 2000 consisted of 145 buildings, aggregating approximately 10.5 million square feet, and the properties acquired during 2001 consisted of 65 buildings, aggregating 6.8 million square feet. In 2000, property divestitures consisted of one retail center and 25 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 2.5 million square feet, and property divestitures during 2001 consisted of 24 industrial and two retail buildings, aggregating approximately 3.2 million square feet. Our future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition of additional properties and dispositions. Our future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical rates.

During 2001, the same store rent increases on industrial renewals and rollovers (cash basis) was 23.5% on 10.0 million square feet leased.

The $9.8 million increase in interest and other income was primarily due to interest income from our mortgage note on the retail center that we sold in 2000 and from interest income resulting from higher average cash balances. 21 Table of Contents Property Operating Expenses and Real Estate Taxes 2001 2000 $ Change % Change (Exclusive of depreciation and amortization) Rental expenses $ 69.0 $ 50.6 $ 18.4 36.4 % Real estate taxes 69.2 57.2 12.0 21.0 % Property operating expenses $ 138.2 $ 107.8 $ 30.4 28.2 % Same store $ 93.2 $ 87.2 $ 6.0 6.9 % 2000 acquisitions 27.9 7.1 20.8 293.0 % 2001 acquisitions 4.4 4.4 Developments 9.6 4.3 5.3 123.3 % Divestitures 3.1 9.2 (6.1 ) (66.3 )% Total $ 138.2 $ 107.8 $ 30.4 28.2 % The increase in same store properties operating expenses primarily relates to increases in common area maintenance expenses of $2.3 million, real estate taxes of $2.5 million, and insurance expense of $0.8 million.

The secured debt issuances were primarily for our co investment joint ventures properties. The increase in depreciation expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased personnel and occupancy costs. In addition, the consolidation of AMB Investment Management, Inc. (predecessor in interest to AMB Capital Partners, LLC) and Headlands Realty Corporation on May 31, 2001, resulted in an increase in general and administrative expenses of $4.9 million. During 2001, we recognized $20.8 million of losses on investments in other companies, related to our investment in Webvan Group, Inc. and other technology related companies. The loss reflects a 100% write down of the book value of the investments. During 2001, we retired $55.2 million of secured debt prior to maturity primarily in connection with property divestitures and early prepayments. We recognized a net extraordinary loss of $0.6 million related to the early retirement of debt, resulting from prepayment penalties, partially offset by the write off of debt premiums. For the Years Ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 Rental Revenues 2000 1999 $ Change % Change (Dollars in millions) Same store $ 314.4 $ 293.3 $ 21.1 7.2 % 1999 acquisitions 85.1 41.0 44.1 107.6 % 2000 acquisitions 28.0 28.0 Developments 7.0 4.2 2.8 66.7 % Divestitures 19.5 90.4 (70.9 ) (78.4 )% Straight line rents 10.2 10.8 (0.6 ) (5.6 )% Total $ 464.2 $ 439.7 $ 24.5 5.6 % 22 Table of Contents The growth in rental revenues in same store properties resulted primarily from the incremental effect of cash rental rate increases, fixed rent increases on existing leases, increases in occupancy and reimbursement of expenses, partially offset by a decrease in straight line rents.

The increase in depreciation expense was primarily due to lower than normal depreciation expense in 1999 and increases in our investments in real estate. Under the required accounting for assets held for sale, we discontinued depreciation of a substantial portion of our retail portfolio after we committed to dispose of a portion of the portfolio in March 1999. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was due to increased allocations to AMB Investment Management, Inc. (predecessor in interest to AMB Capital Partners, LLC), partially offset by increased personnel costs. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for acquisitions, development, expansion, and renovation of properties will include: (1) cash flow from operations; (2) borrowings under our unsecured credit facility; (3) other forms of secured or unsecured financing; (4) proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the operating partnership (including issuances of limited partnership units in the operating partnership or its subsidiaries); and (5) net proceeds from divestitures of properties. Additionally, we believe that our private capital co investment program will also continue to serve as a source of capital for acquisitions and developments. We believe that our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow 23 Table of Contents from operations and borrowings available under our unsecured credit facility, and our ability to access private and public debt and equity capital, are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. Capital Resources Property Divestitures. In 2001, we divested ourselves of 24 industrial and two retail buildings for an aggregate price of $193.4 million, with a resulting net gain of $24.1 million, net of minority interest partners share. Properties Held for Divestiture. We have decided to divest ourselves of three industrial properties and seven retail centers, which are not in our core markets or which do not meet our strategic objectives. The divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. As of December 31, 2001, the net carrying value of the properties held for divestiture was $157.2 million. Co investment Joint Ventures. We consolidate the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of our five co investment joint ventures. We consolidate these joint ventures for financial reporting purposes because we are the sole managing general partner and, as a result, control all of the major operating decisions. Third party equity interests in the joint ventures are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2001, we owned approximately 26.9 million square feet of our properties through these entities. We may make additional investments through these joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. The inability to obtain new joint venture partners could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. During 2001, we contributed $539.2 million in operating properties, consisting of 111 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 10.8 million square feet, to three of our co investment joint ventures. We recognized a gain of $17.8 million related to these contributions, representing the portion of the contributed properties acquired by the third party co investors. We formed AMB Institutional Alliance Fund II, L.P. to acquire, develop, and redevelop distribution facilities nationwide, in which AMB Institutional Alliance REIT II, Inc. became a partner on June 28, 2001. As of December 31, 2001, the Alliance Fund II had received total equity commitments from third party investors of $195.4 million, which, when combined with anticipated debt financings and our investment, creates a total planned capitalization of $488.6 million. We are the managing general partner of the Alliance Fund II and owned, as of December 31, 2001, approximately 20% of the co investment joint venture. We formed AMB SGP, L.P. with a subsidiary of GIC Real Estate Pte Ltd., the real estate investment subsidiary of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, to own and operate, through a private real estate investment trust, distribution facilities nationwide. On March 23, 2001, AMB SGP, L.P. received an equity contribution from GIC of $75.0 million, which, when combined with anticipated debt financings and our investment, creates a total planned capitalization of $335.0 million. We are the managing general partner of AMB SGP, L.P. and owned, as of December 31, 2001, approximately 50.3% of the co investment joint venture. We formed AMB Partners II, L.P. with the City and County of San Francisco Employees Retirement System to acquire, develop, and redevelop distribution facilities nationwide. On February 14, 2001, Partners II received an equity contribution from CCSFERS of $50.0 million, which, when combined with anticipated debt financings and our investment, creates a total planned capitalization of $250.0 million. We are the managing general partner of Partners II and owned, as of December 31, 2001, approximately 50% of the co investment joint venture. The operating partnership, together with one of our other affiliates, owns, as of December 31, 2001, approximately 21% of the partnership interests in AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P. The Alliance Fund I is a co investment partnership between the operating partnership and AMB Institutional Alliance REIT I, Inc., which includes 15 institutional investors as stockholders, and is engaged in the acquisition, ownership, operation, management, renovation, expansion, and development of industrial buildings in target markets 24 Table of Contents nationwide. As of December 31, 2001, the Alliance Fund I had received equity contributions from third party investors totaling $169.0 million, which, when combined with debt financings and our investment, creates a total capitalization of $378.0 million. The operating partnership, together with one of our other affiliates, owns, as of December 31, 2001, approximately 50% of the partnership interests in AMB/ Erie. L.P. Erie is a co investment partnership between the operating partnership and various entities related to Erie Indemnity Company, and is engaged in the acquisition, ownership, operation, management, renovation, expansion, and development of industrial buildings in target markets nationwide. As of December 31, 2001, Erie had received equity contributions from third party investors totaling $13.7 million, which, when combined with debt financings and our investment, created a total capitalization of $129.0 million. Credit Facilities. In May 2000, the operating partnership entered into a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit agreement. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations under the credit facility. The credit facility matures in May 2003, has a one year extension option, and is subject to a 15 basis point annual facility fee, which is based on our credit rating. The operating partnership has the ability to increase available borrowings to $700.0 million by adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase its commitments. We use our unsecured credit facility principally for acquisitions and for general working capital requirements. Borrowings under our credit facility currently bear interest at LIBOR plus 75 basis points, which is based on our credit rating. Increases in interest rates on this indebtedness could increase our interest expense, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Accordingly, in the future, we may engage in transactions to limit our exposure to rising interest rates. As of December 31, 2001, there was an outstanding balance of $12.0 million on our unsecured credit facility. Monthly debt service payments on our credit facility are interest only. The total amount available under our credit facility fluctuates based upon the borrowing base, as defined in the agreement governing the credit facility. At December 31, 2001, the remaining amount available under our unsecured credit facility was $488.0 million (excluding the additional $200.0 million of potential additional capacity). In July 2001, the Alliance Fund II obtained a $150.0 million credit facility from Bank of America N.A. Borrowings currently bear interest at LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points. As of December 31, 2001, the outstanding balance was $123.5 million and the remaining amount available was $26.5 million. The credit facility is secured by the unfunded capital commitments of the third party investors in the Alliance REIT II and the Alliance Fund II. Equity. In December 2001, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, repurchased all of its outstanding 2,200,000 8.75% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units from three institutional investors. The units were redeemed for an aggregate cost of $115.7 million, including accrued and unpaid dividends totaling $1.3 million and a premium of $4.4 million. The Series C Preferred Units had a par value of $110.0 million. In September 2001, the operating partnership issued and sold 800,000 7.95% Series J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units at a price of $50.00 per unit in a private placement. Distributions are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable quarterly in arrears. The Series J Preferred Units are redeemable by the operating partnership on or after September 21, 2006, subject to certain conditions, for cash at a redemption price equal to $50.00 per unit, plus accumulated and unpaid distributions thereon, if any, to the redemption date. The Series J Preferred Units are exchangeable, at specified times and subject to certain conditions, on a one for one basis, for shares of our Series J Preferred Stock. The operating partnership used the net proceeds of $38.9 million for general corporate purposes, which may include the partial repayment of indebtedness or the acquisition or development of additional properties. In March 2001, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, issued and sold 510,000 8.00% Series I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units at a price of $50.00 per unit in a private placement. Distributions are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable quarterly in arrears at a rate per unit equal to $4.00 per annum. The Series I Preferred Units are redeemable by AMB Property II, L.P. on or after March 21, 2006, subject to certain conditions, for cash at a redemption price equal to $50.00 per unit, 25 Table of Contents plus accumulated and unpaid distributions thereon, if any, to the redemption date. The Series I Preferred Units are exchangeable, at specified times and subject to certain conditions, on a one for one basis, for shares of our Series I Preferred Stock. AMB Property II, L.P. used the net proceeds of $24.9 million to repay advances from the operating partnership and to make a loan to the operating partnership. The operating partnership used the funds to partially repay borrowings under its unsecured credit facility and for general corporate purposes. The loan bears interest at 8.0% per annum and is payable on demand. During 2001, we redeemed 223,092 and 635,798 common limited partnership units of the operating partnership for cash and shares of our common stock, respectively. Our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program in 1999 for the repurchase of up to $100.0 million worth of our common stock. During 2001, we repurchased 1,392,600 shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of $23.62 per share under the program. Under the program to date, we have repurchased 2,836,200 shares our common stock at an average purchase price of $21.22 per share. Our stock repurchase program expired in December 2001. Our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $100.0 million worth of our common stock. The new stock repurchase program expires in December 2003 and no repurchases were made under the new program in 2001. Debt. As of December 31, 2001, the aggregate principal amount of our secured debt was $1.2 billion, excluding unamortized debt premiums of $6.8 million. The secured debt bears interest at rates varying from 4.0% to 10.6% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 7.3%) and final maturity dates ranging from February 2002 to June 2023. All of the secured debt bears interest at fixed rates, except for three loans with an aggregate principal amount of $52.4 million as of December 31, 2001, which bear interest at variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 3.8% at December 31, 2001). In August 2000, the operating partnership commenced a medium term note program for the issuance of up to $400.0 million in principal amount of medium term notes, which will be guaranteed by us. As of December 31, 2001, the operating partnership had issued $380.0 million of medium term notes under this program, leaving $20.0 million available for issuance. However, on January 14, 2002, the operating partnership issued and sold the remaining $20.0 million of the notes under this program to Lehman Brothers, Inc., as principal. We have guaranteed the notes, which mature on January 17, 2007, and bear interest at 5.90% per annum. The operating partnership used the net proceeds of $19.9 million for general corporate purposes, to partially repay indebtedness, and to acquire and develop additional properties. In January 2001, the operating partnership issued and sold $25.0 million of the notes under this program to A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc., as principal. We have guaranteed the notes, which mature on January 30, 2006, and bear interest at 6.90% per annum. The operating partnership used the net proceeds of $24.9 million for general corporate purposes, to partially repay indebtedness, and to acquire and develop additional properties. In March 2001, the operating partnership issued and sold $50.0 million of the notes under this program to First Union Securities, Inc., as principal. We have guaranteed the notes, which mature on March 7, 2011, and bear interest at 7.00% per annum. The operating partnership used the net proceeds of $49.7 million for general corporate purposes, to partially repay indebtedness, and to acquire and develop additional properties. In September 2001, the operating partnership issued and sold $25.0 million of the notes under this program to Lehman Brothers, Inc., as principal. We have guaranteed the notes, which mature on September 6, 2011, and bear interest at 6.75% per annum. The operating partnership used the net proceeds of $24.8 million for general corporate purposes and to acquire and develop additional properties. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to the senior debt securities. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds of other capital transactions, then we expect that our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repay all such maturing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. In addition, if we mortgage one or more of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments, 26 Table of Contents then the property could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income and asset value. A foreclosure on one or more of our properties could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Mortgage Receivables. In September 2000, we sold our retail center located in Los Angeles, California. As of December 31, 2001, we carried a 9.50% mortgage note in the principal amount of $74.0 million on the retail center. The maturity date of the mortgage note, which was originally scheduled to mature on October 1, 2001, has been extended to September 30, 2002. Through a wholly owned subsidiary, we also hold a mortgage loan receivable on AMB Pier One, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture. The note bears interest at 13.0% and matures in May 2026. As of December 31, 2001, the outstanding balance on the note was $13.2 million. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, we presently intend to operate with a debt to total market capitalization ratio of approximately 45% or less. At December 31, 2001, our debt to total market capitalization ratio was 44.7%. Additionally, we currently intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. In spite of these policies, our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our board of directors could alter or eliminate these policies or circumstances could arise that could render us unable to comply with these policies.

We also had $26.5 million of additional available borrowing under our Alliance Fund II credit facility. To fund acquisitions, development activities, and capital expenditures and to provide for general working capital requirements, we intend to use: (1) cash from operations; (2) borrowings under our credit facility; (3) other forms of secured and unsecured financing; (4) proceeds from any future debt or equity offerings by us or the operating partnership (including issuances of limited partnership units in the operating partnership or its subsidiaries); (5) proceeds from divestitures of properties; and (6) private capital. The unavailability of capital would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. 28 Table of Contents Our board of directors declared a regular cash dividend for the quarter ending December 31, 2001, of $0.395 per share of common stock and the operating partnership declared a regular cash distribution for the quarter ending December 31, 2001, of $0.395 per common unit. The dividends and distributions were payable on December 24, 2001, to stockholders and unitholders of record on December 14, 2001. The Series A, B, E, F, G, and J preferred stock and unit dividends and distributions were also payable on January 15, 2002, to stockholders and unitholders of record on January 4, 2002. The Series D, H, and I preferred unit distributions were payable on December 25, 2001, to unitholders of record on December 10, 2001. The following table sets forth the dividend payments and distributions for 2001 and 2000: Security Paying Entity 2001 2000 Common stock AMB Property Corporation $ 1.58 $ 1.48 Operating partnership units Operating Partnership $ 1.58 $ 1.48 Series A preferred stock AMB Property Corporation $ 2.13 $ 2.13 Series A preferred units Operating Partnership $ 2.13 $ 2.13 Series B preferred units Operating Partnership $ 4.31 $ 4.31 Series C preferred units AMB Property II, L.P $ 3.88 $ 4.38 Series D preferred units AMB Property II, L.P $ 3.88 $ 3.88 Series E preferred units AMB Property II, L.P $ 3.88 $ 3.88 Series F preferred units AMB Property II, L.P $ 3.98 $ 3.09 Series G preferred units AMB Property II, L.P $ 3.98 $ 1.35 Series H preferred units AMB Property II, L.P $ 4.06 $ 1.30 Series I preferred units AMB Property II, L.P $ 3.04 n/a Series J preferred units Operating Partnership $ 1.24 n/a The anticipated size of our distributions, using only cash from operations, will not allow us to retire all of our debt as it comes due. Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Commitments Developments. In addition to recurring capital expenditures, which consist of building improvements and leasing costs incurred to renew or re tenant space, as of December 31, 2001, we are developing 12 projects representing a total estimated investment of $154.4 million upon completion and two development projects available for sale representing a total estimated investment of $50.0 million upon completion. Of this total, $127.3 million had been funded as of December 31, 2001, and an estimated $77.1 million is required to complete current and planned projects. We expect to fund these expenditures with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facility, debt or equity issuances, and net proceeds from property divestitures, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow. We may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms for development projects and we may not complete construction on schedule or within budget, resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs and delays in leasing such properties and generating cash flow. This could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We have no other material capital commitments. Acquisitions. During 2001, we invested $428.3 million in 65 operating industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 6.8 million rentable square feet. We funded these acquisitions and initiated development and renovation projects through private capital contributions, borrowings under our credit facility, cash, debt and equity issuances, and net proceeds from property divestitures. 29 Table of Contents Lease Commitments. We have entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels with periods up to 40 years and a lease on a building in New York City. Future minimum rental payments required under non cancelable operating leases in effect as of December 31, 2001, were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2002 $ 6,823 2003 7,720 2004 7,921 2005 8,159 2006 8,480 Thereafter 146,335 $ 185,438 These operating lease payments are being amortized ratably over the terms of the related leases. Captive Insurance Company. We have responded to recent trends towards increasing costs and decreasing coverage availability in the insurance markets by obtaining higher deductible property insurance from third party insurers and by forming a wholly owned captive insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd. in December 2001. Arcata will generally provide insurance coverage for losses below the increased deductible under the third party policies. Premiums paid to Arcata have a retrospective component, so that if expenses, including losses, are less than premiums collected, the excess will be returned to the property owners (and, in turn, as appropriate, to the customers) and conversely, if expenses, including losses, are greater than premiums collected, an additional premium, not in excess of the difference, will be charged. Through this structure, we believe that we have been able to obtain insurance for our portfolio with more comprehensive coverage at a projected overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market. Potential Unknown Liabilities. Unknown liabilities may include the following: (1) liabilities for clean up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; (2) claims of customers, vendors, or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to our formation transactions that had not been asserted prior to our formation transactions; (3) accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; (4) tax liabilities; and (5) claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these entities. Funds From Operations We believe that funds from operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, is an appropriate measure of performance for a real estate investment trust. While funds from operations is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and it should not be considered as an alternative to those indicators in evaluating liquidity or operating performance. Further, funds from operations as disclosed by other real estate investment trusts may not be comparable. FFO is defined as income from operations before minority interest, gains or losses from sale of real estate, and extraordinary items plus real estate depreciation and adjustment to derive our pro rata share of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures, less minority interests pro rata share of FFO of consolidated joint ventures and perpetual preferred stock dividends. In accordance with the NAREIT White Paper on funds from operations, we include the effects of straight line rents in funds from operations. Further, we do not adjust FFO to eliminate the effects of non recurring charges. 30 Table of Contents The following table reflects the calculation of funds from operations for the years ended December 31, (dollars in thousands): 2001 2000 1999 Income before minority interests $ 165,672 $ 165,599 $ 159,321 Gains on developments held for sale 13,169 Real estate related depreciation and amortization: Total depreciation and amortization 111,414 90,358 67,035 Furniture, fixtures, and equipment depreciation and ground lease amortization(1) (1,963 ) (1,114 ) (1,002 ) FFO attributable to minority interests(2) (40,144 ) (15,055 ) (8,182 ) Adjustments to derive FFO in unconsolidated joint venture(3): Our share of net income (5,467 ) (5,212 ) (4,701 ) Our share of FFO 8,014 7,188 6,677 Series A preferred stock dividends (8,500 ) (8,500 ) (8,500 ) Preferred unit distributions (28,682 ) (24,613 ) (19,501 ) FFO $ 213,513 $ 208,651 $ 191,147 (1) Ground lease amortization represents the amortization of our investments in ground lease properties, for which we do not have a purchase option. (2) Represents FFO attributable to minority interests in consolidated joint ventures whose interests are not exchangeable into common stock. The minority interests share of net operating income for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, was $65.0 million, $25.0 million, and $12.5 million, respectively. (3) Our share of net operating income for years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, was $10.2 million, $8.3 million, and $8.0 million, respectively. BUSINESS RISKS Our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences to us. These risks include, among others: General Real Estate Risks There Are Factors Outside of Our Control that Affect the Performance and Value of Our Properties Real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk. The yields available from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of income earned and capital appreciation generated by the related properties as well as the expenses incurred in connection with the properties. If our properties do not generate income sufficient to meet operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, then our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders could be adversely affected. Income from, and the value of, our properties may be adversely affected by the general economic climate, local conditions such as oversupply of industrial space, or a reduction in demand for industrial space, the attractiveness of our properties to potential customers, competition from other properties, our ability to provide adequate maintenance and insurance, and an increase in operating costs. Periods of economic slowdown or recession in the United States and in other countries, rising interest rates, or declining demand for real estate, or public perception that any of these events may occur would result in a general decrease in rents or an increased occurrence of defaults under existing leases, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Future terrorist attacks in the United States may result in declining economic activity, which could harm the demand for and the value of our properties. To the extent that our customers are impacted by future attacks, their businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to honor their existing leases. Our properties are currently concentrated predominantly in the industrial real estate sector. Our concentration in a certain property type exposes us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a 31 Table of Contents greater extent than if our portfolio also included other property types. As a result of such concentration, economic downturns in the industrial real estate sector could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. In addition, revenues from properties and real estate values are also affected by factors such as the cost of compliance with regulations, the potential for liability under applicable laws (including changes in tax laws), interest rate levels, and the availability of financing. Our income would be adversely affected if a significant number of customers were unable to pay rent or if we were unable to rent our industrial space on favorable terms. Certain significant expenditures associated with an investment in real estate (such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes, and maintenance costs) generally do not decline when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property. We May Be Unable to Renew Leases or Relet Space as Leases Expire We are subject to the risks that leases may not be renewed, space may not be relet, or the terms of renewal or reletting (including the cost of required renovations) may be less favorable than current lease terms. Leases on a total of 14.9% of our industrial properties (based on annualized base rent) as of December 31, 2001, will expire on or prior to December 31, 2002. In addition, numerous properties compete with our properties in attracting customers to lease space, particularly with respect to retail centers. The number of competitive commercial properties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space in our properties and on the rents that we are able to charge. Our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and our ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected if we are unable to promptly relet or renew the leases for all or a substantial portion of expiring leases, if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting is significantly lower than expected, or if our reserves for these purposes prove inadequate. Real Estate Investments are Illiquid Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions is limited. The limitations in the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations on a real estate investment trust holding property for sale may affect our ability to sell properties without adversely affecting dividends to our stockholders. The relative illiquidity of our holdings and Internal Revenue Code prohibitions and related regulations could impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our investments and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and our ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. A Significant Number of Our Properties Are Located in California Our industrial properties located in California as of December 31, 2001, represented approximately 28.7% of the aggregate square footage of our industrial operating properties as of December 31, 2001, and 35.9% of our annualized base rent. Annualized base rent means the monthly contractual amount under existing leases as of December 31, 2001, multiplied by 12. This amount excludes expense reimbursements and rental abatements. Our revenue from, and the value of, our properties located in California may be affected by a number of factors, including local real estate conditions (such as oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties) and the local economic climate. Business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns, changing demographics, and other factors may adversely impact the local economic climate. A downturn in either the California economy or in California real estate conditions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and our ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Certain of our properties are also subject to possible loss from seismic activity. Some Potential Losses Are not Covered by Insurance We carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage, and rental loss insurance covering all of our properties, with policy specifications and insured limits that we believe are adequate and appropriate under the circumstances given relative risk of loss, the cost of such coverage, and industry practice. There are, however, certain losses that are not generally insured because it is not economically feasible to insure against them, 32 Table of Contents including losses due to acts of terrorism, riots or acts of war. Certain losses such as losses due to floods or seismic activity may be insured subject to certain limitations including large deductibles or co payments and policy limits. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties, then we could lose the capital we invested in the properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the properties and, in the case of debt, which is with recourse to us, we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties. Moreover, as the general partner of the operating partnership, we generally will be liable for all of the operating partnerships unsatisfied obligations other than non recourse obligations, including any obligations incurred by the operating partnership as the general partner of the co investment joint ventures. Any such liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. A number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to earthquake activity, including California where, as of December 31, 2001, 291 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 23.4 million square feet (representing 28.7% of our industrial operating properties based on aggregate square footage and 35.9% based on annualized base rent) are located. We carry replacement cost earthquake insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable. This insurance coverage also applies to the properties managed by AMB Capital Partners, LLC, with a single aggregate policy limit and deductible applicable to those properties and our properties. Through an annual analysis prepared by outside consultants, we evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage in light of current industry practice and determine the appropriate amount of earthquake insurance to carry. We may incur material losses in excess of insurance proceeds and we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance at commercially reasonable rates. We Are Subject to Risks and Liabilities In Connection With Properties Owned Through Joint Ventures, Limited Liability Companies, and Partnerships As of December 31, 2001, we had ownership interests in several joint ventures, limited liability companies, or partnerships with third parties, as well as interests in three unconsolidated entities. As of December 31, 2001, we owned approximately 34.1 million square feet (excluding three unconsolidated joint ventures) of our properties through these entities. We may make additional investments through these ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. Such partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions. Partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture investments may involve risks such as the following: (1) our partners, co members, or joint venturers might become bankrupt (in which event we and any other remaining general partners, members, or joint venturers would generally remain liable for the liabilities of the partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture); (2) our partners, co members, or joint venturers might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals; (3) our partners, co members, or joint venturers may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions, requests, policies, or objectives, including our current policy with respect to maintaining our qualification as a real estate investment trust; and (4) agreements governing joint ventures, limited liability companies, and partnerships often contain restrictions on the transfer of a joint venturers, members, or partners interest or buy sell or other provisions, which may result in a purchase or sale of the interest at a disadvantageous time or on disadvantageous terms. We will, however, generally seek to maintain sufficient control of our partnerships, limited liability companies, and joint ventures to permit us to achieve our business objectives. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in partnerships, limited liability companies, or joint ventures. The occurrence of one or more of the events described above could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We May be Unable to Consummate Acquisitions on Advantageous Terms We intend to continue to acquire primarily industrial properties. Acquisitions of properties entail risks that investments will fail to perform in accordance with expectations. Estimates of the costs of improvements 33 Table of Contents necessary for us to bring an acquired property up to market standards may prove inaccurate. In addition, there are general investment risks associated with any real estate investment. Further, we anticipate significant competition for attractive investment opportunities from other major real estate investors with significant capital including both publicly traded real estate investment trusts and private institutional investment funds. We expect that future acquisitions will be financed through a combination of borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the operating partnership (including issuances of limited partnership units by the operating partnership or its subsidiaries), and proceeds from property divestitures, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow. We may not be able to acquire additional properties. Our inability to finance any future acquisitions on favorable terms or the failure of acquisitions to conform with our expectations or investment criteria, or our failure to timely reinvest the proceeds from property divestitures could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We May be Unable to Complete Renovation and Development on Advantageous Terms The real estate development business, including the renovation and rehabilitation of existing properties, involves significant risks. These risks include the following: (1) we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms for development projects and we may not complete construction on schedule or within budget, resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs and delays in leasing such properties and generating cash flow; (2) we may not be able to obtain, or we may experience delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy, and other required governmental permits and authorizations; (3) new or renovated properties may perform below anticipated levels, producing cash flow below budgeted amounts; (4) substantial renovation as well as new development activities, regardless of whether or not they are ultimately successful, typically require a substantial portion of managements time and attention that could divert managements time from our day to day operations; and (5) activities that we finance through construction loans involve the risk that, upon completion of construction, we may not be able to obtain permanent financing or we may not be able to obtain permanent financing on advantageous terms. These risks could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We May be Unable to Complete Divestitures on Advantageous Terms We have decided to divest ourselves of four retail centers and one industrial property, which are not in our core markets or which do not meet our strategic objectives. The divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. Our ability to dispose of properties on advantageous terms is dependent upon factors beyond our control, including competition from other owners (including other real estate investment trusts) that are attempting to dispose of industrial and retail properties and the availability of financing on attractive terms for potential buyers of our properties. Our inability to dispose of properties on favorable terms or our inability to redeploy the proceeds of property divestitures in accordance with our investment strategy could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Debt Financing We Could Incur More Debt We operate with a policy of incurring debt, either directly or through our subsidiaries, only if upon such incurrence our debt to total market capitalization ratio would be approximately 45% or less. The aggregate amount of indebtedness that we may incur under our policy varies directly with the valuation of our capital stock and the number of shares of capital stock outstanding. Accordingly, we would be able to incur additional indebtedness under our policy as a result of increases in the market price per share of our common stock or other outstanding classes of capital stock, and future issuance of shares of our capital stock. However, our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our board of directors could alter or eliminate this policy. If we change this policy, then we could 34 Table of Contents become more highly leveraged, resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Scheduled Debt Payments Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition We are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risks that cash flow will be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders, that we will be unable to refinance existing indebtedness on our properties (which in all cases will not have been fully amortized at maturity) and that the terms of refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness. As of December 31, 2001, we had total debt outstanding of approximately $2.1 billion. In addition, we guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to the senior debt securities referenced in our financial statements. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds of other capital transactions, then we expect that our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repay all such maturing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. In addition, if we mortgage one or more of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments, then the property could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income and asset value. A foreclosure on one or more of our properties could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Rising Interest Rates Could Adversely Affect Our Cash Flow As of December 31, 2001, we had $123.5 million outstanding under our Alliance Fund II secured credit facility, $12.0 million outstanding under our unsecured credit facility, and we had four secured loans with an aggregate principal amount of $52.4 million, which bear interest at variable rates (with weighted average interest rate of 3.8% as of December 31, 2001). In addition, we may incur other variable rate indebtedness in the future. Increases in interest rates on this indebtedness could increase our interest expense, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Accordingly, in the future, we may engage in transactions to limit our exposure to rising interest rates. We Are Dependent on External Sources of Capital In order to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code, we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain) and we are subject to tax on our income to the extent it is not distributed. Because of this distribution requirement, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs, including capital needs in connection with acquisitions, from cash retained from operations. As a result, to fund capital needs, we rely on third party sources of capital, which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms or at all. Our access to third party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors, including: (1) general market conditions; (2) the markets perception of our growth potential; (3) our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; and (4) the market price of our capital stock. Additional debt financing may substantially increase our debt to total capitalization ratio. We Could Default on Cross Collateralized and Cross Defaulted Debt As of December 31, 2001, we had 22 non recourse secured loans, which are cross collateralized by 48 properties. As of December 31, 2001, we had $551.9 million (not including unamortized debt premium) outstanding on these loans. If we default on any of these loans, then we could be required to repay the 35 Table of Contents aggregate of all indebtedness, together with applicable prepayment charges, to avoid foreclosure on all the cross collateralized properties within the applicable pool. Foreclosure on our properties, or our inability to refinance our loans on favorable terms, could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. In addition, our credit facilities and the senior debt securities of the operating partnership contain certain cross default provisions, which are triggered in the event that our other material indebtedness is in default. These cross default provisions may require us to repay or restructure the credit facilities and the senior debt securities in addition to any mortgage or other debt that is in default, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Contingent or Unknown Liabilities Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition Our predecessors have been in existence for varying lengths of time up to 18 years. At the time of our formation we acquired the assets of these entities subject to all of their potential existing liabilities. There may be current liabilities or future liabilities arising from prior activities that we are not aware of and therefore have not disclosed in this report. We assumed these liabilities as the surviving entity in the various merger and contribution transactions that occurred at the time of our formation. Existing liabilities for indebtedness generally were taken into account in connection with the allocation of the operating partnerships limited partnership units or shares of our common stock in the formation transactions, but no other liabilities were taken into account for these purposes. We do not have recourse against our predecessors or any of their respective stockholders or partners or against any individual account investors with respect to any unknown liabilities. Unknown liabilities might include the following: (1) liabilities for clean up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; (2) claims of customers, vendors, or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to the formation transactions that had not been asserted prior to the formation transactions; (3) accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; (4) tax liabilities; and (5) claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these entities. Certain customers may claim that the formation transactions gave rise to a right to purchase the premises that they occupy. We do not believe any such claims would be material and, to date, no such claims have been filed. See Government Regulations We Could Encounter Costly Environmental Problems below regarding the possibility of undisclosed environmental conditions potentially affecting the value of our properties. Undisclosed material liabilities in connection with the acquisition of properties, entities and interests in properties, or entities could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Our Access to Timely Financial Reporting and to Capital Markets May be Impaired if Arthur Andersen LLP is Unable to Perform Required Audit Related Services On March 14, 2002, our independent public accountant, Arthur Andersen LLP, was indicted on federal obstruction of justice charges arising from the U.S. governments investigation of Enron Corporation. Arthur Andersen LLP has indicated that it intends to contest vigorously the indictment. The Securities and Exchange Commission has said that it will continue accepting financial statements audited by Arthur Andersen LLP, and interim financial statements reviewed by it, so long as Arthur Andersen LLP is able to make certain representations to its clients. Our access to the capital markets and our ability to make timely filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission could be impaired if the Securities and Exchange Commission ceases accepting financial statements audited by Arthur Andersen LLP, if Arthur Andersen LLP becomes unable to make the required representations to us or if for any other reason Arthur Andersen LLP is unable to perform required audit related services for us. However, we believe that our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow from operations and borrowings available under our unsecured credit facility, are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. 36 Table of Contents Conflicts of Interest Some of Our Directors and Executive Officers Are Involved in Other Real Estate Activities and Investments Some of our executive officers own interests in real estate related businesses and investments. These interests include minority ownership of Institutional Housing Partners, L.P., a residential housing finance company, and ownership of Aspire Development, Inc. and Aspire Development, L.P., developers that own property not suitable for ownership by us. Aspire Development, Inc. and Aspire Development, L.P. have agreed not to initiate any new development projects not contemplated at our initial public offering in November 1997. These entities have also agreed that they will not make any further investments in industrial properties other than those currently under development at the time of our initial public offering. The continued involvement in other real estate related activities by some of our executive officers and directors could divert managements attention from our day to day operations. Most of our executive officers have entered into non competition agreements with us pursuant to which they have agreed not to engage in any activities, directly or indirectly, in respect of commercial real estate, and not to make any investment in respect of industrial real estate, other than through ownership of not more than 5% of the outstanding shares of a public company engaged in such activities or through the existing investments referred to in this report. State law may limit our ability to enforce these agreements. Certain of Our Executive Officers and Directors May Have Conflicts of Interest with Us in Connection with Other Properties that They Own or Control As of December 31, 2001, Aspire Development, L.P. owns interests in three retail development projects in the U.S., one of which is a single freestanding Walgreens drugstore and two of which are Walgreens drugstores plus shop buildings, which are less than 10,000 feet. In addition, Messrs. Moghadam and Burke, each a founder and director, own less than 1% interests in two partnerships that own office buildings in various markets; these interests have negligible value. Luis A. Belmonte, an executive officer, owns less than a 10% interest, representing an estimated value of $150,000, in a limited partnership, which owns an office building located in Oakland, California. In addition, several of our executive officers individually own: (1) less than 1% interests in the stocks of certain publicly traded real estate investment trusts; (2) certain interests in and rights to developed and undeveloped real property located outside the United States; and (3) certain other de minimus holdings in equity securities of real estate companies. Thomas W. Tusher, a member of our board of directors, is a limited partner in a partnership in which Messrs. Moghadam and Burke are general partners and which owns a 75% interest in an office building. Mr. Tusher owns a 20% interest in the partnership, valued at approximately $1.7 million. Messrs. Moghadam and Burke each have a 26.7% interest in the partnership, each valued at approximately $2.2 million. We believe that the properties and activities set forth above generally do not directly compete with any of our properties. However, it is possible that a property in which an executive officer or director, or an affiliate of an executive officer or director, has an interest may compete with us in the future if we were to invest in a property similar in type and in close proximity to that property. In addition, the continued involvement by our executive officers and directors in these properties could divert managements attention from our day to day operations. Our policy prohibits us from acquiring any properties from our executive officers or their affiliates without the approval of the disinterested members of our board of directors with respect to that transaction. Our Role as General Partner of the Operating Partnership May Conflict with the Interests of Stockholders As the general partner of the operating partnership, we have fiduciary obligations to the operating partnerships limited partners, the discharge of which may conflict with the interests of our stockholders. In addition, those persons holding limited partnership units will have the right to vote as a class on certain amendments to the partnership agreement of the operating partnership and individually to approve certain 37 Table of Contents amendments that would adversely affect their rights. The limited partners may exercise these voting rights in a manner that conflicts with the interests of our stockholders. In addition, under the terms of the operating partnerships partnership agreement, holders of limited partnership units will have certain approval rights with respect to certain transactions that affect all stockholders but which they may not exercise in a manner that reflects the interests of all stockholders. Our Directors, Executive Officers, and Significant Stockholders Could Act in a Manner that is Not in the Best Interest of All Stockholders As of March 20, 2002, we believe that our two largest stockholders, Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc. (with respect to various client accounts for which Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc. serves as investment advisor) and ABP Investments U.S. (with respect to various client accounts for which ABP Investments U.S. serves as investment advisor) beneficially owned 14.0% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, our executive officers and directors beneficially owned 4.3% of our outstanding common stock as of March 20, 2002, and will have influence on our management and operation and, as stockholders, will have influence on the outcome of any matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. This influence might be exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with the interests of other stockholders. Although there is no understanding or arrangement for these directors, officers, and stockholders and their affiliates to act in concert, these parties would be in a position to exercise significant influence over our affairs if they choose to do so. Government Regulations Many laws and governmental regulations are applicable to our properties and changes in these laws and regulations, or their interpretation by agencies and the courts, occur frequently. Costs of Compliance with Americans with Disabilities Act Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, places of public accommodation must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act might require us to remove structural barriers to handicapped access in certain public areas where such removal is readily achievable. If we fail to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, then we might be required to pay fines to the government or damages to private litigants. The impact of application of the Americans with Disabilities Act to our properties, including the extent and timing of required renovations, is uncertain. If we are required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, then our cash flow and the amounts available for dividends to our stockholders may be adversely affected. We Could Encounter Environmental Problems Federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment impose liability on a current or previous owner or operator of real estate for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at the property. A current or previous owner may be required to investigate and clean up contamination at or migrating from a site. These laws typically impose liability and clean up responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean up costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury, property damage, or other costs, including investigation and clean up costs, resulting from environmental contamination present at or emanating from that site. Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance, and removal of asbestos. These laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, that they adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos, and that they undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or 38 Table of Contents demolition of a building. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failing to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers. Some of our properties may contain asbestos containing building materials. Some of our properties are leased or have been leased, in part, to owners and operators of businesses that use, store, or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. These operations create a potential for the release of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. Some of our properties are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, certain of our properties are on, are adjacent to, or are near other properties upon which others, including former owners or customers of the properties, have engaged or may in the future engage in activities that may release petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. From time to time, we may acquire properties, or interests in properties, with known adverse environmental conditions where we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and the acquisition will yield a superior risk adjusted return. Environmental issues for each property are evaluated and quantified prior to acquisition. The costs of environmental investigation, clean up, and monitoring are underwritten into the cost of the acquisition and appropriate environmental insurance is obtained for the property. In connection with certain divested properties, we have agreed to remain responsible for, and to bear the cost of, remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties. All of our properties were subject to a Phase I or similar environmental assessments by independent environmental consultants at the time of acquisition. Phase I assessments are intended to discover and evaluate information regarding the environmental condition of the surveyed property and surrounding properties and include an historical review, a public records review, an investigation of the surveyed site and surrounding properties, and preparation and issuance of a written report. We may perform additional Phase II testing if recommended by the independent environmental consultant. Phase II testing may include the collection and laboratory analysis of soil and groundwater samples, completion of surveys for asbestos containing building materials, and any other testing that the consultant considers prudent in order to test for the presence of hazardous materials. None of the environmental assessments of our properties has revealed any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. Furthermore, we are not aware of any such material environmental liability. Nonetheless, it is possible that the assessments do not reveal all environmental liabilities and that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware or that known environmental conditions may give rise to liabilities that are materially greater than anticipated. Moreover, the current environmental condition of our properties may be affected by customers, the condition of land, operations in the vicinity of the properties (such as releases from underground storage tanks), or by third parties unrelated to us. If the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations exceed our budgets for these items, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. Our Financial Condition Could be Adversely Affected if We Fail to Comply with Other Regulations Our properties are also subject to various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, then we might incur fines by governmental authorities or be required to pay awards of damages to private litigants. We believe that our properties are currently in substantial compliance with all such regulatory requirements. However, these requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed, which could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us. Any such unanticipated expenditure could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. 39 Table of Contents Federal Income Tax Risks Our Failure to Qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust Would Have Serious Adverse Consequences to Stockholders We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1997. We currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code and believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify. Qualification as a real estate investment trust requires us to satisfy numerous requirements (some on an annual and others on a quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. For example, in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we must derive at least 95% of our gross income in any year from qualifying sources. In addition, we must pay dividends to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis. These provisions and the applicable treasury regulations are more complicated in our case because we hold our assets through the operating partnership. Legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations, or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a real estate investment trust or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. However, we are not aware of any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect our ability to operate as a real estate investment trust. If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment trust for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost qualification. If we lose our real estate investment trust status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved. In addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. We Pay Some Taxes Even if we qualify as a real estate investment trust, we will be required to pay certain state and local taxes on our income and property. In addition, we will be required to pay federal and state income tax on the net taxable income, if any, from the activities conducted through AMB Capital Partners, LLC and Headlands Realty Corporation. AMB Capital Partners, LLC and Headlands Realty Corporation, as taxable REIT subsidiaries, are also subject to tax on their income, reducing their cash available for distribution to us. Certain Property Transfers May Generate Prohibited Transaction Income From time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. Under the Internal Revenue Code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction. We would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on that income. Since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we believe that any transfer or disposal of property by us would not be deemed by the Internal Revenue Service to be a prohibited transaction with any resulting gain allocable to us being subject to a 100% penalty tax. However, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. While we believe that the Internal Revenue Service would not prevail in any such dispute, if the IRS were to successfully argue that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay 40 Table of Contents a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction. In addition, any income from a prohibited transaction may adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes. We Are Dependent On Our Key Personnel We depend on the efforts of our executive officers. While we believe that we could find suitable replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers. We May Be Unable to Manage Our Growth Our business has grown rapidly and continues to grow through property acquisitions and developments. If we fail to effectively manage our growth, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. We May Be Unable to Effectively Manage Our International Growth We may acquire properties in foreign countries. Local markets affect our operations and, therefore, we would be subject to economic fluctuations in foreign locations. Our international operations also would be subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as the revaluation of currencies, revisions in tax treaties or other laws governing the taxation of revenues, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and, in certain parts of the world, political instability. We cannot predict the likelihood that any such developments may occur. Further, we may enter into agreements with non U.S. entities that are governed by the laws of, and are subject to dispute resolution in, the courts of another country or region. We cannot accurately predict whether such a forum would provide us with an effective and efficient means of resolving disputes that may arise. Even if we are able to obtain a satisfactory decision through arbitration or a court proceeding, we could have difficulty enforcing any award or judgment on a timely basis. Our business has grown rapidly and continues to grow through property acquisitions and developments. If we fail to effectively manage our international growth, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. Ownership of Our Stock Limitations in Our Charter and Bylaws Could Prevent a Change in Control Certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay, defer, or prevent a change in control or other transaction that could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for the common stock. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock may be owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code to include certain entities) during the last half of a taxable year after the first taxable year for which a real estate investment trust election is made. Furthermore, our common stock must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a 12 month taxable year (or a proportionate part of a short tax year). In addition, if we, or an owner of 10% or more of our stock, actually or constructively owns 10% or more of one of our customers (or a tenant of any partnership in which we are a partner), then the rent received by us (either directly or through any such partnership) from that tenant will not be qualifying income for purposes of the real estate investment trust gross income tests of the Internal Revenue Code. To facilitate maintenance of our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, we will prohibit the ownership, actually or by virtue of the constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, by any single person of more than 9.8% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock and more than 9.8% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the issued and outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, and we will also prohibit the ownership, actually or constructively, of any shares of our other preferred stock by any single 41 Table of Contents person so that no such person, taking into account all of our stock so owned by such person, may own in excess of 9.8% of our issued and outstanding capital stock. We refer to this limitation as the ownership limit. Shares acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary. Any person who acquires shares in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any dividends on the shares or be entitled to vote the shares or receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the shares in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the shares or the amount realized from the sale. A transfer of shares in violation of the above limits may be void under certain circumstances. The ownership limit may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control and, therefore, could adversely affect our stockholders ability to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for the shares of our common stock in connection with such transaction. Our charter authorizes us to issue additional shares of common and preferred stock and to establish the preferences, rights, and other terms of any series or class of preferred stock that we issue. Although our board of directors has no intention to do so at the present time, it could establish a series or class of preferred stock that could delay, defer, or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. Our charter and bylaws and Maryland law also contain other provisions that may delay, defer, or prevent a transaction, including a change in control, that might involve payment of a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. Those provisions include the following: (1) the provision in the charter that directors may be removed only for cause and only upon a two thirds vote of stockholders, together with bylaw provisions authorizing the board of directors to fill vacant directorships; (2) the provision in the charter requiring a two thirds vote of stockholders for any amendment of the charter; (3) the requirement in the bylaws that the request of the holders of 50% or more of our common stock is necessary for stockholders to call a special meeting; (4) the requirement of Maryland law that stockholders may only take action by written consent with the unanimous approval of all stockholders entitled to vote on the matter in question; and (5) the requirement in the bylaws of advance notice by stockholders for the nomination of directors or proposal of business to be considered at a meeting of stockholders. These provisions may impede various actions by stockholders without approval of our board of directors, which in turn may delay, defer or prevent a transaction involving a change of control. We Could Change Our Investment and Financing Policies without a Vote of Stockholders Subject to our current investment policy to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust (unless a change is approved by our board of directors under certain circumstances), our board of directors will determine our investment and financing policies, our growth strategy and our debt, capitalization, distribution, and operating policies. Although the board of directors has no present intention to revise or amend these strategies and policies, the board of directors may do so at any time without a vote of stockholders. Accordingly, stockholders will have no control over changes in our strategies and policies (other than through the election of directors), and any such changes may not serve the interests of all stockholders and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations, including our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. If We Issue Additional Securities, then the Investment of Existing Stockholders Will Be Diluted We have authority to issue shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities in exchange for property or otherwise. Similarly, we may cause the operating partnership to issue additional limited partnership units in exchange for property or otherwise. Existing stockholders will have no preemptive right to acquire any additional securities issued by us or the operating partnership and any issuance of additional equity securities could result in dilution of an existing stockholders investment. 42 Table of Contents The Large Number of Shares Available for Future Sale Could Adversely Affect the Market Price of Our Common Stock We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of our common stock, or the availability of shares of our common stock for future sale, will have on its market price. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market (or upon exchange of limited partnership units in the operating partnership) or the perception that such sales (or exchanges) might occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. All shares of common stock issuable upon the redemption of limited partnership units in the operating partnership will be deemed to be restricted securities within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act and may not be transferred unless registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from registration is available, including any exemption from registration provided under Rule 144. In general, upon satisfaction of certain conditions, Rule 144 permits the holder to sell certain amounts of restricted securities one year following the date of acquisition of the restricted securities from us and, after two years, permits unlimited sales by persons unaffiliated with us. Commencing generally on the first anniversary of the date of acquisition of common limited partnership units (or such other date agreed to by the operating partnership and the holders of the units), the operating partnership may redeem common limited partnership units at the request of the holders for cash (based on the fair market value of an equivalent number of shares of common stock at the time of redemption) or, at the option of the operating partnership, exchange the common limited partnership units for an equal number of shares of our common stock, subject to certain antidilution adjustments. The operating partnership had issued and outstanding 4,969,027 common limited partnership units as of December 31, 2001. As of December 31, 2001, we had reserved 8,072,818 shares of common stock for issuance under our Stock Option and Incentive Plan (not including shares that we have already issued) and, as of December 31, 2001, we had granted to certain directors, officers, and employees options to purchase 7,437,219 shares of common stock (excluding forfeitures and 330,176 shares that we have issued pursuant to the exercise of options). As of December 31, 2001, we had granted 549,738 restricted shares of common stock, 2,732 of which have been forfeited. In addition, we may issue additional shares of common stock and the operating partnership may issue additional limited partnership units in connection with the acquisition of properties. In connection with the issuance of common limited partnership units to other transferors of properties, and in connection with the issuance of the performance units, we have agreed to file registration statements covering the issuance of shares of common stock upon the exchange of the common limited partnership units. We have also filed a registration statement with respect to the shares of common stock issuable under our Stock Option and Incentive Plan. These registration statements and registration rights generally allow shares of common stock covered thereby, including shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of limited partnership units, including performance units, or the exercise of options or restricted shares of common stock, to be transferred or resold without restriction under the Securities Act. We may also agree to provide registration rights to any other person who may become an owner of the operating partnerships limited partnership units. Future sales of the shares of common stock described above could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The existence of the operating partnerships limited partnership units, options, and shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon exchange of limited partnership units, and the exercise of options and registration rights referred to above, also may adversely affect the terms upon which we are able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities. Various Market Conditions Affect the Price of Our Stock As with other publicly traded equity securities, the market price of our stock will depend upon various market conditions, which may change from time to time. Among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our stock are the following: (1) the extent of investor interest in us; (2) the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate based companies); (3) our financial performance; (4) general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of our stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends; and 43 Table of Contents (5) terrorist activity may adversely affect the markets in which our securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending. Other factors such as governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws could also have a significant impact on the future market price of our stock. Earnings and Cash Dividends, Asset Value, and Market Interest Rates Affect the Price of Our Stock The market value of the equity securities of a real estate investment trust generally is based primarily upon the markets perception of the real estate investment trusts growth potential and its current and potential future earnings and cash dividends. It is based secondarily upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets. For that reason, shares of our stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share. To the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working capital reserves, or other purposes, these retained funds, while increasing the value of our underlying assets, may not correspondingly increase the market price of our stock. Our failure to meet the markets expectations with regard to future earnings and cash dividends likely would adversely affect the market price of our stock. Another factor that may influence the price of our stock will be the distribution yield on the stock (as a percentage of the price of the stock) relative to market interest rates. An increase in market interest rates might lead prospective purchasers of our stock to expect a higher distribution yield, which would adversely affect the market price of the stock. If the market price of our stock declines significantly, then we might breach certain covenants with respect to debt obligations, which might adversely affect our liquidity and ability to make future acquisitions and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. Item 7a. Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevalent market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing, and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes: (1) interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings; and (2) our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2001, we had no interest rate caps or swaps. See Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources Market Capitalization. The table below summarizes the market risks associated with our fixed and variable rated debt outstanding before unamortized debt premiums of $6.8 million as of December 31, 2001: Expected Maturity Date Total 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Thereafter Debt Fixed rate debt(1) $ 73,603 $ 89,319 $ 92,364 $ 350,029 $ 186,452 $ 1,149,166 $ 1,940,933 Average interest rate 8.3 % 7.8 % 8.0 % 7.3 % 7.3 % 7.5 % 7.5 % Variable rate debt(2) $ 23,093 $ 136,053 $ 20,526 $ 594 $ 7,629 $ 187,895 Average interest rate 3.5 % 2.8 % 4.1 % 3.5 % 3.5 % 3.0 % (1) Represents 91.2% of all outstanding debt. (2) Represents 8.9% of all outstanding debt. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased by 10% (or 30 basis points), then the increase in interest expense on the variable rate debt would be $0.6 million annually.
