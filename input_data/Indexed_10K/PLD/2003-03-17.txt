Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Risks for a complete discussion of the various risks that could adversely affect us. 6 Item 2. Properties INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES As of December 31, 2002, we owned 904 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 84.2 million rentable square feet, located in 28 markets throughout North America and France. Our industrial properties accounted for $501.2 million, or 97.7%, of our total annualized base rent as of December 31, 2002. Our industrial properties were 94.6% leased to over 2,300 customers, the largest of which accounted for no more than 2.6% of our annualized base rent from our industrial properties. See Item 14. Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for segment information related to our operations. Property Characteristics. Our industrial properties, which consist primarily of warehouse distribution facilities suitable for single or multiple customers, are typically comprised of multiple buildings. The following table identifies type and characteristics of our industrial buildings and each types percentage of our total portfolio based on square footage at December 31: Building Type Description 2002 2001 Warehouse 15,000 75,000 SF, single or multi customer 40.2% 40.3% Bulk Warehouse Over 75,000 SF, single or multi customer 39.6% 37.8% Flex Industrial Includes assembly or R&D, single or multi customer 7.5% 9.6% Light Industrial Smaller customers, 15,000 SF or less, higher office finish 6.5% 7.3% Trans Shipment Unique configurations for truck terminals and cross docking 2.3% 1.8% Air Cargo On tarmac or airport land for transfer of air cargo goods 2.6% 1.6% Office Single or multi customer, used strictly for office 1.3% 1.5% Lease Terms. Our industrial properties are typically subject to lease on a triple net basis, in which customers pay their proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance and operating costs, or are subject to leases on a modified gross basis, in which customers pay expenses over certain threshold levels. In addition, most of our leases include fixed rental increases or CPI rental increases. Lease terms typically range from three to ten years, with an average of six years, excluding renewal options. However, the majority of our industrial leases do not include renewal options. Overview of Major Target Markets. Our industrial properties are located near key passenger and air cargo airports, key interstate highways, and seaports in major domestic metropolitan areas, such as Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas/ Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Northern New Jersey/New York City, the San Francisco Bay Area, Miami and Seattle. Our international industrial facilities are located in major distributions markets including Mexico City, Guadalajara and Paris. We believe our industrial properties strategic location, transportation network and infrastructure, and large consumer and manufacturing bases support strong demand for industrial space. Within these metropolitan areas, our industrial properties are concentrated in locations with limited new construction opportunities within established, relatively large submarkets, which we believe should provide a higher rate of occupancy and rent growth than properties located elsewhere. These in fill locations are typically near major passenger and air cargo facilities, seaports or convenient to major highways and rail lines, and are proximate to a diverse labor pool. There is typically broad demand for industrial space in these centrally located submarkets due to a diverse mix of industries and types of industrial uses, including warehouse distribution, light assembly and manufacturing. We generally avoid locations at the periphery of metropolitan areas where there are fewer constraints to the supply of additional industrial properties. 7 Industrial Market Operating Statistics As of December 31, 2002, we operated in eight domestic hub and gateway markets, in addition to 20 other markets throughout North America and France. The following table represents properties in which we own a fee simple interest or a controlling interest (consolidated), and excludes properties in which we only own a non controlling interest (unconsolidated) and properties under development.

Such investments are consolidated because we own a majority interest or exercise significant control over major operating decisions such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers and changes in financing. Under the agreements governing the joint ventures, we and the other party to the joint venture may be required to make additional capital contributions and, subject to certain limitations, the joint ventures may incur additional debt. Such agreements also impose certain restrictions on the transfer of joint venture interests by us or the other party to the joint venture and provide certain rights to us or the other party to the joint venture to sell its interest to the joint venture or to the other joint venture partner on terms specified in the agreement.

In accordance with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust White Paper on funds from operations, we include the effects of straight line rents in funds from operations. We believe that FFO is an appropriate measure of performance for a real estate investment trust because it is widely used by investors and analysts. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, and it should not be considered as an alternative to these indicators in evaluating liquidity or operating performance. Further, FFO as disclosed by other real estate investment trusts may not be comparable. For a presentation of and a quantitative reconciliation of FFO with the most directly comparable financial measure to FFO calculated in accordance with GAAP, please see the supplemental earnings table in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (4) Contractual obligations include short term and long term debt payments and lease obligations. Amounts due within one year were $160.3 million, $103.5 million, $54.1 million, $128.1 million and $14.1 million as of December 31, 2002, 2001, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. 20 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations You should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements. Statements contained in this discussion that are not historical facts may be forward looking statements. Such statements relate to our future performance and plans, results of operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and operating improvements and costs. You can identify forward looking statements by the use of forward looking terminology such as believes, expects, may, will, should, seeks, approximately, intends, plans, pro forma, estimates or anticipates, or the negative of these words and phrases, or similar words or phrases. You can also identify forward looking statements by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. Forward looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties and you should not rely upon them as predictions of future events. There is no assurance that the events or circumstances reflected in forward looking statements will occur or be achieved. Forward looking statements are necessarily dependent on assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise and we may not be able to realize them. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward looking statements: defaults or non renewal of leases by customers; increased interest rates and operating costs; our failure to obtain necessary outside financing; difficulties in identifying properties to acquire and in effecting acquisitions; our failure to successfully integrate acquired properties and operations; our failure to divest of properties that we have contracted to sell or to timely reinvest proceeds from any such divestitures; risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including construction delays, cost overruns, our inability to obtain necessary permits and public opposition to these activities); our failure to qualify and maintain our status as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; environmental uncertainties; risks related to natural disasters; financial market fluctuations; changes in real estate and zoning laws; increases in real property tax rates; and risks of doing business internationally, including currency risks. Our success also depends upon economic trends generally, including interest rates, income tax laws, governmental regulation, legislation, population changes and those other risk factors discussed in the section entitled Business Risks in this report. We caution you not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements, which reflect our analysis only and speak as of the date of this report or as of the dates indicated in the statements. GENERAL We commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company in connection with the completion of our initial public offering on November 26, 1997, and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with our initial tax return for the year 21 ended December 31, 1997. AMB Property Corporation and the operating partnership were formed shortly before the consummation of our initial public offering. We generate revenue primarily from rent received from customers under long term operating leases at our properties, including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs and our private capital business. In addition, our growth is, in part, dependent on our ability to increase occupancy rates or increase rental rates at our properties and our ability to continue the acquisition and development of additional properties. Although the weak economy has decreased customer demand for new space and has limited or in some cases lowered rent growth, many types of investors are acquiring industrial real estate. In 2002, we capitalized on this opportunity by accelerating our portfolio repositioning program through the disposition of properties. Our income would be adversely affected if a significant number of customers were unable to pay rent or if we were unable to rent our industrial space on favorable terms. Certain significant expenditures associated with an investment in real estate (such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs) generally do not decline when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property. Moreover, as the general partner of the operating partnership, we generally will be liable for all of the operating partnerships unsatisfied obligations other than non recourse obligations, including the operating partnerships obligations as the general partner of the co investment joint ventures. Any such liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Investments in Real Estate. Investments in real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a property by property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable. Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying amount of the property. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future market conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying amount of our long lived assets could occur in the future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings. Rental Revenues. We record rental revenue from operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our bad debt reserves, security deposits and letters of credit, then we may have to recognize additional bad debt charges in future periods. Each period we review our outstanding accounts receivable, including straight line rents, for doubtful accounts and provide allowances as needed. Historically, our bad debt expense has been between 50 and 150 basis points of total revenues. 22 Consolidated Joint Ventures. Minority interests represent the limited partnership interests in the operating partnership and interests held by certain third parties in several real estate joint ventures, aggregating approximately 33.8 million square feet, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes. Such investments are consolidated because we own a majority interest or we exercise significant control over major operating decisions such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, investment activity and changes in financing. Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. We have non controlling limited partnership interests in four separate unconsolidated joint ventures. These investments are not consolidated because we do not exercise significant control over major operating decisions such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, investment activity and changes in financing. We account for the joint ventures using the equity method of accounting. Stock based Compensation Expense. In 2002, we adopted the expense recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. We value stock options issued using the Black Scholes option pricing model and recognize this value as an expense over the period in which the options vest. Under this standard, recognition of expense for stock options is retroactively applied to all options granted after the beginning of the year of adoption. Prior to 2002, we followed the intrinsic method set forth in APB Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. During 2002, we awarded 2.0 million stock options to employees. In accordance with SFAS No. 123, we will recognize the associated expense over the three to five year vesting periods. The expense is included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. REIT Compliance. We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1997. In order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we must derive at least 95% of our gross income in any year from qualifying sources. In addition, we must pay dividends to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis. It is our current intention to adhere to these requirements and maintain our REIT status. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on net income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. As such, no provision for federal income taxes has been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As a REIT, we still may be subject to certain state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, we will be required to pay federal and state income tax on the net taxable income, if any, from the activities conducted through our taxable REIT subsidiaries. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The analysis below includes changes attributable to acquisitions, development activity, divestitures and the changes resulting from properties that we owned during both the current and prior year reporting periods, excluding development properties prior to being stabilized (generally defined as 90% leased or 12 months after we receive a certificate of occupancy for the building). We refer to these properties as the same store properties. For the comparison between the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the same store industrial properties consisted of properties aggregating approximately 68.0 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2002 consisted of 43 buildings, aggregating approximately 5.4 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2001 consisted of 65 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.8 million square feet. In 2002, property divestitures consisted of 58 industrial buildings and two retail centers, aggregating approximately 5.7 million square feet. In 2001, property divestitures consisted of 24 industrial and two retail buildings, aggregating approximately 3.2 million square feet. Our future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition of additional properties and dispositions. Our future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical rates. While occupancy levels in our industrial portfolio were similar in 2002 and 2001, rents on lease renewals and rollovers were lower in 2002 as the general contraction in business activity nationwide caused a reduction 23 in demand for industrial warehouse facilities. This reduction in demand was evidenced by two significant factors: decreases in national industrial occupancy levels and negative net absorption of industrial facility space. Specifically, according to Torto Wheaton Research, at December 31, 2001, national industrial occupancy was 90.2%; by December 31, 2002, national occupancy fell to 88.8%. As reported by Torto Wheaton Research, national net absorption of industrial space (the change in the amount of square footage leased in existing and newly constructed industrial properties) was positive from 1989 through 2000. By contrast, Torto Wheaton Research reported that net absorption was negative by 152.0 million square feet in 2001 and 34.0 million square feet in 2002. These factors combined to reduce market rents for industrial properties by approximately 15% to 20% nationally from peak levels at the beginning of 2001. While the level of rental rate reduction varied by market, we strove to maintain high occupancy by pricing lease renewals and new leases with sensitivity to local market conditions. For the Years Ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 Rental Revenues 2002 2001 $ Change % Change (Dollars in millions) Industrial: Same store $ 490.9 $ 472.4 $ 18.5 3.9 % 2001 acquisitions 46.7 20.3 26.4 130.0 % 2002 acquisitions 21.2 21.2 Developments 20.2 9.6 10.6 110.4 % Divestitures 21.9 31.3 (9.4 ) (30.0 )% Retail 16.9 24.3 (7.4 ) (30.5 )% Discontinued operations (40.3 ) (38.0 ) 2.3 Straight line rents 11.0 10.1 0.9 8.9 % Total $ 588.5 $ 530.0 $ 58.5 11.0 % The growth in rental revenues in same store properties resulted primarily from increased lease termination fees, fixed rent increases on existing leases and reimbursement of expenses, partially offset by lower average occupancies. Industrial same store occupancy was 94.6% at December 31, 2002, and 95.0% at December 31, 2001. Year to date, the same store rent decrease on industrial renewals and rollovers (cash basis) was (1.4%) on 13.8 million square feet leased. The increase in straight line rents was partially offset by write offs associated with lease terminations. In 2002, lease termination fees increased $9.5 million, net of straight line rent adjustments and lease cost and tenant improvement write downs, over 2001.

We carried a 9.5% mortgage note secured by the retail center that we sold in September 2000 in the principal amount of $74.0 million. 24 Property Operating Expenses and Real Estate Taxes (Exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 2002 2001 $ Change % Change Rental expenses $ 77.5 $ 64.5 $ 13.0 20.2 % Real estate taxes 68.4 63.3 5.1 8.1 % Property operating expenses $ 145.9 $ 127.8 $ 18.1 14.2 % Industrial: Same store $ 118.3 $ 112.6 $ 5.7 5.1 % 2001 acquisitions 11.0 3.9 7.1 182.1 % 2002 acquisitions 6.8 6.8 Developments 7.2 3.1 4.1 132.3 % Divestitures 6.7 10.0 (3.3 ) (33.0 )% Retail 6.3 8.6 (2.3 ) (26.7 )% Discontinued operations (10.4 ) (10.4 ) 0.0 Total $ 145.9 $ 127.8 $ 18.1 14.2 % The $5.7 million increase in same store properties operating expenses primarily relates to increases in real estate taxes of $1.2 million and insurance expenses of $3.7 million due to premium increases.

The secured debt issuances were primarily for our co investment joint ventures properties. The increase in depreciation expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the consolidation of AMB Investment Management, Inc. (predecessor in interest to AMB Capital Partners, LLC) and Headlands Realty Corporation on May 31, 2001. Prior to May 31, 2001, general and administrative expenses did not include expenses incurred by two unconsolidated preferred stock subsidiaries, Headlands Realty Corporation and AMB Investment Management, Inc. General and administrative expenses would have been $39.4 million had the subsidiaries been consolidated beginning January 1, 2001. The increase in general and administrative expenses was also due to increased stock based compensation expense, additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international expansion and income taxes for our taxable REIT subsidiaries. In 2001, we recognized $20.8 million of losses on investments in other companies, including our investment in Webvan Group, Inc. and other technology related companies. The loss reflects a 100% write down of the investments. No gains or losses were recognized in 2002. 25 For the Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 Rental Revenues 2001 2000 $ Change % Change (Dollars in millions) Same store $ 400.2 $ 376.7 $ 23.5 6.2 % 2000 acquisitions 97.1 25.6 71.5 279.3 % 2001 acquisitions 22.8 22.8 Developments 26.9 14.6 12.3 84.0 % Divestitures 10.9 37.1 (26.2 ) (70.6 )% Discontinued operations (38.0 ) (33.1 ) (4.9 ) 14.8 % Straight line rents 10.1 10.2 (0.1 ) (1.0 )% Total $ 530.0 $ 431.1 $ 98.9 22.9 % The growth in rental revenues in same store properties resulted primarily from the incremental effect of cash rental rate increases on renewals and rollovers, fixed rent increases on existing leases, and reimbursement of expenses, partially offset by lower average occupancies. During 2001, the same store rent increases on industrial renewals and rollovers (cash basis) was 23.5% on 10.0 million square feet leased.

The $9.8 million increase in interest and other income was primarily due to interest income from our mortgage note on the retail center that we sold in 2000 and from interest income resulting from higher average cash balances.

The secured debt issuances were primarily for our co investment joint ventures properties. The increase in depreciation expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased personnel and occupancy costs. In addition, the consolidation of AMB Investment Management, Inc. (predecessor in interest to AMB Capital Partners, LLC) and Headlands Realty Corporation on May 31, 2001, resulted in an increase in general and administrative expenses of $4.9 million. During 2001, we recognized $20.8 million of losses on investments in other companies, related to our investment in Webvan Group, Inc. and other technology related companies. The loss reflects a 100% write down of the book value of the investments. 27 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for acquisitions, development, expansion and renovation of properties will include: cash flow from operations; borrowings under our unsecured credit facility; other forms of secured or unsecured financing; proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the operating partnership (including issuances of limited partnership units in the operating partnership or its subsidiaries); net proceeds from divestitures of properties; and private capital from co investment partners. We believe that our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow from operations, borrowings available under our unsecured credit facility and our ability to access private and public debt and equity capital, are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. Capital Resources Property Divestitures. During 2002, we divested ourselves of 58 industrial buildings, two retail centers and an undeveloped retail land parcel for an aggregate price of $244.0 million, with a resulting net gain of $9.6 million. During 2002, we also completed and sold six buildings developed as part of our development for sale program for a net gain of $1.0 million. Properties Held for Divestiture. We have decided to divest ourselves of two retail centers, four industrial properties and two development properties, which are not in our core markets or which do not meet our current strategic objectives. The divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. As of December 31, 2002, the net carrying value of the properties held for divestiture was $107.9 million. Co investment Joint Ventures. We consolidate the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of our five co investment joint ventures. Our five co investment joint ventures are engaged in the acquisition, ownership, operation, management and, in some cases, the renovation, expansion and development of industrial buildings in target markets nationwide. We consolidate these joint ventures for financial reporting purposes because we are the sole managing general partner and, as a result, control all major operating decisions. Third party equity interests in the joint ventures are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2002, we owned approximately 28.2 million square feet of our properties through these five co investment joint ventures and 5.6 million square feet of our properties through our other consolidated joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. During 2002, we sold $76.9 million in operating properties, consisting of 15 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 1.9 million square feet, to one of our co investment joint ventures, AMB SGP, L.P. We recognized a gain of $3.3 million related to this sale, representing the portion of the sold properties acquired by the third party co investor. We also sold 30% of our interest in AMB Partners II, L.P. to our co investment joint venture partner, we now own 20% of AMB Partners II, L.P. We recognized a gain of $6.3 million related to this sale. 28 Our co investment joint ventures at December 31, 2002 (dollars in thousands): Companys Approximate Ownership Total Planned Co investment Joint Venture Joint Venture Partner Percentage Capitalization(1) AMB/ Erie, L.P.

(5) In November 2002, our partner increased its ownership in AMB Partners II, L.P. from 50% to 80% by acquiring 30% of our partnership interest. We recognized a gain of $6.3 million. Equity. We have authorized for issuance 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which the following series were designated as of December 31, 2002: 4,600,000 shares of Series A preferred; 1,300,000 shares of Series B preferred; 1,595,337 shares of Series D preferred; 220,440 shares of Series E preferred; 267,439 shares of Series F preferred; 840,000 shares of Series H preferred; 510,000 shares of Series I preferred; 800,000 shares of Series J preferred; and 800,000 shares of Series K preferred. On July 31, 2002, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, repurchased 130,000 7.95% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units and all 20,000 of its outstanding 7.95% Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units from a single institutional investor. We redeemed the units for an aggregate cost of $7.1 million, including accrued and unpaid dividends and a redemption discount of $0.4 million. On April 17, 2002, the operating partnership issued and sold 800,000 7.95% Series K Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units at a price of $50.00 per unit in a private placement. Distributions are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable quarterly in arrears. The Series K Preferred Units are redeemable by the operating partnership on or after April 17, 2007, subject to certain conditions, for cash at a redemption price equal to $50.00 per unit, plus accumulated and unpaid distributions thereon, if any, to the redemption date. The Series K Preferred Units are exchangeable at specified times and subject to certain conditions, on a one for one basis, for shares of our Series K Preferred Stock. The operating partnership used the net proceeds of $39.0 million for general corporate purposes, which included the partial repayment of indebtedness and the acquisition and development of additional properties. During 2002, we redeemed 122,640 common limited partnership units of the operating partnership for shares of our common stock. In December 2001, our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $100.0 million worth of our common and preferred stock. In December 2002, our board of directors increased the repurchase program to $200.0 million. The current stock repurchase program expires in December 2003 and as of December 31, 2002, $130.6 million of repurchase capacity remained under our current stock repurchase program. During 2002, we repurchased 2,651,600 shares of our common stock for $69.4 million, including commissions. In July 2002, we also repurchased 4,200 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock for an aggregate cost of $0.1 million, including accrued and unpaid dividends. 29 Debt. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, we presently intend to operate with a debt to total market capitalization ratio (our share) of approximately 45% or less. As of December 31, 2002, our share of total debt to total market capitalization ratio was 37.7%. Additionally, we currently intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. In spite of these policies, our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our board of directors could alter or eliminate these policies or circumstances could arise that could render us unable to comply with these policies. As of December 31, 2002, the aggregate principal amount of our secured debt was $1.3 billion, excluding unamortized debt premiums of $9.8 million. Of the $1.3 billion of secured debt, $0.9 billion is secured by properties in our joint ventures. The secured debt is generally non recourse and bears interest at rates varying from 3.0% to 10.4% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 7.3%) and final maturity dates ranging from January 2003 to June 2023. All of the secured debt bears interest at fixed rates, except for seven loans with an aggregate principal amount of $65.6 million as of December 31, 2002, which bear interest at variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 3.5% as of December 31, 2002). Over time, we intend to repay the secured debt on our 100% owned assets and may prepay if market conditions warrant. In May 2002, the operating partnership commenced a medium term note program for the issuance of up to $400.0 million in principal amount of medium term notes, which will be guaranteed by us. As of December 31, 2002, the operating partnership had issued no medium term notes under this program. In August 2000, the operating partnership commenced a medium term note program for the issuance of up to $400.0 million in principal amount of medium term notes, which are guaranteed by us. On January 14, 2002, the operating partnership completed the program when it issued and sold the remaining $20.0 million of the notes to Lehman Brothers, Inc., as principal. We have guaranteed the notes, which mature on January 17, 2007, and bear interest at 5.90% per annum. The operating partnership used the net proceeds of $19.9 million for general corporate purposes, to partially repay indebtedness and to acquire and develop additional properties. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to its senior debt securities. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then our cash flow may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Credit Facilities. In December 2002, the operating partnership renewed its $500.0 million unsecured revolving line of credit. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations under the credit facility. The credit facility matures in December 2005, has a one year extension option and is currently subject to a 20 basis point annual facility fee. Borrowings under our credit facility currently bear interest at LIBOR plus 60 basis points. Both the facility fee and the interest rate are based on our credit rating, which is currently investment grade. However, if our credit rating falls below investment grade, then our facility fee and interest rate may increase. The credit facility includes a multi currency component under which up to $150.0 million may be drawn in either British pounds sterling, euros or yen, provided that such currency is readily available and freely transferable and convertible to U.S. dollars. The Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service reports LIBOR for such currency in interest periods of 1, 2, 3 or 6 months. The operating partnership has the ability to increase available borrowings to $700.0 million by adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their commitments. We use our unsecured credit facility principally for acquisitions and for general working capital requirements. Monthly debt service payments on our credit facility are interest only. The total amount available under our credit facility fluctuates based upon the borrowing base, as defined in the agreement governing the credit facility, generally the value of our unencumbered properties. As of December 31, 2002, the outstanding balance on our unsecured credit facility was $95.0 million and the 30 remaining amount available was $379.0 million, net of outstanding letters of credit (excluding the $200.0 million of potential additional capacity). In July 2001, AMB Institutional Alliance Fund II, L.P. obtained a $150.0 million credit facility secured by the unfunded capital commitments of the investors in AMB Institutional Alliance REIT II, Inc. and AMB Institutional Alliance Fund II, L.P. Borrowings currently bear interest at LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points. As of December 31, 2002, the outstanding balance was $45.5 million and the remaining amount available was $31.2 million, net of outstanding letters of credit and capital contributions from third party investors. Mortgage Receivables. In September 2000, we sold a retail center located in Southern California. We carried a 9.5% mortgage note secured by the retail center in the principal amount of $74.0 million, due September 30, 2002. On July 3, 2002, we received a full repayment of the mortgage. Through a wholly owned subsidiary, we also hold a mortgage loan receivable on AMB Pier One, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture. The note bears interest at 13.0% and matures in May 2026. As of December 31, 2002, the outstanding balance on the note was $13.1 million. 31 The tables below summarize our debt maturities and capitalization as of December 31, 2002 (dollars in thousands): DEBT Company Joint Unsecured Secured Venture Senior Debt Unsecured Credit Debt Debt Securities Debt Facilities Total Debt 2003 $ 74,631 $ 19,678 $ $ 558 $ 45,500 $ 140,367 2004 63,465 64,928 601 128,994 2005 45,511 59,326 250,000 647 95,000 450,484 2006 85,023 65,676 25,000 698 176,397 2007 24,073 43,163 75,000 752 142,988 2008 32,669 154,684 175,000 810 363,163 2009 4,147 76,826 873 81,846 2010 50,948 105,854 75,000 941 232,743 2011 409 179,295 75,000 1,014 255,718 2012 407 101,399 1,092 102,898 Thereafter 481 22,264 125,000 2,200 149,945 Subtotal 381,764 893,093 800,000 10,186 140,500 2,225,543 Unamortized premiums 7,835 1,983 9,818 Total consolidated debt 389,599 895,076 800,000 10,186 140,500 2,235,361 Our share of unconsolidated joint venture debt(1) 39,288 39,288 Total debt 389,599 934,364 800,000 10,186 140,500 2,274,649 Joint venture partners share of consolidated joint venture debt (546,509 ) (36,400 ) (582,909 ) Our share of total debt $ 389,599 $ 387,855 $ 800,000 $ 10,186 $ 104,100 $ 1,691,740 Weighed average interest rate 8.1 % 7.0 % 7.2 % 7.5 % 2.1 % 7.0 % Weighed average maturity (in years) 3.7 7.1 6.5 11.8 2.2 6.0 (1) The weighted average interest and maturity for the unconsolidated joint venture debt were 6.4% and 6.6 years, respectively. 32 MARKET EQUITY Shares/Units Security Outstanding Market Price Market Value Common stock 82,029,449 $ 27.36 $ 2,244,326 Common limited partnership units 4,846,387 27.36 132,597 Total 86,875,836 $ 2,376,923 PREFERRED STOCK AND UNITS Dividend Liquidation Redemption Security Rate Preference Provisions Series A preferred stock 8.50 % $ 99,895 July 2003 Series B preferred units 8.63 % 65,000 November 2003 Series D preferred units 7.75 % 79,767 May 2004 Series E preferred units 7.75 % 11,022 August 2004 Series F preferred units 7.95 % 13,372 March 2005 Series H preferred units 8.13 % 42,000 September 2005 Series I preferred units 8.00 % 25,500 March 2006 Series J preferred units 7.95 % 40,000 September 2006 Series K preferred units 7.95 % 40,000 April 2007 Weighted average/total 8.17 % $ 416,556 CAPITALIZATION RATIOS Total debt to total market capitalization 44.9 % Our share of total debt to total market capitalization 37.7 % Total debt plus preferred to total market capitalization 53.1 % Our share of total debt plus preferred to total market capitalization 47.0 % Our share of total debt to total book capitalization 45.9 % Liquidity As of December 31, 2002, we had $117.2 million in cash, restricted cash and cash equivalents, and $379.0 million of additional available borrowings under our credit facility. We also had $31.2 million of additional available borrowings under our AMB Institutional Alliance Fund II, L.P. credit facility. To fund acquisitions, development activities and capital expenditures, and to provide for general working capital requirements, we intend to use: cash flow from operations; borrowings under our unsecured credit facility; other forms of secured and unsecured financing; proceeds from any future debt or equity offerings by us or the operating partnership (including issuances of limited partnership units in the operating partnership or its subsidiaries); net proceeds from divestitures of properties; and private capital from our co investment partners. The unavailability of capital would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. 33 Our board of directors declared a regular cash dividend for the quarter ending December 31, 2002, of $0.41 per share of common stock and the operating partnership declared a regular cash distribution for the quarter ending December 31, 2002, of $0.41 per common unit. The dividends and distributions were payable on January 6, 2003, to stockholders and unitholders of record on December 20, 2002. The Series A, B, E, F, J and K preferred stock and unit dividends and distributions were payable on January 15, 2003, to stockholders and unitholders of record on January 3, 2003. The Series D, H and I preferred unit distributions were payable on December 26, 2002.

On July, 31, 2002, AMB Property II, L.P. paid a distribution, which accrued during the period from July 15, 2002 to July 31, 2002, of $0.155 per unit on the 130,000 Series F preferred units that were redeemed. The anticipated size of our distributions, using only cash from operations, will not allow us to retire all of our debt as it comes due. Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Commitments Developments. In addition to recurring capital expenditures, which consist of building improvements and leasing costs incurred to renew or re tenant space, as of December 31, 2002, we are developing ten projects representing a total estimated investment of $106.8 million upon completion and three development projects available for sale representing a total estimated investment of $49.1 million upon completion. Of this total, $92.8 million had been funded as of December 31, 2002, and an estimated $63.1 million is required to complete current and planned projects. We expect to fund these expenditures with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facility, debt or equity issuances and net proceeds from property divestitures, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow. Acquisitions. During 2002, we invested $403.3 million in 43 operating industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 5.4 million rentable square feet, and a parking lot adjacent to Los Angeles International 34 Airport. We funded these acquisitions and initiated development and renovation projects through private capital contributions, borrowings under our credit facility, cash, debt issuances and net proceeds from property divestitures. Lease Commitments. We have entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily on tarmac facilities, and office space with remaining lease terms from one to 38 years. Future minimum rental payments required under non cancelable operating leases in effect as of December 31, 2002, were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2003 $ 19,921 2004 19,753 2005 19,819 2006 20,553 2007 20,772 Thereafter 283,574 Total lease commitments $ 384,392 These operating lease payments are being amortized ratably over the terms of the related leases. Captive Insurance Company. We have responded to recent trends towards increasing costs and decreasing coverage availability in the insurance markets by obtaining higher deductible property insurance from third party insurers and by forming a wholly owned captive insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., in December 2001. Arcata National Insurance Ltd. provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the increased deductible under the third party policies. We capitalized Arcata National Insurance Ltd. in accordance with regulatory requirements. Arcata National Insurance Ltd. established annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss experience of our properties. Annually, we engage an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims and projected expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata National Insurance Ltd. may be adjusted based on this estimate. Premiums paid to Arcata National Insurance Ltd. have a retrospective component, so that if expenses, including losses, are less than premiums collected, the excess will be returned to the property owners (and, in turn, as appropriate, to the customers) and conversely, subject to certain limitations, if expenses, including losses, are greater than premiums collected, an additional premium will be charged. As with all recoverable expenses, differences between estimated and actual insurance premiums will be recognized in the subsequent year. Through this structure, we believe that we have been able to obtain insurance for our portfolio with more comprehensive coverage at a projected overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market. Potential Unknown Liabilities. Unknown liabilities may include the following: liabilities for clean up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to our formation transactions that had not been asserted prior to our formation transactions; accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; tax liabilities; and claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these entities. 35 Overview of Contractual Obligations The following tables summarizes our debt and lease commitments as of December 31, 2002 (dollars in thousands): Less than More than 5 Contractual Obligations 1 Year 13 Years 35 Years Years Total Debt $ 140,367 $ 579,478 $ 319,385 $ 1,186,313 $ 2,225,543 Lease commitments 19,921 39,572 41,325 283,574 384,392 Total contractual obligations $ 160,288 $ 619,050 $ 360,710 $ 1,469,887 $ 2,609,935 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have no off balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations, guarantees or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Supplemental Earning Measure We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP , is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, the real estate industry has adopted a supplemental earnings measure, funds from operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), that is widely used by investors and analysts. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and it should not be considered as an alternative to those indicators in evaluating liquidity or operating performance. Further, FFO as disclosed by other real estate investment trusts may not be comparable. FFO is defined as income from operations before minority interest plus real estate depreciation, discontinued operations FFO and adjustments to derive our pro rata share of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures, less minority interests pro rata share of FFO of consolidated joint ventures and perpetual preferred stock dividends. In accordance with the NAREIT White Paper on FFO, we include the effects of straight line rents in FFO. Further, we do not adjust FFO to eliminate the effects of non recurring charges. 36 The following table reflects the calculation of FFO for the years ended December 31, (dollars in thousands): 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 Net income $ 116,153 $ 125,053 $ 113,282 $ 167,603 $ 108,954 Minority interests 37,806 34,835 20,323 14,486 9,350 Gains from dispositions of real estate, net of minority interests (7,789 ) (23,259 ) (1,144 ) (51,263 ) Gains from dispositions of real estate, discontinued operations (11,372 ) Preferred unit redemption discount/(premium) (412 ) 4,400 Real estate related depreciation and amortization: Total depreciation and amortization 127,160 104,838 84,960 63,747 55,210 Discontinued operations depreciation 7,529 6,600 5,398 3,758 2,254 Furniture, fixtures and equipment depreciation and ground lease amortization(1) (2,450 ) (1,963 ) (1,114 ) (1,002 ) (463 ) FFO attributable to minority interests (52,051 ) (40,144 ) (15,030 ) (8,158 ) (5,887 ) Adjustments to derive FFO in unconsolidated joint ventures: Our share of net income (5,674 ) (5,467 ) (5,212 ) (4,701 ) (1,750 ) Our share of FFO 8,728 8,014 7,188 6,677 2,739 Funds from operations $ 217,628 $ 212,907 $ 208,651 $ 191,147 $ 170,407 (1) Ground lease amortization represents the amortization of our investments in ground lease properties, for which we do not have a purchase option.

These risks include, among others: General Real Estate Risks There are Factors Outside of Our Control that Affect the Performance and Value of Our Properties. Real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk. The yields available from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of income earned and capital appreciation generated by the related properties as well as the expenses incurred in connection with the properties. If our properties do not generate income sufficient to meet operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, then our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders could be adversely affected. Income from, and the value of, our properties may be adversely affected by the general economic climate, local conditions, such as oversupply of industrial space or a reduction in demand for industrial space, the attractiveness of our properties to potential customers, competition from other properties, our ability to provide adequate maintenance and insurance and an increase in operating costs. Periods of economic slowdown or recession in the United States and in other countries, rising interest rates or declining demand for real estate, or public perception that any of these events may occur, would result in a general decrease in rents or an increased occurrence of defaults under existing leases, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our properties are currently concentrated predominantly in the industrial real estate sector. Our concentration in a certain property type exposes us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our portfolio also included other property types. As a result of such concentration, economic downturns in the industrial real estate sector could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. In addition, revenues from properties and real estate values are also affected by factors such as the cost of compliance with regulations, the potential for liability under applicable laws (including changes in tax laws), interest rate levels and the availability of financing. Our income would be adversely affected if a significant number of customers were unable to pay rent or if we were unable to rent our industrial space on favorable terms. Certain significant expenditures associated with an investment in real estate (such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes, and maintenance costs) generally do not decline when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property. Future terrorist attacks in the United States may result in declining economic activity, which could harm the demand for and the value of our properties. To the extent that our customers are impacted by future attacks, their businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to honor their existing leases. We May Be Unable to Renew Leases or Relet Space as Leases Expire. We are subject to the risks that leases may not be renewed, space may not be relet, or the terms of renewal or reletting (including the cost of required renovations) may be less favorable than current lease terms. Leases on a total of 15.4% of our industrial properties (based on annualized base rent) as of December 31, 2002, will expire on or prior to December 31, 2003. In addition, numerous properties compete with our properties in attracting customers to lease space, particularly with respect to retail centers. The number of competitive commercial properties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space in our properties and on the rents that we are able to charge. Our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected if we are unable to promptly relet or renew the leases for all or a substantial portion of expiring leases, if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting is significantly lower than expected, or if our reserves for these purposes prove inadequate. Real Estate Investments are Illiquid. Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions is limited. The limitations in the Internal Revenue Code and related 38 regulations on a real estate investment trust holding property for sale may affect our ability to sell properties without adversely affecting dividends to our stockholders. The relative illiquidity of our holdings and Internal Revenue Code prohibitions and related regulations could impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our investments and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. A Significant Number of Our Properties are Located in California. Our industrial properties located in California as of December 31, 2002, represented 28.4% of the aggregate square footage of our industrial operating properties as of December 31, 2002, and 33.9% of our industrial annualized base rent. Annualized base rent means the monthly contractual amount under existing leases as of December 31, 2002, multiplied by 12. This amount excludes expense reimbursements and rental abatements. Our revenue from, and the value of, our properties located in California may be affected by a number of factors, including local real estate conditions (such as oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties) and the local economic climate. Business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns, changing demographics, and other factors may adversely impact the local economic climate. A downturn in Californias economy, fiscal situation or real estate conditions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Certain of our properties are also subject to possible loss from seismic activity. See Some Potential Losses are not Covered by Insurance. Some Potential Losses are not Covered by Insurance. We carry commercial liability, property and rental loss insurance covering all properties owned and managed by us, with policy specifications and insured limits that we believe are adequate and appropriate under the circumstances given relative risks, the cost of such coverage and industry practice. Certain losses such as losses due to terrorism, windstorms, floods or seismic activity may be insured subject to certain limitations, including large deductibles or co payments and policy limits. Although we have obtained coverage for certain acts of terrorism, with policy specifications and insured limits that we believe are commercially reasonable, it is not certain that we will be able to renew coverage or collect under such policies. From time to time, we evaluate the amount of earthquake coverage that we carry for all properties owned and managed by us, to assess whether, in our good faith discretion, the coverage is adequate. We may incur material losses in excess of insurance proceeds and we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance at commercially reasonable rates. In addition, there are certain losses that are not generally insured because it is not economically feasible to insure against them, including losses due to riots or acts of war. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties, then we could lose the capital we invested in the properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the properties and, in the case of debt, which is with recourse to us, we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties. Moreover, as the general partner of the operating partnership, we generally will be liable for all of the operating partnerships unsatisfied obligations other than non recourse obligations, including any obligations incurred by the operating partnership as the general partner of the co investment joint ventures. Any such liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. A number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to earthquake activity, including California where, as of December 31, 2002, 295 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 23.9 million square feet (representing 28.4% of our industrial operating properties based on aggregate square footage and 33.9% based on industrial annualized base rent), are located. We carry replacement cost earthquake insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable. This insurance coverage also applies to the properties managed by AMB Capital Partners, LLC, with a single aggregate policy limit and deductible applicable to those properties and our properties. Through an annual analysis prepared by outside consultants, we evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage in light of current industry practice and determine the appropriate amount of earthquake insurance to carry, which we believe is commercially 39 reasonable. We may incur material losses in excess of insurance proceeds and we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance at commercially reasonable rates. We are Subject to Risks and Liabilities In Connection With Properties Owned Through Joint Ventures, Limited Liability Companies and Partnerships. As of December 31, 2002, we had ownership interests in several joint ventures, limited liability companies or partnerships with third parties, as well as interests in three unconsolidated entities. As of December 31, 2002, we owned approximately 33.7 million square feet (excluding three unconsolidated joint ventures) of our properties through these entities. We may make additional investments through these ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. Such partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions. Partnership, limited liability company or joint venture investments may involve risks such as the following: our partners, co members or joint venturers might become bankrupt (in which event we and any other remaining general partners, members, or joint venturers would generally remain liable for the liabilities of the partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture); our partners, co members or joint venturers might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals; our partners, co members or joint venturers may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions, requests, policies, or objectives, including our current policy with respect to maintaining our qualification as a real estate investment trust; and agreements governing joint ventures, limited liability companies and partnerships often contain restrictions on the transfer of a joint venturers, members or partners interest or buy sell or other provisions that may result in a purchase or sale of the interest at a disadvantageous time or on disadvantageous terms. We will, however, generally seek to maintain sufficient control of our partnerships, limited liability companies, and joint ventures to permit us to achieve our business objectives. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in partnerships, limited liability companies or joint ventures. The occurrence of one or more of the events described above could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We May be Unable to Consummate Acquisitions on Advantageous Terms or Acquisitions May Not Perform As We Expect. We intend to continue to acquire primarily industrial properties. The acquisition of and investment in properties entails various risks. In addition to the general investment risks associated with any real estate investment, our investments may not perform in accordance with our expectations or our cost estimates for bringing an acquired property up to market standards may prove inaccurate. Further, we may not be able to acquire additional properties on acceptable terms. We anticipate significant competition for attractive investment opportunities from other major real estate investors with significant capital including both publicly traded real estate investment trusts and private institutional investment funds. In addition, we expect to finance future acquisitions through a combination of borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the operating partnership (including issuances of limited partnership units by the operating partnership or its subsidiaries) and proceeds from property divestitures, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow. Our inability to finance future acquisitions on favorable terms, the failure of acquisitions to conform with our expectations or investment criteria, or our failure to timely reinvest the proceeds from property divestitures could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. 40 We May be Unable to Complete Divestitures on Advantageous Terms. We have decided to divest ourselves of retail centers and industrial properties that are not in our core markets or which do not meet our strategic objectives. The divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. Our ability to dispose of properties on advantageous terms is dependent upon factors beyond our control, including competition from other owners (including other real estate investment trusts) that are attempting to dispose of industrial and retail properties and the availability of attractive financing for potential buyers of our properties. Our inability to dispose of properties on favorable terms or redeploy the proceeds of property divestitures in accordance with our investment strategy could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We May be Unable to Complete Renovation and Development Projects on Advantageous Terms. The real estate development business, including the renovation and rehabilitation of existing properties, involves significant risks that include the following: we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms for development projects and we may not complete construction on schedule or within budget, resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs and delays in leasing such properties and generating cash flow; we may not be able to obtain, or we may experience delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations; new or renovated properties may perform below anticipated levels, producing cash flow below budgeted amounts; substantial renovation as well as new development activities, regardless of their ultimate success, typically require a substantial portion of managements time and attention, diverting our attention from our day to day operations; and upon completion of construction, we may not be able to obtain permanent financing, or obtain permanent financing on advantageous terms, for activities that we have financed through construction loans. These risks could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Debt Financing We Could Incur More Debt. It is our policy to incur debt, either directly or through our subsidiaries, only if it will not cause our share of debt to total market capitalization ratio to exceed approximately 45%. The aggregate amount of indebtedness that we may incur under our policy varies directly with the valuation of our capital stock and the number of shares of capital stock outstanding. Accordingly, we would be able to incur additional indebtedness under our policy as a result of increases in the market price per share of our common stock or other outstanding classes of capital stock, and future issuance of shares of our capital stock. However, our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our board of directors could alter or eliminate this policy. If we change this policy, then we could become more highly leveraged, resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Scheduled Debt Payments Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition. We are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing, including that cash flow will be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders, that we will be unable to refinance existing indebtedness on our properties (which in all cases will not have been fully amortized at maturity), and that the terms of 41 refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness. As of December 31, 2002, we had total debt outstanding of $2.2 billion. In addition, we guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to the senior debt securities referenced in our financial statements. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds of other capital transactions, then we expect that our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repay all such maturing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. In addition, if we mortgage one or more of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments, then the property could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income and asset value. A foreclosure on one or more of our properties could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Rising Interest Rates Could Adversely Affect Our Cash Flow. As of December 31, 2002, we had $45.5 million outstanding under our Alliance Fund II secured credit facility, $95.0 million outstanding on our unsecured credit facility, and we had seven secured loans with an aggregate principal amount of $65.6 million that bear interest at variable rates (with weighted average interest rate of 3.5% as of December 31, 2002). In addition, we may incur other variable rate indebtedness in the future. Increases in interest rates on this indebtedness could increase our interest expense, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Accordingly, in the future, we may engage in transactions to limit our exposure to rising interest rates. We Are Dependent on External Sources of Capital. In order to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code, we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain) and we are subject to tax on our income to the extent it is not distributed. Because of this distribution requirement, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs, including capital needs in connection with acquisitions, from cash retained from operations. As a result, to fund capital needs we rely on third party sources of capital, which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms or at all. Our access to third party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors, including: general market conditions; the markets perception of our growth potential; our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; and the market price of our capital stock. Additional debt financing may substantially increase our debt to total capitalization ratio. We Could Default on Cross Collateralized and Cross Defaulted Debt. As of December 31, 2002, we had 26 non recourse secured loans that are cross collateralized by 60 properties, totaling $711.7 million (not including unamortized debt premium). If we default on any of these loans, then we could be required to repay the aggregate of all indebtedness, together with applicable prepayment charges, to avoid foreclosure on all the cross collateralized properties within the applicable pool. Foreclosure on our properties, or our inability to refinance our loans on favorable terms, could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. In addition, our credit facilities and senior debt securities contain certain cross default 42 provisions, which are triggered in the event that our other material indebtedness is in default. These cross default provisions may require us to repay or restructure the credit facilities and the senior debt securities in addition to any mortgage or other debt that is in default, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Contingent or Unknown Liabilities Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition. Our predecessors have been in existence for varying lengths of time up to 19 years. At the time of our formation we acquired the assets of these entities subject to all of their potential existing liabilities. There may be current liabilities or future liabilities arising from prior activities that we are not aware of and therefore have not disclosed in this report. We assumed these liabilities as the surviving entity in the various merger and contribution transactions that occurred at the time of our formation. Existing liabilities for indebtedness generally were taken into account in connection with the allocation of the operating partnerships limited partnership units or shares of our common stock in the formation transactions, but no other liabilities were taken into account for these purposes. We do not have recourse against our predecessors or any of their respective stockholders or partners or against any individual account investors with respect to any unknown liabilities. Unknown liabilities might include the following: liabilities for clean up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; claims of customers, vendors, or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to the formation transactions that had not been asserted prior to the formation transactions; accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; tax liabilities; and claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these entities. Certain customers may claim that the formation transactions gave rise to a right to purchase the premises that they occupy. We do not believe any such claims would be material and, to date, no such claims have been filed. See Government Regulations We Could Encounter Costly Environmental Problems below regarding the possibility of undisclosed environmental conditions potentially affecting the value of our properties. Undisclosed material liabilities in connection with the acquisition of properties, entities and interests in properties, or entities could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Conflicts of Interest Some of Our Directors and Executive Officers are Involved in Other Real Estate Activities and Investments. Some of our executive officers own interests in real estate related businesses and investments. These interests include minority ownership interests in Institutional Housing Partners, L.P., a residential housing finance company (Messrs. Burke and Moghadam) and Aspire Development, Inc. and Aspire Development, L.P., developers of properties not within our investment criteria (Messrs. Belmonte, Burke and Moghadam). The continued involvement in other real estate related activities by some of our executive officers and directors could divert managements attention from our day to day operations. Our executive officers have entered into non competition agreements with us pursuant to which they have agreed not to engage in any activities, directly or indirectly, in respect of commercial real estate, and not to make any investment in respect of any industrial or retail real estate, other than through ownership of not more than 5% of the outstanding shares of a public company engaged in such activities or through the existing investments referred to in this report. State law may limit our ability to enforce these agreements. 43 Certain of Our Executive Officers and Directors May Have Conflicts of Interest with Us in Connection with Other Properties that They Own or Control. As of December 31, 2002, Aspire Development, L.P. owned interests in several retail development projects in the U.S., which are individually less than 10,000 feet. In addition, Messrs. Moghadam and Burke, each a founder and director, own less than 1% interests in two partnerships that own office buildings in various markets; these interests have negligible value. Luis A. Belmonte, an executive officer, owns less than a 10% interest, representing an estimated value of $150,000, in a limited partnership, which owns an office building located in Oakland, California. In addition, several of our executive officers individually own: less than 1% interests in the stocks of certain publicly traded real estate investment trusts; certain interests in and rights to developed and undeveloped real property located outside the United States; and certain other de minimus holdings in equity securities of real estate companies. Thomas W. Tusher, a member of our board of directors and chair of the boards compensation committee, is a limited partner in a venture in which Messrs. Moghadam and Burke are two of three members in the controlling general partner. The venture owns an office building. Mr. Tusher owns a 20% interest in the venture and Messrs. Moghadam and Burke each have a 26.7% interest in the venture. These interests in the venture have negligible value. The venture was formed in 1985, prior to the time of our initial public offering, and we continue to act as property and asset manager of the office building, for which services the venture pays us a fee. In our capacity as property and asset manager, we oversee the management and operation of the property, including the obtaining of financing and negotiating with third party lenders in connection therewith. The largest tenant, which occupies 68% of the building, filed for bankruptcy in January 2003. We believe that the properties and activities set forth above generally do not directly compete with any of our properties. However, it is possible that a property in which an executive officer or director, or an affiliate of an executive officer or director, has an interest may compete with us in the future if we were to invest in a property similar in type and in close proximity to that property. In addition, the continued involvement by our executive officers and directors in these properties could divert managements attention from our day to day operations. Our policy prohibits us from acquiring any properties from our executive officers or their affiliates without the approval of the disinterested members of our board of directors with respect to that transaction. Our Role as General Partner of the Operating Partnership May Conflict with the Interests of Stockholders. As the general partner of the operating partnership, we have fiduciary obligations to the operating partnerships limited partners, the discharge of which may conflict with the interests of our stockholders. In addition, those persons holding limited partnership units will have the right to vote as a class on certain amendments to the partnership agreement of the operating partnership and individually to approve certain amendments that would adversely affect their rights. The limited partners may exercise these voting rights in a manner that conflicts with the interests of our stockholders. In addition, under the terms of the operating partnerships partnership agreement, holders of limited partnership units will have certain approval rights with respect to certain transactions that affect all stockholders but which they may not exercise in a manner that reflects the interests of all stockholders. Our Directors, Executive Officers, and Significant Stockholders Could Act in a Manner that is Not in the Best Interest of All Stockholders. As of December 31, 2002, our two largest stockholders, Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Inc. (with respect to various client accounts for which Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Inc. serves as investment advisor) and ABP Investments U.S. (with respect to various client accounts for which ABP Investments U.S. serves as investment advisor) together beneficially owned 10.8% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, our executive officers and directors beneficially owned 4.3% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2002, and will have influence on our management and operation and, as 44 stockholders, will have influence on the outcome of any matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. This influence might be exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with the interests of other stockholders. Although there is no understanding or arrangement for these directors, officers, and stockholders and their affiliates to act in concert, these parties would be in a position to exercise significant influence over our affairs if they choose to do so. Government Regulations Many laws and governmental regulations are applicable to our properties and changes in these laws and regulations, or their interpretation by agencies and the courts, occur frequently. We May Incur Costs to Comply with Americans with Disabilities Act. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, places of public accommodation must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act might require us to remove structural barriers to handicapped access in certain public areas where such removal is readily achievable. If we fail to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, then we might be required to pay fines to the government or damages to private litigants. The impact of application of the Americans with Disabilities Act to our properties, including the extent and timing of required renovations, is uncertain. If we are required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, then our cash flow and the amounts available for dividends to our stockholders may be adversely affected. We Could Encounter Environmental Problems. Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment impose liability on a current or previous owner or operator of real estate for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at the property. A current or previous owner may be required to investigate and clean up contamination at or migrating from a site. These laws typically impose liability and clean up responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean up costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury, property damage, or other costs, including investigation and clean up costs, resulting from environmental contamination present at or emanating from that site. Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos. These laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, that they adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failing to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers. Some of our properties may contain asbestos containing building materials. Some of our properties are leased or have been leased, in part, to owners and operators of businesses that use, store, or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. These operations create a potential for the release of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. Some of our properties are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, certain of our properties are on, are adjacent to, or are near other properties upon which others, including former owners or customers of the properties, have engaged or may in the future engage in activities that may release petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. From time to time, we may acquire properties, or interests in properties, with known adverse environmental conditions where we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and the acquisition will yield a superior risk adjusted return. Environmental issues for each 45 property are evaluated and quantified prior to acquisition. The costs of environmental investigation, clean up and monitoring are underwritten into the cost of the acquisition and appropriate environmental insurance is obtained for the property. In connection with certain divested properties, we have agreed to remain responsible for, and to bear the cost of, remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties. All of our properties were subject to a Phase I or similar environmental assessments by independent environmental consultants at the time of acquisition. Phase I assessments are intended to discover and evaluate information regarding the environmental condition of the surveyed property and surrounding properties and include an historical review, a public records review, an investigation of the surveyed site and surrounding properties, and preparation and issuance of a written report. We may perform additional Phase II testing if recommended by the independent environmental consultant. Phase II testing may include the collection and laboratory analysis of soil and groundwater samples, completion of surveys for asbestos containing building materials, and any other testing that the consultant considers prudent in order to test for the presence of hazardous materials. None of the environmental assessments of our properties has revealed any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. Furthermore, we are not aware of any such material environmental liability. Nonetheless, it is possible that the assessments do not reveal all environmental liabilities and that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware or that known environmental conditions may give rise to liabilities that are materially greater than anticipated. Moreover, the current environmental condition of our properties may be affected by customers, the condition of land, operations in the vicinity of the properties (such as releases from underground storage tanks), or by third parties unrelated to us. If the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations exceed our budgets for these items, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. Our Financial Condition Could be Adversely Affected if We Fail to Comply with Other Regulations. Our properties are also subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, then we might incur fines by governmental authorities or be required to pay awards of damages to private litigants. We believe that our properties are currently in substantial compliance with all such regulatory requirements. However, these requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us. Any such unanticipated expenditure could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Federal Income Tax Risks Our Failure to Qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust Would Have Serious Adverse Consequences to Our Stockholders. We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1997. We currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code and believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify. Qualification as a real estate investment trust requires us to satisfy numerous requirements (some on an annual and others on a quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. For example, in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we must derive at least 95% of our gross income in any year from qualifying sources. In addition, we must pay dividends to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our real estate investment 46 trust taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis. These provisions and the applicable treasury regulations are more complicated in our case because we hold our assets through the operating partnership. Legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a real estate investment trust or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. However, we are not aware of any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect our ability to operate as a real estate investment trust. If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment trust for the four taxable years following the year in which we lost qualification. If we lose our real estate investment trust status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved. In addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. We Pay Some Taxes. Even if we qualify as a real estate investment trust, we will be required to pay certain state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property. In addition, we will be required to pay federal and state income tax on the net taxable income, if any, from the activities conducted through our taxable REIT subsidiaries, IMD Holding Corporation and Headlands Realty Corporation, thereby reducing their cash available for distribution to us. Certain Property Transfers May Generate Prohibited Transaction Income. From time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. Under the Internal Revenue Code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction. We would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on that income. Since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we believe that any transfer or disposal of property by us would not be deemed by the Internal Revenue Service to be a prohibited transaction with any resulting gain allocable to us being subject to a 100% penalty tax. However, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. While we believe that the Internal Revenue Service would not prevail in any such dispute, if the IRS were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction. In addition, any income from a prohibited transaction may adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes. We May Be Unable to Manage Our Growth. Our business has grown rapidly and continues to grow through property acquisitions and developments. If we fail to effectively manage our growth, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. Our International Growth is Subject to Special Political and Monetary Risks. We have and expect to continue to acquire or develop additional properties in foreign countries. Local markets affect our operations and, therefore, we would be subject to economic fluctuations in foreign locations. Our international operations also would be subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as the revaluation of currencies, revisions in tax treaties or other laws governing the taxation of revenues, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and, in certain parts of the world, property rights uncertainty and political instability. We cannot predict the likelihood that any such developments may occur. Further, we may enter into 47 agreements with non U.S. entities that are governed by the laws of, and are subject to dispute resolution in, the courts of another country or region. We cannot accurately predict whether such a forum would provide us with an effective and efficient means of resolving disputes that may arise. Even if we are able to obtain a satisfactory decision through arbitration or a court proceeding, we could have difficulty enforcing any award or judgment on a timely basis. Our business has grown rapidly and continues to grow through property acquisitions and developments. If we fail to effectively manage our international growth, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. We Are Dependent On Our Key Personnel. We depend on the efforts of our executive officers. While we believe that we could find suitable replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers. Ownership of Our Stock Limitations in Our Charter and Bylaws Could Prevent a Change in Control. Certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay, defer, or prevent a change in control or other transaction that could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for the common stock. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock may be owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code to include certain entities) during the last half of a taxable year after the first taxable year for which a real estate investment trust election is made. Furthermore, our common stock must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a 12 month taxable year (or a proportionate part of a short tax year). In addition, if we, or an owner of 10% or more of our stock, actually or constructively owns 10% or more of one of our customers (or a tenant of any partnership in which we are a partner), then the rent received by us (either directly or through any such partnership) from that tenant will not be qualifying income for purposes of the real estate investment trust gross income tests of the Internal Revenue Code. To facilitate maintenance of our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, we prohibit the ownership, actually or by virtue of the constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, by any single person of more than 9.8% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock and more than 9.8% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the issued and outstanding shares of our Series A preferred stock, and we also prohibit the ownership, actually or constructively, of any shares of our other preferred stock by any single person so that no such person, taking into account all of our stock so owned by such person, may own in excess of 9.8% of our issued and outstanding capital stock. We refer to this limitation as the ownership limit. Shares acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary. Any person who acquires shares in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any dividends on the shares or be entitled to vote the shares or receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the shares in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the shares or the amount realized from the sale. A transfer of shares in violation of the above limits may be void under certain circumstances. The ownership limit may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control and, therefore, could adversely affect our stockholders ability to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for the shares of our common stock in connection with such transaction. Our charter authorizes us to issue additional shares of common and preferred stock and to establish the preferences, rights and other terms of any series or class of preferred stock that we issue. Although our board of directors has no intention to do so at the present time, it could establish a series or class of preferred stock that could delay, defer, or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. 48 Our charter and bylaws and Maryland law also contain other provisions that may delay, defer, or prevent a transaction, including a change in control, that might involve payment of a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. Those provisions include the following: directors may be removed only for cause and only upon a two thirds vote of stockholders, together with bylaw provisions authorizing the board of directors to fill vacant directorships; a two thirds vote of stockholders for any amendment of the charter is required; the request of the holders of 50% or more of our common stock is necessary for stockholders to call a special meeting; stockholders may only take action by written consent with the unanimous approval of all stockholders entitled to vote on the matter in question; and advance notice by stockholders for the nomination of directors or proposal of business to be considered at a meeting of stockholders is required. These provisions may impede various actions by stockholders without approval of our board of directors, which in turn may delay, defer or prevent a transaction involving a change of control. Various Market Conditions Affect the Price of Our Stock. As with other publicly traded equity securities, the market price of our stock will depend upon various market conditions that may change from time to time. Among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our stock are the following: the extent of investor interest in us; the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate based companies); our financial performance; general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of our stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends; and terrorist activity may adversely affect the markets in which our securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending. Other factors such as governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws could also have a significant impact on the future market price of our stock. Earnings and Cash Dividends, Asset Value and Market Interest Rates Affect the Price of Our Stock. The market value of the equity securities of a real estate investment trust generally is based primarily upon the markets perception of the real estate investment trusts growth potential and its current and potential future earnings and cash dividends. It is based secondarily upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets. For that reason, shares of our stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share. To the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working capital reserves, or other purposes, these retained funds, while increasing the value of our underlying assets, may not correspondingly increase the market price of our stock. Our failure to meet the markets expectations with regard to future earnings and cash dividends likely would adversely affect the market price of our stock. Another factor that may influence the price of our stock will be the distribution yield on the stock (as a percentage of the price of the stock) relative to market interest rates. An increase in market interest rates might lead prospective purchasers of our stock to expect a higher distribution yield, which would adversely affect the market price of the stock. If the market price of our stock declines significantly, then we might 49 breach certain covenants with respect to debt obligations, which might adversely affect our liquidity and ability to make future acquisitions and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. If We Issue Additional Securities, then the Investment of Existing Stockholders Will Be Diluted. We have authority to issue shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities in exchange for property or otherwise. Similarly, we may cause the operating partnership to issue additional limited partnership units in exchange for property or otherwise. Existing stockholders will have no preemptive right to acquire any additional securities issued by us or the operating partnership and any issuance of additional equity securities could result in dilution of an existing stockholders investment. We Could Change Our Investment and Financing Policies without a Vote of Stockholders. Subject to our current investment policy to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust (unless a change is approved by our board of directors under certain circumstances), our board of directors will determine our investment and financing policies, our growth strategy and our debt, capitalization, distribution and operating policies. Although the board of directors has no present intention to revise or amend these strategies and policies, they may do so at any time without a vote of stockholders. Accordingly, stockholders will have no control over changes in our strategies and policies (other than through the election of directors), and any such changes may not serve the interests of all stockholders and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations, including our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. Shares Available for Future Sale Could Adversely Affect the Market Price of Our Common Stock. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of our common stock, or the availability of shares of our common stock for future sale, will have on its market price. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market (or upon exchange of limited partnership units in the operating partnership) or the perception that such sales (or exchanges) might occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. All shares of common stock issuable upon the redemption of limited partnership units in the operating partnership will be deemed to be restricted securities within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act and may not be transferred unless registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from registration is available, including any exemption from registration provided under Rule 144. In general, upon satisfaction of certain conditions, Rule 144 permits the holder to sell certain amounts of restricted securities one year following the date of acquisition of the restricted securities from us and, after two years, permits unlimited sales by persons unaffiliated with us. Commencing generally on the first anniversary of the date of acquisition of common limited partnership units (or such other date agreed to by the operating partnership and the holders of the units), the operating partnership may redeem common limited partnership units at the request of the holders for cash (based on the fair market value of an equivalent number of shares of common stock at the time of redemption) or, at the option of the operating partnership, exchange the common limited partnership units for an equal number of shares of our common stock, subject to certain antidilution adjustments. The operating partnership had issued and outstanding 4,846,387 common limited partnership units as of December 31, 2002. As of December 31, 2002, we had reserved 17,336,237 shares of common stock for issuance under our Stock Option and Incentive Plans (not including shares that we have already issued) and, as of December 31, 2002, we had granted to certain directors, officers and employees options to purchase 8,764,912 shares of common stock (excluding forfeitures and 896,152 shares that we have issued pursuant to the exercise of options). As of December 31, 2002, we had granted 717,611 restricted shares of common stock, excluding 36,200 shares that have been forfeited. In addition, we may issue additional shares of common stock and the operating partnership may issue additional limited partnership units in connection with the acquisition of properties. In connection with the issuance of common limited partnership units to other transferors of properties, and in connection with the issuance of the performance units, we have agreed to file registration statements covering the issuance of shares of common stock upon the exchange of the common limited partnership units. We have also filed registration statements with respect to the shares of common stock issuable under our stock option and incentive plans. These registration statements and registration rights 50 generally allow shares of common stock covered thereby, including shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of limited partnership units, including performance units, or the exercise of options or restricted shares of common stock, to be transferred or resold without restriction under the Securities Act. We may also agree to provide registration rights to any other person who may become an owner of the operating partnerships limited partnership units. Future sales of the shares of common stock described above could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The existence of the operating partnerships limited partnership units, options, and shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon exchange of limited partnership units, and the exercise of options and registration rights referred to above, also may adversely affect the terms upon which we are able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities. Item 7a. Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes: (1) interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings; and (2) our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2002, we had no interest rate caps or swaps. See Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources Market Capitalization. The table below summarizes the market risks associated with our fixed and variable rated debt outstanding before unamortized debt premiums of $9.8 million as of December 31, 2002: Expected Maturity 2003 2004 2005 2006 Date 2007 Thereafter Total Debt Fixed rate debt (1) $ 93,088 $ 98,490 $ 351,996 $ 167,804 $ 136,120 $ 1,171,945 $ 2,019,443 Average interest rate 7.8% 8.0% 7.3% 7.4% 7.4% 7.3% 7.4% Variable rate debt (2) $ 47,279 $ 30.504 $ 98,488 $ 8,593 $ 6,868 $ 14,368 $ 206,100 Average interest rate 2.8% 3.3% 2.1% 3.1% 3.1% 4.4% 2.7% (1) Represents 93.9% of all outstanding debt. (2) Represents 6.1% of all outstanding debt. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased by 10% (or approximately 27 basis points), then the increase in interest expense on the variable rate debt would be $0.6 million annually. As of December 31, 2002, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt was $2,152.6 million based on our estimate of current market interest rates. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations You should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements. Statements contained in this discussion that are not historical facts may be forward looking statements. Such statements relate to our future performance and plans, results of operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and operating improvements and costs. You can identify forward looking statements by the use of forward looking terminology such as believes, expects, may, will, should, seeks, approximately, intends, plans, pro forma, estimates or anticipates, or the negative of these words and phrases, or similar words or phrases. You can also identify forward looking statements by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. Forward looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties and you should not rely upon them as predictions of future events. There is no assurance that the events or circumstances reflected in forward looking statements will occur or be achieved. Forward looking statements are necessarily dependent on assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise and we may not be able to realize them. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward looking statements: defaults or non renewal of leases by customers; increased interest rates and operating costs; our failure to obtain necessary outside financing; difficulties in identifying properties to acquire and in effecting acquisitions; our failure to successfully integrate acquired properties and operations; our failure to divest of properties that we have contracted to sell or to timely reinvest proceeds from any such divestitures; risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including construction delays, cost overruns, our inability to obtain necessary permits and public opposition to these activities); our failure to qualify and maintain our status as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; environmental uncertainties; risks related to natural disasters; financial market fluctuations; changes in real estate and zoning laws; increases in real property tax rates; and risks of doing business internationally, including currency risks. Our success also depends upon economic trends generally, including interest rates, income tax laws, governmental regulation, legislation, population changes and those other risk factors discussed in the section entitled Business Risks in this report. We caution you not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements, which reflect our analysis only and speak as of the date of this report or as of the dates indicated in the statements. GENERAL We commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company in connection with the completion of our initial public offering on November 26, 1997, and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with our initial tax return for the year 21 ended December 31, 1997. AMB Property Corporation and the operating partnership were formed shortly before the consummation of our initial public offering. We generate revenue primarily from rent received from customers under long term operating leases at our properties, including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs and our private capital business. In addition, our growth is, in part, dependent on our ability to increase occupancy rates or increase rental rates at our properties and our ability to continue the acquisition and development of additional properties. Although the weak economy has decreased customer demand for new space and has limited or in some cases lowered rent growth, many types of investors are acquiring industrial real estate. In 2002, we capitalized on this opportunity by accelerating our portfolio repositioning program through the disposition of properties. Our income would be adversely affected if a significant number of customers were unable to pay rent or if we were unable to rent our industrial space on favorable terms. Certain significant expenditures associated with an investment in real estate (such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs) generally do not decline when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property. Moreover, as the general partner of the operating partnership, we generally will be liable for all of the operating partnerships unsatisfied obligations other than non recourse obligations, including the operating partnerships obligations as the general partner of the co investment joint ventures. Any such liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Investments in Real Estate. Investments in real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a property by property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable. Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying amount of the property. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future market conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying amount of our long lived assets could occur in the future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings. Rental Revenues. We record rental revenue from operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our bad debt reserves, security deposits and letters of credit, then we may have to recognize additional bad debt charges in future periods. Each period we review our outstanding accounts receivable, including straight line rents, for doubtful accounts and provide allowances as needed. Historically, our bad debt expense has been between 50 and 150 basis points of total revenues. 22 Consolidated Joint Ventures. Minority interests represent the limited partnership interests in the operating partnership and interests held by certain third parties in several real estate joint ventures, aggregating approximately 33.8 million square feet, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes. Such investments are consolidated because we own a majority interest or we exercise significant control over major operating decisions such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, investment activity and changes in financing. Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. We have non controlling limited partnership interests in four separate unconsolidated joint ventures. These investments are not consolidated because we do not exercise significant control over major operating decisions such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, investment activity and changes in financing. We account for the joint ventures using the equity method of accounting. Stock based Compensation Expense. In 2002, we adopted the expense recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. We value stock options issued using the Black Scholes option pricing model and recognize this value as an expense over the period in which the options vest. Under this standard, recognition of expense for stock options is retroactively applied to all options granted after the beginning of the year of adoption. Prior to 2002, we followed the intrinsic method set forth in APB Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. During 2002, we awarded 2.0 million stock options to employees. In accordance with SFAS No. 123, we will recognize the associated expense over the three to five year vesting periods. The expense is included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. REIT Compliance. We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1997. In order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we must derive at least 95% of our gross income in any year from qualifying sources. In addition, we must pay dividends to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis. It is our current intention to adhere to these requirements and maintain our REIT status. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on net income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. As such, no provision for federal income taxes has been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As a REIT, we still may be subject to certain state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, we will be required to pay federal and state income tax on the net taxable income, if any, from the activities conducted through our taxable REIT subsidiaries. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The analysis below includes changes attributable to acquisitions, development activity, divestitures and the changes resulting from properties that we owned during both the current and prior year reporting periods, excluding development properties prior to being stabilized (generally defined as 90% leased or 12 months after we receive a certificate of occupancy for the building). We refer to these properties as the same store properties. For the comparison between the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the same store industrial properties consisted of properties aggregating approximately 68.0 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2002 consisted of 43 buildings, aggregating approximately 5.4 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2001 consisted of 65 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.8 million square feet. In 2002, property divestitures consisted of 58 industrial buildings and two retail centers, aggregating approximately 5.7 million square feet. In 2001, property divestitures consisted of 24 industrial and two retail buildings, aggregating approximately 3.2 million square feet. Our future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition of additional properties and dispositions. Our future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical rates. While occupancy levels in our industrial portfolio were similar in 2002 and 2001, rents on lease renewals and rollovers were lower in 2002 as the general contraction in business activity nationwide caused a reduction 23 in demand for industrial warehouse facilities. This reduction in demand was evidenced by two significant factors: decreases in national industrial occupancy levels and negative net absorption of industrial facility space. Specifically, according to Torto Wheaton Research, at December 31, 2001, national industrial occupancy was 90.2%; by December 31, 2002, national occupancy fell to 88.8%. As reported by Torto Wheaton Research, national net absorption of industrial space (the change in the amount of square footage leased in existing and newly constructed industrial properties) was positive from 1989 through 2000. By contrast, Torto Wheaton Research reported that net absorption was negative by 152.0 million square feet in 2001 and 34.0 million square feet in 2002. These factors combined to reduce market rents for industrial properties by approximately 15% to 20% nationally from peak levels at the beginning of 2001. While the level of rental rate reduction varied by market, we strove to maintain high occupancy by pricing lease renewals and new leases with sensitivity to local market conditions.

Industrial same store occupancy was 94.6% at December 31, 2002, and 95.0% at December 31, 2001. Year to date, the same store rent decrease on industrial renewals and rollovers (cash basis) was (1.4%) on 13.8 million square feet leased. The increase in straight line rents was partially offset by write offs associated with lease terminations. In 2002, lease termination fees increased $9.5 million, net of straight line rent adjustments and lease cost and tenant improvement write downs, over 2001.

We carried a 9.5% mortgage note secured by the retail center that we sold in September 2000 in the principal amount of $74.0 million. 24 Property Operating Expenses and Real Estate Taxes (Exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 2002 2001 $ Change % Change Rental expenses $ 77.5 $ 64.5 $ 13.0 20.2 % Real estate taxes 68.4 63.3 5.1 8.1 % Property operating expenses $ 145.9 $ 127.8 $ 18.1 14.2 % Industrial: Same store $ 118.3 $ 112.6 $ 5.7 5.1 % 2001 acquisitions 11.0 3.9 7.1 182.1 % 2002 acquisitions 6.8 6.8 Developments 7.2 3.1 4.1 132.3 % Divestitures 6.7 10.0 (3.3 ) (33.0 )% Retail 6.3 8.6 (2.3 ) (26.7 )% Discontinued operations (10.4 ) (10.4 ) 0.0 Total $ 145.9 $ 127.8 $ 18.1 14.2 % The $5.7 million increase in same store properties operating expenses primarily relates to increases in real estate taxes of $1.2 million and insurance expenses of $3.7 million due to premium increases.

The secured debt issuances were primarily for our co investment joint ventures properties. The increase in depreciation expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the consolidation of AMB Investment Management, Inc. (predecessor in interest to AMB Capital Partners, LLC) and Headlands Realty Corporation on May 31, 2001. Prior to May 31, 2001, general and administrative expenses did not include expenses incurred by two unconsolidated preferred stock subsidiaries, Headlands Realty Corporation and AMB Investment Management, Inc. General and administrative expenses would have been $39.4 million had the subsidiaries been consolidated beginning January 1, 2001. The increase in general and administrative expenses was also due to increased stock based compensation expense, additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international expansion and income taxes for our taxable REIT subsidiaries. In 2001, we recognized $20.8 million of losses on investments in other companies, including our investment in Webvan Group, Inc. and other technology related companies. The loss reflects a 100% write down of the investments. No gains or losses were recognized in 2002. 25 For the Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 Rental Revenues 2001 2000 $ Change % Change (Dollars in millions) Same store $ 400.2 $ 376.7 $ 23.5 6.2 % 2000 acquisitions 97.1 25.6 71.5 279.3 % 2001 acquisitions 22.8 22.8 Developments 26.9 14.6 12.3 84.0 % Divestitures 10.9 37.1 (26.2 ) (70.6 )% Discontinued operations (38.0 ) (33.1 ) (4.9 ) 14.8 % Straight line rents 10.1 10.2 (0.1 ) (1.0 )% Total $ 530.0 $ 431.1 $ 98.9 22.9 % The growth in rental revenues in same store properties resulted primarily from the incremental effect of cash rental rate increases on renewals and rollovers, fixed rent increases on existing leases, and reimbursement of expenses, partially offset by lower average occupancies.

The secured debt issuances were primarily for our co investment joint ventures properties. The increase in depreciation expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased personnel and occupancy costs. In addition, the consolidation of AMB Investment Management, Inc. (predecessor in interest to AMB Capital Partners, LLC) and Headlands Realty Corporation on May 31, 2001, resulted in an increase in general and administrative expenses of $4.9 million. During 2001, we recognized $20.8 million of losses on investments in other companies, related to our investment in Webvan Group, Inc. and other technology related companies. The loss reflects a 100% write down of the book value of the investments. 27 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for acquisitions, development, expansion and renovation of properties will include: cash flow from operations; borrowings under our unsecured credit facility; other forms of secured or unsecured financing; proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the operating partnership (including issuances of limited partnership units in the operating partnership or its subsidiaries); net proceeds from divestitures of properties; and private capital from co investment partners. We believe that our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow from operations, borrowings available under our unsecured credit facility and our ability to access private and public debt and equity capital, are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. Capital Resources Property Divestitures. During 2002, we divested ourselves of 58 industrial buildings, two retail centers and an undeveloped retail land parcel for an aggregate price of $244.0 million, with a resulting net gain of $9.6 million. During 2002, we also completed and sold six buildings developed as part of our development for sale program for a net gain of $1.0 million. Properties Held for Divestiture. We have decided to divest ourselves of two retail centers, four industrial properties and two development properties, which are not in our core markets or which do not meet our current strategic objectives. The divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. As of December 31, 2002, the net carrying value of the properties held for divestiture was $107.9 million. Co investment Joint Ventures. We consolidate the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of our five co investment joint ventures. Our five co investment joint ventures are engaged in the acquisition, ownership, operation, management and, in some cases, the renovation, expansion and development of industrial buildings in target markets nationwide. We consolidate these joint ventures for financial reporting purposes because we are the sole managing general partner and, as a result, control all major operating decisions. Third party equity interests in the joint ventures are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2002, we owned approximately 28.2 million square feet of our properties through these five co investment joint ventures and 5.6 million square feet of our properties through our other consolidated joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. During 2002, we sold $76.9 million in operating properties, consisting of 15 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 1.9 million square feet, to one of our co investment joint ventures, AMB SGP, L.P. We recognized a gain of $3.3 million related to this sale, representing the portion of the sold properties acquired by the third party co investor. We also sold 30% of our interest in AMB Partners II, L.P. to our co investment joint venture partner, we now own 20% of AMB Partners II, L.P. We recognized a gain of $6.3 million related to this sale. 28 Our co investment joint ventures at December 31, 2002 (dollars in thousands): Companys Approximate Ownership Total Planned Co investment Joint Venture Joint Venture Partner Percentage Capitalization(1) AMB/ Erie, L.P.

(5) In November 2002, our partner increased its ownership in AMB Partners II, L.P. from 50% to 80% by acquiring 30% of our partnership interest. We recognized a gain of $6.3 million. Equity. We have authorized for issuance 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which the following series were designated as of December 31, 2002: 4,600,000 shares of Series A preferred; 1,300,000 shares of Series B preferred; 1,595,337 shares of Series D preferred; 220,440 shares of Series E preferred; 267,439 shares of Series F preferred; 840,000 shares of Series H preferred; 510,000 shares of Series I preferred; 800,000 shares of Series J preferred; and 800,000 shares of Series K preferred. On July 31, 2002, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, repurchased 130,000 7.95% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units and all 20,000 of its outstanding 7.95% Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units from a single institutional investor. We redeemed the units for an aggregate cost of $7.1 million, including accrued and unpaid dividends and a redemption discount of $0.4 million. On April 17, 2002, the operating partnership issued and sold 800,000 7.95% Series K Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units at a price of $50.00 per unit in a private placement. Distributions are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable quarterly in arrears. The Series K Preferred Units are redeemable by the operating partnership on or after April 17, 2007, subject to certain conditions, for cash at a redemption price equal to $50.00 per unit, plus accumulated and unpaid distributions thereon, if any, to the redemption date. The Series K Preferred Units are exchangeable at specified times and subject to certain conditions, on a one for one basis, for shares of our Series K Preferred Stock. The operating partnership used the net proceeds of $39.0 million for general corporate purposes, which included the partial repayment of indebtedness and the acquisition and development of additional properties. During 2002, we redeemed 122,640 common limited partnership units of the operating partnership for shares of our common stock. In December 2001, our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $100.0 million worth of our common and preferred stock. In December 2002, our board of directors increased the repurchase program to $200.0 million. The current stock repurchase program expires in December 2003 and as of December 31, 2002, $130.6 million of repurchase capacity remained under our current stock repurchase program. During 2002, we repurchased 2,651,600 shares of our common stock for $69.4 million, including commissions. In July 2002, we also repurchased 4,200 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock for an aggregate cost of $0.1 million, including accrued and unpaid dividends. 29 Debt. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, we presently intend to operate with a debt to total market capitalization ratio (our share) of approximately 45% or less. As of December 31, 2002, our share of total debt to total market capitalization ratio was 37.7%. Additionally, we currently intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. In spite of these policies, our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our board of directors could alter or eliminate these policies or circumstances could arise that could render us unable to comply with these policies. As of December 31, 2002, the aggregate principal amount of our secured debt was $1.3 billion, excluding unamortized debt premiums of $9.8 million. Of the $1.3 billion of secured debt, $0.9 billion is secured by properties in our joint ventures. The secured debt is generally non recourse and bears interest at rates varying from 3.0% to 10.4% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 7.3%) and final maturity dates ranging from January 2003 to June 2023. All of the secured debt bears interest at fixed rates, except for seven loans with an aggregate principal amount of $65.6 million as of December 31, 2002, which bear interest at variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 3.5% as of December 31, 2002). Over time, we intend to repay the secured debt on our 100% owned assets and may prepay if market conditions warrant. In May 2002, the operating partnership commenced a medium term note program for the issuance of up to $400.0 million in principal amount of medium term notes, which will be guaranteed by us. As of December 31, 2002, the operating partnership had issued no medium term notes under this program. In August 2000, the operating partnership commenced a medium term note program for the issuance of up to $400.0 million in principal amount of medium term notes, which are guaranteed by us. On January 14, 2002, the operating partnership completed the program when it issued and sold the remaining $20.0 million of the notes to Lehman Brothers, Inc., as principal. We have guaranteed the notes, which mature on January 17, 2007, and bear interest at 5.90% per annum. The operating partnership used the net proceeds of $19.9 million for general corporate purposes, to partially repay indebtedness and to acquire and develop additional properties. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to its senior debt securities. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then our cash flow may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Credit Facilities. In December 2002, the operating partnership renewed its $500.0 million unsecured revolving line of credit. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations under the credit facility. The credit facility matures in December 2005, has a one year extension option and is currently subject to a 20 basis point annual facility fee. Borrowings under our credit facility currently bear interest at LIBOR plus 60 basis points. Both the facility fee and the interest rate are based on our credit rating, which is currently investment grade. However, if our credit rating falls below investment grade, then our facility fee and interest rate may increase. The credit facility includes a multi currency component under which up to $150.0 million may be drawn in either British pounds sterling, euros or yen, provided that such currency is readily available and freely transferable and convertible to U.S. dollars. The Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service reports LIBOR for such currency in interest periods of 1, 2, 3 or 6 months. The operating partnership has the ability to increase available borrowings to $700.0 million by adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their commitments. We use our unsecured credit facility principally for acquisitions and for general working capital requirements. Monthly debt service payments on our credit facility are interest only. The total amount available under our credit facility fluctuates based upon the borrowing base, as defined in the agreement governing the credit facility, generally the value of our unencumbered properties. As of December 31, 2002, the outstanding balance on our unsecured credit facility was $95.0 million and the 30 remaining amount available was $379.0 million, net of outstanding letters of credit (excluding the $200.0 million of potential additional capacity). In July 2001, AMB Institutional Alliance Fund II, L.P. obtained a $150.0 million credit facility secured by the unfunded capital commitments of the investors in AMB Institutional Alliance REIT II, Inc. and AMB Institutional Alliance Fund II, L.P. Borrowings currently bear interest at LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points. As of December 31, 2002, the outstanding balance was $45.5 million and the remaining amount available was $31.2 million, net of outstanding letters of credit and capital contributions from third party investors. Mortgage Receivables. In September 2000, we sold a retail center located in Southern California. We carried a 9.5% mortgage note secured by the retail center in the principal amount of $74.0 million, due September 30, 2002. On July 3, 2002, we received a full repayment of the mortgage. Through a wholly owned subsidiary, we also hold a mortgage loan receivable on AMB Pier One, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture. The note bears interest at 13.0% and matures in May 2026. As of December 31, 2002, the outstanding balance on the note was $13.1 million. 31 The tables below summarize our debt maturities and capitalization as of December 31, 2002 (dollars in thousands): DEBT Company Joint Unsecured Secured Venture Senior Debt Unsecured Credit Debt Debt Securities Debt Facilities Total Debt 2003 $ 74,631 $ 19,678 $ $ 558 $ 45,500 $ 140,367 2004 63,465 64,928 601 128,994 2005 45,511 59,326 250,000 647 95,000 450,484 2006 85,023 65,676 25,000 698 176,397 2007 24,073 43,163 75,000 752 142,988 2008 32,669 154,684 175,000 810 363,163 2009 4,147 76,826 873 81,846 2010 50,948 105,854 75,000 941 232,743 2011 409 179,295 75,000 1,014 255,718 2012 407 101,399 1,092 102,898 Thereafter 481 22,264 125,000 2,200 149,945 Subtotal 381,764 893,093 800,000 10,186 140,500 2,225,543 Unamortized premiums 7,835 1,983 9,818 Total consolidated debt 389,599 895,076 800,000 10,186 140,500 2,235,361 Our share of unconsolidated joint venture debt(1) 39,288 39,288 Total debt 389,599 934,364 800,000 10,186 140,500 2,274,649 Joint venture partners share of consolidated joint venture debt (546,509 ) (36,400 ) (582,909 ) Our share of total debt $ 389,599 $ 387,855 $ 800,000 $ 10,186 $ 104,100 $ 1,691,740 Weighed average interest rate 8.1 % 7.0 % 7.2 % 7.5 % 2.1 % 7.0 % Weighed average maturity (in years) 3.7 7.1 6.5 11.8 2.2 6.0 (1) The weighted average interest and maturity for the unconsolidated joint venture debt were 6.4% and 6.6 years, respectively. 32 MARKET EQUITY Shares/Units Security Outstanding Market Price Market Value Common stock 82,029,449 $ 27.36 $ 2,244,326 Common limited partnership units 4,846,387 27.36 132,597 Total 86,875,836 $ 2,376,923 PREFERRED STOCK AND UNITS Dividend Liquidation Redemption Security Rate Preference Provisions Series A preferred stock 8.50 % $ 99,895 July 2003 Series B preferred units 8.63 % 65,000 November 2003 Series D preferred units 7.75 % 79,767 May 2004 Series E preferred units 7.75 % 11,022 August 2004 Series F preferred units 7.95 % 13,372 March 2005 Series H preferred units 8.13 % 42,000 September 2005 Series I preferred units 8.00 % 25,500 March 2006 Series J preferred units 7.95 % 40,000 September 2006 Series K preferred units 7.95 % 40,000 April 2007 Weighted average/total 8.17 % $ 416,556 CAPITALIZATION RATIOS Total debt to total market capitalization 44.9 % Our share of total debt to total market capitalization 37.7 % Total debt plus preferred to total market capitalization 53.1 % Our share of total debt plus preferred to total market capitalization 47.0 % Our share of total debt to total book capitalization 45.9 % Liquidity As of December 31, 2002, we had $117.2 million in cash, restricted cash and cash equivalents, and $379.0 million of additional available borrowings under our credit facility. We also had $31.2 million of additional available borrowings under our AMB Institutional Alliance Fund II, L.P. credit facility. To fund acquisitions, development activities and capital expenditures, and to provide for general working capital requirements, we intend to use: cash flow from operations; borrowings under our unsecured credit facility; other forms of secured and unsecured financing; proceeds from any future debt or equity offerings by us or the operating partnership (including issuances of limited partnership units in the operating partnership or its subsidiaries); net proceeds from divestitures of properties; and private capital from our co investment partners. The unavailability of capital would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. 33 Our board of directors declared a regular cash dividend for the quarter ending December 31, 2002, of $0.41 per share of common stock and the operating partnership declared a regular cash distribution for the quarter ending December 31, 2002, of $0.41 per common unit. The dividends and distributions were payable on January 6, 2003, to stockholders and unitholders of record on December 20, 2002.

Series C preferred units n/a $ 3.88 $ 4.38 AMB Property II, L.P. Series D preferred units $ 3.88 $ 3.88 $ 3.88 AMB Property II, L.P. Series E preferred units $ 3.88 $ 3.88 $ 3.88 AMB Property II, L.P. Series F preferred units(1) $ 3.34 $ 3.98 $ 3.09 AMB Property II, L.P.

Series I preferred units $ 4.00 $ 3.04 n/a (1) On July 31, 2002, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, repurchased 130,000 of its 7.95% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units and all 20,000 of its outstanding 7.95% Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units from a single institutional investor. On July, 31, 2002, AMB Property II, L.P. paid a distribution, which accrued during the period from July 15, 2002 to July 31, 2002, of $0.155 per unit on the 130,000 Series F preferred units that were redeemed. The anticipated size of our distributions, using only cash from operations, will not allow us to retire all of our debt as it comes due. Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Commitments Developments. In addition to recurring capital expenditures, which consist of building improvements and leasing costs incurred to renew or re tenant space, as of December 31, 2002, we are developing ten projects representing a total estimated investment of $106.8 million upon completion and three development projects available for sale representing a total estimated investment of $49.1 million upon completion. Of this total, $92.8 million had been funded as of December 31, 2002, and an estimated $63.1 million is required to complete current and planned projects. We expect to fund these expenditures with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facility, debt or equity issuances and net proceeds from property divestitures, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow. Acquisitions. During 2002, we invested $403.3 million in 43 operating industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 5.4 million rentable square feet, and a parking lot adjacent to Los Angeles International 34 Airport. We funded these acquisitions and initiated development and renovation projects through private capital contributions, borrowings under our credit facility, cash, debt issuances and net proceeds from property divestitures. Lease Commitments. We have entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily on tarmac facilities, and office space with remaining lease terms from one to 38 years. Future minimum rental payments required under non cancelable operating leases in effect as of December 31, 2002, were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2003 $ 19,921 2004 19,753 2005 19,819 2006 20,553 2007 20,772 Thereafter 283,574 Total lease commitments $ 384,392 These operating lease payments are being amortized ratably over the terms of the related leases. Captive Insurance Company. We have responded to recent trends towards increasing costs and decreasing coverage availability in the insurance markets by obtaining higher deductible property insurance from third party insurers and by forming a wholly owned captive insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., in December 2001. Arcata National Insurance Ltd. provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the increased deductible under the third party policies. We capitalized Arcata National Insurance Ltd. in accordance with regulatory requirements. Arcata National Insurance Ltd. established annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss experience of our properties. Annually, we engage an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims and projected expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata National Insurance Ltd. may be adjusted based on this estimate. Premiums paid to Arcata National Insurance Ltd. have a retrospective component, so that if expenses, including losses, are less than premiums collected, the excess will be returned to the property owners (and, in turn, as appropriate, to the customers) and conversely, subject to certain limitations, if expenses, including losses, are greater than premiums collected, an additional premium will be charged. As with all recoverable expenses, differences between estimated and actual insurance premiums will be recognized in the subsequent year. Through this structure, we believe that we have been able to obtain insurance for our portfolio with more comprehensive coverage at a projected overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market. Potential Unknown Liabilities. Unknown liabilities may include the following: liabilities for clean up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to our formation transactions that had not been asserted prior to our formation transactions; accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; tax liabilities; and claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these entities. 35 Overview of Contractual Obligations The following tables summarizes our debt and lease commitments as of December 31, 2002 (dollars in thousands): Less than More than 5 Contractual Obligations 1 Year 13 Years 35 Years Years Total Debt $ 140,367 $ 579,478 $ 319,385 $ 1,186,313 $ 2,225,543 Lease commitments 19,921 39,572 41,325 283,574 384,392 Total contractual obligations $ 160,288 $ 619,050 $ 360,710 $ 1,469,887 $ 2,609,935 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have no off balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations, guarantees or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Supplemental Earning Measure We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP , is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, the real estate industry has adopted a supplemental earnings measure, funds from operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), that is widely used by investors and analysts. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and it should not be considered as an alternative to those indicators in evaluating liquidity or operating performance. Further, FFO as disclosed by other real estate investment trusts may not be comparable. FFO is defined as income from operations before minority interest plus real estate depreciation, discontinued operations FFO and adjustments to derive our pro rata share of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures, less minority interests pro rata share of FFO of consolidated joint ventures and perpetual preferred stock dividends. In accordance with the NAREIT White Paper on FFO, we include the effects of straight line rents in FFO. Further, we do not adjust FFO to eliminate the effects of non recurring charges. 36 The following table reflects the calculation of FFO for the years ended December 31, (dollars in thousands): 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 Net income $ 116,153 $ 125,053 $ 113,282 $ 167,603 $ 108,954 Minority interests 37,806 34,835 20,323 14,486 9,350 Gains from dispositions of real estate, net of minority interests (7,789 ) (23,259 ) (1,144 ) (51,263 ) Gains from dispositions of real estate, discontinued operations (11,372 ) Preferred unit redemption discount/(premium) (412 ) 4,400 Real estate related depreciation and amortization: Total depreciation and amortization 127,160 104,838 84,960 63,747 55,210 Discontinued operations depreciation 7,529 6,600 5,398 3,758 2,254 Furniture, fixtures and equipment depreciation and ground lease amortization(1) (2,450 ) (1,963 ) (1,114 ) (1,002 ) (463 ) FFO attributable to minority interests (52,051 ) (40,144 ) (15,030 ) (8,158 ) (5,887 ) Adjustments to derive FFO in unconsolidated joint ventures: Our share of net income (5,674 ) (5,467 ) (5,212 ) (4,701 ) (1,750 ) Our share of FFO 8,728 8,014 7,188 6,677 2,739 Funds from operations $ 217,628 $ 212,907 $ 208,651 $ 191,147 $ 170,407 (1) Ground lease amortization represents the amortization of our investments in ground lease properties, for which we do not have a purchase option.

These risks include, among others: General Real Estate Risks There are Factors Outside of Our Control that Affect the Performance and Value of Our Properties. Real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk. The yields available from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of income earned and capital appreciation generated by the related properties as well as the expenses incurred in connection with the properties. If our properties do not generate income sufficient to meet operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, then our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders could be adversely affected. Income from, and the value of, our properties may be adversely affected by the general economic climate, local conditions, such as oversupply of industrial space or a reduction in demand for industrial space, the attractiveness of our properties to potential customers, competition from other properties, our ability to provide adequate maintenance and insurance and an increase in operating costs. Periods of economic slowdown or recession in the United States and in other countries, rising interest rates or declining demand for real estate, or public perception that any of these events may occur, would result in a general decrease in rents or an increased occurrence of defaults under existing leases, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our properties are currently concentrated predominantly in the industrial real estate sector. Our concentration in a certain property type exposes us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our portfolio also included other property types. As a result of such concentration, economic downturns in the industrial real estate sector could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. In addition, revenues from properties and real estate values are also affected by factors such as the cost of compliance with regulations, the potential for liability under applicable laws (including changes in tax laws), interest rate levels and the availability of financing. Our income would be adversely affected if a significant number of customers were unable to pay rent or if we were unable to rent our industrial space on favorable terms. Certain significant expenditures associated with an investment in real estate (such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes, and maintenance costs) generally do not decline when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property. Future terrorist attacks in the United States may result in declining economic activity, which could harm the demand for and the value of our properties. To the extent that our customers are impacted by future attacks, their businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to honor their existing leases. We May Be Unable to Renew Leases or Relet Space as Leases Expire. We are subject to the risks that leases may not be renewed, space may not be relet, or the terms of renewal or reletting (including the cost of required renovations) may be less favorable than current lease terms. Leases on a total of 15.4% of our industrial properties (based on annualized base rent) as of December 31, 2002, will expire on or prior to December 31, 2003. In addition, numerous properties compete with our properties in attracting customers to lease space, particularly with respect to retail centers. The number of competitive commercial properties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space in our properties and on the rents that we are able to charge. Our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected if we are unable to promptly relet or renew the leases for all or a substantial portion of expiring leases, if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting is significantly lower than expected, or if our reserves for these purposes prove inadequate. Real Estate Investments are Illiquid. Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions is limited. The limitations in the Internal Revenue Code and related 38 regulations on a real estate investment trust holding property for sale may affect our ability to sell properties without adversely affecting dividends to our stockholders. The relative illiquidity of our holdings and Internal Revenue Code prohibitions and related regulations could impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our investments and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. A Significant Number of Our Properties are Located in California. Our industrial properties located in California as of December 31, 2002, represented 28.4% of the aggregate square footage of our industrial operating properties as of December 31, 2002, and 33.9% of our industrial annualized base rent. Annualized base rent means the monthly contractual amount under existing leases as of December 31, 2002, multiplied by 12. This amount excludes expense reimbursements and rental abatements. Our revenue from, and the value of, our properties located in California may be affected by a number of factors, including local real estate conditions (such as oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties) and the local economic climate. Business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns, changing demographics, and other factors may adversely impact the local economic climate. A downturn in Californias economy, fiscal situation or real estate conditions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Certain of our properties are also subject to possible loss from seismic activity. See Some Potential Losses are not Covered by Insurance. Some Potential Losses are not Covered by Insurance. We carry commercial liability, property and rental loss insurance covering all properties owned and managed by us, with policy specifications and insured limits that we believe are adequate and appropriate under the circumstances given relative risks, the cost of such coverage and industry practice. Certain losses such as losses due to terrorism, windstorms, floods or seismic activity may be insured subject to certain limitations, including large deductibles or co payments and policy limits. Although we have obtained coverage for certain acts of terrorism, with policy specifications and insured limits that we believe are commercially reasonable, it is not certain that we will be able to renew coverage or collect under such policies. From time to time, we evaluate the amount of earthquake coverage that we carry for all properties owned and managed by us, to assess whether, in our good faith discretion, the coverage is adequate. We may incur material losses in excess of insurance proceeds and we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance at commercially reasonable rates. In addition, there are certain losses that are not generally insured because it is not economically feasible to insure against them, including losses due to riots or acts of war. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties, then we could lose the capital we invested in the properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the properties and, in the case of debt, which is with recourse to us, we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties. Moreover, as the general partner of the operating partnership, we generally will be liable for all of the operating partnerships unsatisfied obligations other than non recourse obligations, including any obligations incurred by the operating partnership as the general partner of the co investment joint ventures. Any such liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. A number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to earthquake activity, including California where, as of December 31, 2002, 295 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 23.9 million square feet (representing 28.4% of our industrial operating properties based on aggregate square footage and 33.9% based on industrial annualized base rent), are located. We carry replacement cost earthquake insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable. This insurance coverage also applies to the properties managed by AMB Capital Partners, LLC, with a single aggregate policy limit and deductible applicable to those properties and our properties. Through an annual analysis prepared by outside consultants, we evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage in light of current industry practice and determine the appropriate amount of earthquake insurance to carry, which we believe is commercially 39 reasonable. We may incur material losses in excess of insurance proceeds and we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance at commercially reasonable rates. We are Subject to Risks and Liabilities In Connection With Properties Owned Through Joint Ventures, Limited Liability Companies and Partnerships. As of December 31, 2002, we had ownership interests in several joint ventures, limited liability companies or partnerships with third parties, as well as interests in three unconsolidated entities. As of December 31, 2002, we owned approximately 33.7 million square feet (excluding three unconsolidated joint ventures) of our properties through these entities. We may make additional investments through these ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. Such partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions. Partnership, limited liability company or joint venture investments may involve risks such as the following: our partners, co members or joint venturers might become bankrupt (in which event we and any other remaining general partners, members, or joint venturers would generally remain liable for the liabilities of the partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture); our partners, co members or joint venturers might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals; our partners, co members or joint venturers may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions, requests, policies, or objectives, including our current policy with respect to maintaining our qualification as a real estate investment trust; and agreements governing joint ventures, limited liability companies and partnerships often contain restrictions on the transfer of a joint venturers, members or partners interest or buy sell or other provisions that may result in a purchase or sale of the interest at a disadvantageous time or on disadvantageous terms. We will, however, generally seek to maintain sufficient control of our partnerships, limited liability companies, and joint ventures to permit us to achieve our business objectives. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in partnerships, limited liability companies or joint ventures. The occurrence of one or more of the events described above could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We May be Unable to Consummate Acquisitions on Advantageous Terms or Acquisitions May Not Perform As We Expect. We intend to continue to acquire primarily industrial properties. The acquisition of and investment in properties entails various risks. In addition to the general investment risks associated with any real estate investment, our investments may not perform in accordance with our expectations or our cost estimates for bringing an acquired property up to market standards may prove inaccurate. Further, we may not be able to acquire additional properties on acceptable terms. We anticipate significant competition for attractive investment opportunities from other major real estate investors with significant capital including both publicly traded real estate investment trusts and private institutional investment funds. In addition, we expect to finance future acquisitions through a combination of borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the operating partnership (including issuances of limited partnership units by the operating partnership or its subsidiaries) and proceeds from property divestitures, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow. Our inability to finance future acquisitions on favorable terms, the failure of acquisitions to conform with our expectations or investment criteria, or our failure to timely reinvest the proceeds from property divestitures could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. 40 We May be Unable to Complete Divestitures on Advantageous Terms. We have decided to divest ourselves of retail centers and industrial properties that are not in our core markets or which do not meet our strategic objectives. The divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. Our ability to dispose of properties on advantageous terms is dependent upon factors beyond our control, including competition from other owners (including other real estate investment trusts) that are attempting to dispose of industrial and retail properties and the availability of attractive financing for potential buyers of our properties. Our inability to dispose of properties on favorable terms or redeploy the proceeds of property divestitures in accordance with our investment strategy could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We May be Unable to Complete Renovation and Development Projects on Advantageous Terms. The real estate development business, including the renovation and rehabilitation of existing properties, involves significant risks that include the following: we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms for development projects and we may not complete construction on schedule or within budget, resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs and delays in leasing such properties and generating cash flow; we may not be able to obtain, or we may experience delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations; new or renovated properties may perform below anticipated levels, producing cash flow below budgeted amounts; substantial renovation as well as new development activities, regardless of their ultimate success, typically require a substantial portion of managements time and attention, diverting our attention from our day to day operations; and upon completion of construction, we may not be able to obtain permanent financing, or obtain permanent financing on advantageous terms, for activities that we have financed through construction loans. These risks could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Debt Financing We Could Incur More Debt. It is our policy to incur debt, either directly or through our subsidiaries, only if it will not cause our share of debt to total market capitalization ratio to exceed approximately 45%. The aggregate amount of indebtedness that we may incur under our policy varies directly with the valuation of our capital stock and the number of shares of capital stock outstanding. Accordingly, we would be able to incur additional indebtedness under our policy as a result of increases in the market price per share of our common stock or other outstanding classes of capital stock, and future issuance of shares of our capital stock. However, our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our board of directors could alter or eliminate this policy. If we change this policy, then we could become more highly leveraged, resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Scheduled Debt Payments Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition. We are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing, including that cash flow will be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders, that we will be unable to refinance existing indebtedness on our properties (which in all cases will not have been fully amortized at maturity), and that the terms of 41 refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness. As of December 31, 2002, we had total debt outstanding of $2.2 billion. In addition, we guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to the senior debt securities referenced in our financial statements. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds of other capital transactions, then we expect that our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repay all such maturing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. In addition, if we mortgage one or more of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments, then the property could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income and asset value. A foreclosure on one or more of our properties could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Rising Interest Rates Could Adversely Affect Our Cash Flow. As of December 31, 2002, we had $45.5 million outstanding under our Alliance Fund II secured credit facility, $95.0 million outstanding on our unsecured credit facility, and we had seven secured loans with an aggregate principal amount of $65.6 million that bear interest at variable rates (with weighted average interest rate of 3.5% as of December 31, 2002). In addition, we may incur other variable rate indebtedness in the future. Increases in interest rates on this indebtedness could increase our interest expense, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Accordingly, in the future, we may engage in transactions to limit our exposure to rising interest rates. We Are Dependent on External Sources of Capital. In order to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code, we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain) and we are subject to tax on our income to the extent it is not distributed. Because of this distribution requirement, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs, including capital needs in connection with acquisitions, from cash retained from operations. As a result, to fund capital needs we rely on third party sources of capital, which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms or at all. Our access to third party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors, including: general market conditions; the markets perception of our growth potential; our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; and the market price of our capital stock. Additional debt financing may substantially increase our debt to total capitalization ratio. We Could Default on Cross Collateralized and Cross Defaulted Debt. As of December 31, 2002, we had 26 non recourse secured loans that are cross collateralized by 60 properties, totaling $711.7 million (not including unamortized debt premium). If we default on any of these loans, then we could be required to repay the aggregate of all indebtedness, together with applicable prepayment charges, to avoid foreclosure on all the cross collateralized properties within the applicable pool. Foreclosure on our properties, or our inability to refinance our loans on favorable terms, could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. In addition, our credit facilities and senior debt securities contain certain cross default 42 provisions, which are triggered in the event that our other material indebtedness is in default. These cross default provisions may require us to repay or restructure the credit facilities and the senior debt securities in addition to any mortgage or other debt that is in default, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Contingent or Unknown Liabilities Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition. Our predecessors have been in existence for varying lengths of time up to 19 years. At the time of our formation we acquired the assets of these entities subject to all of their potential existing liabilities. There may be current liabilities or future liabilities arising from prior activities that we are not aware of and therefore have not disclosed in this report. We assumed these liabilities as the surviving entity in the various merger and contribution transactions that occurred at the time of our formation. Existing liabilities for indebtedness generally were taken into account in connection with the allocation of the operating partnerships limited partnership units or shares of our common stock in the formation transactions, but no other liabilities were taken into account for these purposes. We do not have recourse against our predecessors or any of their respective stockholders or partners or against any individual account investors with respect to any unknown liabilities. Unknown liabilities might include the following: liabilities for clean up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; claims of customers, vendors, or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to the formation transactions that had not been asserted prior to the formation transactions; accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; tax liabilities; and claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these entities. Certain customers may claim that the formation transactions gave rise to a right to purchase the premises that they occupy. We do not believe any such claims would be material and, to date, no such claims have been filed. See Government Regulations We Could Encounter Costly Environmental Problems below regarding the possibility of undisclosed environmental conditions potentially affecting the value of our properties. Undisclosed material liabilities in connection with the acquisition of properties, entities and interests in properties, or entities could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Conflicts of Interest Some of Our Directors and Executive Officers are Involved in Other Real Estate Activities and Investments. Some of our executive officers own interests in real estate related businesses and investments. These interests include minority ownership interests in Institutional Housing Partners, L.P., a residential housing finance company (Messrs. Burke and Moghadam) and Aspire Development, Inc. and Aspire Development, L.P., developers of properties not within our investment criteria (Messrs. Belmonte, Burke and Moghadam). The continued involvement in other real estate related activities by some of our executive officers and directors could divert managements attention from our day to day operations. Our executive officers have entered into non competition agreements with us pursuant to which they have agreed not to engage in any activities, directly or indirectly, in respect of commercial real estate, and not to make any investment in respect of any industrial or retail real estate, other than through ownership of not more than 5% of the outstanding shares of a public company engaged in such activities or through the existing investments referred to in this report. State law may limit our ability to enforce these agreements. 43 Certain of Our Executive Officers and Directors May Have Conflicts of Interest with Us in Connection with Other Properties that They Own or Control. As of December 31, 2002, Aspire Development, L.P. owned interests in several retail development projects in the U.S., which are individually less than 10,000 feet. In addition, Messrs. Moghadam and Burke, each a founder and director, own less than 1% interests in two partnerships that own office buildings in various markets; these interests have negligible value. Luis A. Belmonte, an executive officer, owns less than a 10% interest, representing an estimated value of $150,000, in a limited partnership, which owns an office building located in Oakland, California. In addition, several of our executive officers individually own: less than 1% interests in the stocks of certain publicly traded real estate investment trusts; certain interests in and rights to developed and undeveloped real property located outside the United States; and certain other de minimus holdings in equity securities of real estate companies. Thomas W. Tusher, a member of our board of directors and chair of the boards compensation committee, is a limited partner in a venture in which Messrs. Moghadam and Burke are two of three members in the controlling general partner. The venture owns an office building. Mr. Tusher owns a 20% interest in the venture and Messrs. Moghadam and Burke each have a 26.7% interest in the venture. These interests in the venture have negligible value. The venture was formed in 1985, prior to the time of our initial public offering, and we continue to act as property and asset manager of the office building, for which services the venture pays us a fee. In our capacity as property and asset manager, we oversee the management and operation of the property, including the obtaining of financing and negotiating with third party lenders in connection therewith. The largest tenant, which occupies 68% of the building, filed for bankruptcy in January 2003. We believe that the properties and activities set forth above generally do not directly compete with any of our properties. However, it is possible that a property in which an executive officer or director, or an affiliate of an executive officer or director, has an interest may compete with us in the future if we were to invest in a property similar in type and in close proximity to that property. In addition, the continued involvement by our executive officers and directors in these properties could divert managements attention from our day to day operations. Our policy prohibits us from acquiring any properties from our executive officers or their affiliates without the approval of the disinterested members of our board of directors with respect to that transaction. Our Role as General Partner of the Operating Partnership May Conflict with the Interests of Stockholders. As the general partner of the operating partnership, we have fiduciary obligations to the operating partnerships limited partners, the discharge of which may conflict with the interests of our stockholders. In addition, those persons holding limited partnership units will have the right to vote as a class on certain amendments to the partnership agreement of the operating partnership and individually to approve certain amendments that would adversely affect their rights. The limited partners may exercise these voting rights in a manner that conflicts with the interests of our stockholders. In addition, under the terms of the operating partnerships partnership agreement, holders of limited partnership units will have certain approval rights with respect to certain transactions that affect all stockholders but which they may not exercise in a manner that reflects the interests of all stockholders. Our Directors, Executive Officers, and Significant Stockholders Could Act in a Manner that is Not in the Best Interest of All Stockholders. As of December 31, 2002, our two largest stockholders, Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Inc. (with respect to various client accounts for which Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Inc. serves as investment advisor) and ABP Investments U.S. (with respect to various client accounts for which ABP Investments U.S. serves as investment advisor) together beneficially owned 10.8% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, our executive officers and directors beneficially owned 4.3% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2002, and will have influence on our management and operation and, as 44 stockholders, will have influence on the outcome of any matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. This influence might be exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with the interests of other stockholders. Although there is no understanding or arrangement for these directors, officers, and stockholders and their affiliates to act in concert, these parties would be in a position to exercise significant influence over our affairs if they choose to do so. Government Regulations Many laws and governmental regulations are applicable to our properties and changes in these laws and regulations, or their interpretation by agencies and the courts, occur frequently. We May Incur Costs to Comply with Americans with Disabilities Act. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, places of public accommodation must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act might require us to remove structural barriers to handicapped access in certain public areas where such removal is readily achievable. If we fail to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, then we might be required to pay fines to the government or damages to private litigants. The impact of application of the Americans with Disabilities Act to our properties, including the extent and timing of required renovations, is uncertain. If we are required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, then our cash flow and the amounts available for dividends to our stockholders may be adversely affected. We Could Encounter Environmental Problems. Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment impose liability on a current or previous owner or operator of real estate for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at the property. A current or previous owner may be required to investigate and clean up contamination at or migrating from a site. These laws typically impose liability and clean up responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean up costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury, property damage, or other costs, including investigation and clean up costs, resulting from environmental contamination present at or emanating from that site. Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos. These laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, that they adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failing to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers. Some of our properties may contain asbestos containing building materials. Some of our properties are leased or have been leased, in part, to owners and operators of businesses that use, store, or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. These operations create a potential for the release of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. Some of our properties are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, certain of our properties are on, are adjacent to, or are near other properties upon which others, including former owners or customers of the properties, have engaged or may in the future engage in activities that may release petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. From time to time, we may acquire properties, or interests in properties, with known adverse environmental conditions where we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and the acquisition will yield a superior risk adjusted return. Environmental issues for each 45 property are evaluated and quantified prior to acquisition. The costs of environmental investigation, clean up and monitoring are underwritten into the cost of the acquisition and appropriate environmental insurance is obtained for the property. In connection with certain divested properties, we have agreed to remain responsible for, and to bear the cost of, remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties. All of our properties were subject to a Phase I or similar environmental assessments by independent environmental consultants at the time of acquisition. Phase I assessments are intended to discover and evaluate information regarding the environmental condition of the surveyed property and surrounding properties and include an historical review, a public records review, an investigation of the surveyed site and surrounding properties, and preparation and issuance of a written report. We may perform additional Phase II testing if recommended by the independent environmental consultant. Phase II testing may include the collection and laboratory analysis of soil and groundwater samples, completion of surveys for asbestos containing building materials, and any other testing that the consultant considers prudent in order to test for the presence of hazardous materials. None of the environmental assessments of our properties has revealed any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. Furthermore, we are not aware of any such material environmental liability. Nonetheless, it is possible that the assessments do not reveal all environmental liabilities and that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware or that known environmental conditions may give rise to liabilities that are materially greater than anticipated. Moreover, the current environmental condition of our properties may be affected by customers, the condition of land, operations in the vicinity of the properties (such as releases from underground storage tanks), or by third parties unrelated to us. If the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations exceed our budgets for these items, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. Our Financial Condition Could be Adversely Affected if We Fail to Comply with Other Regulations. Our properties are also subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, then we might incur fines by governmental authorities or be required to pay awards of damages to private litigants. We believe that our properties are currently in substantial compliance with all such regulatory requirements. However, these requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us. Any such unanticipated expenditure could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Federal Income Tax Risks Our Failure to Qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust Would Have Serious Adverse Consequences to Our Stockholders. We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1997. We currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code and believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify. Qualification as a real estate investment trust requires us to satisfy numerous requirements (some on an annual and others on a quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. For example, in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we must derive at least 95% of our gross income in any year from qualifying sources. In addition, we must pay dividends to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our real estate investment 46 trust taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis. These provisions and the applicable treasury regulations are more complicated in our case because we hold our assets through the operating partnership. Legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a real estate investment trust or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. However, we are not aware of any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect our ability to operate as a real estate investment trust. If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment trust for the four taxable years following the year in which we lost qualification. If we lose our real estate investment trust status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved. In addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. We Pay Some Taxes. Even if we qualify as a real estate investment trust, we will be required to pay certain state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property. In addition, we will be required to pay federal and state income tax on the net taxable income, if any, from the activities conducted through our taxable REIT subsidiaries, IMD Holding Corporation and Headlands Realty Corporation, thereby reducing their cash available for distribution to us. Certain Property Transfers May Generate Prohibited Transaction Income. From time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. Under the Internal Revenue Code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction. We would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on that income. Since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we believe that any transfer or disposal of property by us would not be deemed by the Internal Revenue Service to be a prohibited transaction with any resulting gain allocable to us being subject to a 100% penalty tax. However, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. While we believe that the Internal Revenue Service would not prevail in any such dispute, if the IRS were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction. In addition, any income from a prohibited transaction may adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes. We May Be Unable to Manage Our Growth. Our business has grown rapidly and continues to grow through property acquisitions and developments. If we fail to effectively manage our growth, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. Our International Growth is Subject to Special Political and Monetary Risks. We have and expect to continue to acquire or develop additional properties in foreign countries. Local markets affect our operations and, therefore, we would be subject to economic fluctuations in foreign locations. Our international operations also would be subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as the revaluation of currencies, revisions in tax treaties or other laws governing the taxation of revenues, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and, in certain parts of the world, property rights uncertainty and political instability. We cannot predict the likelihood that any such developments may occur. Further, we may enter into 47 agreements with non U.S. entities that are governed by the laws of, and are subject to dispute resolution in, the courts of another country or region. We cannot accurately predict whether such a forum would provide us with an effective and efficient means of resolving disputes that may arise. Even if we are able to obtain a satisfactory decision through arbitration or a court proceeding, we could have difficulty enforcing any award or judgment on a timely basis. Our business has grown rapidly and continues to grow through property acquisitions and developments. If we fail to effectively manage our international growth, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. We Are Dependent On Our Key Personnel. We depend on the efforts of our executive officers. While we believe that we could find suitable replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers. Ownership of Our Stock Limitations in Our Charter and Bylaws Could Prevent a Change in Control. Certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay, defer, or prevent a change in control or other transaction that could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for the common stock. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock may be owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code to include certain entities) during the last half of a taxable year after the first taxable year for which a real estate investment trust election is made. Furthermore, our common stock must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a 12 month taxable year (or a proportionate part of a short tax year). In addition, if we, or an owner of 10% or more of our stock, actually or constructively owns 10% or more of one of our customers (or a tenant of any partnership in which we are a partner), then the rent received by us (either directly or through any such partnership) from that tenant will not be qualifying income for purposes of the real estate investment trust gross income tests of the Internal Revenue Code. To facilitate maintenance of our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, we prohibit the ownership, actually or by virtue of the constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, by any single person of more than 9.8% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock and more than 9.8% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the issued and outstanding shares of our Series A preferred stock, and we also prohibit the ownership, actually or constructively, of any shares of our other preferred stock by any single person so that no such person, taking into account all of our stock so owned by such person, may own in excess of 9.8% of our issued and outstanding capital stock. We refer to this limitation as the ownership limit. Shares acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary. Any person who acquires shares in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any dividends on the shares or be entitled to vote the shares or receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the shares in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the shares or the amount realized from the sale. A transfer of shares in violation of the above limits may be void under certain circumstances. The ownership limit may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control and, therefore, could adversely affect our stockholders ability to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for the shares of our common stock in connection with such transaction. Our charter authorizes us to issue additional shares of common and preferred stock and to establish the preferences, rights and other terms of any series or class of preferred stock that we issue. Although our board of directors has no intention to do so at the present time, it could establish a series or class of preferred stock that could delay, defer, or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. 48 Our charter and bylaws and Maryland law also contain other provisions that may delay, defer, or prevent a transaction, including a change in control, that might involve payment of a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. Those provisions include the following: directors may be removed only for cause and only upon a two thirds vote of stockholders, together with bylaw provisions authorizing the board of directors to fill vacant directorships; a two thirds vote of stockholders for any amendment of the charter is required; the request of the holders of 50% or more of our common stock is necessary for stockholders to call a special meeting; stockholders may only take action by written consent with the unanimous approval of all stockholders entitled to vote on the matter in question; and advance notice by stockholders for the nomination of directors or proposal of business to be considered at a meeting of stockholders is required. These provisions may impede various actions by stockholders without approval of our board of directors, which in turn may delay, defer or prevent a transaction involving a change of control. Various Market Conditions Affect the Price of Our Stock. As with other publicly traded equity securities, the market price of our stock will depend upon various market conditions that may change from time to time. Among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our stock are the following: the extent of investor interest in us; the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate based companies); our financial performance; general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of our stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends; and terrorist activity may adversely affect the markets in which our securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending. Other factors such as governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws could also have a significant impact on the future market price of our stock. Earnings and Cash Dividends, Asset Value and Market Interest Rates Affect the Price of Our Stock. The market value of the equity securities of a real estate investment trust generally is based primarily upon the markets perception of the real estate investment trusts growth potential and its current and potential future earnings and cash dividends. It is based secondarily upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets. For that reason, shares of our stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share. To the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working capital reserves, or other purposes, these retained funds, while increasing the value of our underlying assets, may not correspondingly increase the market price of our stock. Our failure to meet the markets expectations with regard to future earnings and cash dividends likely would adversely affect the market price of our stock. Another factor that may influence the price of our stock will be the distribution yield on the stock (as a percentage of the price of the stock) relative to market interest rates. An increase in market interest rates might lead prospective purchasers of our stock to expect a higher distribution yield, which would adversely affect the market price of the stock. If the market price of our stock declines significantly, then we might 49 breach certain covenants with respect to debt obligations, which might adversely affect our liquidity and ability to make future acquisitions and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. If We Issue Additional Securities, then the Investment of Existing Stockholders Will Be Diluted. We have authority to issue shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities in exchange for property or otherwise. Similarly, we may cause the operating partnership to issue additional limited partnership units in exchange for property or otherwise. Existing stockholders will have no preemptive right to acquire any additional securities issued by us or the operating partnership and any issuance of additional equity securities could result in dilution of an existing stockholders investment. We Could Change Our Investment and Financing Policies without a Vote of Stockholders. Subject to our current investment policy to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust (unless a change is approved by our board of directors under certain circumstances), our board of directors will determine our investment and financing policies, our growth strategy and our debt, capitalization, distribution and operating policies. Although the board of directors has no present intention to revise or amend these strategies and policies, they may do so at any time without a vote of stockholders. Accordingly, stockholders will have no control over changes in our strategies and policies (other than through the election of directors), and any such changes may not serve the interests of all stockholders and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations, including our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. Shares Available for Future Sale Could Adversely Affect the Market Price of Our Common Stock. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of our common stock, or the availability of shares of our common stock for future sale, will have on its market price. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market (or upon exchange of limited partnership units in the operating partnership) or the perception that such sales (or exchanges) might occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. All shares of common stock issuable upon the redemption of limited partnership units in the operating partnership will be deemed to be restricted securities within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act and may not be transferred unless registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from registration is available, including any exemption from registration provided under Rule 144. In general, upon satisfaction of certain conditions, Rule 144 permits the holder to sell certain amounts of restricted securities one year following the date of acquisition of the restricted securities from us and, after two years, permits unlimited sales by persons unaffiliated with us. Commencing generally on the first anniversary of the date of acquisition of common limited partnership units (or such other date agreed to by the operating partnership and the holders of the units), the operating partnership may redeem common limited partnership units at the request of the holders for cash (based on the fair market value of an equivalent number of shares of common stock at the time of redemption) or, at the option of the operating partnership, exchange the common limited partnership units for an equal number of shares of our common stock, subject to certain antidilution adjustments. The operating partnership had issued and outstanding 4,846,387 common limited partnership units as of December 31, 2002. As of December 31, 2002, we had reserved 17,336,237 shares of common stock for issuance under our Stock Option and Incentive Plans (not including shares that we have already issued) and, as of December 31, 2002, we had granted to certain directors, officers and employees options to purchase 8,764,912 shares of common stock (excluding forfeitures and 896,152 shares that we have issued pursuant to the exercise of options). As of December 31, 2002, we had granted 717,611 restricted shares of common stock, excluding 36,200 shares that have been forfeited. In addition, we may issue additional shares of common stock and the operating partnership may issue additional limited partnership units in connection with the acquisition of properties. In connection with the issuance of common limited partnership units to other transferors of properties, and in connection with the issuance of the performance units, we have agreed to file registration statements covering the issuance of shares of common stock upon the exchange of the common limited partnership units. We have also filed registration statements with respect to the shares of common stock issuable under our stock option and incentive plans. These registration statements and registration rights 50 generally allow shares of common stock covered thereby, including shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of limited partnership units, including performance units, or the exercise of options or restricted shares of common stock, to be transferred or resold without restriction under the Securities Act. We may also agree to provide registration rights to any other person who may become an owner of the operating partnerships limited partnership units. Future sales of the shares of common stock described above could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The existence of the operating partnerships limited partnership units, options, and shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon exchange of limited partnership units, and the exercise of options and registration rights referred to above, also may adversely affect the terms upon which we are able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities. Item 7a. Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes: (1) interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings; and (2) our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2002, we had no interest rate caps or swaps. See Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources Market Capitalization. The table below summarizes the market risks associated with our fixed and variable rated debt outstanding before unamortized debt premiums of $9.8 million as of December 31, 2002: Expected Maturity 2003 2004 2005 2006 Date 2007 Thereafter Total Debt Fixed rate debt (1) $ 93,088 $ 98,490 $ 351,996 $ 167,804 $ 136,120 $ 1,171,945 $ 2,019,443 Average interest rate 7.8% 8.0% 7.3% 7.4% 7.4% 7.3% 7.4% Variable rate debt (2) $ 47,279 $ 30.504 $ 98,488 $ 8,593 $ 6,868 $ 14,368 $ 206,100 Average interest rate 2.8% 3.3% 2.1% 3.1% 3.1% 4.4% 2.7% (1) Represents 93.9% of all outstanding debt. (2) Represents 6.1% of all outstanding debt. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased by 10% (or approximately 27 basis points), then the increase in interest expense on the variable rate debt would be $0.6 million annually. As of December 31, 2002, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt was $2,152.6 million based on our estimate of current market interest rates.
