ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements. Statements contained in this discussion that are not historical facts may be forward looking statements. Such statements relate to our future performance and plans, results of operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and operating improvements and costs. You can identify forward looking statements by the use of forward looking terminology such as "believes," "expects," "may," "will," "should," "seeks," "approximately," "intends," "plans," "pro forma," "estimates" or "anticipates," or the negative of these words and phrases, or similar words or phrases. You can also identify forward looking statements by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. Forward looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties and you should not rely upon them as predictions of future events. There is no assurance that the events or circumstances reflected in forward looking statements will occur or be achieved. Forward looking statements are necessarily dependent on assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise and we may not be able to realize them. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward looking statements: changes in general economic conditions or in the real estate sector; non renewal of leases by customers or renewal at lower than expected rent; difficulties in identifying properties to acquire and in effecting acquisitions on advantageous terms and the failure of acquisitions to perform as we expect; risks and uncertainties affecting property development and renovation (including construction delays, cost overruns, our inability to obtain necessary permits and financing); a downturn in Californias economy or real estate conditions; losses in excess of our insurance coverage; our failure to divest of properties on advantageous terms or to timely reinvest proceeds from any such divestitures; unknown liabilities acquired from our predecessors or in connection with acquired properties; risks of doing business internationally, including unfamiliarity with new markets and currency risks; risks associated with using debt to fund acquisitions and development, including re financing risks; our failure to obtain necessary financing; changes in local, state and federal regulatory requirements; environmental uncertainties; and our failure to qualify and maintain our status as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Our success also depends upon economic trends generally, various market conditions and fluctuations and those other risk factors discussed in the section entitled "Business Risks" in this report. We caution you not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements, which reflect our analysis only and speak as of the date of this report or as of the dates indicated in the statements. We assume no obligation to update or supplement forward looking statements. GENERAL We commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company effective with the completion of our initial public offering on November 26, 1997, and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with our initial tax return for the year ended December 31, 1997. AMB Property Corporation and AMB Property, L.P. were formed shortly before the consummation of our initial public offering. We refer to AMB Property, L.P. as the "operating partnership." 21 MANAGEMENTS OVERVIEW We generate revenue and earnings primarily from rent received from customers under long term (generally three to ten years) operating leases at our properties, including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs, and from partnership distributions and fees from our private capital business. We also derive earnings from the strategic disposition of assets and from the disposition of projects under our development for sale program. Our long term growth is dependent on our ability to maintain and increase occupancy rates or increase rental rates at our properties and our ability to continue to acquire and develop new properties. Although the weak economy over the past three years has decreased customer demand for space and has limited or in most cases lowered rental rates, many types of investors are acquiring industrial real estate. We believe that we have capitalized on this opportunity by accelerating the repositioning of our portfolio through the disposition of properties. While property dispositions result in reinvestment capacity and trigger gain/loss recognition, they also create near term earnings dilution. However, we believe that, in the long term, the repositioning of our portfolio will benefit our stockholders. The table below summarizes our leasing activity for 2003 and 2002: U.S. HUB TOTAL OTHER TOTAL/WEIGHTED PROPERTY DATA MARKETS(1) MARKETS AVERAGE For the year ended December 31, 2003: % of total rentable square feet........... 75.0% 25.0% 100.0% Occupancy percentage at year end.......... 93.5% 91.9% 93.1% Same space square footage leased.......... 13,636,050 3,636,967 17,273,017 Rent increases/(decreases) on renewals and rollovers..............................

(1.8)% 1.0% (1.0)% (1) Our U.S. hub and gateway markets include on tarmac and Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Northern New Jersey/New York City, the San Francisco Bay Area, Miami and Seattle. Occupancy levels in our industrial portfolio and rents on lease renewals and rollovers were lower in 2003 as the general contraction in business activity, which began in 2001, reduced demand for industrial warehouse facilities. According to Torto Wheaton Research, the overall industrial market deteriorated rapidly from its peak levels at the end of 2000, when availability was 6.6%, through the second quarter of 2002, when availability reached 10.8%. Subsequently, national industrial availability has deteriorated at a more modest rate, declining an average of 13 basis points per quarter to reach 11.6% at December 31, 2003. As a result of the increase in availability, market rents for industrial properties in most markets decreased between 10% and 20% from their peak levels in 2001. Over the same three year period, our portfolio vacancy increased from 3.6% at December 31, 2000 to 6.9% at December 31, 2003, which we consider consistent with market trends, but still outperforming the national industrial average. While the level of rental rate reduction varied by market, we maintained high occupancy by pricing lease renewals and new leases with sensitivity to local market conditions. In periods of decreasing rental rates, we strive to sign leases with shorter terms to prevent locking in lower rent levels for long periods and to be prepared to sign new, longer term leases during periods of growing rental rates. When we sign leases of shorter duration, we attempt to limit overall leasing costs and capital expenditures by offering modest tenant improvement packages, appropriate to the lease term. We generally followed this practice during 2003. Through the first half of 2003, we experienced declining occupancy in our industrial operating portfolio; at June 30, 2003, occupancy in our operating industrial portfolio was 91.5%. However, during the last half of 2003, we have increased occupancy in our operating industrial portfolio by 160 basis points to 93.1% at December 31, 2003, 470 basis points greater than the 22 overall industrial market, according to Torto Wheaton Research. Rents on industrial renewals and rollovers in our portfolio decreased 1.0% during 2002 and 10.1% during 2003. During 2003, our dispositions and contributions (to a joint venture in which we retained a 15% ownership interest in exchange for cash) totaled $366.3 million, including assets in markets that no longer fit our investment strategy and properties at valuations that we considered to be at premium levels. Because we did not immediately reinvest sales proceeds into attractively priced industrial assets, these sales and contributions have diluted our near term operating results. However, we believe they help position us for long term growth and higher returns on invested capital by increasing the strategic fit of our portfolio with our investment and private capital models. Further, proceeds from these sales, along with our balance sheet and private capital sources, create significant capacity for future deployment. While we will continue to sell assets on an opportunistic basis, we believe that we have substantially achieved our near term strategic disposition goals. During 2003, we also expanded our development staff and capabilities, because we believe that development, renovation and expansion of well located, high quality industrial properties should generally continue to provide us with attractive investment opportunities at a higher rate of return than we may obtain from the purchase of existing properties. In 2003, Eugene F. Reilly joined us as Executive Vice President of North American Development, adding to our in house development team. We have increased our development pipeline from a low of $107.0 million at the end of 2002 to $233.0 million at the end of 2003. In addition to our committed development pipeline, we hold over 600 acres of land, which could support approximately 10.0 million square feet of additional development. Going forward, we believe that our co investment program with private capital investors will continue to serve as a significant source of revenues and capital for acquisitions and developments. Through these co investment joint ventures we earn acquisition and development fees, asset management fees and priority distributions as well as promoted interests and incentive fees based on the performance of the co investment joint ventures; however, there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so. As of December 31, 2003, we owned approximately 32.1 million square feet of our properties (34.7% of the total consolidated operating and development portfolio) through our co investment joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. Over the next three to four years, we expect to have approximately 15% of our portfolio (based on consolidated annualized base rent) invested in international markets. Our Mexican target markets currently include Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey. Our European target markets currently include Paris, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Madrid and London. Our Asian target markets currently include Singapore, Hong Kong and Tokyo. It is possible that our target markets will change over time to reflect experience, market opportunities, customer needs and changes in global distribution patterns. As of December 31, 2003, our international operating properties comprised 3.0% of our total annualized base rent. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust, we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income. As a result, we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our on going operations to the same extent that other corporations that are not real estate investment trusts can. We must continue to raise capital in both the debt and equity markets to fund our working capital needs, acquisitions and developments. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for a complete discussion of the sources of our capital. SUMMARY OF KEY TRANSACTIONS IN 2003 During the year ended December 31, 2003, we completed the following capital deployment transactions: Acquired 82 buildings in the U.S., Mexico, Europe and Asia, aggregating approximately 6.5 million square feet, for $533.9 million, including $238.3 million invested through two of our co investment joint ventures; Completed industrial development projects in the U.S., Mexico and Europe, comprising 1.6 million square feet, for a total investment of $105.7 million; Expanded our development pipeline, which at December 31, 2003, included projects in the U.S., Mexico, Singapore and Spain totaling 5.0 million square feet with an expected total investment of 23 $233.0 million, of which $91.2 million was invested as of December 31, 2003 and of which 34% was pre leased; Divested ourselves of 24 industrial buildings and two retail centers, aggregating approximately 2.8 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $272.3 million; and Contributed $94.0 million in operating properties to our newly formed unconsolidated joint venture, in which we retained a 15% interest. See Part IV. "Item 15: Notes 4 and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for a more detailed discussion of our acquisition, development and disposition activity. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we completed the following capital markets transactions: Raised $103.4 million, net of costs, from the issuances of $50.0 million of our 6.5% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and $57.5 million of our 6.75% Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock; Raised $125.0 million from the issuance by the operating partnership of $75.0 million of 5.53%, 10 year, unsecured fixed rate notes and $50.0 million of floating rate unsecured notes at a rate of three month LIBOR telerate plus 40 basis points; Redeemed all of our outstanding 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and all of the operating partnerships outstanding 8 5/8% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units for an aggregate of $165.8 million; Repurchased 812,900 shares of our common stock for $21.2 million; Obtained long term secured debt financing for our co investment joint ventures totaling $177.0 million at an average rate of 4.3%; and Repaid the $45.5 million outstanding balance on the AMB Institutional Alliance Fund II, L.P. credit facility with capital contributions and secured debt financing proceeds. See Part IV. "Item 15: Notes 7, 10 and 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for a more detailed discussion of our capital markets transactions. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Investments in Real Estate. Investments in real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. We also record at acquisition an intangible asset or liability for the value attributable to above or below market leases, in place leases and lease origination costs for all acquisitions subsequent to July 1, 2001. Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a property by property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable. Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying amount of the property. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future market conditions and the availability of capital. Examples of certain situations that could affect future cash flows of a property may 24 include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in occupancy; unforeseen bankruptcy, lease termination and move out of a major customer; or a significant decrease in annual base rents of that property. If impairment analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying amount of our long lived assets could occur in the future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings. Revenue Recognition. We record rental revenue from operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts, security deposits and letters of credit, then we may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our customers on an on going basis. Each period we review our outstanding accounts receivable, including straight line rents, for doubtful accounts and provide allowances as needed. We also record lease termination fees when a customer has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us. Property Dispositions. We report real estate dispositions in three separate categories on our consolidated statements of operations. First, when we contribute properties to our joint ventures, we recognize gains representing the portion of the contributed properties acquired by the third party investors to the extent of cash proceeds received. We also dispose of value added conversion projects and build to suit and speculative development projects that we have held as development projects available for sale. The gain or loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable. Lastly, beginning in 2002, SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, required us to separately report as discontinued operations the historical operating results attributable to operating properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the properties. The consolidated statements of operations for prior periods are also adjusted to conform with this classification. There is no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial position, net income or cash flows. Joint Ventures. We hold interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. Our joint venture investments do not meet the variable interest entity criteria under FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. Therefore, we determine consolidation based on standards set forth in EITF 96 16, Investors Accounting for an Investee When the Investor Has a Majority of the Voting Interest but the Minority Shareholder or Shareholders Have Certain Approval or Veto Rights, and Statement of Position 78 9, Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures. Based on the guidance set forth in these pronouncements, we consolidate certain joint venture investments because we own a majority interest or exercise significant control over major operating decisions, such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, asset management, investment activity and changes in financing. For joint ventures where we do not own a majority interest or do not exercise significant control over major operating and management decisions, we use the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. Real Estate Investment Trust. As a real estate investment trust, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes if minimum distribution, income, asset and shareholder tests are met. However, not all of our underlying entities are qualified REIT subsidiaries and may be subject to federal and state taxes, when applicable. In addition, foreign entities may also be subject to the taxes of the host country. An income tax allocation is required to be estimated on our taxable income arising from our taxable REIT subsidiaries and foreign entities. A deferred tax component could arise based upon the differences in GAAP versus tax income for items such as depreciation and gain recognition. However, deferred tax is an immaterial component of our consolidated balance sheet. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The analysis below includes changes attributable to same store growth, acquisitions, development activity and divestitures. Same store properties are those that we owned during both the current and prior year reporting periods, excluding development properties prior to being stabilized subsequent to December 31, 2001 (generally defined as properties that are 90% leased or properties for which we have held a certificate of occupancy or where building has been substantially complete for at least 12 months). As of December 31, 25 2003, same store industrial properties consisted of properties aggregating approximately 72.0 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2003, consisted of 82 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.5 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2002 consisted of 43 buildings, aggregating approximately 5.4 million square feet. During 2003, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 48 industrial buildings and two retail centers, aggregating approximately 5.3 million square feet. In 2002, property divestitures consisted of 58 industrial and two retail buildings, aggregating approximately 5.7 million square feet. Our future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition of additional properties and dispositions. Our future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical results.

Industrial same store occupancy was 93.0% at December 31, 2003, and 95.0% at December 31, 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2003, rents in the same store portfolio decreased 10.6% on industrial renewals and rollovers (cash basis) on 16.2 million square feet leased. The properties acquired during 2002 consisted of 43 buildings, aggregating approximately 5.4 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2003 consisted of 82 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.5 million square feet. Other industrial includes rental revenues from divested properties not classified as discontinued operations. In 2003, we acquired properties in Mexico and France, resulting in increased international industrial revenues. The 26 increase in private capital income was primarily due to incentive distributions earned from AMB Partners II, L.P.

The 2002 acquisitions consisted of 43 buildings, aggregating approximately 5.4 million square feet. The 2003 acquisitions consist of 82 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.5 million square feet. Other industrial includes expenses from divested properties not classified as discontinued operations. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate, partially offset by a reduction of $2.1 million for the recovery, through the settlement of a lawsuit, of capital expenditures paid in prior years. The 2003 impairment loss was on investments in real estate and leasehold interests that we continue to hold for long term investment. The 2002 impairment included losses for lease cost write offs of $1.7 million and an impairment on a portion of our planned property contributions of $1.2 million. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased stock based compensation expense of $2.8 million resulting from our decision to expense stock options under SFAS No. 123 prospectively and the issuance of additional restricted stock, partially offset by decreased personnel costs and taxes.

The increase in gains from dispositions of real estate (not classified as discontinued operations) resulted from our contribution of $94.0 million in operating properties to our newly formed co investment joint venture, Industrial Fund I, LLC, in February 2003. We recognized a gain of $7.4 million on the contribution, representing the portion of the contributed properties acquired by the 27 third party investors. During 2002, we sold two industrial buildings and one retail center, aggregating approximately 0.8 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $50.6 million, with a resulting loss of $0.8 million. In June 2002, we also contributed $76.9 million in operating properties to our consolidated co investment joint venture, AMB SGP, LP. We recognized a gain of $3.3 million on the contribution, representing the portion of the contributed properties acquired by the third party investors. The property contributions and 2002 divestitures of properties held for disposition at December 31, 2001, were not classified as discontinued operations under the provisions of SFAS No. 144. The increase in development profits, net of taxes, resulted from an increased sales volume of $57.8 million in 2003.

During 2002, we divested ourselves of 56 industrial buildings, one retail center and an undeveloped land parcel, aggregating approximately 4.9 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $193.4 million, with a resulting net gain of $10.6 million. In November 2002, our joint venture partner in AMB Partners II, L.P. increased its ownership in AMB Partners II, L.P. from 50% to 80% by acquiring 30% of the operating partnerships interest in AMB Partners II, L.P.

Industrial same store occupancy was 94.6% at December 31, 2002, and 94.6% at December 31, 2001. In 2002, the same store rent decrease on industrial renewals and rollovers (cash basis) was 1.4% on 13.8 million square feet leased.

Other industrial property operating costs include expenses from sold properties not classified as discontinued operations. The increase in depreciation expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The 2002 impairment included losses for lease cost write offs of $1.7 million and an impairment on a portion of our planned property contributions of $1.2 million. The 2001 impairment loss included losses for investments in retail real estate totaling $13.0 million, leasehold interests that we continue to hold for long term investment totaling $4.3 million and industrial real estate properties held for disposition totaling $1.3 million. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the consolidation of AMB Investment Management, Inc. (predecessor in interest to AMB Capital Partners, LLC) and Headlands Realty Corporation on May 31, 2001. Prior to May 31, 2001, general and administrative expenses did not include expenses incurred by these two unconsolidated preferred stock subsidiaries. General and administrative expenses would have been $39.4 million had the subsidiaries been consolidated beginning January 1, 2001. The increase in general and administrative expenses was also due to increased stock based compensation expense due to our decision to expense stock options under 29 SFAS No. 123 prospectively, additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international expansion and income taxes for our taxable REIT subsidiaries.

In 2001, we recognized $20.8 million of losses on investments in other companies, including our investment in Webvan Group, Inc. and other technology related companies. The loss reflects a 100% write down of the investments. No gains or losses were recognized in 2002. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to the issuance of additional unsecured senior debt securities and an increase in secured debt balances, partially offset by decreased borrowings on our unsecured credit facility. The secured debt issuances were primarily for our co investment joint ventures properties.

In November 2002, our joint venture partner in AMB Partners II, L.P. increased its ownership in AMB Partners II, L.P. from 50% to 80% by acquiring 30% of the operating partnerships interest in AMB Partners II, L.P. We recognized a gain of $6.3 million on the sale of the operating partnerships 30% interest.

In July 2003, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it had revised its position relating to the application of Emerging Issues Task Force Topic No. D 42, The Effect on the Calculation of Earnings per Share for the Redemption or Induced Conversion of Preferred Stock, ("Topic D 42"). As a result of this announcement, original issuance costs related to preferred equity are to be reflected as a reduction of income available to common stockholders in determining earnings per share for the period in which the preferred equity is redeemed. The announcement requires retroactive application of the revised position in previously issued financial statements. As a result, our financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2001, have been restated to reflect a reduction in income available to common stockholders of $3.2 million, representing the original issuance costs of AMB Property II, L.P.s series C preferred units. Diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2001, was $1.43 compared to $1.47 as previously reported. The U.S. Securities 30 and Exchange Commissions revised position on Topic D 42 did not require us to file amendments to previously filed reports and will not impact any other previously reported periods. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Balance Sheet Strategy. In general, we use unsecured lines of credit, unsecured notes, preferred stock and common equity to capitalize our 100% owned assets. Over time, we plan to retire non recourse, secured debt encumbering our 100% owned assets and replace that debt with unsecured notes. In managing our co investment joint ventures, in general, we use non recourse, secured debt to capitalize our co investment joint ventures. We currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for acquisitions, development, expansion and renovation of properties will include: retained earnings and cash flow from operations; borrowings under our unsecured credit facility; other forms of secured or unsecured financing; proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the operating partnership (including issuances of limited partnership units in the operating partnership or its subsidiaries); net proceeds from divestitures of properties; and private capital from co investment partners. We currently expect that our principal funding requirements will include: working capital; development, expansion and renovation of properties; acquisitions, including our global expansion; debt service; and dividends and distributions on outstanding common and preferred stock and limited partnership units. We believe that our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow from operations, borrowings available under our unsecured credit facility and our ability to access private and public debt and equity capital, are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. CAPITAL RESOURCES Property Contributions. In February 2003, we contributed $94.0 million in operating properties, consisting of 24 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 2.4 million square feet, to our newly formed unconsolidated joint venture, Industrial Fund I, LLC, with Citigroup Global Investments Real Estate LP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and recognized a gain of $7.4 million on the contribution representing the portion of the contributed properties acquired by the third party co investors in exchange for cash. Developments for Sale. During 2003, we sold seven development for sale and other projects, for an aggregate price of $74.8 million, with a resulting gain of $14.4 million, net of taxes. Property Divestitures. During 2003, we divested ourselves of 24 industrial buildings and two retail centers, for an aggregate price of $272.3 million, with a resulting net gain of $42.9 million. Properties Held for Divestiture. As of December 31, 2003, we had decided to divest ourselves of one retail land parcel and one industrial building, which are not in our core markets or which do not meet our current strategic objectives. The divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms 31 and other customary conditions. As of December 31, 2003, the net carrying value of the properties held for divestiture was $11.8 million. Co investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co investment joint ventures provide us with an additional source of capital to fund certain acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. We consolidate these joint ventures for financial reporting purposes because we are the sole managing general partner and control all major operating decisions. Third party equity interests in the joint ventures are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2003, we owned approximately 32.1 million square feet of our properties (34.7% of the total consolidated operating and development portfolio) through our co investment joint ventures and 6.0 million square feet of our properties through our other consolidated joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so.

We have authorized for issuance 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which the following series were designated as of December 31, 2003: 1,595,337 shares of series D preferred stock; 220,440 shares of series E preferred stock; 267,439 shares of series F preferred stock; 840,000 shares of series H preferred stock; 510,000 shares of series I preferred stock; 800,000 shares of series J preferred stock; 800,000 shares of series K preferred stock; 2,300,000 shares of series L preferred stock; and 2,300,000 shares of series M preferred stock. On June 23, 2003, we issued and sold 2,000,000 shares of 6.5% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at a price of $25.00 per share. Dividends are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable quarterly in arrears at a rate per share equal to $1.625 per annum. The series L preferred stock is redeemable by us on or after June 23, 2008, subject to certain conditions, for cash at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, if any, to the redemption date. We 32 contributed the net proceeds of $48.0 million to the operating partnership, and in exchange, the operating partnership issued to us 2,000,000 6.5% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units. The operating partnership used the proceeds, in addition to proceeds previously contributed to the operating partnership from other equity issuances, to redeem all 3,995,800 of its 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units from us on July 28, 2003. We, in turn, used those proceeds to redeem all 3,995,800 of our 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for $100.2 million, including all accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, to the redemption date. On July 14, 2003, AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased, from an unrelated third party, 66,300 of its series F preferred units for $3.3 million, including accrued and unpaid dividends. On November 25, 2003, we issued and sold 2,300,000 shares of 6.75% Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at $25.00 per share. Dividends are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable quarterly in arrears at a rate per share equal to $1.6875 per annum. The series M preferred stock is redeemable by us on or after November 25, 2008, subject to certain conditions, for cash at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends theron, if any, to the redemption date. We contributed the net proceeds of $55.4 million to the operating partnership, and in exchange, the operating partnership issued to us 2,300,000 6.75% Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units. On November 26, 2003, the operating partnership redeemed all 1,300,000 of its outstanding 8 5/8% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Partnership Units, for an aggregate redemption price of $65.6 million, including accrued and unpaid dividends. In December 2003, our board of directors approved a new two year common stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of our common stock. During 2003, we repurchased 812,900 shares of our common stock for $21.2 million, including commissions. In December 2001, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $100.0 million worth of our common and preferred stock. In December 2002, our board of directors increased the 2001 repurchase program to $200.0 million. The 2001 stock repurchase program expired in December 2003. During 2002, we repurchased 2,651,600 shares of our common stock for $69.4 million, including commissions. In July 2002, we also repurchased 4,200 shares of our series A preferred stock for an aggregate cost of $0.1 million, including accrued and unpaid dividends. During 2003, the operating partnership redeemed 226,145 of its common limited partnership units for cash and 2,000 of its common limited partnership units for shares of our common stock. In November 2003, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, also issued 145,548 of its class B common limited partnership units in connection with a property acquisition. During 2002, the operating partnership redeemed 122,640 of its common limited partnership units for shares of our common stock. Debt. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, we presently intend to operate with a debt to total market capitalization ratio (our share) of approximately 45% or less. As of December 31, 2003, our share of total debt to total market capitalization ratio was 37.9%. However, we typically finance our co investment joint ventures with secured debt at a loan to value ratio of 50 65%, per our joint venture partnership agreements. Additionally, we currently intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these policies, our organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our management could alter or eliminate these policies without stockholder approval or circumstances could arise that could render us unable to comply with these policies. As of December 31, 2003, the aggregate principal amount of our secured debt was $1.4 billion, excluding unamortized debt premiums of $10.8 million. Of the $1.4 billion of secured debt, $1.1 billion is secured by properties in our joint ventures. The secured debt is generally non recourse and bears interest at rates varying from 2.6% to 10.6% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 7.0%) and final maturity dates ranging from June 2004 to June 2023. All of the secured debt bears interest at fixed rates, except for five loans with an aggregate principal amount of $52.3 million as of December 31, 2003, which bear interest at variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 3.2% as of December 31, 2003). 33 In June 1998, the operating partnership issued $400.0 million of unsecured senior debt securities. Interest on the unsecured senior debt securities is payable semi annually. The 2015 notes are putable and callable in September 2005. In August 2000, the operating partnership commenced a medium term note program and subsequently issued $400.0 million of medium term notes with a weighted average interest rate of 7.3%. The notes mature between December 2005 and September 2011 and are guaranteed by us. In May 2002, the operating partnership commenced a new medium term note program for the issuance of up to $400.0 million in principal amount of medium term notes, which will be guaranteed by us. On November 10, 2003, the operating partnership issued $75.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes to Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America. We guaranteed the principal amount and interest on the notes, which mature on November 1, 2013, and bear interest at 5.53% per annum. Teachers has agreed that until November 10, 2005, the operating partnership can require Teachers to return the notes to it for cancellation for an obligation of equal dollar amount under a first mortgage loan to be secured by properties determined by the operating partnership, except that in the event the ratings on operating partnerships senior unsecured debt are downgraded by two ratings agencies to BBB , the operating partnership will only have ten days after the last of these downgrades to exercise this right. During the period when the operating partnership can exercise its cancellation right and until any mortgage loans close, Teachers has agreed not to sell, contract to sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of, any portion of the notes. On November 21, 2003, the operating partnership issued $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior unsecured notes. We guaranteed the principal amount and interest on the notes, which mature on November 21, 2006, and bear interest at a floating rate of 3 month LIBOR telerate plus 40 basis points. The operating partnership intends to continue to issue medium term notes, guaranteed by us, under the program from time to time as market conditions permit. As of December 31, 2003, $275.0 million of capacity remained under the May 2002 medium term note program. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to its senior debt securities. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then our cash flow may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Credit Facilities. In December 2002, the operating partnership renewed its $500.0 million unsecured revolving line of credit. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations under the credit facility. The credit facility matures in December 2005, has a one year extension option and is subject to a 20 basis point annual facility fee. The credit facility includes a multi currency component, which was amended effective July 10, 2003, to increase from $150.0 million to $250.0 million the amount that may be drawn in either British pounds sterling, Euros or Yen (provided that such currency is readily available and freely transferable and convertible to U.S. dollars, the Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service reports LIBOR for such currency in interest periods of 1, 2, 3 or 6 months and the operating partnership has an investment grade credit rating). U.S. dollar borrowings under the credit facility currently bear interest at LIBOR plus 60 basis points. Euro borrowings under the credit facility currently bear interest at EURIBOR plus 60 basis points. Yen borrowings under the credit facility currently bear interest at the Japanese Yen TIBOR rate plus 60 basis points. Both the facility fee and the interest rate are based on the operating partnerships credit rating, which is currently investment grade. However, depending on the operating partnerships credit rating, the facility fee and interest rate may increase. The operating partnership has the ability to increase available borrowings to $700.0 million by adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their commitments. We use the unsecured credit facility principally for acquisitions, funding our development activity and for general working capital requirements. Monthly debt service payments on the credit facility are interest only. The total amount available under the credit facility fluctuates based upon the borrowing base, as defined in the agreement governing the credit facility, generally the value of our unencumbered properties. As of December 31, 2003, the outstanding balance on our unsecured credit facility was $275.7 million and the remaining amount available was $171.6 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $52.7 million (excluding the $200.0 million of potential additional capacity). The outstanding balance included borrowings denomi 34 nated in Euros and Yen and translated to U.S. dollars at December 31, 2003, of $83.1 million and $47.6 million, respectively. In August 2001, AMB Institutional Alliance Fund II, L.P. obtained a $150.0 million credit facility secured by the unfunded capital commitments of the investors in AMB Institutional Alliance REIT II, Inc. and AMB Institutional Alliance Fund II, L.P. In April 2003, AMB Institutional Alliance Fund II, L.P. repaid the credit facility with capital contributions and secured debt financing proceeds and terminated the credit facility. Mortgages Receivable. Through a wholly owned subsidiary, we hold a mortgage loan receivable on AMB Pier One, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture. The note bears interest at 13.0% and matures in May 2026. As of December 31, 2003, the outstanding balance on the note was $13.0 million. We also hold short term mortgages on sold properties totaling $30.1 million with a weighted average interest rate of 6.2%. The mortgages mature between February 2004 and November 2006.

"Item 7. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources". 36 LIQUIDITY As of December 31, 2003, we had $127.7 million in cash (of which $81.1 million was held by our consolidated co investment joint ventures) and cash equivalents, and $171.6 million of additional available borrowings under our credit facility. Our board of directors declared a regular cash dividend for the quarter ended December 31, 2003, of $0.415 per share of common stock and the operating partnership announced its intention to pay a regular cash distribution for the quarter ended December 31, 2003, of $0.415 per common unit. The dividends and distributions were payable on January 5, 2004, to stockholders and unitholders of record on December 22, 2003. The series L and M preferred stock dividends were payable on January 15, 2004, to stockholders of record on January 5, 2004.

The following table sets forth the dividends and distributions paid or payable per share or unit for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001: PAYING ENTITY SECURITY 2003 2002 2001 AMB Property Corporation Common stock............................. $1.66 $1.64 $1.58 AMB Property Corporation Series A preferred stock................. $1.15 $2.13 $2.13 AMB Property Corporation Series L preferred stock................. $0.85 n/a n/a AMB Property Corporation Series M preferred stock................. $0.17 n/a n/a Operating Partnership Common limited partnership units......... $1.66 $1.64 $1.58 Operating Partnership Series B preferred units................. $3.71 $4.31 $4.31 Operating Partnership Series J preferred units................. $3.98 $3.98 $1.24 Operating Partnership Series K preferred units................. $3.98 $2.96 n/a AMB Property II, L.P.

Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. CAPITAL COMMITMENTS Developments. In addition to recurring capital expenditures, which consist of building improvements and leasing costs incurred to renew or re tenant space, during 2003, we initiated 13 new industrial development projects with a total estimated investment of $226.4 million at completion, aggregating an estimated 4.9 million square feet, including 438 acres of land for development in Miamis Airport West submarket for $29.7 million. The master planned park, called Beacon Lakes, is entitled for 6.8 million square feet of properties for lease or sale. We began development of the first two buildings at Beacon Lakes, which will aggregate approximately 0.4 million square feet and have an estimated investment of $19.2 million. As of December 31, 2003, we had 16 projects in our development pipeline representing a total estimated investment 37 of $233.0 million upon completion and four development projects available for sale representing a total estimated investment of $38.8 million upon completion. Of this total, $112.2 million had been funded as of December 31, 2003, and an estimated $159.6 million was required to complete current and planned projects. We expect to fund these expenditures with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facility, debt or equity issuances, net proceeds from property divestitures, and private capital from co investment partners, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow. Acquisitions. During 2003, we invested $533.9 million in 82 operating industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 6.5 million rentable square feet, of which we invested $238.3 million in 43 operating properties, aggregating approximately 3.7 million square feet, through two of our co investment joint ventures. We generally fund our acquisitions through private capital contributions, borrowings under our credit facility, cash, debt issuances and net proceeds from property divestitures. In addition, in October 2003, we entered into an Agreement of Sale with privately held International Airport Centers L.L.C. and certain of its affiliated entities, pursuant to which, if fully consummated, we will acquire a 3.4 million square foot portfolio consisting of 37 airfreight buildings located adjacent to seven international airports in the U.S. for approximately $481.0 million, including $119.0 million of assumed debt. Pursuant to the Agreement of Sale, we will acquire the buildings in separate tranches, as construction is completed and certain other customary closing conditions, including acquiring the necessary consents, are met. The first closings occurred in October and December 2003, and we currently expect the balance of the portfolio to close by the third quarter of 2004. Some of the properties in this portfolio have been allocated to one or more of our co investment joint ventures. We financed the first tranche, and expect to finance the remainder of the purchase price, through additional debt financings and proceeds from property dispositions. Lease Commitments. We have entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily on tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms from one to 37 years. Future minimum rental payments required under non cancelable operating leases in effect as of December 31, 2003, were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2004........................................................ $ 20,149 2005........................................................ 20,272 2006........................................................ 20,922 2007........................................................ 21,120 2008........................................................ 21,340 Thereafter.................................................. 283,965 Total..................................................... $387,768 These operating lease payments are amortized ratably over the terms of the related leases. Co investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co investment joint ventures provide us with an additional source of capital to fund certain acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. As of December 31, 2003, we had investments in co investment joint ventures with a gross book value of $1.9 billion, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes. As of December 31, 2003, we may make additional capital contributions to current and planned co investment joint ventures of up to $27.9 million. We expect to fund these contributions with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facility, debt or equity issuances or net proceeds from property divestitures, which could adversely effect our cash flow. Captive Insurance Company. In December 2001, we formed a wholly owned captive insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., which provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the deductible under our third party policies. We capitalized Arcata National Insurance Ltd. in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata National Insurance Ltd. established annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss experience of our properties. Annually, we engage an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims, related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata National Insurance Ltd. may be adjusted based on this estimate. Premiums paid to Arcata National Insurance Ltd. have a retrospective component, so that if expenses, including losses and deductibles, are less than 38 premiums collected, the excess may be returned to the property owners (and, in turn, as appropriate, to the customers) and conversely, subject to certain limitations, if expenses, including losses, are greater than premiums collected, an additional premium will be charged. As with all recoverable expenses, differences between estimated and actual insurance premiums will be recognized in the subsequent year. Through this structure, we believe that we have more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market. Potential Unknown Liabilities. Unknown liabilities may include the following: liabilities for clean up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to our formation transactions that had not been asserted prior to our formation transactions; accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; tax liabilities; and claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these entities. OVERVIEW OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our debt, interest and lease payments due by period as of December 31, 2003 (dollars in thousands): LESS THAN MORE THAN CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 1 YEAR 1 3 YEARS 3 5 YEARS 5 YEARS TOTAL Debt........................ $ 98,470 $ 854,763 $514,704 $1,095,531 $2,563,468 Debt interest payments...... 157,424 271,085 205,978 72,533 707,020 Operating lease commitments............... 20,149 41,194 42,460 283,965 387,768 Total..................... $276,043 $1,167,042 $763,142 $1,452,029 $3,658,256 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Standby Letters of Credit. As of December 31, 2003, we had provided approximately $64.1 million in letters of credit, of which $52.7 million was provided under the operating partnerships $500.0 million unsecured credit facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other commitments. Guarantees. Other than disclosed elsewhere in this report, as of December 31, 2003, we had outstanding guarantees in the aggregate amount of $50.2 million in connection with certain acquisitions, which are currently expected to close in 2004. Performance and Surety Bonds. As of December 31, 2003, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $0.9 million. These bonds were issued in connection with certain of our development projects and were posted to guarantee certain tax obligations and the construction of certain real property improvements and infrastructure, such as grading, sewers and streets. Performance and surety bonds are commonly required by public agencies from real estate developers. Performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the taxes due or the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. Promoted Interests and Other Contractual Obligations. Upon the achievement of certain return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, we may be obligated to make payments to certain of joint venture partners pursuant to the terms and provisions of their contractual agreements with us. From time to time in the normal course of our business, we enter into various contracts with third parties that may obligate us to make payments or perform other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. 39 SUPPLEMENTAL EARNINGS MEASURES FFO. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider funds from operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. FFO is defined as net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, less gains (or losses) from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estate related depreciation, and adjustments to derive our pro rata share of FFO of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. Further, we do not adjust FFO to eliminate the effects of non recurring charges. We believe that FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. We believe that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. The following table reflects the calculation of FFO reconciled from net income for the years ended December 31, (dollars in thousands): 2002(2) 2001(2) 2000(2) 1999(2) 2003(1) (RESTATED) (RESTATED) (RESTATED) (RESTATED) Net income....................... $ 134,019 $ 124,237 $ 137,953 $ 121,782 $ 176,103 Gains from dispositions of real estate.........................

Basic FFO per share would have been $2.47, $2.10, $2.27 and $2.10 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, had we discontinued our practice of deducting amortization of investments in leasehold interests from FFO retroactively. Diluted FFO per share would have been $2.42, $2.08, $2.26 and $2.10 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, had we discontinued our practice of deducting amortization of investments in leasehold interests from FFO retroactively. (2) In the quarter ended September 30, 2003, we modified our FFO reporting to no longer add back impairment losses when computing FFO in accordance with NAREITs FFO definition. Additionally, we adopted Topic D 42 and began including preferred stock and unit redemption discounts and issuance cost write offs in FFO. As a result, FFO for the periods presented has been restated to reflect these changes. EBITDA. We use earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, to measure both our operating performance and liquidity. We consider EBITDA to provide investors relevant and useful information because it permits fixed income investors to view income from our operations on an unleveraged basis before the effects of non cash depreciation and amortization expense. By excluding interest expense, EBITDA allows investors to measure our operating performance independent of our capital structure and indebtedness and, therefore, allows for a more meaningful comparison of our operating performance between quarters as well as annual periods and to compare our operating performance to that of other companies, both in the real estate industry and in other industries. We consider EBITDA to be a useful supplemental measure for reviewing our comparative performance with other companies because, by excluding non cash depreciation expense, EBITDA can help the investing public compare the performance of a real estate company to that of companies in other industries. As a liquidity measure, we believe that EBITDA helps fixed income and equity investors to analyze our ability to meet our debt service obligations and to make our quarterly preferred share 41 and unit distributions. Management uses EBITDA in the same manner as we expect investors to when measuring our operating performance and our liquidity; specifically when assessing our operating performance, and comparing that performance to other companies, both in the real estate industry and in other industries, and when evaluating our ability to meet our debt service obligations and to make our quarterly preferred share and unit distributions. We believe investors should consider EBITDA, in conjunction with net income (the primary measure of our performance) and the other required GAAP measures of our performance and liquidity, to improve their understanding of our operating results and liquidity, and to make more meaningful comparisons of the performance of our assets between periods and as against other companies. By excluding interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization when assessing our financial performance, an investor is assessing the earnings generated by our operations, but not taking into account the eliminated expenses incurred in connection with such operations. As a result, EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should be used in conjunction with our required GAAP presentations. EBITDA does not reflect our historical cash expenditures or our future cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures or contractual commitments. EBITDA also does not reflect the cash required to make interest and principal payments on our outstanding debt. While EBITDA is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance and liquidity, it does not represent net income or cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and it should not be considered as an alternative to those indicators in evaluating operating performance or liquidity. Further, our computation of EBITDA may not be comparable to EBITDA reported by other companies. The following table reflects the calculation of EBITDA reconciled to net income, a GAAP financial measure, for the years ended December 31, (dollars in thousands): 2003 2002 2001 2000 1999 Net income.............................. $134,019 $124,237 $137,953 $121,782 $176,103 Depreciation and amortization........... 133,514 123,380 103,565 84,752 62,896 Impairment losses....................... 5,251 2,846 18,600 5,900 469 Stock based compensation amortization... 8,075 5,265 2,725 1,022 952 Adjustments to derive EBITDA from unconsolidated joint ventures: Our share of net income(1)............

(3) Our share of interest expense is the pro rata portion of interest expense based on our percentage of equity interest in each of the unconsolidated ventures holding the debt. 43 BUSINESS RISKS Our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences to us. These risks include, among others: GENERAL REAL ESTATE RISKS OUR PERFORMANCE AND VALUE ARE SUBJECT TO GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR REAL ESTATE ASSETS. The investment returns available from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of income earned and capital appreciation generated by the properties, as well as the expenses incurred in connection with the properties. If our properties do not generate income sufficient to meet operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, then our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders could be adversely affected. In addition, there are significant expenditures associated with an investment in real estate (such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs) that generally do not decline when circumstances reduce the income from the property. Income from, and the value of, our properties may be adversely affected by: changes in the general economic climate; local conditions, such as oversupply of or a reduction in demand for industrial space; the attractiveness of our properties to potential customers; competition from other properties; our ability to provide adequate maintenance and insurance; increased operating costs; increased cost of compliance with regulations; and the potential for liability under applicable laws (including changes in tax laws). In addition, periods of economic slowdown or recession in the United States and in other countries, rising interest rates or declining demand for real estate, or public perception that any of these events may occur, would result in a general decrease in rents or an increased occurrence of defaults under existing leases, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Future terrorist attacks may result in declining economic activity, which could reduce the demand for and the value of our properties. To the extent that future attacks impact our customers, their businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to honor their existing leases. Our properties are concentrated predominantly in the industrial real estate sector. As a result of this concentration, we would feel the impact of an economic downturn in this sector more acutely than if our portfolio included other property types. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO RENEW LEASES OR RELET SPACE AS LEASES EXPIRE. As of December 31, 2003, leases on a total of 17.8% of our industrial properties (based on annualized base rent) will expire on or prior to December 31, 2004. We derive most of our income from rent received from our customers. Accordingly, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected if we are unable to promptly relet or renew these expiring leases, if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected. If a tenant experiences a downturn in its business or other type of financial distress, then it may be unable to make timely rental payments or renew its lease. Further, our ability to rent space and the rents that we can charge are impacted, not only by customer demand, but by the number of other properties we have to compete with to appeal to customers. 44 REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS ARE RELATIVELY ILLIQUID, MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO RESPOND PROMPTLY TO CHANGING CONDITIONS. Real estate assets are not as liquid as certain other types of assets. Further, as a real estate investment trust, the Internal Revenue Code regulates the number of properties that we can dispose of in a year, their tax bases and the cost of improvements that we make to the properties. These limitations may affect our ability to sell properties. This lack of liquidity and the Internal Revenue Code restrictions may limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions and, as a result, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO CONSUMMATE ACQUISITIONS ON ADVANTAGEOUS TERMS OR ACQUISITIONS MAY NOT PERFORM AS WE EXPECT. We acquire and intend to continue to acquire primarily industrial properties. The acquisition of properties entails various risks, including the risks that our investments may not perform as we expect, that we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate our new acquisitions into our existing operations and that our cost estimates for bringing an acquired property up to market standards may prove inaccurate. Further, we face significant competition for attractive investment opportunities from other well capitalized real estate investors, including both publicly traded real estate investment trusts and private institutional investment funds. This competition increases as investments in real estate become increasingly attractive relative to other forms of investment. As a result of competition, we may be unable to acquire additional properties as we desire or the purchase price may be significantly elevated. In addition, we expect to finance future acquisitions through a combination of borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the operating partnership or its subsidiaries and proceeds from property divestitures, which may not be available and which could adversely affect our cash flow. Any of the above risks could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO COMPLETE RENOVATION AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS ON ADVANTAGEOUS TERMS. As part of our business, we develop new and renovate existing properties. The real estate development and renovation business involves significant risks that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock, which include: we may not be able to obtain financing for development projects on favorable terms and complete construction on schedule or within budget, resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs and delays in leasing the properties and generating cash flow; we may not be able to obtain, or may experience delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations; the properties may perform below anticipated levels, producing cash flow below budgeted amounts; substantial renovation and new development activities, regardless of their ultimate success, typically require a significant amount of managements time and attention, diverting their attention from our day to day operations; and upon completion of construction, we may not be able to obtain, or obtain on advantageous terms, permanent financing for activities that we have financed through construction loans. OUR PERFORMANCE AND VALUE ARE IMPACTED BY THE LOCAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OF AND THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DOING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. As of December 31, 2003, our industrial properties located in California represented 28.4% of the aggregate square footage of our industrial operating properties and 31.5% of our industrial annualized base rent. Our revenue from, and the value of, our properties located in California may be affected by local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties) and the local economic climate. Business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns, changing demographics, and other 45 factors may adversely impact Californias economic climate. Because of the number of properties we have located in California, a downturn in Californias economy or real estate conditions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. In addition, certain of our properties are subject to possible loss from seismic activity. WE MAY EXPERIENCE LOSSES THAT OUR INSURANCE DOES NOT COVER. We carry commercial liability, property and rental loss insurance covering all the properties that we own and manage in types and amounts that we believe are adequate and appropriate given the relative risks applicable to the property, the cost of coverage and industry practice. Certain losses, such as those due to terrorism, windstorms, floods or seismic activity, may be insured subject to certain limitations, including large deductibles or co payments and policy limits. Although we have obtained coverage for certain acts of terrorism, with policy specifications and insured limits that we consider commercially reasonable given the cost and availability of such coverage, we cannot be certain that we will be able to renew coverage on comparable terms or collect under such policies. In addition, there are other types of losses, such as those from riots, bio terrorism, or acts of war, that are not generally insured in our industry because it is not economically feasible to do so. We may incur material losses in excess of insurance proceeds and we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance at commercially reasonable rates. If we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds our insured limits with respect to one or more of our properties, then we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue from those properties and, if there is recourse debt, then we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties. Moreover, as the general partner of the operating partnership, we generally will be liable for all of the operating partnerships unsatisfied recourse obligations, including any obligations incurred by the operating partnership as the general partner of co investment joint ventures. Any such losses could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. A number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to earthquake activity, including California where, as of December 31, 2003, we had 299 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 24.7 million square feet and representing 28.4% of our industrial operating properties based on aggregate square footage and 31.5% based on industrial annualized base rent. We carry replacement cost earthquake insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable. We evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants. WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND LIABILITIES IN CONNECTION WITH PROPERTIES OWNED THROUGH JOINT VENTURES, LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES AND PARTNERSHIPS. As of December 31, 2003, we owned approximately 48.1 million square feet of our properties through several joint ventures, limited liability companies or partnerships with third parties. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in partnerships, limited liability companies or joint ventures and we intend to continue to develop and acquire properties through joint ventures, limited liability companies and partnerships with other persons or entities when warranted by the circumstances. Such partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions. Partnership, limited liability company or joint venture investments involve certain risks, including: if our partners, co members or joint venturers go bankrupt, then we and any other remaining general partners, members, or joint venturers would generally remain liable for the partnerships, limited liability companys, or joint ventures liabilities; our partners, co members or joint venturers might have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals that would affect our ability to operate the property; our partners, co members or joint venturers may have the power to act contrary to our instructions, requests, policies, or objectives, including our current policy with respect to maintaining our qualification as a real estate investment trust; and 46 the joint venture, limited liability and partnership agreements often restrict the transfer of a joint venturers, members or partners interest or "buy sell" or may otherwise restrict our ability to sell the interest when we desire or on advantageous terms. We generally seek to maintain sufficient control of our partnerships, limited liability companies, and joint ventures to permit us to achieve our business objectives, however, we may not be able to do so, and the occurrence of one or more of the events described above could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO COMPLETE DIVESTITURES ON ADVANTAGEOUS TERMS OR CONTRIBUTE PROPERTIES. We intend to continue to divest ourselves of retail centers and industrial properties that do not meet our strategic objectives, provided that we can negotiate acceptable terms and conditions. Our ability to dispose of properties on advantageous terms depends on factors beyond our control, including competition from other sellers and the availability of attractive financing for potential buyers of our properties. If we are unable to dispose of properties on favorable terms or redeploy the proceeds of property divestitures in accordance with our investment strategy, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. We also anticipate contributing or selling properties to funds and joint ventures. If we do not have sufficient properties available that meet the investment criteria of current or future property funds, or if the funds have reduced or no access to capital on favorable terms, then such contributions or sales could be delayed or prevented, adversely affecting our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. CONTINGENT OR UNKNOWN LIABILITIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. At the time of our formation we acquired assets from our predecessor entities subject to all of their potential existing liabilities, without recourse. In addition, we have and may in the future acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of any of these entities or properties, then we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect our cash flow. Unknown liabilities with respect to entities or properties acquired might include: liabilities for clean up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to the formation transactions or the former owners of the properties; accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; tax liabilities; and claims for indemnification by the general partners, officers and directors and others indemnified by our predecessors or the former owners of the properties. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS OUR INTERNATIONAL GROWTH IS SUBJECT TO SPECIAL RISKS AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR INTERNATIONAL GROWTH. We have acquired and developed, and expect to continue to acquire and develop, properties in foreign countries. Because local markets affect our operations, our international investments are subject to economic fluctuations in the foreign locations in which we invest. In addition, our international operations are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as revisions in tax treaties or other laws governing the taxation of our foreign revenues, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and, in certain parts of the world, property rights uncertainty and political instability. We cannot predict the likelihood that any of these developments may occur. Further, we have entered, and may in the future enter, into agreements with non U.S. entities that are governed by the laws of, and are subject to dispute resolution in the courts of, another country or region. We cannot accurately predict whether such a forum would provide us with an effective and efficient means of 47 resolving disputes that may arise. And even if we are able to obtain a satisfactory decision through arbitration or a court proceeding, we could have difficulty enforcing any award or judgment on a timely basis or at all. Further, our business has grown rapidly and continues to grow through international property acquisitions and developments. If we fail to effectively manage our international growth, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. ACQUIRED PROPERTIES MAY BE LOCATED IN NEW MARKETS, WHERE WE MAY FACE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTING IN AN UNFAMILIAR MARKET. We have acquired and may continue to acquire properties in international markets that are new to us. When we acquire properties located in these markets, we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local government and permitting procedures. We work to mitigate such risks through extensive diligence and research and associations with experienced partners, however there can be no guarantee that all such risks will be eliminated. WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS FROM POTENTIAL FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES BETWEEN THE U.S. DOLLAR AND THE CURRENCIES OF THE FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE INVEST. We are pursuing, and intend to continue to pursue, growth opportunities in international markets. As we invest in countries where the U.S. dollar is not the national currency, we are subject to foreign currency risks from the potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of those foreign countries. A significant depreciation in the value of the currency of one or more foreign countries where we have a significant investment may materially affect our results of operations. We attempt to mitigate any such effects by borrowing under our multi currency credit facility in the currency of the country we are investing in and, under certain circumstances, by putting in place foreign currency put option contracts hedging exchange rate fluctuations. For leases denominated in foreign currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk. We cannot, however, assure you that our efforts will successfully neutralize all foreign currency risks. DEBT FINANCING RISKS WE COULD INCUR MORE DEBT, INCREASING OUR DEBT SERVICE. It is our policy to incur debt, either directly or through our subsidiaries, only if it will not cause our share of total debt to total market capitalization ratio to exceed approximately 45%. The aggregate amount of indebtedness that we may incur under our policy increases directly with an increase in the market price per share of our capital stock. Further, our management could alter or eliminate this policy without stockholder approval. If we change this policy, then we could become more highly leveraged, resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect the cash available for distribution to our stockholders. WE FACE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF DEBT TO FUND ACQUISITIONS AND DEVELOPMENTS, INCLUDING REFINANCING RISK. As of December 31, 2003, we had total debt outstanding of $2.6 billion. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to the senior debt securities referenced in our financial statements. We are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest. We anticipate that we will repay only a small portion of the principal of our debt prior to maturity. Accordingly, we will likely need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds of other capital transactions, then we expect that our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repay all such maturing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in 48 higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. In addition, if we mortgage one or more of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments, then the property could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income and asset value. A foreclosure on one or more of our properties could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. WE ARE DEPENDENT ON EXTERNAL SOURCES OF CAPITAL. In order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain) and are taxed on our income to the extent it is not fully distributed. Consequently, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs, including acquisition and development activities, from cash retained from operations and must rely on third party sources of capital. Our ability to access private debt and equity capital on favorable terms or at all is dependent upon a number of factors, including, general market conditions, the markets perception of our growth potential, our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our capital stock. COVENANTS IN OUR DEBT AGREEMENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. The terms of our credit agreements and other indebtedness require that we comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage. These covenants may limit flexibility in our operations, and our failure to comply with these covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt agreement even if we have satisfied our payment obligations. Further, as of December 31, 2003, we had 42 non recourse secured loans that are cross collateralized by 86 properties, totaling $920.6 million (not including unamortized debt premium). If we default on any of these loans, we may then be required to repay such indebtedness, together with applicable prepayment charges, to avoid foreclosure on all the cross collateralized properties within the applicable pool. Foreclosure on our properties, or our inability to refinance our loans on favorable terms, could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. In addition, our credit facility and senior debt securities contain certain cross default provisions, which are triggered in the event that our other material indebtedness is in default. These cross default provisions may require us to repay or restructure the credit facility and the senior debt securities in addition to any mortgage or other debt that is in default, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST RISKS SOME OF OUR DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS ARE INVOLVED IN OTHER REAL ESTATE ACTIVITIES AND INVESTMENTS. Prior to the consummation our initial public offering in 1997, some of our executive officers and directors acquired interests in real estate related businesses and investments, which they still own. Our executive officers continued involvement in other real estate related activities could divert their attention from our day to day operations. Our executive officers have entered into non competition agreements with us pursuant to which they have agreed not to engage in any activities, directly or indirectly, in respect of commercial real estate, and not to make any investment in respect of any industrial or retail real estate, other than through ownership of not more than 5% of the outstanding shares of a public company engaged in such activities or through the existing investments referred to in this report. State law may limit our ability to enforce these agreements. CERTAIN OF OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS MAY HAVE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WITH US IN CONNECTION WITH OTHER PROPERTIES THAT THEY OWN OR CONTROL. In October 1986, our predecessor in interest entered into a property and asset management agreement with Inglewood Corporate Center Associates to manage an office building, in which Messrs. Moghadam and Burke and Thomas W. Tusher, also a director, held, directly and indirectly, 26.7%, 26.7% and 20% interests, 49 respectively. During 2003, Inglewood transferred to a third party such property and asset management services. Until such time, Inglewood had been paying us property and asset management fees, which totaled approximately $11,500 for the period from January 1, 2003 through the date on which such management was transferred during the second quarter of 2003. Also, during 2003, Mr. Tushers direct and indirect interests in Inglewood were redeemed for an amount equal to the estimated liquidation value of such ventures assets. As a result, each of Messrs. Moghadam and Burke now holds, directly and indirectly, a 33.3% interest in Inglewood. Certain of our executive officers and directors own interests in other real estate related businesses and investments, including retail development projects, office buildings and de minimus holdings of the equity securities of public and private real estate companies. We believe that these properties and activities generally do not directly compete with any of our properties. However, it is possible that a property in which an executive officer or director, or an affiliate of an executive officer or director, has an interest may compete with us in the future if we were to invest in a property similar in type and in close proximity to that property. In addition, our executive officers and directors continued involvement in these properties could divert managements attention from our day to day operations. We will not acquire any properties from our executive officers, directors or their affiliates unless the transaction is approved by a majority of the disinterested and independent (as defined by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange) members of our board of directors with respect to that transaction. OUR ROLE AS GENERAL PARTNER OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP MAY CONFLICT WITH THE INTERESTS OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS. As the general partner of the operating partnership, we have fiduciary obligations to the operating partnerships limited partners, the discharge of which may conflict with the interests of our stockholders. In addition, those persons holding limited partnership units will have the right to vote as a class on certain amendments to the operating partnerships partnership agreement and individually to approve certain amendments that would adversely affect their rights. The limited partners may exercise these voting rights in a manner that conflicts with the interests of our stockholders. In addition, under the terms of the operating partnerships partnership agreement, holders of limited partnership units will have certain approval rights with respect to certain transactions that affect all stockholders but which they may not exercise in a manner that reflects the interests of all stockholders. 50 RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS COMPLIANCE OR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT AND OTHER SIMILAR REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, places of public accommodation must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. If we are required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, including removing access barriers, then our cash flow and the amounts available for dividends to our stockholders may be adversely affected. Our properties are also subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. We could incur fines or private damage awards if we fail to comply with these requirements. While we believe that our properties are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements, the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us that will affect our cash flow and results of operations. THE COSTS OF COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD EXCEED OUR BUDGETS FOR THESE ITEMS. Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at, on, under or in its property. The costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial. These laws typically impose liability and clean up responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean up costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury, property damage, or other costs, including investigation and clean up costs, resulting from the environmental contamination. Environmental laws also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos. Some of our properties may contain asbestos containing building materials. In addition, some of our properties are leased or have been leased, in part, to owners and operators of businesses that use, store, or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances. Further, certain of our properties are on, adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, or upon which others have engaged, are engaged or may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances. From time to time, we may acquire properties, or interests in properties, with known adverse environmental conditions where we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior risk adjusted return. In such an instance, we underwrite the costs of environmental investigation, clean up and monitoring into the acquisition cost and obtain appropriate environmental insurance for the property. Further, in connection with certain divested properties, we have agreed to remain responsible for, and to bear the cost of, remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties. At the time of acquisition, we subject all of our properties to a Phase I or similar environmental assessments by independent environmental consultants and we may have additional Phase II testing performed upon consultants recommendation. These environmental assessments have not revealed, and we are not aware of, any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. Nonetheless, it is possible that the assessments did not reveal all environmental liabilities and that there are material environmental liabilities unknown to us, or that known environmental conditions may give rise to liabilities that are greater than we anticipated. 51 Further, our properties current environmental condition may be affected by customers, the condition of land, operations in the vicinity of the properties (such as releases from underground storage tanks), or by unrelated third parties. If the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations exceed our budgets for these items, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RISKS OUR FAILURE TO QUALIFY AS A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST WOULD HAVE SERIOUS ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS. We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1997. We currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code and believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify. Qualification as a real estate investment trust requires us to satisfy numerous requirements (some on an annual and others on a quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. For example, in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we must derive at least 95% of our gross income in any year from qualifying sources. In addition, we must pay dividends to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis. These provisions and the applicable treasury regulations are more complicated in our case because we hold our assets through the operating partnership. Legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a real estate investment trust or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. However, we are not aware of any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect our ability to qualify as a real estate investment trust. If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment trust for the four taxable years following the year in which we lost qualification. If we lose our real estate investment trust status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved. In addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. CERTAIN PROPERTY TRANSFERS MAY GENERATE PROHIBITED TRANSACTION INCOME, RESULTING IN A PENALTY TAX ON GAIN ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE TRANSACTION. From time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. Under the Internal Revenue Code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100% penalty tax. Since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are treated as prohibited transactions. However, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. While we believe that the Internal Revenue Service would not prevail in any such dispute, if the IRS were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction. In addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes. 52 RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR DEPENDENCE ON KEY PERSONNEL We depend on the efforts of our executive officers. While we believe that we could find suitable replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OWNERSHIP OF OUR STOCK LIMITATIONS IN OUR CHARTER AND BYLAWS COULD PREVENT A CHANGE IN CONTROL. Certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay, defer, or prevent a change in control or other transaction that could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for the common stock. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock may be owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code to include certain entities) during the last half of a taxable year after the first taxable year for which a real estate investment trust election is made. Furthermore, our common stock must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a 12 month taxable year (or a proportionate part of a short tax year). In addition, if we, or an owner of 10% or more of our stock, actually or constructively owns 10% or more of one of our customers (or a tenant of any partnership in which we are a partner), then the rent received by us (either directly or through any such partnership) from that tenant will not be qualifying income for purposes of the real estate investment trust gross income tests of the Internal Revenue Code. To help us maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, we prohibit the ownership, actually or by virtue of the constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, by any single person, of more than 9.8% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the issued and outstanding shares of each of our common stock, series L preferred stock and series M preferred stock. We also prohibit the ownership, actually or constructively, of any shares of our series D, E, F, H, I, J and K preferred stock by any single person so that no such person, taking into account all of our stock so owned by such person, including any common stock or other series of preferred stock, may own in excess of 9.8% of our issued and outstanding capital stock. We refer to this limitation as the "ownership limit". Shares acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary. Any person who acquires shares in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any dividends on the shares or be entitled to vote the shares or receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the shares in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the shares or the amount realized from the sale. A transfer of shares in violation of the above limits may be void under certain circumstances. The ownership limit may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control and, therefore, could adversely affect our stockholders ability to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for the shares of our common stock in connection with such transaction. Our charter authorizes us to issue additional shares of common and preferred stock and to establish the preferences, rights and other terms of any series or class of preferred stock that we issue. Although our board of directors has no intention to do so at the present time, it could establish a series or class of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a transaction, including a change in control, that might involve a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. Our charter and bylaws and Maryland law also contain other provisions that may impede various actions by stockholders without approval of our board of directors, which in turn may delay, defer, or prevent a transaction, including a change in control. Those provisions in our charter and bylaws include: directors may be removed only for cause and only upon a two thirds vote of stockholders; our board can fix the number of directors within set limits (which limits are subject to change by our board), and fill vacant directorships upon the vote of a majority of the remaining directors, even though less than a quorum, or in the case of a vacancy resulting from an increase in the size of the board, a majority of the entire board; stockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or propose business for consideration at a stockholders meeting; and 53 the request of the holders of 50% or more of our common stock is necessary for stockholders to call a special meeting. Those provisions provided for under Maryland law include: a two thirds vote of stockholders is required to amend our charter; and stockholders may only act by written consent with the unanimous approval of all stockholders entitled to vote on the matter in question. In addition, our board could elect to adopt, without stockholder approval, certain other provisions under Maryland law that may impede a change in control. VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS AFFECT THE PRICE OF OUR STOCK. As with other publicly traded equity securities, the market price of our stock will depend upon various market conditions that are not within our control and may change from time to time, including: the extent of investor interest in us; the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate based companies); general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of our stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends; and terrorist activity may adversely affect the markets in which our securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending. Other factors such as governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws could also have a significant impact on the future market price of our stock. EARNINGS AND CASH DIVIDENDS, ASSET VALUE AND MARKET INTEREST RATES AFFECT THE PRICE OF OUR STOCK. As a real estate investment trust the market value of our equity securities, in general, is based primarily upon the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash dividends. Our equity securities market value is based secondarily upon the market value of our underlying real estate assets. For this reason, shares of our stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than our net asset value per share. To the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working capital reserves, or other purposes, these retained funds, while increasing the value of our underlying assets, may not correspondingly increase the market price of our stock. Our failure to meet the markets expectations with regard to future earnings and cash dividends likely would adversely affect the market price of our stock. Further, the distribution yield on the stock (as a percentage of the price of the stock) relative to market interest rates may also influence the price of our stock. An increase in market interest rates might lead prospective purchasers of our stock to expect a higher distribution yield, which would adversely affect our stocks market price. Additionally, if the market price of our stock declines significantly, then we might breach certain covenants with respect to our debt obligations, which could adversely affect our liquidity and ability to make future acquisitions and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. IF WE ISSUE ADDITIONAL SECURITIES, THEN THE INVESTMENT OF EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS WILL BE DILUTED. We have authority to issue shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities, and to cause the operating partnership to issue limited partnership units, in exchange for property or otherwise. Existing stockholders have no preemptive right to acquire any additional securities issued by the operating partnership or us and any issuance of additional equity securities could result in dilution of an existing stockholders investment. 54 WE COULD CHANGE OUR INVESTMENT AND FINANCING POLICIES WITHOUT A VOTE OF STOCKHOLDERS. Subject to our current investment policy to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust (unless a change is approved by our board of directors under certain circumstances), our board of directors determines our investment and financing policies, our growth strategy and our debt, capitalization, distribution and operating policies. Although our board of directors does not presently intend to revise or amend these strategies and policies, they may do so at any time without a vote of stockholders. Any such changes may not serve the interests of all stockholders and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations, including our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. SHARES AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE SALE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. The operating partnership and AMB Property II, L.P. had 4,763,790 common limited partnership units issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2003, which may be exchanged generally one year after their issuance on a one for one basis into shares of our common stock. In the future, the operating partnership or AMB Property II, L.P. may issue additional limited partnership units, and we may issue shares of common stock, in connection with the acquisition of properties or in private placements. These shares of common stock and the shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of limited partnership units may be sold in the public securities markets over time, pursuant to registration rights that we have granted, or may grant in connection with future issuances, or pursuant to Rule 144. In addition, common stock issued under our stock option and incentive plans may also be sold in the market pursuant to registration statements that we have filed or pursuant to Rule 144. As of December 31, 2003, under our stock option and incentive plans, we had reserved 16,761,873 shares of common stock for issuance (not including shares that we have already issued), had outstanding options to purchase 10,286,057 shares of common stock (net of forfeitures and 1,213,905 shares that we have issued upon the exercise of options) and had 974,222 restricted shares of common stock outstanding (net of 52,209 shares that have been forfeited). Future sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Further, the existence of the operating partnerships limited partnership units and the shares of our common stock reserved for issuance upon exchange of limited partnership units and the exercise of options, and registration rights referred to above, may adversely affect the terms upon which we are able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facility and other variable rate borrowings and our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2003, we had no interest rate caps or swaps. See "Item 2: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources Market Capitalization." The table below summarizes the market risks associated with our fixed and variable rate debt outstanding before unamortized debt premiums of $10.8 million as of December 31, 2003 (dollars in thousands): 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 THEREAFTER TOTAL Fixed rate debt(1)......... $96,425 $354,372 $168,961 $138,067 $365,496 $1,062,154 $2,185,475 Average interest rate...... 7.0% 7.0% 6.9% 7.1% 6.9% 6.7% 6.9% Variable rate debt(2)...... $ 2,045 $279,532 $ 51,898 $ 5,504 $ 5,637 $ 33,377 $ 377,993 Average interest rate...... 3.6% 1.9% 1.6% 3.8% 4.1% 4.1% 2.1% (1) Represents 85.3% of all outstanding debt. (2) Represents 14.7% of all outstanding debt. 55 If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased by 10% (or approximately 20 basis points), then the increase in interest expense on the variable rate debt would be $0.8 million annually. As of December 31, 2003, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt was $2,472.2 million based on our estimate of current market interest rates. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, variable rate debt comprised 14.7% and 9.3%, respectively, of all our outstanding debt. Variable rate debt was $378.0 million and $206.1 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2003 and 2002. The increase is due to a higher outstanding balance on our credit facility. This increase in our outstanding variable rate debt increases our risk associated with unfavorable interest rate fluctuations. Financial Instruments. We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income or income. For revenues or expenses denominated in non functional currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments in effect at December 31, 2003, were a forward contract hedging against adverse foreign exchange fluctuations in the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar and a put option hedging against adverse equity fluctuations affecting the value of stock warrants obtained from customers. The following table summarizes our financial instruments as of December 31, 2003: CARRYING FAIR RELATED DERIVATIVES AMOUNT VALUE (IN THOUSANDS) MXN/USD Forward Contract (USD short): Expected Maturity March 30, 2004.......................... Contract Amount (MXN pesos)............................... 37,201 Forward Exchange Rate..................................... 10.86 Contract Amount (USD Dollars)............................. $ 3,426 Fair Value at December 31, 2003........................... $3,273 Put Option: Contract Amount........................................... $ 188 Fair Value at December 31, 2003........................... $ 57 Foreign Operations. Our exposure to market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries operating in the United States and Mexico. The functional currency for our subsidiaries operating outside North America is generally the local currency of the country in which the entity is located, mitigating the effect of foreign exchange gains and losses. Our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. We translate income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. Gains resulting from the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity and totaled $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Our foreign subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. In these instances, non monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2003, losses from remeasurement included in our results of operations were less than $0.1 million. We also record gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated. 56
