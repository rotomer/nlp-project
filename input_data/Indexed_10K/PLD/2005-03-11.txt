Item 7: Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources. 24 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations GENERAL You should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements. We commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company effective with the completion of our initial public offering on November 26, 1997, and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with our initial tax return for the year ended December 31, 1997. AMB Property Corporation and AMB Property, L.P. were formed shortly before the consummation of our initial public offering. Managements Overview We generate revenue and earnings primarily from rent received from customers under long term (generally three to ten years) operating leases at our properties, including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs, and from partnership distributions and fees from our private capital business. We also derive earnings from the strategic disposition of assets and from the disposition of projects under our development for sale or contribution program. Our long term growth is dependent on our ability to maintain and increase occupancy rates or increase rental rates at our properties and our ability to continue to acquire and develop new properties. National industrial markets improved significantly during 2004 when compared with market conditions in 2003. The positive trend in demand began in the second quarter of 2004 and reversed 14 prior quarters of negatively trending, or rising, space availability. We believe the protracted period of rising availability created a difficult leasing environment; however investor demand for industrial property (as evidenced by our observation of strong national sales volumes and declining acquisition capitalization rates) has remained consistently strong. We believe we capitalized on the demand for acquisition property by accelerating the repositioning of our portfolio through the disposition of non core properties. We plan to continue selling selected assets on an opportunistic basis but believe we have substantially achieved our repositioning goals. Property dispositions result in reinvestment capacity and trigger gain/loss recognition, but also create near term earnings dilution if the capital cannot be redeployed effectively. We experienced such near term dilution in 2004. However, we believe that the repositioning of our portfolio will benefit our stockholders in the long term. The table below summarizes our leasing activity for 2004 and 2003: U.S. Hub and Total Other Total/Weighted Property Data Gateway Markets(1) Markets(2) Average For the year ended December 31, 2004: % of total rentable square feet 74.1 % 25.9 % 100.0 % Occupancy percentage at year end 95.0 % 94.2 % 94.8 % Same space square footage leased 13,932,213 3,553,563 17,485,776 Rent increases (decreases) on renewals and rollovers (15.3 )% (3.6 )% (13.2 )% For the year ended December 31, 2003: % of total rentable square feet 75.0 % 25.0 % 100.0 % Occupancy percentage at year end 93.5 % 91.9 % 93.1 % Same space square footage leased 13,636,050 3,636,967 17,273,017 Rent increases (decreases) on renewals and rollovers (12.7 )% 1.7 % (10.1 )% 25 (1) Our U.S. hub and gateway markets include on tarmac and Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas/ Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Northern New Jersey/ New York City, the San Francisco Bay Area, Miami and Seattle. (2) Our total other markets include other domestic target markets, other non target markets, international target markets and retail. We observed two positive trends nationally for industrial real estate during the year ended December 31, 2004, supported by data provided by Torto Wheaton Research. First, national industrial space availability declined 70 basis points during the year from 11.6% to 10.9%. This decrease in national industrial space availability occurred in the last three quarters of 2004, reversing the trend of the prior 14 quarters in which national industrial space availability increased on average 36 basis points per quarter. Second, national absorption of industrial space, defined as the net change in occupied stock as measured by square feet of completions less the change in available square feet, totaled approximately 175 million square feet in the year ended December 31, 2004, substantially exceeding the 20 million square feet of space absorbed in 2003 and well above the ten year historical average of 132 million square feet of space absorbed annually. In this improved environment, our industrial portfolios occupancy levels increased to 94.8% at December 31, 2004 from 93.1% at December 31, 2003, which we believe reflects higher levels of demand for industrial space generally and in our portfolio specifically. During the year ended December 31, 2004, our lease expirations totaled approximately 21.4 million square feet while commencements of new or renewed leases totaled approximately 24.3 million square feet, resulting in an increase in our occupancy level of approximately 170 basis points. Rents on industrial renewals and rollovers in our portfolio decreased 13.2% during the year ended December 31, 2004 as leases were entered into or renewed at rates consistent with what we believe to be current market levels. We believe this decline in rents on lease renewals and rollovers reflects trends in national industrial space availability. We believe that relatively high levels of national industrial space availability have caused market rents for industrial properties to decline between 10% and 20% from their peak levels in 2001 based on our research data; 47% of the space that rolled over in our portfolio in 2004 had commenced between 1999 and 2001. Rental rates in our portfolio declined at successively lower rates in each of the four quarters during 2004, which we believe indicates a stabilization of market rental rate levels. While the level of rental rate reduction varied by market, we achieved occupancy levels in our portfolio 570 basis points in excess of the national industrial market, as determined by Torto Wheaton Research, by pricing lease renewals and new leases with sensitivity to local market conditions. During periods of decreasing or stabilizing rental rates, we strove to sign leases with shorter terms to prevent locking in lower rent levels for long periods and to be prepared to sign new, longer term leases during periods of growing rental rates. When we sign leases of shorter duration, we attempt to limit overall leasing costs and capital expenditures by offering different grades of tenant improvement packages, appropriate to the lease term. We believe that development, renovation and expansion of well located, high quality industrial properties should generally continue to provide us with attractive investment opportunities at a higher rate of return than we may obtain from the purchase of existing properties. We believe that our development opportunities in Mexico and Japan are attractive given the current lack of supply of modern distribution facilities in the major metropolitan markets of these countries. Globally, we have increased our development pipeline from a low of $107.0 million at the end of 2002 to approximately $828.7 million at December 31, 2004. In addition to our committed development pipeline, we hold a total of 1,263 acres for future development or sale, of which 1,015 acres, 199 acres, 39 acres and ten acres in North America, Mexico, Asia and Europe, respectively, could support an aggregate of approximately 22.2 million square feet of additional development. Going forward, we believe that our co investment program with private capital investors will continue to serve as a significant source of revenues and capital for acquisitions and developments. Through these co investment joint ventures, we typically earn acquisition and development fees, asset management fees and priority distributions, as well as promoted interests and incentive distributions based on the performance of the co investment joint ventures; however, there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so. Through contribution of development properties to our co investment joint ventures, we expect to recognize value 26 creation from our development pipeline. As of December 31, 2004, we owned approximately 40.8 million square feet of our properties (36.8% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our co investment joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. By 2007, we plan to have approximately 15% of our portfolio (based on consolidated annualized base rent) invested in international markets. Our North American target markets outside of the United States currently include Guadalajara, Mexico City, Monterrey and Toronto. Our European target markets currently include Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt, London, Lyon, Madrid and Paris. Our Asian target markets currently include Beijing, Nagoya, Osaka, the Pearl River Delta, Shanghai, Singapore and Tokyo. It is possible that our target markets will change over time to reflect experience, market opportunities, customer needs and changes in global distribution patterns. As of December 31, 2004, our international operating properties comprised 4.4% of our consolidated annualized base rent. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust, we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income. As a result, we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our on going operations to the same extent that other corporations that are not real estate investment trusts can. We must continue to raise capital in both the debt and equity markets to fund our working capital needs, acquisitions and developments. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for a complete discussion of the sources of our capital. Summary of Key Transactions in 2004 During the year ended December 31, 2004, we completed the following capital deployment transactions: Acquired 64 buildings in the United States, Mexico, Europe and Asia, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet, for $695.2 million, including $261.0 million invested through four of our co investment joint ventures; Commenced 19 development projects in the United States, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, totaling 6.1 million square feet with an estimated total investment of approximately $648.5 million (using exchange rates in effect at applicable quarter end and year end dates); Acquired 640 acres of land for industrial warehouse development in various U.S. markets and Mexico City for approximately $68.3 million; Sold seven land parcels and six development projects available for sale, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $40.4 million; and Divested ourselves of 21 industrial buildings, two retail centers and one office building, aggregating approximately 3.1 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $200.3 million. See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our acquisition, development and disposition activity. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we completed the following capital markets and other financing transactions: Obtained long term secured debt financings for our co investment joint ventures totaling $243.5 million at an average rate of 5.0%; Obtained $129.2 million of debt (using exchange rates in effect at applicable quarter end dates) with a weighted average interest rate of 4.5% for international acquisitions, net of the financing for the AMB Ohta Distribution Center development; Completed the early renewal of the operating partnerships senior unsecured revolving line of credit in the amount of $500.0 million. The three year credit facility includes a multi currency component under which up to $250.0 million can be drawn in Yen, Euros or British Pounds Sterling; 27 Entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement through AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating partnership, providing for loans or letters of credit in a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of up to 24 billion Yen (approximately $233.8 million in U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2004); Closed on a 20 billion Yen financing (approximately $195 million U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2004) for the AMB Ohta Distribution Center development project in Japan, of which 14 billion Yen ($136 million U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2004) has been funded. We locked in the interest rate on 65% of the financing for the full eight year term at closing. During construction, the fixed rate portion is locked at 1.9% and upon stabilization, the fixed rate will be 2.4%; Formed AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open ended co investment joint venture, with $136.5 million of equity from co investment partners to invest in properties in the United States; and Formed an unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, with Industrial (Mexico) JV Pte Ltd, a real estate investment subsidiary of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, with an equity commitment of $200 million to invest in properties in Mexico, in which we retain a 20% interest. We contributed $71.5 million of operating properties and recently completed development projects in Mexico and when combined with our equity commitment and leverage, the venture has an investment capacity of approximately $715 million. This is our first international co investment joint venture. See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 6, 9 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our capital markets transactions. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Investments in Real Estate. Investments in real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. We also record at acquisition an intangible asset or liability for the value attributable to above or below market leases, in place leases and lease origination costs for all acquisitions. Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a property by property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable. Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying amount of the property. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future market conditions and the availability of capital. Examples of certain situations that could affect future cash flows of a property may include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in occupancy; unforeseen bankruptcy, lease termination and move out of a major customer; or a significant decrease in annual base rents of that property. If impairment analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying amount of our long lived assets could occur in the future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings. 28 Revenue Recognition. We record rental revenue from operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts, security deposits and letters of credit, then we may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our customers on an on going basis by reviewing their financial condition periodically as appropriate. Each period we review our outstanding accounts receivable, including straight line rents, for doubtful accounts and provide allowances as needed. We also record lease termination fees when a customer has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us. If a customer remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement, the applicable termination fees are deferred and recognized over the term of such customers occupancy. Property Dispositions. We report real estate dispositions in three separate categories on our consolidated statements of operations. First, when we divest a portion of our interests in real estate entities or properties, gains from the sale represent the interests acquired by third party investors for cash. Second, we dispose of value added conversion projects and build to suit and speculative development projects for which we have not generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable. Lastly, beginning in 2002, SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, required us to separately report as discontinued operations the historical operating results attributable to operating properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the properties. The consolidated statements of operations for prior periods are also adjusted to conform with this classification. There is no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial position, net income or cash flows. In all cases, gains and losses are recognized using the full accrual method of accounting. Gains relating to transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met. Joint Ventures. We hold interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. Our joint venture investments do not meet the variable interest entity criteria under FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. Therefore, we determine consolidation based on standards set forth in EITF 96 16, Investors Accounting for an Investee When the Investor Has a Majority of the Voting Interest but the Minority Shareholder or Shareholders Have Certain Approval or Veto Rights, and Statement of Position 78 9, Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures. Based on the guidance set forth in these pronouncements, we consolidate certain joint venture investments because we exercise significant control over major operating decisions, such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, asset management, investment activity and changes in financing. For joint ventures where we do not exercise significant control over major operating and management decisions, but where we exercise significant influence, we use the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. Real Estate Investment Trust. As a real estate investment trust, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes in the U.S. if we meet minimum distribution, income, asset and shareholder tests. However, some of our subsidiaries may be subject to federal and state taxes. In addition, foreign entities may also be subject to the taxes of the host country. An income tax allocation is required to be estimated on our taxable income arising from our taxable REIT subsidiaries and international entities. A deferred tax component could arise based upon the differences in GAAP versus tax income for items such as depreciation and gain recognition. However, we believe deferred tax is an immaterial component of our consolidated balance sheet. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The analysis below includes changes attributable to same store growth, acquisitions, development activity and divestitures. Same store properties are those that we owned during both the current and prior year reporting periods, excluding development properties prior to being stabilized subsequent to December 31, 2002 29 (generally defined as properties that are 90% leased or properties for which we have held a certificate of occupancy or where building has been substantially complete for at least 12 months). As of December 31, 2004, same store industrial properties consisted of properties aggregating approximately 74.5 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2003 consisted of 82 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.5 million square feet. During 2004, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 29 industrial buildings, two retail centers and one office, aggregating approximately 4.4 million square feet. In 2003, property divestitures consisted of 48 industrial buildings and two retail centers, aggregating approximately 5.3 million square feet. Our future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition of additional properties and dispositions. Our future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical results. For the Years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 (dollars in millions) Revenues 2004 2003 $ Change % Change Rental revenues U.S. industrial: Same store $ 531.8 $ 535.4 $ (3.6 ) (0.7 )% 2003 acquisitions 47.8 14.6 33.2 227.4 % 2004 acquisitions 25.9 25.9 % Development 7.8 7.8 % Other industrial 10.3 6.3 4.0 63.5 % International industrial 25.6 6.1 19.5 319.7 % Retail 3.6 3.1 0.5 16.1 % Total rental revenues 652.8 573.3 79.5 13.9 % Private capital income 12.9 13.3 (0.4 ) (3.0 )% Total revenues $ 665.7 $ 586.6 $ 79.1 13.5 % The decrease in U.S. industrial same store rental revenues was primarily driven by decreased rental rates in various markets. Across the portfolio, these and other factors accounted for approximately $6.9 million of the change from the prior year. This decrease was partially offset by a decrease in allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately $3.3 million. Industrial same store occupancy was 95.3% at December 31, 2004 and 93.0% at December 31, 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2004, rents in the same store portfolio decreased 14.7% on industrial renewals and rollovers (cash basis) on 16.2 million square feet leased due to decreases in market rates. The properties acquired during 2003 consisted of 82 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.5 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2003 and 2004, we continued to acquire properties in France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial revenues. The decrease in private capital income was due to greater incentive fees earned in the prior year. 30 Costs and Expenses 2004 2003 $ Change % Change Property operating costs: Rental expenses $ 94.7 $ 84.7 $ 10.0 11.8 % Real estate taxes 73.8 67.3 6.5 9.7 % Total property operating costs $ 168.5 $ 152.0 $ 16.5 10.9 % Property operating costs U.S. industrial: Same store $ 141.1 $ 141.4 $ (0.3 ) (0.2 )% 2003 acquisitions 11.0 3.6 7.4 205.6 % 2004 acquisitions 6.9 6.9 % Development 1.5 3.6 (2.1 ) (58.3 )% Other industrial 1.8 1.8 % International industrial 4.9 0.4 4.5 1,125.0 % Retail 1.3 1.2 0.1 8.3 % Total property operating costs 168.5 152.0 16.5 10.9 % Depreciation and amortization 160.0 132.2 27.8 21.0 % Impairment losses 5.3 (5.3 ) (100.0 )% General and administrative 59.0 46.4 12.6 27.2 % Fund costs 1.7 0.8 0.9 112.5 % Total costs and expenses $ 389.2 $ 336.7 $ 52.5 15.6 % Same store properties operating expenses showed a decrease of $0.3 million from the prior year due to decreased non reimbursable expenses. The 2003 acquisitions consisted of 82 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.5 million square feet. The 2004 acquisitions consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2003 and 2004, we continued to acquire properties in France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial property operating costs. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The 2003 impairment loss was on investments in real estate and leasehold interests. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased stock based compensation expense of $2.3 million and additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international and development expansions. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our co investment joint ventures. The increase in fund costs was due to additional formation of co investment joint ventures in 2004. Other Income and (Expenses) 2004 2003 $ Change % Change Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures, net $ 3.8 $ 5.5 $ (1.7 ) (30.9 )% Interest and other income 4.0 4.0 % Gains from dispositions of real estate interests 5.2 7.4 (2.2 ) (29.7 )% Development profits, net of taxes 8.5 14.4 (5.9 ) (41.0 )% Interest expense, including amortization (157.9 ) (146.2 ) 11.7 8.0 % Total other income and (expenses), net $ (136.4 ) $ (114.9 ) $ 21.5 18.7 % The $1.7 million decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was primarily due to decreased occupancy at a property held by one of our joint ventures and increased non reimbursable expenses. 31 This decrease was offset by the receipt of a lease termination fee at the above mentioned property in Chicago in the first quarter of 2004. The gains from dispositions of real estate (not classified as discontinued operations) in 2004, resulted from our contribution of $71.5 million in operating properties to our newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC. The gains from disposition of real estate (not classified as discontinued operations) in 2003, resulted from our contribution of $94.0 million in operating properties to our unconsolidated co investment joint venture, Industrial Fund I, LLC. The decrease in development profits, net of taxes, resulted from delayed gains on development sales. The increase in interest expense, including amortization, was due to the issuance of additional unsecured debt under our 2002 medium term note program, increased borrowings on the unsecured credit facilities, and additional secured debt borrowings in our co investment joint ventures. Discontinued Operations 2004 2003 $ Change % Change Income attributable to discontinued operations, net of minority interests $ 5.6 $ 18.9 $ (13.3 ) (70.4 )% Gains from dispositions of real estate, net of minority interests 42.0 42.9 (0.9 ) (2.1 )% Total discontinued operations $ 47.6 $ 61.8 $ (14.2 ) (23.0 )% During 2004, we divested ourselves of 21 industrial buildings, two retail centers and one office building, aggregating approximately 3.1 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $200.3 million, with a resulting net gain of $42.0 million. During 2003, we divested ourselves of 24 industrial buildings and two retail centers, aggregating approximately 2.8 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $272.3 million, with a resulting net gain of $42.9 million. The decrease in income attributable to discontinued operations reflects the fact that properties were held for only a partial period in 2004 versus an entire year in 2003. Preferred Stock 2004 2003 $ Change % Change Preferred stock dividends $ (7.1 ) $ (7.0 ) $ 0.1 1.4 % Preferred stock and unit (issuance costs or premium) (5.4 ) (5.4 ) (100.0 )% Total preferred stock $ (7.1 ) $ (12.4 ) $ (5.3 ) (42.7 )% In July 2003, we redeemed all 3,995,800 outstanding shares of our 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and recognized a reduction of income available to common stockholders of $3.7 million for the original issuance costs. In addition, on November 26, 2003, the operating partnership redeemed all 1,300,000 of its outstanding 85/8% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Partnership Units and we recognized a reduction of income available to common stockholders of $1.7 million for the original issuance costs. In June and November 2003, we issued 2,000,000 shares of 6.5% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and 2,300,000 shares of 6.75% Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, respectively. The timing of the newly issued shares contributed to the increase in preferred stock dividends. 32 For the Years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 (dollars in millions) Revenues 2003 2002 $ Change % Change Rental revenues U.S. industrial: Same store $ 535.4 $ 529.2 $ 6.2 1.2 % 2003 acquisitions 14.6 14.6 % Development 7.8 3.9 3.9 100.0 % Other industrial 6.3 13.1 (6.8 ) (51.9 )% International industrial 6.1 0.7 5.4 771.4 % Retail 3.1 5.1 (2.0 ) (39.2 )% Total rental revenues 573.3 552.0 21.3 3.9 % Private capital income 13.3 11.2 2.1 18.8 % Total revenues $ 586.6 $ 563.2 $ 23.4 4.2 % The increase in U.S. industrial same store revenues were primarily driven by increased rental revenues in our on tarmac and Los Angeles markets. These increases were partially offset by decreased rental income in our San Francisco Bay Area market and an increase in our allowances for doubtful accounts of $4.0 million across the portfolio. The properties acquired during 2003 consisted of 82 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.5 million square feet. The development revenue increase reflects the timing of the stabilization of properties in the development pipeline. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2003, we acquired properties in Mexico and France, resulting in increased international industrial revenues. The increase in private capital income was primarily due to incentive distributions earned from AMB Partners II, L.P.

The 2003 acquisitions consist of 82 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.5 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate, partially offset by a reduction of $2.1 million for the recovery, through the settlement of a lawsuit, of capital expenditures paid in prior years. The 2003 impairment loss was on investments in real estate and leasehold interests. The 2002 impairment included losses for lease cost write offs of $1.7 million and an impairment on a portion of our planned property contributions of $1.2 million. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased stock based compensation expense of $2.8 million, partially offset by decreased personnel costs and taxes. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our co investment joint ventures.

Gains from dispositions of real estate (not classified as discontinued operations) in 2003 resulted from our contribution of $94.0 million in operating properties to our unconsolidated co investment joint venture, Industrial Fund I, LLC, in February 2003. We recognized a gain of $7.4 million on the contribution, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed properties acquired by the third party investors for cash. During 2002, we sold two industrial buildings and one retail center, aggregating approximately 0.8 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $50.6 million, with a resulting loss of $0.8 million. In June 2002, we also contributed $76.9 million in operating properties to our consolidated co investment joint venture, AMB SGP, L.P. We recognized a gain of $3.3 million, representing the sale of our interests in the properties acquired by the third party investors for cash. In November 2002, our joint venture partner in AMB Partners II, L.P. increased its ownership from 50% to 80% by acquiring 30% of the operating partnerships interest in AMB Partners II, L.P. We recognized a gain of $6.3 million on the sale of the operating partnerships 30% interest. The increase in development profits, net of taxes, resulted from an increased sales volume of $57.8 million in 2003.

During 2002, we divested ourselves of 56 industrial buildings, one retail center and an 34 undeveloped land parcel, aggregating approximately 4.9 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $193.4 million, with a resulting net gain of $10.6 million.

In addition, on November 26, 2003, the operating partnership redeemed all 1,300,000 of its outstanding 85/8% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Partnership Units and we recognized a reduction of income available to common stockholders of $1.7 million for the original issuance costs. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Balance Sheet Strategy. In general, we use unsecured lines of credit, unsecured notes, preferred stock and common equity (issued by us and or the operating partnership and its subsidiaries) to capitalize our 100% owned assets. Over time, we plan to retire non recourse, secured debt encumbering our 100% owned assets and replace that debt with unsecured notes. In managing our co investment joint ventures, in general, we use non recourse, secured debt to capitalize our co investment joint ventures. We currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for acquisitions, development, expansion and renovation of properties will include: retained earnings and cash flow from operations; borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities; other forms of secured or unsecured financing; proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the operating partnership (including issuances of limited partnership units in the operating partnership or its subsidiaries); net proceeds from divestitures of properties; private capital from co investment partners; and contribution of properties and completed development projects to our co investment joint ventures. We currently expect that our principal funding requirements will include: working capital; development, expansion and renovation of properties; acquisitions, including our global expansion; debt service; and dividends and distributions on outstanding common and preferred stock and limited partnership units. We believe that our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow from operations, borrowings available under our unsecured credit facilities and our ability to access private and public debt and equity capital, are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. 35 Capital Resources Property Contributions. In December 2004, we contributed $71.5 million in operating properties, consisting of eight industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 1.3 million square feet, to our newly formed unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, with Industrial (Mexico) JV Pte Ltd, a real estate investment subsidiary of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, and recognized a gain of $7.2 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed properties acquired by the third party co investor for cash. Property Divestitures. During 2004, we divested ourselves of 21 industrial buildings, two retail centers and one office building, aggregating approximately 3.1 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $200.3 million, with a resulting net gain of $42.0 million. Development Sales and Contributions. During 2004, we sold seven land parcels and six development projects as part of our development for sale program, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet for an aggregate price of $40.4 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $6.5 million. During 2004, we also contributed one completed development project into a newly formed unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $2.0 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. Properties Held for Divestiture. As of December 31, 2004, we held for divestiture 25 industrial buildings and one undeveloped land parcel, which are not in our core markets, do not meet our current strategic objectives or which we have included as part of our development for sale program. The divestitures of these properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. As of December 31, 2004, the net carrying value of the properties held for divestiture was $87.3 million. Expected net sales proceeds exceed the net carrying value of the properties. Co investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. We generally consolidate these joint ventures for financial reporting purposes because they are not variable interest entities and because we are the sole managing general partner and control all major operating decisions. However in certain cases, our co investment joint ventures are unconsolidated. During 2004, we formed AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. with $136.5 million of equity from co investment partners to invest in properties in the United States. During 2004, we contributed $71.5 million in operating properties, consisting of eight industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 1.3 million square feet, to our newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC. Third party equity interests in the joint ventures are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2004, we owned approximately 40.8 million square feet of our properties (36.8% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated co investment joint ventures and 4.6 million square feet of our properties through our other consolidated joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. 36 Our co investment joint ventures at December 31, 2004 (dollars in thousands): Our Approximate Ownership Original Planned Consolidated co investment Joint Venture Joint Venture Partner Percentage Capitalization(1) AMB/Erie, L.P.

We have authorized for issuance 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which the following series were designated as of December 31, 2004: 1,595,337 shares of series D cumulative redeemable preferred stock; 220,440 shares of series E cumulative redeemable preferred stock; 267,439 shares of series F cumulative redeemable preferred stock; 840,000 shares of series H cumulative redeemable preferred stock; 510,000 shares of series I cumulative redeemable preferred stock; 800,000 shares of series J cumulative redeemable preferred stock; 800,000 shares of series K cumulative redeemable preferred stock; 2,300,000 shares of series L cumulative redeemable preferred stock; and 2,300,000 shares of series M cumulative redeemable preferred stock. On June 23, 2003, we issued and sold 2,000,000 shares of 6.5% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at a price of $25.00 per share. Dividends are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable 37 quarterly in arrears at a rate per share equal to $1.625 per annum. The series L preferred stock is redeemable by us on or after June 23, 2008, subject to certain conditions, for cash at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, if any, to the redemption date. We contributed the net proceeds of approximately $48.0 million to the operating partnership, and in exchange, the operating partnership issued to us 2,000,000 6.5% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units. The operating partnership used the proceeds, in addition to proceeds previously contributed to the operating partnership from other equity issuances, to redeem all 3,995,800 of its 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units from us on July 28, 2003. We, in turn, used those proceeds to redeem all 3,995,800 of our 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for $100.2 million, including all accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, to the redemption date. On July 14, 2003, AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased, from an unrelated third party, 66,300 of its series F preferred units for $3.3 million, including accrued and unpaid dividends. On November 25, 2003, we issued and sold 2,300,000 shares of 6.75% Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at $25.00 per share. Dividends are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable quarterly in arrears at a rate per share equal to $1.6875 per annum. The series M preferred stock is redeemable by us on or after November 25, 2008, subject to certain conditions, for cash at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, if any, to the redemption date. We contributed the net proceeds of $55.4 million to the operating partnership, and in exchange, the operating partnership issued to us 2,300,000 6.75% Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units. On November 26, 2003, the operating partnership redeemed all 1,300,000 of its outstanding 85/8% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Partnership Units, for an aggregate redemption price of $65.6 million, including accrued and unpaid dividends. On September 24, 2004, AMB Property II, L.P., a partnership in which Texas AMB I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and our indirect subsidiary, owns an approximate 1.0% general partnership interest and the operating partnership owns an approximate 99% common limited partnership interest, issued 729,582 5.0% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units at a price of $50.00 per unit. The series N preferred units were issued to Robert Pattillo Properties, Inc. in exchange for the contribution of certain parcels of land that are located in multiple markets to AMB Property II, L.P. Beginning September 25, 2006 and until and including September 25, 2009, the series N preferred units may be redeemed by AMB Property II, L.P. at a redemption price equal to 99.5% of the original $50.00 per unit capital contribution, plus all accrued and unpaid distributions to the date of redemption, which shall be paid solely out of capital contributed to AMB Property II, L.P. by Texas AMB I, LLC or the operating partnership (other than with respect to the accumulated but unpaid distributions). Pursuant to a Put Agreement, dated September 24, 2004, by and between Robert Pattillo Properties, Inc. and the operating partnership, beginning on June 1, 2005 and until January 15, 2006, the holders of the series N preferred units will have the right to sell all, but not less than all, of such units to the operating partnership (or to certain designees) at a price equal to $50.00 per unit, plus all accrued and unpaid distributions to the date of such sale. As of December 31, 2004, $90.8 million in preferred units with a rate of 7.75%, issued by the operating partnership, were callable under the terms of the partnership agreement. In December 2003, our board of directors approved a new two year common stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of our common stock. We did not repurchase or retire any shares of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2004. In December 2001, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $100.0 million worth of our common and preferred stock. In December 2002, our board of directors increased the 2001 repurchase program to $200.0 million. The 2001 stock repurchase program expired in December 2003. During 2002, we repurchased 2,651,600 shares of our common stock for $69.4 million, including commissions. In July 2002, we also repurchased 4,200 shares of our series A preferred stock for an aggregate cost of $0.1 million, including accrued and unpaid dividends. 38 During 2003, the operating partnership redeemed 226,145 of its common limited partnership units for cash and 2,000 of its common limited partnership units for shares of our common stock. During 2002, the operating partnership redeemed 122,640 of its common limited partnership units for shares of our common stock. In November 2003, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, also issued 145,548 of its class B common limited partnership units in connection with a property acquisition. Debt. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, we presently intend to operate with an our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio of approximately 45% or less. As of December 31, 2004, our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio was 37.8%. Our definition of our share of total market capitalization is our share of total debt plus preferred equity liquidation preferences plus market equity. See footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratio table contained in Part II, Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Liquidity and Capital Resources for our definition of market equity and footnote 2 to such table for our definition of our share of total debt. However, we typically finance our co investment joint ventures with secured debt at a loan to value ratio of 50 65% per our joint venture partnership agreements. Additionally, we currently intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these policies, however, our organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our management could alter or eliminate these policies without stockholder approval or circumstances could arise that could render us unable to comply with these policies. As of December 31, 2004, the aggregate principal amount of our secured debt was $1.9 billion, excluding unamortized debt premiums of $10.8 million. Of the $1.9 billion of secured debt, $1.4 billion is secured by properties in our joint ventures. The secured debt is generally non recourse and bears interest at rates varying from 0.7% to 10.4% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 6.3%) and has final maturity dates ranging from April 2005 to November 2022. As of December 31, 2004, $1.8 billion of the secured debt obligations bears interest at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 6.5% while the remaining $96.6 million bears interest at variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 2.5%). As of December 31, 2004, the operating partnership had issued an aggregate of $1.0 billion in unsecured senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% and had an average term of 4.6 years. These unsecured senior debt securities include $400.0 million in notes, issued in June 1998, $400.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2000 medium term note program, and $225.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2002 medium term note program. As of December 31, 2004, the operating partnerships 2002 medium term note program has a remaining capacity of $175.0 million. The operating partnership intends to continue to issue medium term notes, guaranteed by us, under the 2002 program from time to time and as market conditions permit. In August 2000, the operating partnership commenced a medium term note program and subsequently issued $400.0 million of medium term notes with a weighted average interest rate of 7.3%. These notes mature between December 2005 and September 2011 and are guaranteed by us. In May 2002, the operating partnership commenced a new medium term note program for the issuance of up to $400.0 million in principal amount of medium term notes, which will be guaranteed by us. On November 10, 2003, the operating partnership issued $75.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes to Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America under the 2002 medium term note program. We guaranteed the principal amount and interest on the notes, which mature on November 1, 2013, and bear interest at 5.53% per annum. Teachers has agreed that until November 10, 2005, the operating partnership can require Teachers to return the notes to it for cancellation for an obligation of equal dollar amount under a first mortgage loan to be secured by properties determined by the operating partnership, except that in the event the ratings on operating partnerships senior unsecured debt are downgraded by two ratings agencies to BBB , the operating partnership will only have ten days after the last of these downgrades to exercise this right. During the period when the operating partnership can exercise its cancellation right and 39 until any mortgage loans close, Teachers has agreed not to sell, contract to sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of, any portion of the notes. On December 9, 2004, we returned $21.1 million of these senior unsecured notes for cancellation and Teachers issued a first mortgage loan in this principal amount that is secured by certain properties in one of our joint ventures. In June 1998, the operating partnership issued $400.0 million of unsecured senior debt securities. Interest on the unsecured senior debt securities is payable semi annually. The 2015 notes are putable and callable in September 2005. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to its senior debt securities. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then our cash flow may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Credit Facilities. On June 1, 2004, the operating partnership completed the early renewal of its senior unsecured revolving line of credit in the amount of $500.0 million. We remain a guarantor of the operating partnerships obligations under the credit facility. The three year credit facility includes a multi currency component under which up to $250.0 million can be drawn in Yen, Euros or British Pounds Sterling. The line, which matures in June 2007 and carries a one year extension option, can be increased up to $700.0 million upon certain conditions, and replaces the operating partnerships previous $500.0 million credit facility that was to mature in December 2005. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the operating partnerships long term debt rating, which is currently 60 basis points with an annual facility fee of 20 basis points, based on the current credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt. The operating partnership uses its unsecured credit facility principally for acquisitions, funding development activity and general working capital requirements. The total amount available under the credit facility fluctuates based upon the borrowing base, as defined in the agreement governing the credit facility, which is generally based upon the value of our unencumbered properties. As of December 31, 2004, the outstanding balance on the credit facility was $235.1 million and the remaining amount available was $251.0 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $13.9 million (excluding the additional $200.0 million of potential additional capacity). The outstanding balance included borrowings denominated in Euros and Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2004, would equal approximately $114.6 million and $92.5 million in U.S. dollars, respectively. As of December 31, 2004, we had an additional outstanding balance of $27.8 million on other credit facilities. On June 29, 2004, AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating partnership, entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement providing for loans or letters of credit in a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of up to 24 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2004, equaled approximately $233.8 million U.S. dollars. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K. under the revolving credit facility, as well as the obligations of any other entity in which the operating partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest, and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the revolving credit agreement. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and for other real estate purposes in Japan. Generally, borrowers under the revolving credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the revolving credit facility with certain real estate assets or equity in entities holding such real estate assets. The revolving credit facility matures in June 2007 and has a one year extension option, which is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.25% of the outstanding commitments under the facility at that time. The rate on the borrowings is generally TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the current credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt and is currently 60 basis points. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, payable in quarterly amounts, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt, and is currently 20 basis points of the outstanding commitments under the facility. As of December 31, 2004, 40 the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2004, was $88.8 million in U.S. dollars. On November 24, 2004, AMB Tokai TMK, a Japanese subsidiary of the operating partnership, entered into a secured multi advance project financing, providing for loans in a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of up to 20 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2004, would equal approximately $194.9 million U.S. dollars. The financing agreement is among AMB Tokai TMK, us, the operating partnership, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and a syndicate of banks. We, along with the operating partnership, jointly and severally guarantee AMB Tokai TMKs obligations under the financing agreement, pursuant to a guaranty of payment executed in connection with the project financing. The financing is secured by a mortgage on certain real property located in Tokai, Tokyo, Japan, and matures on October 31, 2006 with a one year extension option. The rate on the borrowings will generally be TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt and is currently 60 basis points per annum, except that AMB Tokai TMK has purchased from Sumitomo an interest rate swap, which has fixed the interest rate payable on a principal amount equal to 13 billion Yen at 1.32% per annum plus the applicable margin. In addition, there is an annual commitment fee based on unused commitments, payable quarterly, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt, and is currently 20 basis points of the amount of unused commitments. The financing agreement contains customary and other affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. In addition, Sumitomo, AMB Tokai TMK and the operating partnership signed a commitment letter on November 24, 2004, pursuant to which Sumitomo committed to purchase bonds that may be issued by AMB Tokai TMK in an amount between 10 billion Yen and 15 billion Yen (such amount to be determined by AMB Tokai TMK). The bonds would be secured by the AMB Ohta Distribution Center and would generally accrue interest at a rate of TIBOR plus 1.10% per annum; because the swap purchased by AMB Tokai TMK from Sumitomo is coterminous with the maturity date of the proposed bonds, AMB Tokai TMK will have fixed the interest rate payable on, in general, a principal amount equal to 13 billion Yen at 2.42% per annum. The bonds, if issued, would mature on October 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2004, the outstanding balance on this financing agreement was 14 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2004, equaled approximately $136.4 million U.S. dollars. Mortgages Receivable. Through a wholly owned subsidiary, we hold a mortgage loan receivable on AMB Pier One, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture. The note bears interest at 13.0% and matures in May 2026. As of December 31, 2004, the outstanding balance on the note was $12.9 million. We also hold a short term mortgage on a sold property totaling $0.8 million with an interest rate of 12.0%. The mortgage matures in November 2006.

(4) Our share of total book capitalization is defined as our share of total debt plus minority interests to preferred unitholders and limited partnership unitholders plus stockholders equity. Liquidity As of December 31, 2004, we had $109.4 million in cash and cash equivalents (of which $69.0 million was held by our consolidated co investment joint ventures), and $418.3 million of additional available 43 borrowings under our credit facilities. As of December 31, 2004, we had $37.2 million in restricted cash (of which $21.2 million was held by our consolidated co investment joint ventures). Our board of directors declared a regular cash dividend for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 of $0.425 per share of common stock, and the operating partnership announced its intention to pay a regular cash distribution for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 of $0.425 per common unit. The dividends and distributions were payable on January 7, 2005 to stockholders and unitholders of record on December 23, 2004. The series L and M preferred stock dividends were payable on January 17, 2005 to stockholders of record on January 6, 2005. The series E, F, J and K preferred unit quarterly distributions were payable on January 17, 2005. The series D, H and I preferred unit quarterly distributions were payable on December 27, 2004.

Series N preferred units $ 0.70 n/a n/a The anticipated size of our distributions, using only cash from operations, will not allow us to retire all of our debt as it comes due. Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Commitments Developments. In addition to recurring capital expenditures, which consist of building improvements and leasing costs incurred to renew or re tenant space, during 2004, we initiated 14 new industrial development projects in the United States and Mexico with a total estimated investment of $235.4 million, aggregating an estimated 3.1 million square feet, four new industrial developments in Japan and Singapore with a total expected investment of $368.8 million, aggregating approximately 2.7 million square feet, and one new industrial development in Europe with a total expected investment of $44.3 million, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet. As of December 31, 2004, we had 30 projects in our development pipeline representing a total estimated investment of $828.7 million upon completion, of which four industrial projects with a total of 1.2 million square feet and an aggregate estimated investment of $55.0 million upon completion are held in unconsolidated joint ventures. In addition, we held four development projects available for sale, representing a total estimated investment of $29.2 million upon completion. Of this total, $515.2 million had been funded as of December 31, 2004 and an estimated $342.7 million was required to 44 complete current and planned projects. We expect to fund these expenditures with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances, net proceeds from property divestitures and private capital from co investment partners, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow. Acquisitions. During 2004, we acquired 64 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet for a total expected investment of $695.2 million, of which we acquired 48 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 4.2 million square feet through three of our co investment joint ventures, for a total expected investment of $261.0 million. We generally fund our acquisitions through private capital contributions, borrowings under our credit facilities, cash, debt issuances and net proceeds from property divestitures. Lease Commitments. We have entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily on tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms from two to 58 years. These operating lease payments are amortized ratably over the terms of the related leases. Future minimum rental payments required under non cancelable operating leases in effect as of December 31, 2004 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2005 $ 10,810 2006 11,320 2007 11,280 2008 11,310 2009 11,169 Thereafter 222,437 Total $ 278,326 Co investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. As of December 31, 2004, we had investments in co investment joint ventures with a gross book value of $2.6 billion, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, and investments in an unconsolidated co investment joint venture of $9.5 million. As of December 31, 2004, we may make additional capital contributions to current and planned co investment joint ventures of up to $47.9 million. From time to time, we may raise additional equity commitments for AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open ended consolidated co investment joint venture formed in 2004 with institutional investors, which invest through a private real estate investment trust. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of this fund, we are obligated to contribute 20% of the total equity commitments to the fund until such time our total equity commitment is greater than $150 million, at which time, our obligation is reduced to 10% of the total equity commitments. We expect to fund these contributions with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances or net proceeds from property divestitures, which could adversely effect our cash flow. Captive Insurance Company. In December 2001, we formed a wholly owned captive insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., which provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the deductible under our third party policies. We capitalized Arcata National Insurance Ltd. in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata National Insurance Ltd. established annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss experience of our properties. Annually, we engage an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims, related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata National Insurance Ltd. may be adjusted based on this estimate. Premiums paid to Arcata National Insurance Ltd. have a retrospective component, so that if expenses, including losses and deductibles, are less than premiums collected, the excess may be returned to the property owners (and, in turn, as appropriate, to the customers) and conversely, subject to certain limitations, if expenses, including losses, are greater than premiums collected, an additional premium will be charged. As with all recoverable expenses, differences between estimated and actual insurance premiums are recognized in the subsequent year. Through this 45 structure, we believe that we have more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market. Potential Unknown Liabilities. Unknown liabilities may include the following: liabilities for clean up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to our formation transactions that had not been asserted prior to our formation transactions; accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; tax liabilities; and claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these entities.

As of December 31, 2004, we had provided approximately $33.6 million in letters of credit, of which $13.9 million was provided under the operating partnerships $500.0 million unsecured credit facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other commitments. Guarantees. Other than parent guarantees associated with the unsecured debt of the operating partnership, as of December 31, 2004, we had outstanding guarantees in the aggregate amount of $34.7 million in connection with certain acquisitions and lease obligations of which $8.3 million was backed by standby letters of credit. As of December 31, 2004, we guaranteed $4.8 million on outstanding construction loans on two of our unconsolidated joint ventures. Additionally, we provided a take out guarantee after the completion of construction on the aggregate construction loan amount of $30.2 million for another of our unconsolidated joint ventures, of which $20.9 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2004. In connection with this construction loan, our joint venture partner provides an underlying construction loan guarantee up to the completion of construction. Performance and Surety Bonds. As of December 31, 2004, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $1.2 million. These bonds were issued in connection with certain of our development projects and were posted to guarantee certain tax obligations and the construction of certain real property improvements and infrastructure, such as grading, sewers and streets. Performance and surety bonds are commonly required by public agencies from real estate developers. Performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the taxes due or the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. Promoted Interests and Other Contractual Obligations. Upon the achievement of certain return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, we may be obligated to make payments to certain of joint venture partners pursuant to the terms and provisions of their contractual agreements with us. From time to 46 time in the normal course of our business, we enter into various contracts with third parties that may obligate us to make payments or perform other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. SUPPLEMENTAL EARNINGS MEASURES FFO. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider funds from operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. FFO is defined as net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, less gains (or losses) from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estate related depreciation, and adjustments to derive our pro rata share of FFO of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. Further, we do not adjust FFO to eliminate the effects of non recurring charges. We believe that FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. We believe that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. The following table reflects the calculation of FFO reconciled from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands): 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Net income $ 125,471 $ 129,128 $ 121,119 $ 136,200 $ 121,782 Gains from dispositions of real estate (47,224 ) (50,325 ) (19,383 ) (41,859 ) (7,044 ) Real estate related depreciation and amortization: Total depreciation and amortization 160,026 132,167 121,069 101,455 81,523 Discontinued operations depreciation 7,324 10,170 15,434 12,088 8,835 Furniture, fixtures and equipment depreciation (871 ) (720 ) (712 ) (731 ) (380 ) Ground lease amortization (2,301 ) (1,232 ) (734 ) 47 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Adjustments to derive FFO from consolidated joint ventures: Joint venture partners minority interests (Net income) 37,817 31,726 27,320 23,731 11,086 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Net income) 3,318 2,890 4,004 5,322 6,676 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Development profits) 435 344 57 764 Discontinued operations minority interests (Net income) 4,573 4,991 5,105 4,666 2,586 FFO attributable to minority interests (80,192 ) (65,603 ) (52,051 ) (40,144 ) (15,055 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures: Our share of net income (3,781 ) (5,445 ) (5,674 ) (5,467 ) (5,212 ) Our share of FFO 7,549 9,755 9,291 8,014 7,188 Preferred stock dividends (7,131 ) (6,999 ) (8,496 ) (8,500 ) (8,500 ) Preferred stock and unit redemption discount (issuance costs) (5,413 ) 412 (7,600 ) Funds from operations $ 207,314 $ 186,666 $ 215,194 $ 186,707 $ 202,751 Basic FFO per common share and unit $ 2.39 $ 2.17 $ 2.44 $ 2.09 $ 2.26 Diluted FFO per common share and unit $ 2.30 $ 2.13 $ 2.40 $ 2.07 $ 2.25 Weighted average common shares and units: Basic 86,885,250 85,859,899 88,204,208 89,286,379 89,566,375 Diluted 90,120,250 87,616,365 89,689,310 90,325,801 90,024,511 48 BUSINESS RISKS Our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences to us. These risks include, among others: General Real Estate Industry Risks Our performance and value are subject to general economic conditions and risks associated with our real estate assets. The investment returns available from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of income earned and capital appreciation generated by the properties, as well as the expenses incurred in connection with the properties. If our properties do not generate income sufficient to meet operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, then our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders could be adversely affected. In addition, there are significant expenditures associated with an investment in real estate (such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs) that generally do not decline when circumstances reduce the income from the property. Income from, and the value of, our properties may be adversely affected by: changes in the general economic climate; local conditions, such as oversupply of or a reduction in demand for industrial space; the attractiveness of our properties to potential customers; competition from other properties; our ability to provide adequate maintenance and insurance; increased operating costs; increased cost of compliance with regulations; and the potential for liability under applicable laws (including changes in tax laws). In addition, periods of economic slowdown or recession in the United States and in other countries, rising interest rates or declining demand for real estate, or public perception that any of these events may occur, would result in a general decrease in rents or an increased occurrence of defaults under existing leases, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Future terrorist attacks may result in declining economic activity, which could reduce the demand for and the value of our properties. To the extent that future attacks impact our customers, their businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to honor their existing leases. Our properties are concentrated predominantly in the industrial real estate sector. As a result of this concentration, we would feel the impact of an economic downturn in this sector more acutely than if our portfolio included other property types. We may be unable to renew leases or relet space as leases expire. As of December 31, 2004, leases on a total of 16.3% of our industrial properties (based on annualized base rent) will expire on or prior to December 31, 2005. We derive most of our income from rent received from our customers. Accordingly, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected if we are unable to promptly relet or renew these expiring leases, if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected. If a tenant experiences a downturn in its business or other type of financial distress, then it may be unable to make timely rental payments or renew its lease. Further, our ability to rent space and the rents that we can charge are impacted, not only by customer demand, but by the number of other properties we have to compete with to appeal to customers. 49 Actions by our competitors may decrease or prevent increases of the occupancy and rental rates of our properties. We compete with other developers, owners and operators of real estate, some of which own properties similar to ours in the same submarkets in which our properties are located. If our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, we may lose potential tenants, and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge in order to retain tenants when our tenants leases expire. As a result, our financial condition, cash flow, cash available for distribution, trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could be materially adversely affected. Real estate investments are relatively illiquid, making it difficult for us to respond promptly to changing conditions. Real estate assets are not as liquid as certain other types of assets. Further, as a real estate investment trust, the Internal Revenue Code regulates the number of properties that we can dispose of in a year, their tax bases and the cost of improvements that we make to the properties. In addition, a portion of the properties held directly or indirectly by certain of our subsidiary partnerships were acquired in exchange for limited partnership units in the applicable partnership. The contribution agreements for such properties may contain restrictions on certain sales, exchanges or other dispositions of these properties, or a portion thereof, that result in a taxable transaction for specified periods, following the contribution of these properties to the applicable partnership. These limitations may affect our ability to sell properties. This lack of liquidity and the Internal Revenue Code restrictions may limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions and, as a result, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We could be adversely affected if a significant number of our tenants are unable to meet their lease obligations. Our results of operations, distributable cash flow and the value of our common stock would be adversely affected if a significant number of our tenants were unable to meet their lease obligations to us. In the event of a significant number of lease defaults, our cash flow may not be sufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders and repay maturing debt. As of December 31, 2004, we did not have any single tenant account for annualized base rent revenues greater than 3.4%. However, in the event of lease defaults by a significant number of our tenants, we may incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord. We may be unable to consummate acquisitions on advantageous terms or acquisitions may not perform as we expect. We acquire and intend to continue to acquire primarily industrial properties. The acquisition of properties entails various risks, including the risks that our investments may not perform as we expect, that we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate our new acquisitions into our existing operations and that our cost estimates for bringing an acquired property up to market standards may prove inaccurate. Further, we face significant competition for attractive investment opportunities from other well capitalized real estate investors, including both publicly traded real estate investment trusts and private institutional investment funds. This competition increases as investments in real estate become increasingly attractive relative to other forms of investment. As a result of competition, we may be unable to acquire additional properties as we desire or the purchase price may be significantly elevated. In addition, we expect to finance future acquisitions through a combination of borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the operating partnership or its subsidiaries and proceeds from property divestitures, which may not be available and which could adversely affect our cash flow. Any of the above risks could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. 50 We may be unable to complete renovation and development projects on advantageous terms. As part of our business, we develop new and renovate existing properties. The real estate development and renovation business involves significant risks that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock, which include: we may not be able to obtain financing for development projects on favorable terms and complete construction on schedule or within budget, resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs and delays in leasing the properties and generating cash flow; we may not be able to obtain, or may experience delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations; the properties may perform below anticipated levels, producing cash flow below budgeted amounts; substantial renovation and new development activities, regardless of their ultimate success, typically require a significant amount of managements time and attention, diverting their attention from our day to day operations; and upon completion of construction, we may not be able to obtain, or obtain on advantageous terms, permanent financing for activities that we have financed through construction loans. Risks Associated With Our International Business Our international growth is subject to special risks and we may not be able to effectively manage our international growth. We have acquired and developed, and expect to continue to acquire and develop, properties in international countries. Because local markets affect our operations, our international investments are subject to economic fluctuations in the international locations in which we invest. In addition, our international operations are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as revisions in tax treaties or other laws and regulations, including those governing the taxation of our international revenues, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and, in certain parts of the world, property rights uncertainty and political instability. We cannot predict the likelihood that any of these developments may occur. Further, we have entered, and may in the future enter, into agreements with non U.S. entities that are governed by the laws of, and are subject to dispute resolution in the courts of, another country or region. We cannot accurately predict whether such a forum would provide us with an effective and efficient means of resolving disputes that may arise. And even if we are able to obtain a satisfactory decision through arbitration or a court proceeding, we could have difficulty enforcing any award or judgment on a timely basis or at all. Further, our business has grown rapidly and continues to grow through international property acquisitions and developments. If we fail to effectively manage our international growth, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. Acquired properties may be located in new markets, where we may face risks associated with investing in an unfamiliar market. We have acquired and may continue to acquire properties in international markets that are new to us. When we acquire properties located in these markets, we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local government and permitting procedures. We work to mitigate such risks through extensive diligence and research and associations with experienced partners, however there can be no guarantee that all such risks will be eliminated. 51 We are subject to risks from potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of the other countries in which we invest. We are pursuing, and intend to continue to pursue, growth opportunities in international markets. As we invest in countries where the U.S. dollar is not the national currency, we are subject to international currency risks from the potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of those other countries. A significant depreciation in the value of the currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may materially affect our results of operations. We attempt to mitigate any such effects by borrowing under our multi currency credit facility in the currency of the country we are investing in and, under certain circumstances, by putting in place international currency put option contracts hedging exchange rate fluctuations. For leases denominated in international currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage the international exchange risk. We cannot, however, assure you that our efforts will successfully neutralize all international currency risks. If we do engage in international currency exchange rate hedging activities, any income recognized with respect to these hedges (as well as any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates) may not qualify under the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT. Our performance and value are impacted by the local economic conditions of and the risks associated with doing business in California. As of December 31, 2004, our industrial properties located in California represented 27.0% of the aggregate square footage of our industrial operating properties and 27.8% of our industrial annualized base rent. Our revenue from, and the value of, our properties located in California may be affected by local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties) and the local economic climate. Business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns, changing demographics, and other factors may adversely impact Californias economic climate. Because of the number of properties we have located in California, a downturn in Californias economy or real estate conditions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We may experience losses that our insurance does not cover. We carry commercial liability, property and rental loss insurance covering all the properties that we own and manage in types and amounts that we believe are adequate and appropriate given the relative risks applicable to the property, the cost of coverage and industry practice. Certain losses, such as those due to terrorism, windstorms, floods or seismic activity, may be insured subject to certain limitations, including large deductibles or co payments and policy limits. Although we have obtained coverage for certain acts of terrorism, with policy specifications and insured limits that we consider commercially reasonable given the cost and availability of such coverage, we cannot be certain that we will be able to renew coverage on comparable terms or collect under such policies. In addition, there are other types of losses, such as those from riots, bio terrorism, or acts of war, that are not generally insured in our industry because it is not economically feasible to do so. We may incur material losses in excess of insurance proceeds and we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance at commercially reasonable rates. If we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds our insured limits with respect to one or more of our properties, then we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue from those properties and, if there is recourse debt, then we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties. Moreover, as the general partner of the operating partnership, we generally will be liable for all of the operating partnerships unsatisfied recourse obligations, including any obligations incurred by the operating partnership as the general partner of co investment joint ventures. Any such losses could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. A number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to earthquake activity. Domestic properties located in active seismic areas include properties in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Memphis and Seattle. Our largest concentration of such properties is in California where, as of 52 December 31, 2004, we had 289 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 24.4 million square feet and representing 27.0% of our industrial operating properties based on aggregate square footage and 27.8% based on industrial annualized base rent. International properties located in active seismic areas include Tokyo and Osaka, Japan and Mexico City, Mexico. We carry replacement cost earthquake insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable. We evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants. We are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with properties owned through joint ventures, limited liability companies and partnerships. As of December 31, 2004, we owned approximately 55.6 million square feet of our properties through several joint ventures, limited liability companies or partnerships with third parties. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in partnerships, limited liability companies or joint ventures and we intend to continue to develop and acquire properties through joint ventures, limited liability companies and partnerships with other persons or entities when warranted by the circumstances. Such partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions. Partnership, limited liability company or joint venture investments involve certain risks, including: if our partners, co members or joint venturers go bankrupt, then we and any other remaining general partners, members, or joint venturers would generally remain liable for the partnerships, limited liability companys, or joint ventures liabilities; if our partners fail to fund their share of any required capital contributions; our partners, co members or joint venturers might have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals that would affect our ability to operate the property; our partners, co members or joint venturers may have the power to act contrary to our instructions, requests, policies, or objectives, including our current policy with respect to maintaining our qualification as a real estate investment trust; the joint venture, limited liability and partnership agreements often restrict the transfer of a joint ventures, members or partners interest or buy sell or may otherwise restrict our ability to sell the interest when we desire or on advantageous terms; disputes between us and our partners, co members or joint venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business and result in subjecting the properties owned by the applicable partnership or joint venture to additional risk; and we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our partners, co members or joint venturers. We generally seek to maintain sufficient control of our partnerships, limited liability companies, and joint ventures to permit us to achieve our business objectives, however, we may not be able to do so, and the occurrence of one or more of the events described above could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We may be unable to complete divestitures on advantageous terms or contribute properties. We intend to continue to divest ourselves of properties that do not meet our strategic objectives, provided that we can negotiate acceptable terms and conditions. Our ability to dispose of properties on advantageous terms depends on factors beyond our control, including competition from other sellers and the availability of attractive financing for potential buyers of our properties. If we are unable to dispose of properties on favorable terms or redeploy the proceeds of property divestitures in accordance with our investment strategy, then our 53 financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. We also anticipate contributing or selling properties to funds and joint ventures. If we do not have sufficient properties available that meet the investment criteria of current or future property funds, or if the funds have reduced or no access to capital on favorable terms, then such contributions or sales could be delayed or prevented, adversely affecting our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Contingent or unknown liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition. We have and may in the future acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of any of these entities or properties, then we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect our cash flow. Unknown liabilities with respect to entities or properties acquired might include: liabilities for clean up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; tax liabilities; and claims for indemnification by the general partners, officers and directors and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties. We are dependent on external sources of capital. In order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain) and are taxed on our income to the extent it is not fully distributed. Consequently, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs, including acquisition and development activities, from cash retained from operations and must rely on third party sources of capital. Further, in order to maintain our REIT status and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes, we may need to borrow funds on a short term basis to meet the REIT distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. These short term borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non deductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. Our ability to access private debt and equity capital on favorable terms or at all is dependent upon a number of factors, including, general market conditions, the markets perception of our growth potential, our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our capital stock. Debt Financing Risks We could incur more debt, increasing our debt service. It is our policy to incur debt, either directly or through our subsidiaries, only if it will not cause our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio to exceed approximately 45%. Our definition of our share of total market capitalization is our share of total debt plus preferred equity liquidation preferences plus market equity. See footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratio table contained in Part II, Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Liquidity and Capital Resources for our definition of market equity and footnote 2 to such table for our definition of our share of total debt. The aggregate amount of indebtedness that we may incur under our policy increases directly with an increase in the market price per share of our capital stock. Further, our management could alter or eliminate this policy without stockholder approval. If we change this policy, then we could become 54 more highly leveraged, resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect the cash available for distribution to our stockholders. We face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk. As of December 31, 2004, we had total debt outstanding of $3.3 billion. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to the senior debt securities referenced in our financial statements. We are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest. We anticipate that we will repay only a small portion of the principal of our debt prior to maturity. Accordingly, we will likely need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds of other capital transactions, then we expect that our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repay all such maturing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. In addition, if we mortgage one or more of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments, then the property could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income and asset value. A foreclosure on one or more of our properties could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Covenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our financial condition. The terms of our credit agreements and other indebtedness require that we comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage. These covenants may limit flexibility in our operations, and our failure to comply with these covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt agreement even if we have satisfied our payment obligations. As of December 31, 2004, we had certain non recourse, secured loans, which are cross collateralized by multiple properties. If we default on any of these loans, we may then be required to repay such indebtedness, together with applicable prepayment charges, to avoid foreclosure on all the cross collateralized properties within the applicable pool. Foreclosure on our properties, or our inability to refinance our loans on favorable terms, could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. In addition, our credit facilities and senior debt securities contain certain cross default provisions, which are triggered in the event that our other material indebtedness is in default. These cross default provisions may require us to repay or restructure the credit facilities and the senior debt securities in addition to any mortgage or other debt that is in default, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rates may adversely affect results of operations. We seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements, such as interest rate cap agreements and interest rate swap agreements. These agreements involve risks, such as the risk that the counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes and that a court could rule that such agreements are not legally enforceable. Hedging may reduce overall returns on our investments. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may materially adversely affect our results of operations. 55 Conflicts of Interest Risks Some of our directors and executive officers are involved in other real estate activities and investments and therefore, may have conflicts of interest with us. Certain of our executive officers and directors own interests in other real estate related businesses and investments, including retail development projects, office buildings and de minimis holdings of the equity securities of public and private real estate companies. Our executive officers continued involvement in other real estate related activities could divert their attention from our day to day operations. Our executive officers have entered into non competition agreements with us pursuant to which they have agreed not to engage in any activities, directly or indirectly, in respect of commercial real estate, and not to make any investment in respect of any industrial or retail real estate, other than through ownership of not more than 5% of the outstanding shares of a public company engaged in such activities or through the existing investments referred to in this report. State law may limit our ability to enforce these agreements. We believe that these properties and activities generally do not directly compete with any of our properties. However, it is possible that a property in which an executive officer or director, or an affiliate of an executive officer or director, has an interest may compete with us in the future if we were to invest in a property similar in type and in close proximity to that property. We will not acquire any properties from our executive officers, directors or their affiliates unless the transaction is approved by a majority of the disinterested and independent (as defined by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange) members of our board of directors with respect to that transaction. Our role as general partner of the operating partnership may conflict with the interests of our stockholders. As the general partner of the operating partnership, we have fiduciary obligations to the operating partnerships limited partners, the discharge of which may conflict with the interests of our stockholders. In addition, those persons holding limited partnership units will have the right to vote as a class on certain amendments to the operating partnerships partnership agreement and individually to approve certain amendments that would adversely affect their rights. The limited partners may exercise these voting rights in a manner that conflicts with the interests of our stockholders. In addition, under the terms of the operating partnerships partnership agreement, holders of limited partnership units will have certain approval rights with respect to certain transactions that affect all stockholders but which they may not exercise in a manner that reflects the interests of all stockholders. Risks Associated with Government Regulations The costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations and any related potential liability could exceed our budgets for these items. Under various environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at, on, under or in its property. The costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial. These laws typically impose liability and clean up responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean up costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury, property damage, or other costs, including investigation and clean up costs, resulting from the environmental contamination. Environmental laws in some countries, including the U.S., also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and 56 may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos. Some of our properties may contain asbestos containing building materials. In addition, some of our properties are leased or have been leased, in part, to owners and operators of businesses that use, store, or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances. Further, certain of our properties are on, adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, or upon which others have engaged, are engaged or may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances. From time to time, we may acquire properties, or interests in properties, with known adverse environmental conditions where we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior risk adjusted return. In such an instance, we underwrite the costs of environmental investigation, clean up and monitoring into the acquisition cost and obtain appropriate environmental insurance for the property. Further, in connection with certain divested properties, we have agreed to remain responsible for, and to bear the cost of, remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties. At the time of acquisition, we subject all of our properties to a Phase I or similar environmental assessments by independent environmental consultants and we may have additional Phase II testing performed upon consultants recommendation. These environmental assessments have not revealed, and we are not aware of, any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. Nonetheless, it is possible that the assessments did not reveal all environmental liabilities and that there are material environmental liabilities unknown to us, or that known environmental conditions may give rise to liabilities that are greater than we anticipated. Further, our properties current environmental condition may be affected by customers, the condition of land, operations in the vicinity of the properties (such as releases from underground storage tanks), or by unrelated third parties. If the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations exceed our budgets for these items, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar regulations could result in substantial costs. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, places of public accommodation must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. If we are required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, including removing access barriers, then our cash flow and the amounts available for dividends to our stockholders may be adversely affected. Our properties are also subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. We could incur fines or private damage awards if we fail to comply with these requirements. While we believe that our properties are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements, the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us that will affect our cash flow and results of operations. Federal Income Tax Risks Our failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust would have serious adverse consequences to our stockholders. We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1997. We currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code and believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a real estate 57 investment trust, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify. Qualification as a real estate investment trust requires us to satisfy numerous requirements (some on an annual and others on a quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. For example, in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we must derive at least 95% of our gross income in any year from qualifying sources. In addition, we must pay dividends to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis. These provisions and the applicable treasury regulations are more complicated in our case because we hold our assets through the operating partnership. Legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a real estate investment trust or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. However, we are not aware of any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect our ability to qualify as a real estate investment trust. If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment trust for the four taxable years following the year in which we lost qualification. If we lose our real estate investment trust status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved. In addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. Certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction. From time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. Under the Internal Revenue Code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100% penalty tax. Since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are treated as prohibited transactions. However, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. While we believe that the Internal Revenue Service would not prevail in any such dispute, if the IRS were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction. In addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes. Risks Associated With Our Dependence on Key Personnel We depend on the efforts of our executive officers. While we believe that we could find suitable replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers. Risks Associated with Our Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting. The design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. As part of managements on going 58 review of our accounting policies and internal control over financial reporting, on October 12, 2004, management determined that there was a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to ground lease depreciation. This weakness resulted in an understatement of depreciation expense and resulted in a restatement of depreciation expense for our results in previously issued financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 and for the quarters ended March 31, 2004 and June 30, 2004. In connection with correcting this error, management modified our system of internal control over financial reporting to remediate the material weakness. As of December 31, 2004, management had appropriately remediated this issue and the material weakness no longer existed. While management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Other deficiencies, including any material weakness, in our internal control over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, a decline in our stock price, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operation, financial condition or liquidity. Risks Associated with Ownership of Our Stock Limitations in our charter and bylaws could prevent a change in control. Certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay, defer, or prevent a change in control or other transaction that could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for the common stock. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock may be owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code to include certain entities) during the last half of a taxable year after the first taxable year for which a real estate investment trust election is made. Furthermore, our common stock must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a 12 month taxable year (or a proportionate part of a short tax year). In addition, if we, or an owner of 10% or more of our stock, actually or constructively owns 10% or more of one of our customers (or a tenant of any partnership in which we are a partner), then the rent received by us (either directly or through any such partnership) from that tenant will not be qualifying income for purposes of the real estate investment trust gross income tests of the Internal Revenue Code. To help us maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, we prohibit the ownership, actually or by virtue of the constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, by any single person, of more than 9.8% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the issued and outstanding shares of each of our common stock, series L preferred stock and series M preferred stock. We also prohibit the ownership, actually or constructively, of any shares of our series D, E, F, H, I, J and K preferred stock by any single person so that no such person, taking into account all of our stock so owned by such person, including any common stock or other series of preferred stock, may own in excess of 9.8% of our issued and outstanding capital stock. We refer to this limitation as the ownership limit. Shares acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary. Any person who acquires shares in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any dividends on the shares or be entitled to vote the shares or receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the shares in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the shares or the amount realized from the sale. A transfer of shares in violation of the above limits may be void under certain circumstances. The ownership limit may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control and, therefore, could adversely affect our stockholders ability to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for the shares of our common stock in connection with such transaction. Our charter authorizes us to issue additional shares of common and preferred stock and to establish the preferences, rights and other terms of any series or class of preferred stock that we issue. Although our board of directors has no intention to do so at the present time, it could establish a series or class of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a transaction, including a change in control, that might involve a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. 59 Our charter and bylaws and Maryland law also contain other provisions that may impede various actions by stockholders without approval of our board of directors, which in turn may delay, defer, or prevent a transaction, including a change in control. Those provisions in our charter and bylaws include: directors may be removed only for cause and only upon a two thirds vote of stockholders; our board can fix the number of directors within set limits (which limits are subject to change by our board), and fill vacant directorships upon the vote of a majority of the remaining directors, even though less than a quorum, or in the case of a vacancy resulting from an increase in the size of the board, a majority of the entire board; stockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or propose business for consideration at a stockholders meeting; and the request of the holders of 50% or more of our common stock is necessary for stockholders to call a special meeting. Those provisions provided for under Maryland law include: a two thirds vote of stockholders is required to amend our charter; and stockholders may only act by written consent with the unanimous approval of all stockholders entitled to vote on the matter in question. In addition, our board could elect to adopt, without stockholder approval, certain other provisions under Maryland law that may impede a change in control. The market value of our stock could be substantially affected by various factors. As with other publicly traded securities, the trading price of our stock will depend on many factors that are not within our control and may change from time to time, including: the extent of investor interest in us; the market for similar securities issued by real estate investment trusts; the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate based companies); general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of our stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends; terrorist activity may adversely affect the markets in which our securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending; general economic conditions; and our financial condition, performance and prospects. Other factors such as governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws could also have a significant impact on the future trading price of our stock. Earnings and cash dividends, asset value and market interest rates affect the price of our stock. As a real estate investment trust the market value of our equity securities, in general, is based primarily upon the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash dividends. Our equity securities market value is based secondarily upon the market value of our underlying real estate assets. For this reason, shares of our stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than our net asset value per share. To the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working capital reserves, or other purposes, these retained funds, while increasing the value of our underlying assets, may not 60 correspondingly increase the market price of our stock. Our failure to meet the markets expectations with regard to future earnings and cash dividends likely would adversely affect the market price of our stock. Further, the distribution yield on the stock (as a percentage of the price of the stock) relative to market interest rates may also influence the price of our stock. An increase in market interest rates might lead prospective purchasers of our stock to expect a higher distribution yield, which would adversely affect our stocks market price. Additionally, if the market price of our stock declines significantly, then we might breach certain covenants with respect to our debt obligations, which could adversely affect our liquidity and ability to make future acquisitions and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. If we issue additional securities, then the investment of existing stockholders will be diluted. We have authority to issue shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities, and to cause the operating partnership to issue limited partnership units, in exchange for property or otherwise. Existing stockholders have no preemptive right to acquire any additional securities issued by the operating partnership or us and any issuance of additional equity securities could result in dilution of an existing stockholders investment. We could change our investment and financing policies without a vote of stockholders. Subject to our current investment policy to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust (unless a change is approved by our board of directors under certain circumstances), our board of directors determines our investment and financing policies, our growth strategy and our debt, capitalization, distribution and operating policies. Although our board of directors does not presently intend to revise or amend these strategies and policies, they may do so at any time without a vote of stockholders. Any such changes may not serve the interests of all stockholders and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations, including our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. Shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The operating partnership and AMB Property II, L.P. had 4,746,104 common limited partnership units issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2004, which may be exchanged generally one year after their issuance on a one for one basis into shares of our common stock. In the future, the operating partnership or AMB Property II, L.P. may issue additional limited partnership units, and we may issue shares of common stock, in connection with the acquisition of properties or in private placements. These shares of common stock and the shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of limited partnership units may be sold in the public securities markets over time, pursuant to registration rights that we have granted, or may grant in connection with future issuances, or pursuant to Rule 144. In addition, common stock issued under our stock option and incentive plans may also be sold in the market pursuant to registration statements that we have filed or pursuant to Rule 144. As of December 31, 2004, under our stock option and incentive plans, we had 5,103,927 shares of common stock reserved and available for issuance (including cancellations and forfeitures), had outstanding options to purchase 10,220,631 shares of common stock (net of cancellations and forfeitures, and 2,447,390 shares that we have issued upon the exercise of options) and had 1,178,052 restricted shares of common stock outstanding (net of 75,988 shares that have been forfeited). Future sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Further, the existence of the operating partnerships limited partnership units and the shares of our common stock reserved for issuance upon exchange of limited partnership units and the exercise of options, and registration rights referred to above, may adversely affect the terms upon which we are able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices, interest rates and international exchange rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing 61 activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings and our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2004, we had two outstanding interest rate swaps with aggregate notional amount of $137.1 million (in U.S. dollars). See Financial Instruments disclosure below. The table below summarizes the market risks associated with our fixed and variable rate debt outstanding before unamortized debt premiums of $10.8 million as of December 31, 2004 (dollars in thousands): 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total Fixed rate debt(1) $ 358,798 $ 172,312 $ 145,740 $ 386,761 $ 188,305 $ 1,496,223 $ 2,748,139 Average interest rate 7.0 % 6.6 % 6.9 % 6.7 % 4.8 % 7.2 % 6.6 % Variable rate debt(2) $ 1,049 $ 84,037 $ 341,191 $ 5,571 $ 37,375 $ 29,063 $ 498,286 Average interest rate 3.6 % 2.6 % 2.0 % 2.8 % 2.7 % 1.9 % 2.1 % Interest Payments $ 25,154 $ 13,558 $ 16,880 $ 26,069 $ 10,048 $ 108,280 $ 199,989 (1) Represents 84.7% of all outstanding debt. (2) Represents 15.3% of all outstanding debt. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased by 10%, then the increase in interest expense on the variable rate debt would be $1.1 million annually. As of December 31, 2004, the book value and the estimated fair value of our total consolidated debt (both secured and unsecured) was $3.4 billion based on our estimate of current market interest rates. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, variable rate debt comprised 15.3% and 14.7%, respectively, of all our outstanding debt. Variable rate debt was $498.3 million and $378.0 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. The increase is primarily due to higher outstanding balances on our credit facilities. This increase in our outstanding variable rate debt increases our risk associated with unfavorable interest rate fluctuations. Financial Instruments. We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income or income. For revenues or expenses denominated in non functional currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments in effect at December 31, 2004 were two put options (buy USD/sell MXN) hedging against adverse currency exchange fluctuations of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar and two interest rate swaps hedging cash flows of our variable rate borrowings based on 62 Euribor (Europe) and Japanese TIBOR (Japan). The following table summarizes our financial instruments as of December 31, 2004: Maturity Dates Notional Related Derivatives (In thousands) March 05 Dec 08 October 12 Amount Fair Value Interest Rate Swaps: Plain Interest Rate Swap, Japan Notional Amount (U.S. Dollars) $ 126,669 $ 126,669 Receive Floating(%) 3M TIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 1.32 % Fair Market Value $ $ (1,211 ) Plain Interest Rate Swap, Europe Notional Amount (U.S. Dollars) $ 10,437 $ 10,437 Receive Floating(%) 3M EURIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 3.72 % Fair Market Value $ $ (13 ) Foreign Exchange Agreements: Option to Sell MXN/ Buy USD Contract Amount (U.S. Dollars) $ 2,422 $ 2,422 Contract FX Rate 11.50 Contract Premium $ 43 $ 30 Total $ 139,528 $ (1,194 ) International Operations. Our exposure to market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries operating in the United States and Mexico. The functional currency for our subsidiaries operating outside North America is generally the local currency of the country in which the entity is located, mitigating the effect of currency exchange gains and losses. Our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. We translate income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. Losses resulting from the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity and totaled $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Our international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. In these instances, non monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2004, gains from remeasurement included in our statements of operations were $0.5 million. We also record gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated. We believe that these gains and losses are immaterial. 63 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations GENERAL You should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements. We commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company effective with the completion of our initial public offering on November 26, 1997, and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with our initial tax return for the year ended December 31, 1997. AMB Property Corporation and AMB Property, L.P. were formed shortly before the consummation of our initial public offering. Managements Overview We generate revenue and earnings primarily from rent received from customers under long term (generally three to ten years) operating leases at our properties, including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs, and from partnership distributions and fees from our private capital business. We also derive earnings from the strategic disposition of assets and from the disposition of projects under our development for sale or contribution program. Our long term growth is dependent on our ability to maintain and increase occupancy rates or increase rental rates at our properties and our ability to continue to acquire and develop new properties. National industrial markets improved significantly during 2004 when compared with market conditions in 2003. The positive trend in demand began in the second quarter of 2004 and reversed 14 prior quarters of negatively trending, or rising, space availability. We believe the protracted period of rising availability created a difficult leasing environment; however investor demand for industrial property (as evidenced by our observation of strong national sales volumes and declining acquisition capitalization rates) has remained consistently strong. We believe we capitalized on the demand for acquisition property by accelerating the repositioning of our portfolio through the disposition of non core properties. We plan to continue selling selected assets on an opportunistic basis but believe we have substantially achieved our repositioning goals. Property dispositions result in reinvestment capacity and trigger gain/loss recognition, but also create near term earnings dilution if the capital cannot be redeployed effectively. We experienced such near term dilution in 2004. However, we believe that the repositioning of our portfolio will benefit our stockholders in the long term. The table below summarizes our leasing activity for 2004 and 2003: U.S. Hub and Total Other Total/Weighted Property Data Gateway Markets(1) Markets(2) Average For the year ended December 31, 2004: % of total rentable square feet 74.1 % 25.9 % 100.0 % Occupancy percentage at year end 95.0 % 94.2 % 94.8 % Same space square footage leased 13,932,213 3,553,563 17,485,776 Rent increases (decreases) on renewals and rollovers (15.3 )% (3.6 )% (13.2 )% For the year ended December 31, 2003: % of total rentable square feet 75.0 % 25.0 % 100.0 % Occupancy percentage at year end 93.5 % 91.9 % 93.1 % Same space square footage leased 13,636,050 3,636,967 17,273,017 Rent increases (decreases) on renewals and rollovers (12.7 )% 1.7 % (10.1 )% 25 (1) Our U.S. hub and gateway markets include on tarmac and Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas/ Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Northern New Jersey/ New York City, the San Francisco Bay Area, Miami and Seattle. (2) Our total other markets include other domestic target markets, other non target markets, international target markets and retail. We observed two positive trends nationally for industrial real estate during the year ended December 31, 2004, supported by data provided by Torto Wheaton Research. First, national industrial space availability declined 70 basis points during the year from 11.6% to 10.9%. This decrease in national industrial space availability occurred in the last three quarters of 2004, reversing the trend of the prior 14 quarters in which national industrial space availability increased on average 36 basis points per quarter. Second, national absorption of industrial space, defined as the net change in occupied stock as measured by square feet of completions less the change in available square feet, totaled approximately 175 million square feet in the year ended December 31, 2004, substantially exceeding the 20 million square feet of space absorbed in 2003 and well above the ten year historical average of 132 million square feet of space absorbed annually. In this improved environment, our industrial portfolios occupancy levels increased to 94.8% at December 31, 2004 from 93.1% at December 31, 2003, which we believe reflects higher levels of demand for industrial space generally and in our portfolio specifically. During the year ended December 31, 2004, our lease expirations totaled approximately 21.4 million square feet while commencements of new or renewed leases totaled approximately 24.3 million square feet, resulting in an increase in our occupancy level of approximately 170 basis points. Rents on industrial renewals and rollovers in our portfolio decreased 13.2% during the year ended December 31, 2004 as leases were entered into or renewed at rates consistent with what we believe to be current market levels. We believe this decline in rents on lease renewals and rollovers reflects trends in national industrial space availability. We believe that relatively high levels of national industrial space availability have caused market rents for industrial properties to decline between 10% and 20% from their peak levels in 2001 based on our research data; 47% of the space that rolled over in our portfolio in 2004 had commenced between 1999 and 2001. Rental rates in our portfolio declined at successively lower rates in each of the four quarters during 2004, which we believe indicates a stabilization of market rental rate levels. While the level of rental rate reduction varied by market, we achieved occupancy levels in our portfolio 570 basis points in excess of the national industrial market, as determined by Torto Wheaton Research, by pricing lease renewals and new leases with sensitivity to local market conditions. During periods of decreasing or stabilizing rental rates, we strove to sign leases with shorter terms to prevent locking in lower rent levels for long periods and to be prepared to sign new, longer term leases during periods of growing rental rates. When we sign leases of shorter duration, we attempt to limit overall leasing costs and capital expenditures by offering different grades of tenant improvement packages, appropriate to the lease term. We believe that development, renovation and expansion of well located, high quality industrial properties should generally continue to provide us with attractive investment opportunities at a higher rate of return than we may obtain from the purchase of existing properties. We believe that our development opportunities in Mexico and Japan are attractive given the current lack of supply of modern distribution facilities in the major metropolitan markets of these countries. Globally, we have increased our development pipeline from a low of $107.0 million at the end of 2002 to approximately $828.7 million at December 31, 2004. In addition to our committed development pipeline, we hold a total of 1,263 acres for future development or sale, of which 1,015 acres, 199 acres, 39 acres and ten acres in North America, Mexico, Asia and Europe, respectively, could support an aggregate of approximately 22.2 million square feet of additional development. Going forward, we believe that our co investment program with private capital investors will continue to serve as a significant source of revenues and capital for acquisitions and developments. Through these co investment joint ventures, we typically earn acquisition and development fees, asset management fees and priority distributions, as well as promoted interests and incentive distributions based on the performance of the co investment joint ventures; however, there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so. Through contribution of development properties to our co investment joint ventures, we expect to recognize value 26 creation from our development pipeline. As of December 31, 2004, we owned approximately 40.8 million square feet of our properties (36.8% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our co investment joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. By 2007, we plan to have approximately 15% of our portfolio (based on consolidated annualized base rent) invested in international markets. Our North American target markets outside of the United States currently include Guadalajara, Mexico City, Monterrey and Toronto. Our European target markets currently include Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt, London, Lyon, Madrid and Paris. Our Asian target markets currently include Beijing, Nagoya, Osaka, the Pearl River Delta, Shanghai, Singapore and Tokyo. It is possible that our target markets will change over time to reflect experience, market opportunities, customer needs and changes in global distribution patterns. As of December 31, 2004, our international operating properties comprised 4.4% of our consolidated annualized base rent. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust, we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income. As a result, we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our on going operations to the same extent that other corporations that are not real estate investment trusts can. We must continue to raise capital in both the debt and equity markets to fund our working capital needs, acquisitions and developments. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for a complete discussion of the sources of our capital. Summary of Key Transactions in 2004 During the year ended December 31, 2004, we completed the following capital deployment transactions: Acquired 64 buildings in the United States, Mexico, Europe and Asia, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet, for $695.2 million, including $261.0 million invested through four of our co investment joint ventures; Commenced 19 development projects in the United States, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, totaling 6.1 million square feet with an estimated total investment of approximately $648.5 million (using exchange rates in effect at applicable quarter end and year end dates); Acquired 640 acres of land for industrial warehouse development in various U.S. markets and Mexico City for approximately $68.3 million; Sold seven land parcels and six development projects available for sale, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $40.4 million; and Divested ourselves of 21 industrial buildings, two retail centers and one office building, aggregating approximately 3.1 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $200.3 million. See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our acquisition, development and disposition activity. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we completed the following capital markets and other financing transactions: Obtained long term secured debt financings for our co investment joint ventures totaling $243.5 million at an average rate of 5.0%; Obtained $129.2 million of debt (using exchange rates in effect at applicable quarter end dates) with a weighted average interest rate of 4.5% for international acquisitions, net of the financing for the AMB Ohta Distribution Center development; Completed the early renewal of the operating partnerships senior unsecured revolving line of credit in the amount of $500.0 million. The three year credit facility includes a multi currency component under which up to $250.0 million can be drawn in Yen, Euros or British Pounds Sterling; 27 Entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement through AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating partnership, providing for loans or letters of credit in a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of up to 24 billion Yen (approximately $233.8 million in U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2004); Closed on a 20 billion Yen financing (approximately $195 million U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2004) for the AMB Ohta Distribution Center development project in Japan, of which 14 billion Yen ($136 million U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2004) has been funded. We locked in the interest rate on 65% of the financing for the full eight year term at closing. During construction, the fixed rate portion is locked at 1.9% and upon stabilization, the fixed rate will be 2.4%; Formed AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open ended co investment joint venture, with $136.5 million of equity from co investment partners to invest in properties in the United States; and Formed an unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, with Industrial (Mexico) JV Pte Ltd, a real estate investment subsidiary of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, with an equity commitment of $200 million to invest in properties in Mexico, in which we retain a 20% interest. We contributed $71.5 million of operating properties and recently completed development projects in Mexico and when combined with our equity commitment and leverage, the venture has an investment capacity of approximately $715 million. This is our first international co investment joint venture. See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 6, 9 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our capital markets transactions. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Investments in Real Estate. Investments in real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. We also record at acquisition an intangible asset or liability for the value attributable to above or below market leases, in place leases and lease origination costs for all acquisitions. Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a property by property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable. Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying amount of the property. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future market conditions and the availability of capital. Examples of certain situations that could affect future cash flows of a property may include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in occupancy; unforeseen bankruptcy, lease termination and move out of a major customer; or a significant decrease in annual base rents of that property. If impairment analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying amount of our long lived assets could occur in the future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings. 28 Revenue Recognition. We record rental revenue from operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts, security deposits and letters of credit, then we may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our customers on an on going basis by reviewing their financial condition periodically as appropriate. Each period we review our outstanding accounts receivable, including straight line rents, for doubtful accounts and provide allowances as needed. We also record lease termination fees when a customer has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us. If a customer remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement, the applicable termination fees are deferred and recognized over the term of such customers occupancy. Property Dispositions. We report real estate dispositions in three separate categories on our consolidated statements of operations. First, when we divest a portion of our interests in real estate entities or properties, gains from the sale represent the interests acquired by third party investors for cash. Second, we dispose of value added conversion projects and build to suit and speculative development projects for which we have not generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable. Lastly, beginning in 2002, SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, required us to separately report as discontinued operations the historical operating results attributable to operating properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the properties. The consolidated statements of operations for prior periods are also adjusted to conform with this classification. There is no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial position, net income or cash flows. In all cases, gains and losses are recognized using the full accrual method of accounting. Gains relating to transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met. Joint Ventures. We hold interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. Our joint venture investments do not meet the variable interest entity criteria under FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. Therefore, we determine consolidation based on standards set forth in EITF 96 16, Investors Accounting for an Investee When the Investor Has a Majority of the Voting Interest but the Minority Shareholder or Shareholders Have Certain Approval or Veto Rights, and Statement of Position 78 9, Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures. Based on the guidance set forth in these pronouncements, we consolidate certain joint venture investments because we exercise significant control over major operating decisions, such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, asset management, investment activity and changes in financing. For joint ventures where we do not exercise significant control over major operating and management decisions, but where we exercise significant influence, we use the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. Real Estate Investment Trust. As a real estate investment trust, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes in the U.S. if we meet minimum distribution, income, asset and shareholder tests. However, some of our subsidiaries may be subject to federal and state taxes. In addition, foreign entities may also be subject to the taxes of the host country. An income tax allocation is required to be estimated on our taxable income arising from our taxable REIT subsidiaries and international entities. A deferred tax component could arise based upon the differences in GAAP versus tax income for items such as depreciation and gain recognition. However, we believe deferred tax is an immaterial component of our consolidated balance sheet. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The analysis below includes changes attributable to same store growth, acquisitions, development activity and divestitures. Same store properties are those that we owned during both the current and prior year reporting periods, excluding development properties prior to being stabilized subsequent to December 31, 2002 29 (generally defined as properties that are 90% leased or properties for which we have held a certificate of occupancy or where building has been substantially complete for at least 12 months). As of December 31, 2004, same store industrial properties consisted of properties aggregating approximately 74.5 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2003 consisted of 82 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.5 million square feet. During 2004, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 29 industrial buildings, two retail centers and one office, aggregating approximately 4.4 million square feet. In 2003, property divestitures consisted of 48 industrial buildings and two retail centers, aggregating approximately 5.3 million square feet. Our future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition of additional properties and dispositions. Our future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical results. For the Years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 (dollars in millions) Revenues 2004 2003 $ Change % Change Rental revenues U.S. industrial: Same store $ 531.8 $ 535.4 $ (3.6 ) (0.7 )% 2003 acquisitions 47.8 14.6 33.2 227.4 % 2004 acquisitions 25.9 25.9 % Development 7.8 7.8 % Other industrial 10.3 6.3 4.0 63.5 % International industrial 25.6 6.1 19.5 319.7 % Retail 3.6 3.1 0.5 16.1 % Total rental revenues 652.8 573.3 79.5 13.9 % Private capital income 12.9 13.3 (0.4 ) (3.0 )% Total revenues $ 665.7 $ 586.6 $ 79.1 13.5 % The decrease in U.S. industrial same store rental revenues was primarily driven by decreased rental rates in various markets. Across the portfolio, these and other factors accounted for approximately $6.9 million of the change from the prior year. This decrease was partially offset by a decrease in allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately $3.3 million. Industrial same store occupancy was 95.3% at December 31, 2004 and 93.0% at December 31, 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2004, rents in the same store portfolio decreased 14.7% on industrial renewals and rollovers (cash basis) on 16.2 million square feet leased due to decreases in market rates. The properties acquired during 2003 consisted of 82 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.5 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2003 and 2004, we continued to acquire properties in France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial revenues. The decrease in private capital income was due to greater incentive fees earned in the prior year. 30 Costs and Expenses 2004 2003 $ Change % Change Property operating costs: Rental expenses $ 94.7 $ 84.7 $ 10.0 11.8 % Real estate taxes 73.8 67.3 6.5 9.7 % Total property operating costs $ 168.5 $ 152.0 $ 16.5 10.9 % Property operating costs U.S. industrial: Same store $ 141.1 $ 141.4 $ (0.3 ) (0.2 )% 2003 acquisitions 11.0 3.6 7.4 205.6 % 2004 acquisitions 6.9 6.9 % Development 1.5 3.6 (2.1 ) (58.3 )% Other industrial 1.8 1.8 % International industrial 4.9 0.4 4.5 1,125.0 % Retail 1.3 1.2 0.1 8.3 % Total property operating costs 168.5 152.0 16.5 10.9 % Depreciation and amortization 160.0 132.2 27.8 21.0 % Impairment losses 5.3 (5.3 ) (100.0 )% General and administrative 59.0 46.4 12.6 27.2 % Fund costs 1.7 0.8 0.9 112.5 % Total costs and expenses $ 389.2 $ 336.7 $ 52.5 15.6 % Same store properties operating expenses showed a decrease of $0.3 million from the prior year due to decreased non reimbursable expenses. The 2003 acquisitions consisted of 82 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.5 million square feet. The 2004 acquisitions consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2003 and 2004, we continued to acquire properties in France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial property operating costs. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The 2003 impairment loss was on investments in real estate and leasehold interests. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased stock based compensation expense of $2.3 million and additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international and development expansions. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our co investment joint ventures. The increase in fund costs was due to additional formation of co investment joint ventures in 2004.

The gains from dispositions of real estate (not classified as discontinued operations) in 2004, resulted from our contribution of $71.5 million in operating properties to our newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC. The gains from disposition of real estate (not classified as discontinued operations) in 2003, resulted from our contribution of $94.0 million in operating properties to our unconsolidated co investment joint venture, Industrial Fund I, LLC. The decrease in development profits, net of taxes, resulted from delayed gains on development sales. The increase in interest expense, including amortization, was due to the issuance of additional unsecured debt under our 2002 medium term note program, increased borrowings on the unsecured credit facilities, and additional secured debt borrowings in our co investment joint ventures. Discontinued Operations 2004 2003 $ Change % Change Income attributable to discontinued operations, net of minority interests $ 5.6 $ 18.9 $ (13.3 ) (70.4 )% Gains from dispositions of real estate, net of minority interests 42.0 42.9 (0.9 ) (2.1 )% Total discontinued operations $ 47.6 $ 61.8 $ (14.2 ) (23.0 )% During 2004, we divested ourselves of 21 industrial buildings, two retail centers and one office building, aggregating approximately 3.1 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $200.3 million, with a resulting net gain of $42.0 million. During 2003, we divested ourselves of 24 industrial buildings and two retail centers, aggregating approximately 2.8 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $272.3 million, with a resulting net gain of $42.9 million. The decrease in income attributable to discontinued operations reflects the fact that properties were held for only a partial period in 2004 versus an entire year in 2003.

In addition, on November 26, 2003, the operating partnership redeemed all 1,300,000 of its outstanding 85/8% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Partnership Units and we recognized a reduction of income available to common stockholders of $1.7 million for the original issuance costs. In June and November 2003, we issued 2,000,000 shares of 6.5% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and 2,300,000 shares of 6.75% Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, respectively. The timing of the newly issued shares contributed to the increase in preferred stock dividends. 32 For the Years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 (dollars in millions) Revenues 2003 2002 $ Change % Change Rental revenues U.S. industrial: Same store $ 535.4 $ 529.2 $ 6.2 1.2 % 2003 acquisitions 14.6 14.6 % Development 7.8 3.9 3.9 100.0 % Other industrial 6.3 13.1 (6.8 ) (51.9 )% International industrial 6.1 0.7 5.4 771.4 % Retail 3.1 5.1 (2.0 ) (39.2 )% Total rental revenues 573.3 552.0 21.3 3.9 % Private capital income 13.3 11.2 2.1 18.8 % Total revenues $ 586.6 $ 563.2 $ 23.4 4.2 % The increase in U.S. industrial same store revenues were primarily driven by increased rental revenues in our on tarmac and Los Angeles markets. These increases were partially offset by decreased rental income in our San Francisco Bay Area market and an increase in our allowances for doubtful accounts of $4.0 million across the portfolio. The properties acquired during 2003 consisted of 82 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.5 million square feet. The development revenue increase reflects the timing of the stabilization of properties in the development pipeline. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2003, we acquired properties in Mexico and France, resulting in increased international industrial revenues. The increase in private capital income was primarily due to incentive distributions earned from AMB Partners II, L.P.

The 2003 acquisitions consist of 82 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.5 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate, partially offset by a reduction of $2.1 million for the recovery, through the settlement of a lawsuit, of capital expenditures paid in prior years. The 2003 impairment loss was on investments in real estate and leasehold interests. The 2002 impairment included losses for lease cost write offs of $1.7 million and an impairment on a portion of our planned property contributions of $1.2 million. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased stock based compensation expense of $2.8 million, partially offset by decreased personnel costs and taxes. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our co investment joint ventures.

Gains from dispositions of real estate (not classified as discontinued operations) in 2003 resulted from our contribution of $94.0 million in operating properties to our unconsolidated co investment joint venture, Industrial Fund I, LLC, in February 2003. We recognized a gain of $7.4 million on the contribution, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed properties acquired by the third party investors for cash. During 2002, we sold two industrial buildings and one retail center, aggregating approximately 0.8 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $50.6 million, with a resulting loss of $0.8 million. In June 2002, we also contributed $76.9 million in operating properties to our consolidated co investment joint venture, AMB SGP, L.P. We recognized a gain of $3.3 million, representing the sale of our interests in the properties acquired by the third party investors for cash. In November 2002, our joint venture partner in AMB Partners II, L.P. increased its ownership from 50% to 80% by acquiring 30% of the operating partnerships interest in AMB Partners II, L.P. We recognized a gain of $6.3 million on the sale of the operating partnerships 30% interest. The increase in development profits, net of taxes, resulted from an increased sales volume of $57.8 million in 2003.

In addition, on November 26, 2003, the operating partnership redeemed all 1,300,000 of its outstanding 85/8% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Partnership Units and we recognized a reduction of income available to common stockholders of $1.7 million for the original issuance costs. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Balance Sheet Strategy. In general, we use unsecured lines of credit, unsecured notes, preferred stock and common equity (issued by us and or the operating partnership and its subsidiaries) to capitalize our 100% owned assets. Over time, we plan to retire non recourse, secured debt encumbering our 100% owned assets and replace that debt with unsecured notes. In managing our co investment joint ventures, in general, we use non recourse, secured debt to capitalize our co investment joint ventures. We currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for acquisitions, development, expansion and renovation of properties will include: retained earnings and cash flow from operations; borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities; other forms of secured or unsecured financing; proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the operating partnership (including issuances of limited partnership units in the operating partnership or its subsidiaries); net proceeds from divestitures of properties; private capital from co investment partners; and contribution of properties and completed development projects to our co investment joint ventures. We currently expect that our principal funding requirements will include: working capital; development, expansion and renovation of properties; acquisitions, including our global expansion; debt service; and dividends and distributions on outstanding common and preferred stock and limited partnership units. We believe that our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow from operations, borrowings available under our unsecured credit facilities and our ability to access private and public debt and equity capital, are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. 35 Capital Resources Property Contributions. In December 2004, we contributed $71.5 million in operating properties, consisting of eight industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 1.3 million square feet, to our newly formed unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, with Industrial (Mexico) JV Pte Ltd, a real estate investment subsidiary of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, and recognized a gain of $7.2 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed properties acquired by the third party co investor for cash. Property Divestitures. During 2004, we divested ourselves of 21 industrial buildings, two retail centers and one office building, aggregating approximately 3.1 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $200.3 million, with a resulting net gain of $42.0 million. Development Sales and Contributions. During 2004, we sold seven land parcels and six development projects as part of our development for sale program, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet for an aggregate price of $40.4 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $6.5 million. During 2004, we also contributed one completed development project into a newly formed unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $2.0 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. Properties Held for Divestiture. As of December 31, 2004, we held for divestiture 25 industrial buildings and one undeveloped land parcel, which are not in our core markets, do not meet our current strategic objectives or which we have included as part of our development for sale program. The divestitures of these properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. As of December 31, 2004, the net carrying value of the properties held for divestiture was $87.3 million. Expected net sales proceeds exceed the net carrying value of the properties. Co investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. We generally consolidate these joint ventures for financial reporting purposes because they are not variable interest entities and because we are the sole managing general partner and control all major operating decisions. However in certain cases, our co investment joint ventures are unconsolidated. During 2004, we formed AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. with $136.5 million of equity from co investment partners to invest in properties in the United States. During 2004, we contributed $71.5 million in operating properties, consisting of eight industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 1.3 million square feet, to our newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC. Third party equity interests in the joint ventures are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2004, we owned approximately 40.8 million square feet of our properties (36.8% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated co investment joint ventures and 4.6 million square feet of our properties through our other consolidated joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. 36 Our co investment joint ventures at December 31, 2004 (dollars in thousands): Our Approximate Ownership Original Planned Consolidated co investment Joint Venture Joint Venture Partner Percentage Capitalization(1) AMB/Erie, L.P.

We have authorized for issuance 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which the following series were designated as of December 31, 2004: 1,595,337 shares of series D cumulative redeemable preferred stock; 220,440 shares of series E cumulative redeemable preferred stock; 267,439 shares of series F cumulative redeemable preferred stock; 840,000 shares of series H cumulative redeemable preferred stock; 510,000 shares of series I cumulative redeemable preferred stock; 800,000 shares of series J cumulative redeemable preferred stock; 800,000 shares of series K cumulative redeemable preferred stock; 2,300,000 shares of series L cumulative redeemable preferred stock; and 2,300,000 shares of series M cumulative redeemable preferred stock. On June 23, 2003, we issued and sold 2,000,000 shares of 6.5% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at a price of $25.00 per share. Dividends are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable 37 quarterly in arrears at a rate per share equal to $1.625 per annum. The series L preferred stock is redeemable by us on or after June 23, 2008, subject to certain conditions, for cash at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, if any, to the redemption date. We contributed the net proceeds of approximately $48.0 million to the operating partnership, and in exchange, the operating partnership issued to us 2,000,000 6.5% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units. The operating partnership used the proceeds, in addition to proceeds previously contributed to the operating partnership from other equity issuances, to redeem all 3,995,800 of its 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units from us on July 28, 2003. We, in turn, used those proceeds to redeem all 3,995,800 of our 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for $100.2 million, including all accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, to the redemption date. On July 14, 2003, AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased, from an unrelated third party, 66,300 of its series F preferred units for $3.3 million, including accrued and unpaid dividends. On November 25, 2003, we issued and sold 2,300,000 shares of 6.75% Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at $25.00 per share. Dividends are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable quarterly in arrears at a rate per share equal to $1.6875 per annum. The series M preferred stock is redeemable by us on or after November 25, 2008, subject to certain conditions, for cash at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, if any, to the redemption date. We contributed the net proceeds of $55.4 million to the operating partnership, and in exchange, the operating partnership issued to us 2,300,000 6.75% Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units. On November 26, 2003, the operating partnership redeemed all 1,300,000 of its outstanding 85/8% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Partnership Units, for an aggregate redemption price of $65.6 million, including accrued and unpaid dividends. On September 24, 2004, AMB Property II, L.P., a partnership in which Texas AMB I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and our indirect subsidiary, owns an approximate 1.0% general partnership interest and the operating partnership owns an approximate 99% common limited partnership interest, issued 729,582 5.0% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units at a price of $50.00 per unit. The series N preferred units were issued to Robert Pattillo Properties, Inc. in exchange for the contribution of certain parcels of land that are located in multiple markets to AMB Property II, L.P. Beginning September 25, 2006 and until and including September 25, 2009, the series N preferred units may be redeemed by AMB Property II, L.P. at a redemption price equal to 99.5% of the original $50.00 per unit capital contribution, plus all accrued and unpaid distributions to the date of redemption, which shall be paid solely out of capital contributed to AMB Property II, L.P. by Texas AMB I, LLC or the operating partnership (other than with respect to the accumulated but unpaid distributions). Pursuant to a Put Agreement, dated September 24, 2004, by and between Robert Pattillo Properties, Inc. and the operating partnership, beginning on June 1, 2005 and until January 15, 2006, the holders of the series N preferred units will have the right to sell all, but not less than all, of such units to the operating partnership (or to certain designees) at a price equal to $50.00 per unit, plus all accrued and unpaid distributions to the date of such sale. As of December 31, 2004, $90.8 million in preferred units with a rate of 7.75%, issued by the operating partnership, were callable under the terms of the partnership agreement. In December 2003, our board of directors approved a new two year common stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of our common stock. We did not repurchase or retire any shares of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2004. In December 2001, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $100.0 million worth of our common and preferred stock. In December 2002, our board of directors increased the 2001 repurchase program to $200.0 million. The 2001 stock repurchase program expired in December 2003. During 2002, we repurchased 2,651,600 shares of our common stock for $69.4 million, including commissions. In July 2002, we also repurchased 4,200 shares of our series A preferred stock for an aggregate cost of $0.1 million, including accrued and unpaid dividends. 38 During 2003, the operating partnership redeemed 226,145 of its common limited partnership units for cash and 2,000 of its common limited partnership units for shares of our common stock. During 2002, the operating partnership redeemed 122,640 of its common limited partnership units for shares of our common stock. In November 2003, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, also issued 145,548 of its class B common limited partnership units in connection with a property acquisition. Debt. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, we presently intend to operate with an our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio of approximately 45% or less. As of December 31, 2004, our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio was 37.8%. Our definition of our share of total market capitalization is our share of total debt plus preferred equity liquidation preferences plus market equity. See footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratio table contained in Part II, Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Liquidity and Capital Resources for our definition of market equity and footnote 2 to such table for our definition of our share of total debt. However, we typically finance our co investment joint ventures with secured debt at a loan to value ratio of 50 65% per our joint venture partnership agreements. Additionally, we currently intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these policies, however, our organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our management could alter or eliminate these policies without stockholder approval or circumstances could arise that could render us unable to comply with these policies. As of December 31, 2004, the aggregate principal amount of our secured debt was $1.9 billion, excluding unamortized debt premiums of $10.8 million. Of the $1.9 billion of secured debt, $1.4 billion is secured by properties in our joint ventures. The secured debt is generally non recourse and bears interest at rates varying from 0.7% to 10.4% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 6.3%) and has final maturity dates ranging from April 2005 to November 2022. As of December 31, 2004, $1.8 billion of the secured debt obligations bears interest at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 6.5% while the remaining $96.6 million bears interest at variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 2.5%). As of December 31, 2004, the operating partnership had issued an aggregate of $1.0 billion in unsecured senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% and had an average term of 4.6 years. These unsecured senior debt securities include $400.0 million in notes, issued in June 1998, $400.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2000 medium term note program, and $225.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2002 medium term note program. As of December 31, 2004, the operating partnerships 2002 medium term note program has a remaining capacity of $175.0 million. The operating partnership intends to continue to issue medium term notes, guaranteed by us, under the 2002 program from time to time and as market conditions permit. In August 2000, the operating partnership commenced a medium term note program and subsequently issued $400.0 million of medium term notes with a weighted average interest rate of 7.3%. These notes mature between December 2005 and September 2011 and are guaranteed by us. In May 2002, the operating partnership commenced a new medium term note program for the issuance of up to $400.0 million in principal amount of medium term notes, which will be guaranteed by us. On November 10, 2003, the operating partnership issued $75.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes to Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America under the 2002 medium term note program. We guaranteed the principal amount and interest on the notes, which mature on November 1, 2013, and bear interest at 5.53% per annum. Teachers has agreed that until November 10, 2005, the operating partnership can require Teachers to return the notes to it for cancellation for an obligation of equal dollar amount under a first mortgage loan to be secured by properties determined by the operating partnership, except that in the event the ratings on operating partnerships senior unsecured debt are downgraded by two ratings agencies to BBB , the operating partnership will only have ten days after the last of these downgrades to exercise this right. During the period when the operating partnership can exercise its cancellation right and 39 until any mortgage loans close, Teachers has agreed not to sell, contract to sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of, any portion of the notes. On December 9, 2004, we returned $21.1 million of these senior unsecured notes for cancellation and Teachers issued a first mortgage loan in this principal amount that is secured by certain properties in one of our joint ventures. In June 1998, the operating partnership issued $400.0 million of unsecured senior debt securities. Interest on the unsecured senior debt securities is payable semi annually. The 2015 notes are putable and callable in September 2005. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to its senior debt securities. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then our cash flow may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Credit Facilities. On June 1, 2004, the operating partnership completed the early renewal of its senior unsecured revolving line of credit in the amount of $500.0 million. We remain a guarantor of the operating partnerships obligations under the credit facility. The three year credit facility includes a multi currency component under which up to $250.0 million can be drawn in Yen, Euros or British Pounds Sterling. The line, which matures in June 2007 and carries a one year extension option, can be increased up to $700.0 million upon certain conditions, and replaces the operating partnerships previous $500.0 million credit facility that was to mature in December 2005. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the operating partnerships long term debt rating, which is currently 60 basis points with an annual facility fee of 20 basis points, based on the current credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt. The operating partnership uses its unsecured credit facility principally for acquisitions, funding development activity and general working capital requirements. The total amount available under the credit facility fluctuates based upon the borrowing base, as defined in the agreement governing the credit facility, which is generally based upon the value of our unencumbered properties. As of December 31, 2004, the outstanding balance on the credit facility was $235.1 million and the remaining amount available was $251.0 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $13.9 million (excluding the additional $200.0 million of potential additional capacity). The outstanding balance included borrowings denominated in Euros and Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2004, would equal approximately $114.6 million and $92.5 million in U.S. dollars, respectively. As of December 31, 2004, we had an additional outstanding balance of $27.8 million on other credit facilities. On June 29, 2004, AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating partnership, entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement providing for loans or letters of credit in a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of up to 24 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2004, equaled approximately $233.8 million U.S. dollars. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K. under the revolving credit facility, as well as the obligations of any other entity in which the operating partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest, and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the revolving credit agreement. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and for other real estate purposes in Japan. Generally, borrowers under the revolving credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the revolving credit facility with certain real estate assets or equity in entities holding such real estate assets. The revolving credit facility matures in June 2007 and has a one year extension option, which is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.25% of the outstanding commitments under the facility at that time. The rate on the borrowings is generally TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the current credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt and is currently 60 basis points. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, payable in quarterly amounts, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt, and is currently 20 basis points of the outstanding commitments under the facility. As of December 31, 2004, 40 the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2004, was $88.8 million in U.S. dollars. On November 24, 2004, AMB Tokai TMK, a Japanese subsidiary of the operating partnership, entered into a secured multi advance project financing, providing for loans in a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of up to 20 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2004, would equal approximately $194.9 million U.S. dollars. The financing agreement is among AMB Tokai TMK, us, the operating partnership, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and a syndicate of banks. We, along with the operating partnership, jointly and severally guarantee AMB Tokai TMKs obligations under the financing agreement, pursuant to a guaranty of payment executed in connection with the project financing. The financing is secured by a mortgage on certain real property located in Tokai, Tokyo, Japan, and matures on October 31, 2006 with a one year extension option. The rate on the borrowings will generally be TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt and is currently 60 basis points per annum, except that AMB Tokai TMK has purchased from Sumitomo an interest rate swap, which has fixed the interest rate payable on a principal amount equal to 13 billion Yen at 1.32% per annum plus the applicable margin. In addition, there is an annual commitment fee based on unused commitments, payable quarterly, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt, and is currently 20 basis points of the amount of unused commitments. The financing agreement contains customary and other affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. In addition, Sumitomo, AMB Tokai TMK and the operating partnership signed a commitment letter on November 24, 2004, pursuant to which Sumitomo committed to purchase bonds that may be issued by AMB Tokai TMK in an amount between 10 billion Yen and 15 billion Yen (such amount to be determined by AMB Tokai TMK). The bonds would be secured by the AMB Ohta Distribution Center and would generally accrue interest at a rate of TIBOR plus 1.10% per annum; because the swap purchased by AMB Tokai TMK from Sumitomo is coterminous with the maturity date of the proposed bonds, AMB Tokai TMK will have fixed the interest rate payable on, in general, a principal amount equal to 13 billion Yen at 2.42% per annum. The bonds, if issued, would mature on October 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2004, the outstanding balance on this financing agreement was 14 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2004, equaled approximately $136.4 million U.S. dollars. Mortgages Receivable. Through a wholly owned subsidiary, we hold a mortgage loan receivable on AMB Pier One, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture. The note bears interest at 13.0% and matures in May 2026. As of December 31, 2004, the outstanding balance on the note was $12.9 million. We also hold a short term mortgage on a sold property totaling $0.8 million with an interest rate of 12.0%. The mortgage matures in November 2006.

(3) Our share of total debt is the pro rata portion of the total debt based on our percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated ventures holding the debt. We believe that our share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze our leverage and to compare our leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of our debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their joint ventures. Our share of total debt is not intended to reflect our actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures. The above table reconciles our share of total debt to total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure.

(4) Our share of total book capitalization is defined as our share of total debt plus minority interests to preferred unitholders and limited partnership unitholders plus stockholders equity. Liquidity As of December 31, 2004, we had $109.4 million in cash and cash equivalents (of which $69.0 million was held by our consolidated co investment joint ventures), and $418.3 million of additional available 43 borrowings under our credit facilities. As of December 31, 2004, we had $37.2 million in restricted cash (of which $21.2 million was held by our consolidated co investment joint ventures). Our board of directors declared a regular cash dividend for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 of $0.425 per share of common stock, and the operating partnership announced its intention to pay a regular cash distribution for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 of $0.425 per common unit. The dividends and distributions were payable on January 7, 2005 to stockholders and unitholders of record on December 23, 2004. The series L and M preferred stock dividends were payable on January 17, 2005 to stockholders of record on January 6, 2005. The series E, F, J and K preferred unit quarterly distributions were payable on January 17, 2005. The series D, H and I preferred unit quarterly distributions were payable on December 27, 2004. The following table sets forth the dividends and distributions paid or payable per share or unit for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002: Paying Entity Security 2004 2003 2002 AMB Property Corporation Common stock $ 1.70 $ 1.66 $ 1.64 AMB Property Corporation Series A preferred stock n/a $ 1.15 $ 2.13 AMB Property Corporation Series L preferred stock $ 1.63 $ 0.85 n/a AMB Property Corporation Series M preferred stock $ 1.69 $ 0.17 n/a Operating Partnership Common limited partnership units $ 1.70 $ 1.66 $ 1.64 Operating Partnership Series B preferred units n/a $ 3.71 $ 4.31 Operating Partnership Series J preferred units $ 3.98 $ 3.98 $ 3.98 Operating Partnership Series K preferred units $ 3.98 $ 3.98 $ 2.96 AMB Property II, L.P.

Series N preferred units $ 0.70 n/a n/a The anticipated size of our distributions, using only cash from operations, will not allow us to retire all of our debt as it comes due. Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Commitments Developments. In addition to recurring capital expenditures, which consist of building improvements and leasing costs incurred to renew or re tenant space, during 2004, we initiated 14 new industrial development projects in the United States and Mexico with a total estimated investment of $235.4 million, aggregating an estimated 3.1 million square feet, four new industrial developments in Japan and Singapore with a total expected investment of $368.8 million, aggregating approximately 2.7 million square feet, and one new industrial development in Europe with a total expected investment of $44.3 million, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet. As of December 31, 2004, we had 30 projects in our development pipeline representing a total estimated investment of $828.7 million upon completion, of which four industrial projects with a total of 1.2 million square feet and an aggregate estimated investment of $55.0 million upon completion are held in unconsolidated joint ventures. In addition, we held four development projects available for sale, representing a total estimated investment of $29.2 million upon completion. Of this total, $515.2 million had been funded as of December 31, 2004 and an estimated $342.7 million was required to 44 complete current and planned projects. We expect to fund these expenditures with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances, net proceeds from property divestitures and private capital from co investment partners, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow. Acquisitions. During 2004, we acquired 64 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet for a total expected investment of $695.2 million, of which we acquired 48 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 4.2 million square feet through three of our co investment joint ventures, for a total expected investment of $261.0 million. We generally fund our acquisitions through private capital contributions, borrowings under our credit facilities, cash, debt issuances and net proceeds from property divestitures. Lease Commitments. We have entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily on tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms from two to 58 years. These operating lease payments are amortized ratably over the terms of the related leases. Future minimum rental payments required under non cancelable operating leases in effect as of December 31, 2004 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2005 $ 10,810 2006 11,320 2007 11,280 2008 11,310 2009 11,169 Thereafter 222,437 Total $ 278,326 Co investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. As of December 31, 2004, we had investments in co investment joint ventures with a gross book value of $2.6 billion, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, and investments in an unconsolidated co investment joint venture of $9.5 million. As of December 31, 2004, we may make additional capital contributions to current and planned co investment joint ventures of up to $47.9 million. From time to time, we may raise additional equity commitments for AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open ended consolidated co investment joint venture formed in 2004 with institutional investors, which invest through a private real estate investment trust. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of this fund, we are obligated to contribute 20% of the total equity commitments to the fund until such time our total equity commitment is greater than $150 million, at which time, our obligation is reduced to 10% of the total equity commitments. We expect to fund these contributions with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances or net proceeds from property divestitures, which could adversely effect our cash flow. Captive Insurance Company. In December 2001, we formed a wholly owned captive insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., which provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the deductible under our third party policies. We capitalized Arcata National Insurance Ltd. in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata National Insurance Ltd. established annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss experience of our properties. Annually, we engage an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims, related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata National Insurance Ltd. may be adjusted based on this estimate. Premiums paid to Arcata National Insurance Ltd. have a retrospective component, so that if expenses, including losses and deductibles, are less than premiums collected, the excess may be returned to the property owners (and, in turn, as appropriate, to the customers) and conversely, subject to certain limitations, if expenses, including losses, are greater than premiums collected, an additional premium will be charged. As with all recoverable expenses, differences between estimated and actual insurance premiums are recognized in the subsequent year. Through this 45 structure, we believe that we have more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market. Potential Unknown Liabilities. Unknown liabilities may include the following: liabilities for clean up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to our formation transactions that had not been asserted prior to our formation transactions; accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; tax liabilities; and claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these entities. Overview of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our debt, interest and lease payments due by period as of December 31, 2004 (dollars in thousands): Less than More than Contractual Obligations 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Total Debt $ 359,847 $ 743,280 $ 618,012 $ 1,525,286 $ 3,246,425 Debt interest payments 25,154 30,438 36,117 108,280 199,989 Operating lease commitments 10,810 22,600 22,479 222,437 278,326 Total $ 395,811 $ 796,318 $ 676,608 $ 1,856,003 $ 3,724,740 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Standby Letters of Credit. As of December 31, 2004, we had provided approximately $33.6 million in letters of credit, of which $13.9 million was provided under the operating partnerships $500.0 million unsecured credit facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other commitments. Guarantees. Other than parent guarantees associated with the unsecured debt of the operating partnership, as of December 31, 2004, we had outstanding guarantees in the aggregate amount of $34.7 million in connection with certain acquisitions and lease obligations of which $8.3 million was backed by standby letters of credit. As of December 31, 2004, we guaranteed $4.8 million on outstanding construction loans on two of our unconsolidated joint ventures. Additionally, we provided a take out guarantee after the completion of construction on the aggregate construction loan amount of $30.2 million for another of our unconsolidated joint ventures, of which $20.9 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2004. In connection with this construction loan, our joint venture partner provides an underlying construction loan guarantee up to the completion of construction. Performance and Surety Bonds. As of December 31, 2004, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $1.2 million. These bonds were issued in connection with certain of our development projects and were posted to guarantee certain tax obligations and the construction of certain real property improvements and infrastructure, such as grading, sewers and streets. Performance and surety bonds are commonly required by public agencies from real estate developers. Performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the taxes due or the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. Promoted Interests and Other Contractual Obligations. Upon the achievement of certain return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, we may be obligated to make payments to certain of joint venture partners pursuant to the terms and provisions of their contractual agreements with us. From time to 46 time in the normal course of our business, we enter into various contracts with third parties that may obligate us to make payments or perform other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. SUPPLEMENTAL EARNINGS MEASURES FFO. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider funds from operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. FFO is defined as net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, less gains (or losses) from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estate related depreciation, and adjustments to derive our pro rata share of FFO of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. Further, we do not adjust FFO to eliminate the effects of non recurring charges. We believe that FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. We believe that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. The following table reflects the calculation of FFO reconciled from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands): 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Net income $ 125,471 $ 129,128 $ 121,119 $ 136,200 $ 121,782 Gains from dispositions of real estate (47,224 ) (50,325 ) (19,383 ) (41,859 ) (7,044 ) Real estate related depreciation and amortization: Total depreciation and amortization 160,026 132,167 121,069 101,455 81,523 Discontinued operations depreciation 7,324 10,170 15,434 12,088 8,835 Furniture, fixtures and equipment depreciation (871 ) (720 ) (712 ) (731 ) (380 ) Ground lease amortization (2,301 ) (1,232 ) (734 ) 47 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Adjustments to derive FFO from consolidated joint ventures: Joint venture partners minority interests (Net income) 37,817 31,726 27,320 23,731 11,086 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Net income) 3,318 2,890 4,004 5,322 6,676 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Development profits) 435 344 57 764 Discontinued operations minority interests (Net income) 4,573 4,991 5,105 4,666 2,586 FFO attributable to minority interests (80,192 ) (65,603 ) (52,051 ) (40,144 ) (15,055 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures: Our share of net income (3,781 ) (5,445 ) (5,674 ) (5,467 ) (5,212 ) Our share of FFO 7,549 9,755 9,291 8,014 7,188 Preferred stock dividends (7,131 ) (6,999 ) (8,496 ) (8,500 ) (8,500 ) Preferred stock and unit redemption discount (issuance costs) (5,413 ) 412 (7,600 ) Funds from operations $ 207,314 $ 186,666 $ 215,194 $ 186,707 $ 202,751 Basic FFO per common share and unit $ 2.39 $ 2.17 $ 2.44 $ 2.09 $ 2.26 Diluted FFO per common share and unit $ 2.30 $ 2.13 $ 2.40 $ 2.07 $ 2.25 Weighted average common shares and units: Basic 86,885,250 85,859,899 88,204,208 89,286,379 89,566,375 Diluted 90,120,250 87,616,365 89,689,310 90,325,801 90,024,511 48 BUSINESS RISKS Our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences to us. These risks include, among others: General Real Estate Industry Risks Our performance and value are subject to general economic conditions and risks associated with our real estate assets. The investment returns available from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of income earned and capital appreciation generated by the properties, as well as the expenses incurred in connection with the properties. If our properties do not generate income sufficient to meet operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, then our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders could be adversely affected. In addition, there are significant expenditures associated with an investment in real estate (such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs) that generally do not decline when circumstances reduce the income from the property. Income from, and the value of, our properties may be adversely affected by: changes in the general economic climate; local conditions, such as oversupply of or a reduction in demand for industrial space; the attractiveness of our properties to potential customers; competition from other properties; our ability to provide adequate maintenance and insurance; increased operating costs; increased cost of compliance with regulations; and the potential for liability under applicable laws (including changes in tax laws). In addition, periods of economic slowdown or recession in the United States and in other countries, rising interest rates or declining demand for real estate, or public perception that any of these events may occur, would result in a general decrease in rents or an increased occurrence of defaults under existing leases, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Future terrorist attacks may result in declining economic activity, which could reduce the demand for and the value of our properties. To the extent that future attacks impact our customers, their businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to honor their existing leases. Our properties are concentrated predominantly in the industrial real estate sector. As a result of this concentration, we would feel the impact of an economic downturn in this sector more acutely than if our portfolio included other property types. We may be unable to renew leases or relet space as leases expire. As of December 31, 2004, leases on a total of 16.3% of our industrial properties (based on annualized base rent) will expire on or prior to December 31, 2005. We derive most of our income from rent received from our customers. Accordingly, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected if we are unable to promptly relet or renew these expiring leases, if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected. If a tenant experiences a downturn in its business or other type of financial distress, then it may be unable to make timely rental payments or renew its lease. Further, our ability to rent space and the rents that we can charge are impacted, not only by customer demand, but by the number of other properties we have to compete with to appeal to customers. 49 Actions by our competitors may decrease or prevent increases of the occupancy and rental rates of our properties. We compete with other developers, owners and operators of real estate, some of which own properties similar to ours in the same submarkets in which our properties are located. If our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, we may lose potential tenants, and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge in order to retain tenants when our tenants leases expire. As a result, our financial condition, cash flow, cash available for distribution, trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could be materially adversely affected. Real estate investments are relatively illiquid, making it difficult for us to respond promptly to changing conditions. Real estate assets are not as liquid as certain other types of assets. Further, as a real estate investment trust, the Internal Revenue Code regulates the number of properties that we can dispose of in a year, their tax bases and the cost of improvements that we make to the properties. In addition, a portion of the properties held directly or indirectly by certain of our subsidiary partnerships were acquired in exchange for limited partnership units in the applicable partnership. The contribution agreements for such properties may contain restrictions on certain sales, exchanges or other dispositions of these properties, or a portion thereof, that result in a taxable transaction for specified periods, following the contribution of these properties to the applicable partnership. These limitations may affect our ability to sell properties. This lack of liquidity and the Internal Revenue Code restrictions may limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions and, as a result, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We could be adversely affected if a significant number of our tenants are unable to meet their lease obligations. Our results of operations, distributable cash flow and the value of our common stock would be adversely affected if a significant number of our tenants were unable to meet their lease obligations to us. In the event of a significant number of lease defaults, our cash flow may not be sufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders and repay maturing debt. As of December 31, 2004, we did not have any single tenant account for annualized base rent revenues greater than 3.4%. However, in the event of lease defaults by a significant number of our tenants, we may incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord. We may be unable to consummate acquisitions on advantageous terms or acquisitions may not perform as we expect. We acquire and intend to continue to acquire primarily industrial properties. The acquisition of properties entails various risks, including the risks that our investments may not perform as we expect, that we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate our new acquisitions into our existing operations and that our cost estimates for bringing an acquired property up to market standards may prove inaccurate. Further, we face significant competition for attractive investment opportunities from other well capitalized real estate investors, including both publicly traded real estate investment trusts and private institutional investment funds. This competition increases as investments in real estate become increasingly attractive relative to other forms of investment. As a result of competition, we may be unable to acquire additional properties as we desire or the purchase price may be significantly elevated. In addition, we expect to finance future acquisitions through a combination of borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the operating partnership or its subsidiaries and proceeds from property divestitures, which may not be available and which could adversely affect our cash flow. Any of the above risks could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. 50 We may be unable to complete renovation and development projects on advantageous terms. As part of our business, we develop new and renovate existing properties. The real estate development and renovation business involves significant risks that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock, which include: we may not be able to obtain financing for development projects on favorable terms and complete construction on schedule or within budget, resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs and delays in leasing the properties and generating cash flow; we may not be able to obtain, or may experience delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations; the properties may perform below anticipated levels, producing cash flow below budgeted amounts; substantial renovation and new development activities, regardless of their ultimate success, typically require a significant amount of managements time and attention, diverting their attention from our day to day operations; and upon completion of construction, we may not be able to obtain, or obtain on advantageous terms, permanent financing for activities that we have financed through construction loans. Risks Associated With Our International Business Our international growth is subject to special risks and we may not be able to effectively manage our international growth. We have acquired and developed, and expect to continue to acquire and develop, properties in international countries. Because local markets affect our operations, our international investments are subject to economic fluctuations in the international locations in which we invest. In addition, our international operations are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as revisions in tax treaties or other laws and regulations, including those governing the taxation of our international revenues, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and, in certain parts of the world, property rights uncertainty and political instability. We cannot predict the likelihood that any of these developments may occur. Further, we have entered, and may in the future enter, into agreements with non U.S. entities that are governed by the laws of, and are subject to dispute resolution in the courts of, another country or region. We cannot accurately predict whether such a forum would provide us with an effective and efficient means of resolving disputes that may arise. And even if we are able to obtain a satisfactory decision through arbitration or a court proceeding, we could have difficulty enforcing any award or judgment on a timely basis or at all. Further, our business has grown rapidly and continues to grow through international property acquisitions and developments. If we fail to effectively manage our international growth, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. Acquired properties may be located in new markets, where we may face risks associated with investing in an unfamiliar market. We have acquired and may continue to acquire properties in international markets that are new to us. When we acquire properties located in these markets, we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local government and permitting procedures. We work to mitigate such risks through extensive diligence and research and associations with experienced partners, however there can be no guarantee that all such risks will be eliminated. 51 We are subject to risks from potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of the other countries in which we invest. We are pursuing, and intend to continue to pursue, growth opportunities in international markets. As we invest in countries where the U.S. dollar is not the national currency, we are subject to international currency risks from the potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of those other countries. A significant depreciation in the value of the currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may materially affect our results of operations. We attempt to mitigate any such effects by borrowing under our multi currency credit facility in the currency of the country we are investing in and, under certain circumstances, by putting in place international currency put option contracts hedging exchange rate fluctuations. For leases denominated in international currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage the international exchange risk. We cannot, however, assure you that our efforts will successfully neutralize all international currency risks. If we do engage in international currency exchange rate hedging activities, any income recognized with respect to these hedges (as well as any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates) may not qualify under the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT. Our performance and value are impacted by the local economic conditions of and the risks associated with doing business in California. As of December 31, 2004, our industrial properties located in California represented 27.0% of the aggregate square footage of our industrial operating properties and 27.8% of our industrial annualized base rent. Our revenue from, and the value of, our properties located in California may be affected by local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties) and the local economic climate. Business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns, changing demographics, and other factors may adversely impact Californias economic climate. Because of the number of properties we have located in California, a downturn in Californias economy or real estate conditions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We may experience losses that our insurance does not cover. We carry commercial liability, property and rental loss insurance covering all the properties that we own and manage in types and amounts that we believe are adequate and appropriate given the relative risks applicable to the property, the cost of coverage and industry practice. Certain losses, such as those due to terrorism, windstorms, floods or seismic activity, may be insured subject to certain limitations, including large deductibles or co payments and policy limits. Although we have obtained coverage for certain acts of terrorism, with policy specifications and insured limits that we consider commercially reasonable given the cost and availability of such coverage, we cannot be certain that we will be able to renew coverage on comparable terms or collect under such policies. In addition, there are other types of losses, such as those from riots, bio terrorism, or acts of war, that are not generally insured in our industry because it is not economically feasible to do so. We may incur material losses in excess of insurance proceeds and we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance at commercially reasonable rates. If we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds our insured limits with respect to one or more of our properties, then we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue from those properties and, if there is recourse debt, then we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties. Moreover, as the general partner of the operating partnership, we generally will be liable for all of the operating partnerships unsatisfied recourse obligations, including any obligations incurred by the operating partnership as the general partner of co investment joint ventures. Any such losses could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. A number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to earthquake activity. Domestic properties located in active seismic areas include properties in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Memphis and Seattle. Our largest concentration of such properties is in California where, as of 52 December 31, 2004, we had 289 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 24.4 million square feet and representing 27.0% of our industrial operating properties based on aggregate square footage and 27.8% based on industrial annualized base rent. International properties located in active seismic areas include Tokyo and Osaka, Japan and Mexico City, Mexico. We carry replacement cost earthquake insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable. We evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants. We are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with properties owned through joint ventures, limited liability companies and partnerships. As of December 31, 2004, we owned approximately 55.6 million square feet of our properties through several joint ventures, limited liability companies or partnerships with third parties. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in partnerships, limited liability companies or joint ventures and we intend to continue to develop and acquire properties through joint ventures, limited liability companies and partnerships with other persons or entities when warranted by the circumstances. Such partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions. Partnership, limited liability company or joint venture investments involve certain risks, including: if our partners, co members or joint venturers go bankrupt, then we and any other remaining general partners, members, or joint venturers would generally remain liable for the partnerships, limited liability companys, or joint ventures liabilities; if our partners fail to fund their share of any required capital contributions; our partners, co members or joint venturers might have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals that would affect our ability to operate the property; our partners, co members or joint venturers may have the power to act contrary to our instructions, requests, policies, or objectives, including our current policy with respect to maintaining our qualification as a real estate investment trust; the joint venture, limited liability and partnership agreements often restrict the transfer of a joint ventures, members or partners interest or buy sell or may otherwise restrict our ability to sell the interest when we desire or on advantageous terms; disputes between us and our partners, co members or joint venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business and result in subjecting the properties owned by the applicable partnership or joint venture to additional risk; and we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our partners, co members or joint venturers. We generally seek to maintain sufficient control of our partnerships, limited liability companies, and joint ventures to permit us to achieve our business objectives, however, we may not be able to do so, and the occurrence of one or more of the events described above could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We may be unable to complete divestitures on advantageous terms or contribute properties. We intend to continue to divest ourselves of properties that do not meet our strategic objectives, provided that we can negotiate acceptable terms and conditions. Our ability to dispose of properties on advantageous terms depends on factors beyond our control, including competition from other sellers and the availability of attractive financing for potential buyers of our properties. If we are unable to dispose of properties on favorable terms or redeploy the proceeds of property divestitures in accordance with our investment strategy, then our 53 financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. We also anticipate contributing or selling properties to funds and joint ventures. If we do not have sufficient properties available that meet the investment criteria of current or future property funds, or if the funds have reduced or no access to capital on favorable terms, then such contributions or sales could be delayed or prevented, adversely affecting our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Contingent or unknown liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition. We have and may in the future acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of any of these entities or properties, then we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect our cash flow. Unknown liabilities with respect to entities or properties acquired might include: liabilities for clean up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; tax liabilities; and claims for indemnification by the general partners, officers and directors and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties. We are dependent on external sources of capital. In order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain) and are taxed on our income to the extent it is not fully distributed. Consequently, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs, including acquisition and development activities, from cash retained from operations and must rely on third party sources of capital. Further, in order to maintain our REIT status and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes, we may need to borrow funds on a short term basis to meet the REIT distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. These short term borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non deductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. Our ability to access private debt and equity capital on favorable terms or at all is dependent upon a number of factors, including, general market conditions, the markets perception of our growth potential, our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our capital stock. Debt Financing Risks We could incur more debt, increasing our debt service. It is our policy to incur debt, either directly or through our subsidiaries, only if it will not cause our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio to exceed approximately 45%. Our definition of our share of total market capitalization is our share of total debt plus preferred equity liquidation preferences plus market equity. See footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratio table contained in Part II, Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Liquidity and Capital Resources for our definition of market equity and footnote 2 to such table for our definition of our share of total debt. The aggregate amount of indebtedness that we may incur under our policy increases directly with an increase in the market price per share of our capital stock. Further, our management could alter or eliminate this policy without stockholder approval. If we change this policy, then we could become 54 more highly leveraged, resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect the cash available for distribution to our stockholders. We face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk. As of December 31, 2004, we had total debt outstanding of $3.3 billion. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to the senior debt securities referenced in our financial statements. We are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest. We anticipate that we will repay only a small portion of the principal of our debt prior to maturity. Accordingly, we will likely need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds of other capital transactions, then we expect that our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repay all such maturing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. In addition, if we mortgage one or more of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments, then the property could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income and asset value. A foreclosure on one or more of our properties could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Covenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our financial condition. The terms of our credit agreements and other indebtedness require that we comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage. These covenants may limit flexibility in our operations, and our failure to comply with these covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt agreement even if we have satisfied our payment obligations. As of December 31, 2004, we had certain non recourse, secured loans, which are cross collateralized by multiple properties. If we default on any of these loans, we may then be required to repay such indebtedness, together with applicable prepayment charges, to avoid foreclosure on all the cross collateralized properties within the applicable pool. Foreclosure on our properties, or our inability to refinance our loans on favorable terms, could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. In addition, our credit facilities and senior debt securities contain certain cross default provisions, which are triggered in the event that our other material indebtedness is in default. These cross default provisions may require us to repay or restructure the credit facilities and the senior debt securities in addition to any mortgage or other debt that is in default, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rates may adversely affect results of operations. We seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements, such as interest rate cap agreements and interest rate swap agreements. These agreements involve risks, such as the risk that the counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes and that a court could rule that such agreements are not legally enforceable. Hedging may reduce overall returns on our investments. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may materially adversely affect our results of operations. 55 Conflicts of Interest Risks Some of our directors and executive officers are involved in other real estate activities and investments and therefore, may have conflicts of interest with us. Certain of our executive officers and directors own interests in other real estate related businesses and investments, including retail development projects, office buildings and de minimis holdings of the equity securities of public and private real estate companies. Our executive officers continued involvement in other real estate related activities could divert their attention from our day to day operations. Our executive officers have entered into non competition agreements with us pursuant to which they have agreed not to engage in any activities, directly or indirectly, in respect of commercial real estate, and not to make any investment in respect of any industrial or retail real estate, other than through ownership of not more than 5% of the outstanding shares of a public company engaged in such activities or through the existing investments referred to in this report. State law may limit our ability to enforce these agreements. We believe that these properties and activities generally do not directly compete with any of our properties. However, it is possible that a property in which an executive officer or director, or an affiliate of an executive officer or director, has an interest may compete with us in the future if we were to invest in a property similar in type and in close proximity to that property. We will not acquire any properties from our executive officers, directors or their affiliates unless the transaction is approved by a majority of the disinterested and independent (as defined by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange) members of our board of directors with respect to that transaction. Our role as general partner of the operating partnership may conflict with the interests of our stockholders. As the general partner of the operating partnership, we have fiduciary obligations to the operating partnerships limited partners, the discharge of which may conflict with the interests of our stockholders. In addition, those persons holding limited partnership units will have the right to vote as a class on certain amendments to the operating partnerships partnership agreement and individually to approve certain amendments that would adversely affect their rights. The limited partners may exercise these voting rights in a manner that conflicts with the interests of our stockholders. In addition, under the terms of the operating partnerships partnership agreement, holders of limited partnership units will have certain approval rights with respect to certain transactions that affect all stockholders but which they may not exercise in a manner that reflects the interests of all stockholders. Risks Associated with Government Regulations The costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations and any related potential liability could exceed our budgets for these items. Under various environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at, on, under or in its property. The costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial. These laws typically impose liability and clean up responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean up costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury, property damage, or other costs, including investigation and clean up costs, resulting from the environmental contamination. Environmental laws in some countries, including the U.S., also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and 56 may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos. Some of our properties may contain asbestos containing building materials. In addition, some of our properties are leased or have been leased, in part, to owners and operators of businesses that use, store, or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances. Further, certain of our properties are on, adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, or upon which others have engaged, are engaged or may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances. From time to time, we may acquire properties, or interests in properties, with known adverse environmental conditions where we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior risk adjusted return. In such an instance, we underwrite the costs of environmental investigation, clean up and monitoring into the acquisition cost and obtain appropriate environmental insurance for the property. Further, in connection with certain divested properties, we have agreed to remain responsible for, and to bear the cost of, remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties. At the time of acquisition, we subject all of our properties to a Phase I or similar environmental assessments by independent environmental consultants and we may have additional Phase II testing performed upon consultants recommendation. These environmental assessments have not revealed, and we are not aware of, any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. Nonetheless, it is possible that the assessments did not reveal all environmental liabilities and that there are material environmental liabilities unknown to us, or that known environmental conditions may give rise to liabilities that are greater than we anticipated. Further, our properties current environmental condition may be affected by customers, the condition of land, operations in the vicinity of the properties (such as releases from underground storage tanks), or by unrelated third parties. If the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations exceed our budgets for these items, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar regulations could result in substantial costs. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, places of public accommodation must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. If we are required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, including removing access barriers, then our cash flow and the amounts available for dividends to our stockholders may be adversely affected. Our properties are also subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. We could incur fines or private damage awards if we fail to comply with these requirements. While we believe that our properties are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements, the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us that will affect our cash flow and results of operations. Federal Income Tax Risks Our failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust would have serious adverse consequences to our stockholders. We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1997. We currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code and believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a real estate 57 investment trust, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify. Qualification as a real estate investment trust requires us to satisfy numerous requirements (some on an annual and others on a quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. For example, in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we must derive at least 95% of our gross income in any year from qualifying sources. In addition, we must pay dividends to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis. These provisions and the applicable treasury regulations are more complicated in our case because we hold our assets through the operating partnership. Legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a real estate investment trust or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. However, we are not aware of any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect our ability to qualify as a real estate investment trust. If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment trust for the four taxable years following the year in which we lost qualification. If we lose our real estate investment trust status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved. In addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. Certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction. From time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. Under the Internal Revenue Code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100% penalty tax. Since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are treated as prohibited transactions. However, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. While we believe that the Internal Revenue Service would not prevail in any such dispute, if the IRS were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction. In addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes. Risks Associated With Our Dependence on Key Personnel We depend on the efforts of our executive officers. While we believe that we could find suitable replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers. Risks Associated with Our Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting. The design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. As part of managements on going 58 review of our accounting policies and internal control over financial reporting, on October 12, 2004, management determined that there was a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to ground lease depreciation. This weakness resulted in an understatement of depreciation expense and resulted in a restatement of depreciation expense for our results in previously issued financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 and for the quarters ended March 31, 2004 and June 30, 2004. In connection with correcting this error, management modified our system of internal control over financial reporting to remediate the material weakness. As of December 31, 2004, management had appropriately remediated this issue and the material weakness no longer existed. While management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Other deficiencies, including any material weakness, in our internal control over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, a decline in our stock price, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operation, financial condition or liquidity. Risks Associated with Ownership of Our Stock Limitations in our charter and bylaws could prevent a change in control. Certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay, defer, or prevent a change in control or other transaction that could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for the common stock. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock may be owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code to include certain entities) during the last half of a taxable year after the first taxable year for which a real estate investment trust election is made. Furthermore, our common stock must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a 12 month taxable year (or a proportionate part of a short tax year). In addition, if we, or an owner of 10% or more of our stock, actually or constructively owns 10% or more of one of our customers (or a tenant of any partnership in which we are a partner), then the rent received by us (either directly or through any such partnership) from that tenant will not be qualifying income for purposes of the real estate investment trust gross income tests of the Internal Revenue Code. To help us maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, we prohibit the ownership, actually or by virtue of the constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, by any single person, of more than 9.8% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the issued and outstanding shares of each of our common stock, series L preferred stock and series M preferred stock. We also prohibit the ownership, actually or constructively, of any shares of our series D, E, F, H, I, J and K preferred stock by any single person so that no such person, taking into account all of our stock so owned by such person, including any common stock or other series of preferred stock, may own in excess of 9.8% of our issued and outstanding capital stock. We refer to this limitation as the ownership limit. Shares acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary. Any person who acquires shares in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any dividends on the shares or be entitled to vote the shares or receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the shares in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the shares or the amount realized from the sale. A transfer of shares in violation of the above limits may be void under certain circumstances. The ownership limit may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control and, therefore, could adversely affect our stockholders ability to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for the shares of our common stock in connection with such transaction. Our charter authorizes us to issue additional shares of common and preferred stock and to establish the preferences, rights and other terms of any series or class of preferred stock that we issue. Although our board of directors has no intention to do so at the present time, it could establish a series or class of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a transaction, including a change in control, that might involve a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. 59 Our charter and bylaws and Maryland law also contain other provisions that may impede various actions by stockholders without approval of our board of directors, which in turn may delay, defer, or prevent a transaction, including a change in control. Those provisions in our charter and bylaws include: directors may be removed only for cause and only upon a two thirds vote of stockholders; our board can fix the number of directors within set limits (which limits are subject to change by our board), and fill vacant directorships upon the vote of a majority of the remaining directors, even though less than a quorum, or in the case of a vacancy resulting from an increase in the size of the board, a majority of the entire board; stockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or propose business for consideration at a stockholders meeting; and the request of the holders of 50% or more of our common stock is necessary for stockholders to call a special meeting. Those provisions provided for under Maryland law include: a two thirds vote of stockholders is required to amend our charter; and stockholders may only act by written consent with the unanimous approval of all stockholders entitled to vote on the matter in question. In addition, our board could elect to adopt, without stockholder approval, certain other provisions under Maryland law that may impede a change in control. The market value of our stock could be substantially affected by various factors. As with other publicly traded securities, the trading price of our stock will depend on many factors that are not within our control and may change from time to time, including: the extent of investor interest in us; the market for similar securities issued by real estate investment trusts; the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate based companies); general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of our stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends; terrorist activity may adversely affect the markets in which our securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending; general economic conditions; and our financial condition, performance and prospects. Other factors such as governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws could also have a significant impact on the future trading price of our stock. Earnings and cash dividends, asset value and market interest rates affect the price of our stock. As a real estate investment trust the market value of our equity securities, in general, is based primarily upon the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash dividends. Our equity securities market value is based secondarily upon the market value of our underlying real estate assets. For this reason, shares of our stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than our net asset value per share. To the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working capital reserves, or other purposes, these retained funds, while increasing the value of our underlying assets, may not 60 correspondingly increase the market price of our stock. Our failure to meet the markets expectations with regard to future earnings and cash dividends likely would adversely affect the market price of our stock. Further, the distribution yield on the stock (as a percentage of the price of the stock) relative to market interest rates may also influence the price of our stock. An increase in market interest rates might lead prospective purchasers of our stock to expect a higher distribution yield, which would adversely affect our stocks market price. Additionally, if the market price of our stock declines significantly, then we might breach certain covenants with respect to our debt obligations, which could adversely affect our liquidity and ability to make future acquisitions and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. If we issue additional securities, then the investment of existing stockholders will be diluted. We have authority to issue shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities, and to cause the operating partnership to issue limited partnership units, in exchange for property or otherwise. Existing stockholders have no preemptive right to acquire any additional securities issued by the operating partnership or us and any issuance of additional equity securities could result in dilution of an existing stockholders investment. We could change our investment and financing policies without a vote of stockholders. Subject to our current investment policy to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust (unless a change is approved by our board of directors under certain circumstances), our board of directors determines our investment and financing policies, our growth strategy and our debt, capitalization, distribution and operating policies. Although our board of directors does not presently intend to revise or amend these strategies and policies, they may do so at any time without a vote of stockholders. Any such changes may not serve the interests of all stockholders and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations, including our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. Shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The operating partnership and AMB Property II, L.P. had 4,746,104 common limited partnership units issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2004, which may be exchanged generally one year after their issuance on a one for one basis into shares of our common stock. In the future, the operating partnership or AMB Property II, L.P. may issue additional limited partnership units, and we may issue shares of common stock, in connection with the acquisition of properties or in private placements. These shares of common stock and the shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of limited partnership units may be sold in the public securities markets over time, pursuant to registration rights that we have granted, or may grant in connection with future issuances, or pursuant to Rule 144. In addition, common stock issued under our stock option and incentive plans may also be sold in the market pursuant to registration statements that we have filed or pursuant to Rule 144. As of December 31, 2004, under our stock option and incentive plans, we had 5,103,927 shares of common stock reserved and available for issuance (including cancellations and forfeitures), had outstanding options to purchase 10,220,631 shares of common stock (net of cancellations and forfeitures, and 2,447,390 shares that we have issued upon the exercise of options) and had 1,178,052 restricted shares of common stock outstanding (net of 75,988 shares that have been forfeited). Future sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Further, the existence of the operating partnerships limited partnership units and the shares of our common stock reserved for issuance upon exchange of limited partnership units and the exercise of options, and registration rights referred to above, may adversely affect the terms upon which we are able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices, interest rates and international exchange rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing 61 activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings and our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2004, we had two outstanding interest rate swaps with aggregate notional amount of $137.1 million (in U.S. dollars). See Financial Instruments disclosure below. The table below summarizes the market risks associated with our fixed and variable rate debt outstanding before unamortized debt premiums of $10.8 million as of December 31, 2004 (dollars in thousands): 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total Fixed rate debt(1) $ 358,798 $ 172,312 $ 145,740 $ 386,761 $ 188,305 $ 1,496,223 $ 2,748,139 Average interest rate 7.0 % 6.6 % 6.9 % 6.7 % 4.8 % 7.2 % 6.6 % Variable rate debt(2) $ 1,049 $ 84,037 $ 341,191 $ 5,571 $ 37,375 $ 29,063 $ 498,286 Average interest rate 3.6 % 2.6 % 2.0 % 2.8 % 2.7 % 1.9 % 2.1 % Interest Payments $ 25,154 $ 13,558 $ 16,880 $ 26,069 $ 10,048 $ 108,280 $ 199,989 (1) Represents 84.7% of all outstanding debt. (2) Represents 15.3% of all outstanding debt. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased by 10%, then the increase in interest expense on the variable rate debt would be $1.1 million annually. As of December 31, 2004, the book value and the estimated fair value of our total consolidated debt (both secured and unsecured) was $3.4 billion based on our estimate of current market interest rates. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, variable rate debt comprised 15.3% and 14.7%, respectively, of all our outstanding debt. Variable rate debt was $498.3 million and $378.0 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. The increase is primarily due to higher outstanding balances on our credit facilities. This increase in our outstanding variable rate debt increases our risk associated with unfavorable interest rate fluctuations. Financial Instruments. We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income or income. For revenues or expenses denominated in non functional currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments in effect at December 31, 2004 were two put options (buy USD/sell MXN) hedging against adverse currency exchange fluctuations of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar and two interest rate swaps hedging cash flows of our variable rate borrowings based on 62 Euribor (Europe) and Japanese TIBOR (Japan). The following table summarizes our financial instruments as of December 31, 2004: Maturity Dates Notional Related Derivatives (In thousands) March 05 Dec 08 October 12 Amount Fair Value Interest Rate Swaps: Plain Interest Rate Swap, Japan Notional Amount (U.S. Dollars) $ 126,669 $ 126,669 Receive Floating(%) 3M TIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 1.32 % Fair Market Value $ $ (1,211 ) Plain Interest Rate Swap, Europe Notional Amount (U.S. Dollars) $ 10,437 $ 10,437 Receive Floating(%) 3M EURIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 3.72 % Fair Market Value $ $ (13 ) Foreign Exchange Agreements: Option to Sell MXN/ Buy USD Contract Amount (U.S. Dollars) $ 2,422 $ 2,422 Contract FX Rate 11.50 Contract Premium $ 43 $ 30 Total $ 139,528 $ (1,194 ) International Operations. Our exposure to market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries operating in the United States and Mexico. The functional currency for our subsidiaries operating outside North America is generally the local currency of the country in which the entity is located, mitigating the effect of currency exchange gains and losses. Our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. We translate income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. Losses resulting from the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity and totaled $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Our international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. In these instances, non monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2004, gains from remeasurement included in our statements of operations were $0.5 million. We also record gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated. We believe that these gains and losses are immaterial. 63 
 
Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Liquidity and Capital Resources for our definition of market equity and footnote 2 to such table for our definition of our share of total debt. However, we typically finance our co investment joint ventures with secured debt at a loan to value ratio of 50 65% per our joint venture partnership agreements. Additionally, we currently intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these policies, however, our organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our management could alter or eliminate these policies without stockholder approval or circumstances could arise that could render us unable to comply with these policies. As of December 31, 2004, the aggregate principal amount of our secured debt was $1.9 billion, excluding unamortized debt premiums of $10.8 million. Of the $1.9 billion of secured debt, $1.4 billion is secured by properties in our joint ventures. The secured debt is generally non recourse and bears interest at rates varying from 0.7% to 10.4% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 6.3%) and has final maturity dates ranging from April 2005 to November 2022. As of December 31, 2004, $1.8 billion of the secured debt obligations bears interest at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 6.5% while the remaining $96.6 million bears interest at variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 2.5%). As of December 31, 2004, the operating partnership had issued an aggregate of $1.0 billion in unsecured senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% and had an average term of 4.6 years. These unsecured senior debt securities include $400.0 million in notes, issued in June 1998, $400.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2000 medium term note program, and $225.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2002 medium term note program. As of December 31, 2004, the operating partnerships 2002 medium term note program has a remaining capacity of $175.0 million. The operating partnership intends to continue to issue medium term notes, guaranteed by us, under the 2002 program from time to time and as market conditions permit. In August 2000, the operating partnership commenced a medium term note program and subsequently issued $400.0 million of medium term notes with a weighted average interest rate of 7.3%. These notes mature between December 2005 and September 2011 and are guaranteed by us. In May 2002, the operating partnership commenced a new medium term note program for the issuance of up to $400.0 million in principal amount of medium term notes, which will be guaranteed by us. On November 10, 2003, the operating partnership issued $75.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes to Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America under the 2002 medium term note program. We guaranteed the principal amount and interest on the notes, which mature on November 1, 2013, and bear interest at 5.53% per annum. Teachers has agreed that until November 10, 2005, the operating partnership can require Teachers to return the notes to it for cancellation for an obligation of equal dollar amount under a first mortgage loan to be secured by properties determined by the operating partnership, except that in the event the ratings on operating partnerships senior unsecured debt are downgraded by two ratings agencies to BBB , the operating partnership will only have ten days after the last of these downgrades to exercise this right. During the period when the operating partnership can exercise its cancellation right and 39 until any mortgage loans close, Teachers has agreed not to sell, contract to sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of, any portion of the notes. On December 9, 2004, we returned $21.1 million of these senior unsecured notes for cancellation and Teachers issued a first mortgage loan in this principal amount that is secured by certain properties in one of our joint ventures. In June 1998, the operating partnership issued $400.0 million of unsecured senior debt securities. Interest on the unsecured senior debt securities is payable semi annually. The 2015 notes are putable and callable in September 2005. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to its senior debt securities. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then our cash flow may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Credit Facilities. On June 1, 2004, the operating partnership completed the early renewal of its senior unsecured revolving line of credit in the amount of $500.0 million. We remain a guarantor of the operating partnerships obligations under the credit facility. The three year credit facility includes a multi currency component under which up to $250.0 million can be drawn in Yen, Euros or British Pounds Sterling. The line, which matures in June 2007 and carries a one year extension option, can be increased up to $700.0 million upon certain conditions, and replaces the operating partnerships previous $500.0 million credit facility that was to mature in December 2005. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the operating partnerships long term debt rating, which is currently 60 basis points with an annual facility fee of 20 basis points, based on the current credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt. The operating partnership uses its unsecured credit facility principally for acquisitions, funding development activity and general working capital requirements. The total amount available under the credit facility fluctuates based upon the borrowing base, as defined in the agreement governing the credit facility, which is generally based upon the value of our unencumbered properties. As of December 31, 2004, the outstanding balance on the credit facility was $235.1 million and the remaining amount available was $251.0 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $13.9 million (excluding the additional $200.0 million of potential additional capacity). The outstanding balance included borrowings denominated in Euros and Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2004, would equal approximately $114.6 million and $92.5 million in U.S. dollars, respectively. As of December 31, 2004, we had an additional outstanding balance of $27.8 million on other credit facilities. On June 29, 2004, AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating partnership, entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement providing for loans or letters of credit in a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of up to 24 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2004, equaled approximately $233.8 million U.S. dollars. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K. under the revolving credit facility, as well as the obligations of any other entity in which the operating partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest, and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the revolving credit agreement. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and for other real estate purposes in Japan. Generally, borrowers under the revolving credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the revolving credit facility with certain real estate assets or equity in entities holding such real estate assets. The revolving credit facility matures in June 2007 and has a one year extension option, which is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.25% of the outstanding commitments under the facility at that time. The rate on the borrowings is generally TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the current credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt and is currently 60 basis points. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, payable in quarterly amounts, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt, and is currently 20 basis points of the outstanding commitments under the facility. As of December 31, 2004, 40 the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2004, was $88.8 million in U.S. dollars. On November 24, 2004, AMB Tokai TMK, a Japanese subsidiary of the operating partnership, entered into a secured multi advance project financing, providing for loans in a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of up to 20 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2004, would equal approximately $194.9 million U.S. dollars. The financing agreement is among AMB Tokai TMK, us, the operating partnership, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and a syndicate of banks. We, along with the operating partnership, jointly and severally guarantee AMB Tokai TMKs obligations under the financing agreement, pursuant to a guaranty of payment executed in connection with the project financing. The financing is secured by a mortgage on certain real property located in Tokai, Tokyo, Japan, and matures on October 31, 2006 with a one year extension option. The rate on the borrowings will generally be TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt and is currently 60 basis points per annum, except that AMB Tokai TMK has purchased from Sumitomo an interest rate swap, which has fixed the interest rate payable on a principal amount equal to 13 billion Yen at 1.32% per annum plus the applicable margin. In addition, there is an annual commitment fee based on unused commitments, payable quarterly, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt, and is currently 20 basis points of the amount of unused commitments. The financing agreement contains customary and other affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. In addition, Sumitomo, AMB Tokai TMK and the operating partnership signed a commitment letter on November 24, 2004, pursuant to which Sumitomo committed to purchase bonds that may be issued by AMB Tokai TMK in an amount between 10 billion Yen and 15 billion Yen (such amount to be determined by AMB Tokai TMK). The bonds would be secured by the AMB Ohta Distribution Center and would generally accrue interest at a rate of TIBOR plus 1.10% per annum; because the swap purchased by AMB Tokai TMK from Sumitomo is coterminous with the maturity date of the proposed bonds, AMB Tokai TMK will have fixed the interest rate payable on, in general, a principal amount equal to 13 billion Yen at 2.42% per annum. The bonds, if issued, would mature on October 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2004, the outstanding balance on this financing agreement was 14 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2004, equaled approximately $136.4 million U.S. dollars. Mortgages Receivable. Through a wholly owned subsidiary, we hold a mortgage loan receivable on AMB Pier One, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture. The note bears interest at 13.0% and matures in May 2026. As of December 31, 2004, the outstanding balance on the note was $12.9 million. We also hold a short term mortgage on a sold property totaling $0.8 million with an interest rate of 12.0%. The mortgage matures in November 2006.

(4) Our share of total book capitalization is defined as our share of total debt plus minority interests to preferred unitholders and limited partnership unitholders plus stockholders equity. Liquidity As of December 31, 2004, we had $109.4 million in cash and cash equivalents (of which $69.0 million was held by our consolidated co investment joint ventures), and $418.3 million of additional available 43 borrowings under our credit facilities. As of December 31, 2004, we had $37.2 million in restricted cash (of which $21.2 million was held by our consolidated co investment joint ventures). Our board of directors declared a regular cash dividend for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 of $0.425 per share of common stock, and the operating partnership announced its intention to pay a regular cash distribution for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 of $0.425 per common unit. The dividends and distributions were payable on January 7, 2005 to stockholders and unitholders of record on December 23, 2004. The series L and M preferred stock dividends were payable on January 17, 2005 to stockholders of record on January 6, 2005. The series E, F, J and K preferred unit quarterly distributions were payable on January 17, 2005. The series D, H and I preferred unit quarterly distributions were payable on December 27, 2004.

Series N preferred units $ 0.70 n/a n/a The anticipated size of our distributions, using only cash from operations, will not allow us to retire all of our debt as it comes due. Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Commitments Developments. In addition to recurring capital expenditures, which consist of building improvements and leasing costs incurred to renew or re tenant space, during 2004, we initiated 14 new industrial development projects in the United States and Mexico with a total estimated investment of $235.4 million, aggregating an estimated 3.1 million square feet, four new industrial developments in Japan and Singapore with a total expected investment of $368.8 million, aggregating approximately 2.7 million square feet, and one new industrial development in Europe with a total expected investment of $44.3 million, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet. As of December 31, 2004, we had 30 projects in our development pipeline representing a total estimated investment of $828.7 million upon completion, of which four industrial projects with a total of 1.2 million square feet and an aggregate estimated investment of $55.0 million upon completion are held in unconsolidated joint ventures. In addition, we held four development projects available for sale, representing a total estimated investment of $29.2 million upon completion. Of this total, $515.2 million had been funded as of December 31, 2004 and an estimated $342.7 million was required to 44 complete current and planned projects. We expect to fund these expenditures with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances, net proceeds from property divestitures and private capital from co investment partners, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow. Acquisitions. During 2004, we acquired 64 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet for a total expected investment of $695.2 million, of which we acquired 48 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 4.2 million square feet through three of our co investment joint ventures, for a total expected investment of $261.0 million. We generally fund our acquisitions through private capital contributions, borrowings under our credit facilities, cash, debt issuances and net proceeds from property divestitures. Lease Commitments. We have entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily on tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms from two to 58 years. These operating lease payments are amortized ratably over the terms of the related leases. Future minimum rental payments required under non cancelable operating leases in effect as of December 31, 2004 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2005 $ 10,810 2006 11,320 2007 11,280 2008 11,310 2009 11,169 Thereafter 222,437 Total $ 278,326 Co investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. As of December 31, 2004, we had investments in co investment joint ventures with a gross book value of $2.6 billion, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, and investments in an unconsolidated co investment joint venture of $9.5 million. As of December 31, 2004, we may make additional capital contributions to current and planned co investment joint ventures of up to $47.9 million. From time to time, we may raise additional equity commitments for AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open ended consolidated co investment joint venture formed in 2004 with institutional investors, which invest through a private real estate investment trust. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of this fund, we are obligated to contribute 20% of the total equity commitments to the fund until such time our total equity commitment is greater than $150 million, at which time, our obligation is reduced to 10% of the total equity commitments. We expect to fund these contributions with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances or net proceeds from property divestitures, which could adversely effect our cash flow. Captive Insurance Company. In December 2001, we formed a wholly owned captive insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., which provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the deductible under our third party policies. We capitalized Arcata National Insurance Ltd. in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata National Insurance Ltd. established annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss experience of our properties. Annually, we engage an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims, related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata National Insurance Ltd. may be adjusted based on this estimate. Premiums paid to Arcata National Insurance Ltd. have a retrospective component, so that if expenses, including losses and deductibles, are less than premiums collected, the excess may be returned to the property owners (and, in turn, as appropriate, to the customers) and conversely, subject to certain limitations, if expenses, including losses, are greater than premiums collected, an additional premium will be charged. As with all recoverable expenses, differences between estimated and actual insurance premiums are recognized in the subsequent year. Through this 45 structure, we believe that we have more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market. Potential Unknown Liabilities. Unknown liabilities may include the following: liabilities for clean up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to our formation transactions that had not been asserted prior to our formation transactions; accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; tax liabilities; and claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these entities.

As of December 31, 2004, we had provided approximately $33.6 million in letters of credit, of which $13.9 million was provided under the operating partnerships $500.0 million unsecured credit facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other commitments. Guarantees. Other than parent guarantees associated with the unsecured debt of the operating partnership, as of December 31, 2004, we had outstanding guarantees in the aggregate amount of $34.7 million in connection with certain acquisitions and lease obligations of which $8.3 million was backed by standby letters of credit. As of December 31, 2004, we guaranteed $4.8 million on outstanding construction loans on two of our unconsolidated joint ventures. Additionally, we provided a take out guarantee after the completion of construction on the aggregate construction loan amount of $30.2 million for another of our unconsolidated joint ventures, of which $20.9 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2004. In connection with this construction loan, our joint venture partner provides an underlying construction loan guarantee up to the completion of construction. Performance and Surety Bonds. As of December 31, 2004, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $1.2 million. These bonds were issued in connection with certain of our development projects and were posted to guarantee certain tax obligations and the construction of certain real property improvements and infrastructure, such as grading, sewers and streets. Performance and surety bonds are commonly required by public agencies from real estate developers. Performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the taxes due or the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. Promoted Interests and Other Contractual Obligations. Upon the achievement of certain return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, we may be obligated to make payments to certain of joint venture partners pursuant to the terms and provisions of their contractual agreements with us. From time to 46 time in the normal course of our business, we enter into various contracts with third parties that may obligate us to make payments or perform other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. SUPPLEMENTAL EARNINGS MEASURES FFO. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider funds from operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. FFO is defined as net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, less gains (or losses) from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estate related depreciation, and adjustments to derive our pro rata share of FFO of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. Further, we do not adjust FFO to eliminate the effects of non recurring charges. We believe that FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. We believe that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. The following table reflects the calculation of FFO reconciled from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands): 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Net income $ 125,471 $ 129,128 $ 121,119 $ 136,200 $ 121,782 Gains from dispositions of real estate (47,224 ) (50,325 ) (19,383 ) (41,859 ) (7,044 ) Real estate related depreciation and amortization: Total depreciation and amortization 160,026 132,167 121,069 101,455 81,523 Discontinued operations depreciation 7,324 10,170 15,434 12,088 8,835 Furniture, fixtures and equipment depreciation (871 ) (720 ) (712 ) (731 ) (380 ) Ground lease amortization (2,301 ) (1,232 ) (734 ) 47 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Adjustments to derive FFO from consolidated joint ventures: Joint venture partners minority interests (Net income) 37,817 31,726 27,320 23,731 11,086 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Net income) 3,318 2,890 4,004 5,322 6,676 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Development profits) 435 344 57 764 Discontinued operations minority interests (Net income) 4,573 4,991 5,105 4,666 2,586 FFO attributable to minority interests (80,192 ) (65,603 ) (52,051 ) (40,144 ) (15,055 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures: Our share of net income (3,781 ) (5,445 ) (5,674 ) (5,467 ) (5,212 ) Our share of FFO 7,549 9,755 9,291 8,014 7,188 Preferred stock dividends (7,131 ) (6,999 ) (8,496 ) (8,500 ) (8,500 ) Preferred stock and unit redemption discount (issuance costs) (5,413 ) 412 (7,600 ) Funds from operations $ 207,314 $ 186,666 $ 215,194 $ 186,707 $ 202,751 Basic FFO per common share and unit $ 2.39 $ 2.17 $ 2.44 $ 2.09 $ 2.26 Diluted FFO per common share and unit $ 2.30 $ 2.13 $ 2.40 $ 2.07 $ 2.25 Weighted average common shares and units: Basic 86,885,250 85,859,899 88,204,208 89,286,379 89,566,375 Diluted 90,120,250 87,616,365 89,689,310 90,325,801 90,024,511 48 BUSINESS RISKS Our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences to us. These risks include, among others: General Real Estate Industry Risks Our performance and value are subject to general economic conditions and risks associated with our real estate assets. The investment returns available from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of income earned and capital appreciation generated by the properties, as well as the expenses incurred in connection with the properties. If our properties do not generate income sufficient to meet operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, then our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders could be adversely affected. In addition, there are significant expenditures associated with an investment in real estate (such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs) that generally do not decline when circumstances reduce the income from the property. Income from, and the value of, our properties may be adversely affected by: changes in the general economic climate; local conditions, such as oversupply of or a reduction in demand for industrial space; the attractiveness of our properties to potential customers; competition from other properties; our ability to provide adequate maintenance and insurance; increased operating costs; increased cost of compliance with regulations; and the potential for liability under applicable laws (including changes in tax laws). In addition, periods of economic slowdown or recession in the United States and in other countries, rising interest rates or declining demand for real estate, or public perception that any of these events may occur, would result in a general decrease in rents or an increased occurrence of defaults under existing leases, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Future terrorist attacks may result in declining economic activity, which could reduce the demand for and the value of our properties. To the extent that future attacks impact our customers, their businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to honor their existing leases. Our properties are concentrated predominantly in the industrial real estate sector. As a result of this concentration, we would feel the impact of an economic downturn in this sector more acutely than if our portfolio included other property types. We may be unable to renew leases or relet space as leases expire. As of December 31, 2004, leases on a total of 16.3% of our industrial properties (based on annualized base rent) will expire on or prior to December 31, 2005. We derive most of our income from rent received from our customers. Accordingly, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected if we are unable to promptly relet or renew these expiring leases, if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected. If a tenant experiences a downturn in its business or other type of financial distress, then it may be unable to make timely rental payments or renew its lease. Further, our ability to rent space and the rents that we can charge are impacted, not only by customer demand, but by the number of other properties we have to compete with to appeal to customers. 49 Actions by our competitors may decrease or prevent increases of the occupancy and rental rates of our properties. We compete with other developers, owners and operators of real estate, some of which own properties similar to ours in the same submarkets in which our properties are located. If our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, we may lose potential tenants, and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge in order to retain tenants when our tenants leases expire. As a result, our financial condition, cash flow, cash available for distribution, trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could be materially adversely affected. Real estate investments are relatively illiquid, making it difficult for us to respond promptly to changing conditions. Real estate assets are not as liquid as certain other types of assets. Further, as a real estate investment trust, the Internal Revenue Code regulates the number of properties that we can dispose of in a year, their tax bases and the cost of improvements that we make to the properties. In addition, a portion of the properties held directly or indirectly by certain of our subsidiary partnerships were acquired in exchange for limited partnership units in the applicable partnership. The contribution agreements for such properties may contain restrictions on certain sales, exchanges or other dispositions of these properties, or a portion thereof, that result in a taxable transaction for specified periods, following the contribution of these properties to the applicable partnership. These limitations may affect our ability to sell properties. This lack of liquidity and the Internal Revenue Code restrictions may limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions and, as a result, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We could be adversely affected if a significant number of our tenants are unable to meet their lease obligations. Our results of operations, distributable cash flow and the value of our common stock would be adversely affected if a significant number of our tenants were unable to meet their lease obligations to us. In the event of a significant number of lease defaults, our cash flow may not be sufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders and repay maturing debt. As of December 31, 2004, we did not have any single tenant account for annualized base rent revenues greater than 3.4%. However, in the event of lease defaults by a significant number of our tenants, we may incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord. We may be unable to consummate acquisitions on advantageous terms or acquisitions may not perform as we expect. We acquire and intend to continue to acquire primarily industrial properties. The acquisition of properties entails various risks, including the risks that our investments may not perform as we expect, that we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate our new acquisitions into our existing operations and that our cost estimates for bringing an acquired property up to market standards may prove inaccurate. Further, we face significant competition for attractive investment opportunities from other well capitalized real estate investors, including both publicly traded real estate investment trusts and private institutional investment funds. This competition increases as investments in real estate become increasingly attractive relative to other forms of investment. As a result of competition, we may be unable to acquire additional properties as we desire or the purchase price may be significantly elevated. In addition, we expect to finance future acquisitions through a combination of borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the operating partnership or its subsidiaries and proceeds from property divestitures, which may not be available and which could adversely affect our cash flow. Any of the above risks could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. 50 We may be unable to complete renovation and development projects on advantageous terms. As part of our business, we develop new and renovate existing properties. The real estate development and renovation business involves significant risks that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock, which include: we may not be able to obtain financing for development projects on favorable terms and complete construction on schedule or within budget, resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs and delays in leasing the properties and generating cash flow; we may not be able to obtain, or may experience delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations; the properties may perform below anticipated levels, producing cash flow below budgeted amounts; substantial renovation and new development activities, regardless of their ultimate success, typically require a significant amount of managements time and attention, diverting their attention from our day to day operations; and upon completion of construction, we may not be able to obtain, or obtain on advantageous terms, permanent financing for activities that we have financed through construction loans. Risks Associated With Our International Business Our international growth is subject to special risks and we may not be able to effectively manage our international growth. We have acquired and developed, and expect to continue to acquire and develop, properties in international countries. Because local markets affect our operations, our international investments are subject to economic fluctuations in the international locations in which we invest. In addition, our international operations are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as revisions in tax treaties or other laws and regulations, including those governing the taxation of our international revenues, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and, in certain parts of the world, property rights uncertainty and political instability. We cannot predict the likelihood that any of these developments may occur. Further, we have entered, and may in the future enter, into agreements with non U.S. entities that are governed by the laws of, and are subject to dispute resolution in the courts of, another country or region. We cannot accurately predict whether such a forum would provide us with an effective and efficient means of resolving disputes that may arise. And even if we are able to obtain a satisfactory decision through arbitration or a court proceeding, we could have difficulty enforcing any award or judgment on a timely basis or at all. Further, our business has grown rapidly and continues to grow through international property acquisitions and developments. If we fail to effectively manage our international growth, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. Acquired properties may be located in new markets, where we may face risks associated with investing in an unfamiliar market. We have acquired and may continue to acquire properties in international markets that are new to us. When we acquire properties located in these markets, we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local government and permitting procedures. We work to mitigate such risks through extensive diligence and research and associations with experienced partners, however there can be no guarantee that all such risks will be eliminated. 51 We are subject to risks from potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of the other countries in which we invest. We are pursuing, and intend to continue to pursue, growth opportunities in international markets. As we invest in countries where the U.S. dollar is not the national currency, we are subject to international currency risks from the potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of those other countries. A significant depreciation in the value of the currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may materially affect our results of operations. We attempt to mitigate any such effects by borrowing under our multi currency credit facility in the currency of the country we are investing in and, under certain circumstances, by putting in place international currency put option contracts hedging exchange rate fluctuations. For leases denominated in international currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage the international exchange risk. We cannot, however, assure you that our efforts will successfully neutralize all international currency risks. If we do engage in international currency exchange rate hedging activities, any income recognized with respect to these hedges (as well as any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates) may not qualify under the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT. Our performance and value are impacted by the local economic conditions of and the risks associated with doing business in California. As of December 31, 2004, our industrial properties located in California represented 27.0% of the aggregate square footage of our industrial operating properties and 27.8% of our industrial annualized base rent. Our revenue from, and the value of, our properties located in California may be affected by local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties) and the local economic climate. Business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns, changing demographics, and other factors may adversely impact Californias economic climate. Because of the number of properties we have located in California, a downturn in Californias economy or real estate conditions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We may experience losses that our insurance does not cover. We carry commercial liability, property and rental loss insurance covering all the properties that we own and manage in types and amounts that we believe are adequate and appropriate given the relative risks applicable to the property, the cost of coverage and industry practice. Certain losses, such as those due to terrorism, windstorms, floods or seismic activity, may be insured subject to certain limitations, including large deductibles or co payments and policy limits. Although we have obtained coverage for certain acts of terrorism, with policy specifications and insured limits that we consider commercially reasonable given the cost and availability of such coverage, we cannot be certain that we will be able to renew coverage on comparable terms or collect under such policies. In addition, there are other types of losses, such as those from riots, bio terrorism, or acts of war, that are not generally insured in our industry because it is not economically feasible to do so. We may incur material losses in excess of insurance proceeds and we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance at commercially reasonable rates. If we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds our insured limits with respect to one or more of our properties, then we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue from those properties and, if there is recourse debt, then we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties. Moreover, as the general partner of the operating partnership, we generally will be liable for all of the operating partnerships unsatisfied recourse obligations, including any obligations incurred by the operating partnership as the general partner of co investment joint ventures. Any such losses could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. A number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to earthquake activity. Domestic properties located in active seismic areas include properties in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Memphis and Seattle. Our largest concentration of such properties is in California where, as of 52 December 31, 2004, we had 289 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 24.4 million square feet and representing 27.0% of our industrial operating properties based on aggregate square footage and 27.8% based on industrial annualized base rent. International properties located in active seismic areas include Tokyo and Osaka, Japan and Mexico City, Mexico. We carry replacement cost earthquake insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable. We evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants. We are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with properties owned through joint ventures, limited liability companies and partnerships. As of December 31, 2004, we owned approximately 55.6 million square feet of our properties through several joint ventures, limited liability companies or partnerships with third parties. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in partnerships, limited liability companies or joint ventures and we intend to continue to develop and acquire properties through joint ventures, limited liability companies and partnerships with other persons or entities when warranted by the circumstances. Such partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions. Partnership, limited liability company or joint venture investments involve certain risks, including: if our partners, co members or joint venturers go bankrupt, then we and any other remaining general partners, members, or joint venturers would generally remain liable for the partnerships, limited liability companys, or joint ventures liabilities; if our partners fail to fund their share of any required capital contributions; our partners, co members or joint venturers might have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals that would affect our ability to operate the property; our partners, co members or joint venturers may have the power to act contrary to our instructions, requests, policies, or objectives, including our current policy with respect to maintaining our qualification as a real estate investment trust; the joint venture, limited liability and partnership agreements often restrict the transfer of a joint ventures, members or partners interest or buy sell or may otherwise restrict our ability to sell the interest when we desire or on advantageous terms; disputes between us and our partners, co members or joint venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business and result in subjecting the properties owned by the applicable partnership or joint venture to additional risk; and we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our partners, co members or joint venturers. We generally seek to maintain sufficient control of our partnerships, limited liability companies, and joint ventures to permit us to achieve our business objectives, however, we may not be able to do so, and the occurrence of one or more of the events described above could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We may be unable to complete divestitures on advantageous terms or contribute properties. We intend to continue to divest ourselves of properties that do not meet our strategic objectives, provided that we can negotiate acceptable terms and conditions. Our ability to dispose of properties on advantageous terms depends on factors beyond our control, including competition from other sellers and the availability of attractive financing for potential buyers of our properties. If we are unable to dispose of properties on favorable terms or redeploy the proceeds of property divestitures in accordance with our investment strategy, then our 53 financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. We also anticipate contributing or selling properties to funds and joint ventures. If we do not have sufficient properties available that meet the investment criteria of current or future property funds, or if the funds have reduced or no access to capital on favorable terms, then such contributions or sales could be delayed or prevented, adversely affecting our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Contingent or unknown liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition. We have and may in the future acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of any of these entities or properties, then we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect our cash flow. Unknown liabilities with respect to entities or properties acquired might include: liabilities for clean up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; tax liabilities; and claims for indemnification by the general partners, officers and directors and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties. We are dependent on external sources of capital. In order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain) and are taxed on our income to the extent it is not fully distributed. Consequently, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs, including acquisition and development activities, from cash retained from operations and must rely on third party sources of capital. Further, in order to maintain our REIT status and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes, we may need to borrow funds on a short term basis to meet the REIT distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. These short term borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non deductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. Our ability to access private debt and equity capital on favorable terms or at all is dependent upon a number of factors, including, general market conditions, the markets perception of our growth potential, our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our capital stock. Debt Financing Risks We could incur more debt, increasing our debt service. It is our policy to incur debt, either directly or through our subsidiaries, only if it will not cause our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio to exceed approximately 45%. Our definition of our share of total market capitalization is our share of total debt plus preferred equity liquidation preferences plus market equity. See footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratio table contained in Part II, Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Liquidity and Capital Resources for our definition of market equity and footnote 2 to such table for our definition of our share of total debt. The aggregate amount of indebtedness that we may incur under our policy increases directly with an increase in the market price per share of our capital stock. Further, our management could alter or eliminate this policy without stockholder approval. If we change this policy, then we could become 54 more highly leveraged, resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect the cash available for distribution to our stockholders. We face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk. As of December 31, 2004, we had total debt outstanding of $3.3 billion. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to the senior debt securities referenced in our financial statements. We are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest. We anticipate that we will repay only a small portion of the principal of our debt prior to maturity. Accordingly, we will likely need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds of other capital transactions, then we expect that our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repay all such maturing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. In addition, if we mortgage one or more of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments, then the property could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income and asset value. A foreclosure on one or more of our properties could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Covenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our financial condition. The terms of our credit agreements and other indebtedness require that we comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage. These covenants may limit flexibility in our operations, and our failure to comply with these covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt agreement even if we have satisfied our payment obligations. As of December 31, 2004, we had certain non recourse, secured loans, which are cross collateralized by multiple properties. If we default on any of these loans, we may then be required to repay such indebtedness, together with applicable prepayment charges, to avoid foreclosure on all the cross collateralized properties within the applicable pool. Foreclosure on our properties, or our inability to refinance our loans on favorable terms, could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. In addition, our credit facilities and senior debt securities contain certain cross default provisions, which are triggered in the event that our other material indebtedness is in default. These cross default provisions may require us to repay or restructure the credit facilities and the senior debt securities in addition to any mortgage or other debt that is in default, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rates may adversely affect results of operations. We seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements, such as interest rate cap agreements and interest rate swap agreements. These agreements involve risks, such as the risk that the counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes and that a court could rule that such agreements are not legally enforceable. Hedging may reduce overall returns on our investments. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may materially adversely affect our results of operations. 55 Conflicts of Interest Risks Some of our directors and executive officers are involved in other real estate activities and investments and therefore, may have conflicts of interest with us. Certain of our executive officers and directors own interests in other real estate related businesses and investments, including retail development projects, office buildings and de minimis holdings of the equity securities of public and private real estate companies. Our executive officers continued involvement in other real estate related activities could divert their attention from our day to day operations. Our executive officers have entered into non competition agreements with us pursuant to which they have agreed not to engage in any activities, directly or indirectly, in respect of commercial real estate, and not to make any investment in respect of any industrial or retail real estate, other than through ownership of not more than 5% of the outstanding shares of a public company engaged in such activities or through the existing investments referred to in this report. State law may limit our ability to enforce these agreements. We believe that these properties and activities generally do not directly compete with any of our properties. However, it is possible that a property in which an executive officer or director, or an affiliate of an executive officer or director, has an interest may compete with us in the future if we were to invest in a property similar in type and in close proximity to that property. We will not acquire any properties from our executive officers, directors or their affiliates unless the transaction is approved by a majority of the disinterested and independent (as defined by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange) members of our board of directors with respect to that transaction. Our role as general partner of the operating partnership may conflict with the interests of our stockholders. As the general partner of the operating partnership, we have fiduciary obligations to the operating partnerships limited partners, the discharge of which may conflict with the interests of our stockholders. In addition, those persons holding limited partnership units will have the right to vote as a class on certain amendments to the operating partnerships partnership agreement and individually to approve certain amendments that would adversely affect their rights. The limited partners may exercise these voting rights in a manner that conflicts with the interests of our stockholders. In addition, under the terms of the operating partnerships partnership agreement, holders of limited partnership units will have certain approval rights with respect to certain transactions that affect all stockholders but which they may not exercise in a manner that reflects the interests of all stockholders. Risks Associated with Government Regulations The costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations and any related potential liability could exceed our budgets for these items. Under various environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at, on, under or in its property. The costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial. These laws typically impose liability and clean up responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean up costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury, property damage, or other costs, including investigation and clean up costs, resulting from the environmental contamination. Environmental laws in some countries, including the U.S., also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and 56 may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos. Some of our properties may contain asbestos containing building materials. In addition, some of our properties are leased or have been leased, in part, to owners and operators of businesses that use, store, or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances. Further, certain of our properties are on, adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, or upon which others have engaged, are engaged or may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances. From time to time, we may acquire properties, or interests in properties, with known adverse environmental conditions where we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior risk adjusted return. In such an instance, we underwrite the costs of environmental investigation, clean up and monitoring into the acquisition cost and obtain appropriate environmental insurance for the property. Further, in connection with certain divested properties, we have agreed to remain responsible for, and to bear the cost of, remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties. At the time of acquisition, we subject all of our properties to a Phase I or similar environmental assessments by independent environmental consultants and we may have additional Phase II testing performed upon consultants recommendation. These environmental assessments have not revealed, and we are not aware of, any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. Nonetheless, it is possible that the assessments did not reveal all environmental liabilities and that there are material environmental liabilities unknown to us, or that known environmental conditions may give rise to liabilities that are greater than we anticipated. Further, our properties current environmental condition may be affected by customers, the condition of land, operations in the vicinity of the properties (such as releases from underground storage tanks), or by unrelated third parties. If the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations exceed our budgets for these items, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar regulations could result in substantial costs. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, places of public accommodation must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. If we are required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, including removing access barriers, then our cash flow and the amounts available for dividends to our stockholders may be adversely affected. Our properties are also subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. We could incur fines or private damage awards if we fail to comply with these requirements. While we believe that our properties are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements, the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us that will affect our cash flow and results of operations. Federal Income Tax Risks Our failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust would have serious adverse consequences to our stockholders. We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1997. We currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code and believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a real estate 57 investment trust, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify. Qualification as a real estate investment trust requires us to satisfy numerous requirements (some on an annual and others on a quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. For example, in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we must derive at least 95% of our gross income in any year from qualifying sources. In addition, we must pay dividends to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis. These provisions and the applicable treasury regulations are more complicated in our case because we hold our assets through the operating partnership. Legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a real estate investment trust or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. However, we are not aware of any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect our ability to qualify as a real estate investment trust. If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment trust for the four taxable years following the year in which we lost qualification. If we lose our real estate investment trust status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved. In addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. Certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction. From time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. Under the Internal Revenue Code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100% penalty tax. Since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are treated as prohibited transactions. However, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. While we believe that the Internal Revenue Service would not prevail in any such dispute, if the IRS were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction. In addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes. Risks Associated With Our Dependence on Key Personnel We depend on the efforts of our executive officers. While we believe that we could find suitable replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers. Risks Associated with Our Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting. The design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. As part of managements on going 58 review of our accounting policies and internal control over financial reporting, on October 12, 2004, management determined that there was a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to ground lease depreciation. This weakness resulted in an understatement of depreciation expense and resulted in a restatement of depreciation expense for our results in previously issued financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 and for the quarters ended March 31, 2004 and June 30, 2004. In connection with correcting this error, management modified our system of internal control over financial reporting to remediate the material weakness. As of December 31, 2004, management had appropriately remediated this issue and the material weakness no longer existed. While management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Other deficiencies, including any material weakness, in our internal control over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, a decline in our stock price, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operation, financial condition or liquidity. Risks Associated with Ownership of Our Stock Limitations in our charter and bylaws could prevent a change in control. Certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay, defer, or prevent a change in control or other transaction that could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for the common stock. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock may be owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code to include certain entities) during the last half of a taxable year after the first taxable year for which a real estate investment trust election is made. Furthermore, our common stock must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a 12 month taxable year (or a proportionate part of a short tax year). In addition, if we, or an owner of 10% or more of our stock, actually or constructively owns 10% or more of one of our customers (or a tenant of any partnership in which we are a partner), then the rent received by us (either directly or through any such partnership) from that tenant will not be qualifying income for purposes of the real estate investment trust gross income tests of the Internal Revenue Code. To help us maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, we prohibit the ownership, actually or by virtue of the constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, by any single person, of more than 9.8% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the issued and outstanding shares of each of our common stock, series L preferred stock and series M preferred stock. We also prohibit the ownership, actually or constructively, of any shares of our series D, E, F, H, I, J and K preferred stock by any single person so that no such person, taking into account all of our stock so owned by such person, including any common stock or other series of preferred stock, may own in excess of 9.8% of our issued and outstanding capital stock. We refer to this limitation as the ownership limit. Shares acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary. Any person who acquires shares in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any dividends on the shares or be entitled to vote the shares or receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the shares in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the shares or the amount realized from the sale. A transfer of shares in violation of the above limits may be void under certain circumstances. The ownership limit may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control and, therefore, could adversely affect our stockholders ability to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for the shares of our common stock in connection with such transaction. Our charter authorizes us to issue additional shares of common and preferred stock and to establish the preferences, rights and other terms of any series or class of preferred stock that we issue. Although our board of directors has no intention to do so at the present time, it could establish a series or class of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a transaction, including a change in control, that might involve a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. 59 Our charter and bylaws and Maryland law also contain other provisions that may impede various actions by stockholders without approval of our board of directors, which in turn may delay, defer, or prevent a transaction, including a change in control. Those provisions in our charter and bylaws include: directors may be removed only for cause and only upon a two thirds vote of stockholders; our board can fix the number of directors within set limits (which limits are subject to change by our board), and fill vacant directorships upon the vote of a majority of the remaining directors, even though less than a quorum, or in the case of a vacancy resulting from an increase in the size of the board, a majority of the entire board; stockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or propose business for consideration at a stockholders meeting; and the request of the holders of 50% or more of our common stock is necessary for stockholders to call a special meeting. Those provisions provided for under Maryland law include: a two thirds vote of stockholders is required to amend our charter; and stockholders may only act by written consent with the unanimous approval of all stockholders entitled to vote on the matter in question. In addition, our board could elect to adopt, without stockholder approval, certain other provisions under Maryland law that may impede a change in control. The market value of our stock could be substantially affected by various factors. As with other publicly traded securities, the trading price of our stock will depend on many factors that are not within our control and may change from time to time, including: the extent of investor interest in us; the market for similar securities issued by real estate investment trusts; the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate based companies); general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of our stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends; terrorist activity may adversely affect the markets in which our securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending; general economic conditions; and our financial condition, performance and prospects. Other factors such as governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws could also have a significant impact on the future trading price of our stock. Earnings and cash dividends, asset value and market interest rates affect the price of our stock. As a real estate investment trust the market value of our equity securities, in general, is based primarily upon the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash dividends. Our equity securities market value is based secondarily upon the market value of our underlying real estate assets. For this reason, shares of our stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than our net asset value per share. To the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working capital reserves, or other purposes, these retained funds, while increasing the value of our underlying assets, may not 60 correspondingly increase the market price of our stock. Our failure to meet the markets expectations with regard to future earnings and cash dividends likely would adversely affect the market price of our stock. Further, the distribution yield on the stock (as a percentage of the price of the stock) relative to market interest rates may also influence the price of our stock. An increase in market interest rates might lead prospective purchasers of our stock to expect a higher distribution yield, which would adversely affect our stocks market price. Additionally, if the market price of our stock declines significantly, then we might breach certain covenants with respect to our debt obligations, which could adversely affect our liquidity and ability to make future acquisitions and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. If we issue additional securities, then the investment of existing stockholders will be diluted. We have authority to issue shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities, and to cause the operating partnership to issue limited partnership units, in exchange for property or otherwise. Existing stockholders have no preemptive right to acquire any additional securities issued by the operating partnership or us and any issuance of additional equity securities could result in dilution of an existing stockholders investment. We could change our investment and financing policies without a vote of stockholders. Subject to our current investment policy to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust (unless a change is approved by our board of directors under certain circumstances), our board of directors determines our investment and financing policies, our growth strategy and our debt, capitalization, distribution and operating policies. Although our board of directors does not presently intend to revise or amend these strategies and policies, they may do so at any time without a vote of stockholders. Any such changes may not serve the interests of all stockholders and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations, including our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. Shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The operating partnership and AMB Property II, L.P. had 4,746,104 common limited partnership units issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2004, which may be exchanged generally one year after their issuance on a one for one basis into shares of our common stock. In the future, the operating partnership or AMB Property II, L.P. may issue additional limited partnership units, and we may issue shares of common stock, in connection with the acquisition of properties or in private placements. These shares of common stock and the shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of limited partnership units may be sold in the public securities markets over time, pursuant to registration rights that we have granted, or may grant in connection with future issuances, or pursuant to Rule 144. In addition, common stock issued under our stock option and incentive plans may also be sold in the market pursuant to registration statements that we have filed or pursuant to Rule 144. As of December 31, 2004, under our stock option and incentive plans, we had 5,103,927 shares of common stock reserved and available for issuance (including cancellations and forfeitures), had outstanding options to purchase 10,220,631 shares of common stock (net of cancellations and forfeitures, and 2,447,390 shares that we have issued upon the exercise of options) and had 1,178,052 restricted shares of common stock outstanding (net of 75,988 shares that have been forfeited). Future sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Further, the existence of the operating partnerships limited partnership units and the shares of our common stock reserved for issuance upon exchange of limited partnership units and the exercise of options, and registration rights referred to above, may adversely affect the terms upon which we are able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices, interest rates and international exchange rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing 61 activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings and our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2004, we had two outstanding interest rate swaps with aggregate notional amount of $137.1 million (in U.S. dollars). See Financial Instruments disclosure below. The table below summarizes the market risks associated with our fixed and variable rate debt outstanding before unamortized debt premiums of $10.8 million as of December 31, 2004 (dollars in thousands): 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total Fixed rate debt(1) $ 358,798 $ 172,312 $ 145,740 $ 386,761 $ 188,305 $ 1,496,223 $ 2,748,139 Average interest rate 7.0 % 6.6 % 6.9 % 6.7 % 4.8 % 7.2 % 6.6 % Variable rate debt(2) $ 1,049 $ 84,037 $ 341,191 $ 5,571 $ 37,375 $ 29,063 $ 498,286 Average interest rate 3.6 % 2.6 % 2.0 % 2.8 % 2.7 % 1.9 % 2.1 % Interest Payments $ 25,154 $ 13,558 $ 16,880 $ 26,069 $ 10,048 $ 108,280 $ 199,989 (1) Represents 84.7% of all outstanding debt. (2) Represents 15.3% of all outstanding debt. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased by 10%, then the increase in interest expense on the variable rate debt would be $1.1 million annually. As of December 31, 2004, the book value and the estimated fair value of our total consolidated debt (both secured and unsecured) was $3.4 billion based on our estimate of current market interest rates. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, variable rate debt comprised 15.3% and 14.7%, respectively, of all our outstanding debt. Variable rate debt was $498.3 million and $378.0 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. The increase is primarily due to higher outstanding balances on our credit facilities. This increase in our outstanding variable rate debt increases our risk associated with unfavorable interest rate fluctuations. Financial Instruments. We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income or income. For revenues or expenses denominated in non functional currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments in effect at December 31, 2004 were two put options (buy USD/sell MXN) hedging against adverse currency exchange fluctuations of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar and two interest rate swaps hedging cash flows of our variable rate borrowings based on 62 Euribor (Europe) and Japanese TIBOR (Japan). The following table summarizes our financial instruments as of December 31, 2004: Maturity Dates Notional Related Derivatives (In thousands) March 05 Dec 08 October 12 Amount Fair Value Interest Rate Swaps: Plain Interest Rate Swap, Japan Notional Amount (U.S. Dollars) $ 126,669 $ 126,669 Receive Floating(%) 3M TIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 1.32 % Fair Market Value $ $ (1,211 ) Plain Interest Rate Swap, Europe Notional Amount (U.S. Dollars) $ 10,437 $ 10,437 Receive Floating(%) 3M EURIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 3.72 % Fair Market Value $ $ (13 ) Foreign Exchange Agreements: Option to Sell MXN/ Buy USD Contract Amount (U.S. Dollars) $ 2,422 $ 2,422 Contract FX Rate 11.50 Contract Premium $ 43 $ 30 Total $ 139,528 $ (1,194 ) International Operations. Our exposure to market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries operating in the United States and Mexico. The functional currency for our subsidiaries operating outside North America is generally the local currency of the country in which the entity is located, mitigating the effect of currency exchange gains and losses. Our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. We translate income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. Losses resulting from the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity and totaled $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Our international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. In these instances, non monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2004, gains from remeasurement included in our statements of operations were $0.5 million. We also record gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated. We believe that these gains and losses are immaterial. 63 
 
Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Liquidity and Capital Resources for our definition of market equity and footnote 2 to such table for our definition of our share of total debt. The aggregate amount of indebtedness that we may incur under our policy increases directly with an increase in the market price per share of our capital stock. Further, our management could alter or eliminate this policy without stockholder approval. If we change this policy, then we could become 54 more highly leveraged, resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect the cash available for distribution to our stockholders. We face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk. As of December 31, 2004, we had total debt outstanding of $3.3 billion. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to the senior debt securities referenced in our financial statements. We are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest. We anticipate that we will repay only a small portion of the principal of our debt prior to maturity. Accordingly, we will likely need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds of other capital transactions, then we expect that our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repay all such maturing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. In addition, if we mortgage one or more of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments, then the property could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income and asset value. A foreclosure on one or more of our properties could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Covenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our financial condition. The terms of our credit agreements and other indebtedness require that we comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage. These covenants may limit flexibility in our operations, and our failure to comply with these covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt agreement even if we have satisfied our payment obligations. As of December 31, 2004, we had certain non recourse, secured loans, which are cross collateralized by multiple properties. If we default on any of these loans, we may then be required to repay such indebtedness, together with applicable prepayment charges, to avoid foreclosure on all the cross collateralized properties within the applicable pool. Foreclosure on our properties, or our inability to refinance our loans on favorable terms, could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. In addition, our credit facilities and senior debt securities contain certain cross default provisions, which are triggered in the event that our other material indebtedness is in default. These cross default provisions may require us to repay or restructure the credit facilities and the senior debt securities in addition to any mortgage or other debt that is in default, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rates may adversely affect results of operations. We seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements, such as interest rate cap agreements and interest rate swap agreements. These agreements involve risks, such as the risk that the counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes and that a court could rule that such agreements are not legally enforceable. Hedging may reduce overall returns on our investments. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may materially adversely affect our results of operations. 55 Conflicts of Interest Risks Some of our directors and executive officers are involved in other real estate activities and investments and therefore, may have conflicts of interest with us. Certain of our executive officers and directors own interests in other real estate related businesses and investments, including retail development projects, office buildings and de minimis holdings of the equity securities of public and private real estate companies. Our executive officers continued involvement in other real estate related activities could divert their attention from our day to day operations. Our executive officers have entered into non competition agreements with us pursuant to which they have agreed not to engage in any activities, directly or indirectly, in respect of commercial real estate, and not to make any investment in respect of any industrial or retail real estate, other than through ownership of not more than 5% of the outstanding shares of a public company engaged in such activities or through the existing investments referred to in this report. State law may limit our ability to enforce these agreements. We believe that these properties and activities generally do not directly compete with any of our properties. However, it is possible that a property in which an executive officer or director, or an affiliate of an executive officer or director, has an interest may compete with us in the future if we were to invest in a property similar in type and in close proximity to that property. We will not acquire any properties from our executive officers, directors or their affiliates unless the transaction is approved by a majority of the disinterested and independent (as defined by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange) members of our board of directors with respect to that transaction. Our role as general partner of the operating partnership may conflict with the interests of our stockholders. As the general partner of the operating partnership, we have fiduciary obligations to the operating partnerships limited partners, the discharge of which may conflict with the interests of our stockholders. In addition, those persons holding limited partnership units will have the right to vote as a class on certain amendments to the operating partnerships partnership agreement and individually to approve certain amendments that would adversely affect their rights. The limited partners may exercise these voting rights in a manner that conflicts with the interests of our stockholders. In addition, under the terms of the operating partnerships partnership agreement, holders of limited partnership units will have certain approval rights with respect to certain transactions that affect all stockholders but which they may not exercise in a manner that reflects the interests of all stockholders. Risks Associated with Government Regulations The costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations and any related potential liability could exceed our budgets for these items. Under various environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at, on, under or in its property. The costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial. These laws typically impose liability and clean up responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean up costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury, property damage, or other costs, including investigation and clean up costs, resulting from the environmental contamination. Environmental laws in some countries, including the U.S., also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and 56 may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos. Some of our properties may contain asbestos containing building materials. In addition, some of our properties are leased or have been leased, in part, to owners and operators of businesses that use, store, or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances. Further, certain of our properties are on, adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, or upon which others have engaged, are engaged or may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances. From time to time, we may acquire properties, or interests in properties, with known adverse environmental conditions where we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior risk adjusted return. In such an instance, we underwrite the costs of environmental investigation, clean up and monitoring into the acquisition cost and obtain appropriate environmental insurance for the property. Further, in connection with certain divested properties, we have agreed to remain responsible for, and to bear the cost of, remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties. At the time of acquisition, we subject all of our properties to a Phase I or similar environmental assessments by independent environmental consultants and we may have additional Phase II testing performed upon consultants recommendation. These environmental assessments have not revealed, and we are not aware of, any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. Nonetheless, it is possible that the assessments did not reveal all environmental liabilities and that there are material environmental liabilities unknown to us, or that known environmental conditions may give rise to liabilities that are greater than we anticipated. Further, our properties current environmental condition may be affected by customers, the condition of land, operations in the vicinity of the properties (such as releases from underground storage tanks), or by unrelated third parties. If the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations exceed our budgets for these items, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar regulations could result in substantial costs. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, places of public accommodation must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. If we are required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, including removing access barriers, then our cash flow and the amounts available for dividends to our stockholders may be adversely affected. Our properties are also subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. We could incur fines or private damage awards if we fail to comply with these requirements. While we believe that our properties are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements, the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us that will affect our cash flow and results of operations. Federal Income Tax Risks Our failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust would have serious adverse consequences to our stockholders. We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1997. We currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code and believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a real estate 57 investment trust, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify. Qualification as a real estate investment trust requires us to satisfy numerous requirements (some on an annual and others on a quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. For example, in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we must derive at least 95% of our gross income in any year from qualifying sources. In addition, we must pay dividends to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis. These provisions and the applicable treasury regulations are more complicated in our case because we hold our assets through the operating partnership. Legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a real estate investment trust or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. However, we are not aware of any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect our ability to qualify as a real estate investment trust. If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment trust for the four taxable years following the year in which we lost qualification. If we lose our real estate investment trust status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved. In addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. Certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction. From time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. Under the Internal Revenue Code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100% penalty tax. Since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are treated as prohibited transactions. However, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. While we believe that the Internal Revenue Service would not prevail in any such dispute, if the IRS were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction. In addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes. Risks Associated With Our Dependence on Key Personnel We depend on the efforts of our executive officers. While we believe that we could find suitable replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers. Risks Associated with Our Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting. The design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. As part of managements on going 58 review of our accounting policies and internal control over financial reporting, on October 12, 2004, management determined that there was a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to ground lease depreciation. This weakness resulted in an understatement of depreciation expense and resulted in a restatement of depreciation expense for our results in previously issued financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 and for the quarters ended March 31, 2004 and June 30, 2004. In connection with correcting this error, management modified our system of internal control over financial reporting to remediate the material weakness. As of December 31, 2004, management had appropriately remediated this issue and the material weakness no longer existed. While management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Other deficiencies, including any material weakness, in our internal control over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, a decline in our stock price, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operation, financial condition or liquidity. Risks Associated with Ownership of Our Stock Limitations in our charter and bylaws could prevent a change in control. Certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay, defer, or prevent a change in control or other transaction that could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for the common stock. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock may be owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code to include certain entities) during the last half of a taxable year after the first taxable year for which a real estate investment trust election is made. Furthermore, our common stock must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a 12 month taxable year (or a proportionate part of a short tax year). In addition, if we, or an owner of 10% or more of our stock, actually or constructively owns 10% or more of one of our customers (or a tenant of any partnership in which we are a partner), then the rent received by us (either directly or through any such partnership) from that tenant will not be qualifying income for purposes of the real estate investment trust gross income tests of the Internal Revenue Code. To help us maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, we prohibit the ownership, actually or by virtue of the constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, by any single person, of more than 9.8% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the issued and outstanding shares of each of our common stock, series L preferred stock and series M preferred stock. We also prohibit the ownership, actually or constructively, of any shares of our series D, E, F, H, I, J and K preferred stock by any single person so that no such person, taking into account all of our stock so owned by such person, including any common stock or other series of preferred stock, may own in excess of 9.8% of our issued and outstanding capital stock. We refer to this limitation as the ownership limit. Shares acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary. Any person who acquires shares in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any dividends on the shares or be entitled to vote the shares or receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the shares in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the shares or the amount realized from the sale. A transfer of shares in violation of the above limits may be void under certain circumstances. The ownership limit may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control and, therefore, could adversely affect our stockholders ability to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for the shares of our common stock in connection with such transaction. Our charter authorizes us to issue additional shares of common and preferred stock and to establish the preferences, rights and other terms of any series or class of preferred stock that we issue. Although our board of directors has no intention to do so at the present time, it could establish a series or class of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a transaction, including a change in control, that might involve a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. 59 Our charter and bylaws and Maryland law also contain other provisions that may impede various actions by stockholders without approval of our board of directors, which in turn may delay, defer, or prevent a transaction, including a change in control. Those provisions in our charter and bylaws include: directors may be removed only for cause and only upon a two thirds vote of stockholders; our board can fix the number of directors within set limits (which limits are subject to change by our board), and fill vacant directorships upon the vote of a majority of the remaining directors, even though less than a quorum, or in the case of a vacancy resulting from an increase in the size of the board, a majority of the entire board; stockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or propose business for consideration at a stockholders meeting; and the request of the holders of 50% or more of our common stock is necessary for stockholders to call a special meeting. Those provisions provided for under Maryland law include: a two thirds vote of stockholders is required to amend our charter; and stockholders may only act by written consent with the unanimous approval of all stockholders entitled to vote on the matter in question. In addition, our board could elect to adopt, without stockholder approval, certain other provisions under Maryland law that may impede a change in control. The market value of our stock could be substantially affected by various factors. As with other publicly traded securities, the trading price of our stock will depend on many factors that are not within our control and may change from time to time, including: the extent of investor interest in us; the market for similar securities issued by real estate investment trusts; the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate based companies); general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of our stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends; terrorist activity may adversely affect the markets in which our securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending; general economic conditions; and our financial condition, performance and prospects. Other factors such as governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws could also have a significant impact on the future trading price of our stock. Earnings and cash dividends, asset value and market interest rates affect the price of our stock. As a real estate investment trust the market value of our equity securities, in general, is based primarily upon the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash dividends. Our equity securities market value is based secondarily upon the market value of our underlying real estate assets. For this reason, shares of our stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than our net asset value per share. To the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working capital reserves, or other purposes, these retained funds, while increasing the value of our underlying assets, may not 60 correspondingly increase the market price of our stock. Our failure to meet the markets expectations with regard to future earnings and cash dividends likely would adversely affect the market price of our stock. Further, the distribution yield on the stock (as a percentage of the price of the stock) relative to market interest rates may also influence the price of our stock. An increase in market interest rates might lead prospective purchasers of our stock to expect a higher distribution yield, which would adversely affect our stocks market price. Additionally, if the market price of our stock declines significantly, then we might breach certain covenants with respect to our debt obligations, which could adversely affect our liquidity and ability to make future acquisitions and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. If we issue additional securities, then the investment of existing stockholders will be diluted. We have authority to issue shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities, and to cause the operating partnership to issue limited partnership units, in exchange for property or otherwise. Existing stockholders have no preemptive right to acquire any additional securities issued by the operating partnership or us and any issuance of additional equity securities could result in dilution of an existing stockholders investment. We could change our investment and financing policies without a vote of stockholders. Subject to our current investment policy to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust (unless a change is approved by our board of directors under certain circumstances), our board of directors determines our investment and financing policies, our growth strategy and our debt, capitalization, distribution and operating policies. Although our board of directors does not presently intend to revise or amend these strategies and policies, they may do so at any time without a vote of stockholders. Any such changes may not serve the interests of all stockholders and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations, including our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. Shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The operating partnership and AMB Property II, L.P. had 4,746,104 common limited partnership units issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2004, which may be exchanged generally one year after their issuance on a one for one basis into shares of our common stock. In the future, the operating partnership or AMB Property II, L.P. may issue additional limited partnership units, and we may issue shares of common stock, in connection with the acquisition of properties or in private placements. These shares of common stock and the shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of limited partnership units may be sold in the public securities markets over time, pursuant to registration rights that we have granted, or may grant in connection with future issuances, or pursuant to Rule 144. In addition, common stock issued under our stock option and incentive plans may also be sold in the market pursuant to registration statements that we have filed or pursuant to Rule 144. As of December 31, 2004, under our stock option and incentive plans, we had 5,103,927 shares of common stock reserved and available for issuance (including cancellations and forfeitures), had outstanding options to purchase 10,220,631 shares of common stock (net of cancellations and forfeitures, and 2,447,390 shares that we have issued upon the exercise of options) and had 1,178,052 restricted shares of common stock outstanding (net of 75,988 shares that have been forfeited). Future sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Further, the existence of the operating partnerships limited partnership units and the shares of our common stock reserved for issuance upon exchange of limited partnership units and the exercise of options, and registration rights referred to above, may adversely affect the terms upon which we are able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices, interest rates and international exchange rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing 61 activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings and our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2004, we had two outstanding interest rate swaps with aggregate notional amount of $137.1 million (in U.S. dollars). See Financial Instruments disclosure below. The table below summarizes the market risks associated with our fixed and variable rate debt outstanding before unamortized debt premiums of $10.8 million as of December 31, 2004 (dollars in thousands): 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total Fixed rate debt(1) $ 358,798 $ 172,312 $ 145,740 $ 386,761 $ 188,305 $ 1,496,223 $ 2,748,139 Average interest rate 7.0 % 6.6 % 6.9 % 6.7 % 4.8 % 7.2 % 6.6 % Variable rate debt(2) $ 1,049 $ 84,037 $ 341,191 $ 5,571 $ 37,375 $ 29,063 $ 498,286 Average interest rate 3.6 % 2.6 % 2.0 % 2.8 % 2.7 % 1.9 % 2.1 % Interest Payments $ 25,154 $ 13,558 $ 16,880 $ 26,069 $ 10,048 $ 108,280 $ 199,989 (1) Represents 84.7% of all outstanding debt. (2) Represents 15.3% of all outstanding debt. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased by 10%, then the increase in interest expense on the variable rate debt would be $1.1 million annually. As of December 31, 2004, the book value and the estimated fair value of our total consolidated debt (both secured and unsecured) was $3.4 billion based on our estimate of current market interest rates. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, variable rate debt comprised 15.3% and 14.7%, respectively, of all our outstanding debt. Variable rate debt was $498.3 million and $378.0 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. The increase is primarily due to higher outstanding balances on our credit facilities. This increase in our outstanding variable rate debt increases our risk associated with unfavorable interest rate fluctuations. Financial Instruments. We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income or income. For revenues or expenses denominated in non functional currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments in effect at December 31, 2004 were two put options (buy USD/sell MXN) hedging against adverse currency exchange fluctuations of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar and two interest rate swaps hedging cash flows of our variable rate borrowings based on 62 Euribor (Europe) and Japanese TIBOR (Japan). The following table summarizes our financial instruments as of December 31, 2004: Maturity Dates Notional Related Derivatives (In thousands) March 05 Dec 08 October 12 Amount Fair Value Interest Rate Swaps: Plain Interest Rate Swap, Japan Notional Amount (U.S. Dollars) $ 126,669 $ 126,669 Receive Floating(%) 3M TIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 1.32 % Fair Market Value $ $ (1,211 ) Plain Interest Rate Swap, Europe Notional Amount (U.S. Dollars) $ 10,437 $ 10,437 Receive Floating(%) 3M EURIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 3.72 % Fair Market Value $ $ (13 ) Foreign Exchange Agreements: Option to Sell MXN/ Buy USD Contract Amount (U.S. Dollars) $ 2,422 $ 2,422 Contract FX Rate 11.50 Contract Premium $ 43 $ 30 Total $ 139,528 $ (1,194 ) International Operations. Our exposure to market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries operating in the United States and Mexico. The functional currency for our subsidiaries operating outside North America is generally the local currency of the country in which the entity is located, mitigating the effect of currency exchange gains and losses. Our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. We translate income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. Losses resulting from the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity and totaled $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Our international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. In these instances, non monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2004, gains from remeasurement included in our statements of operations were $0.5 million. We also record gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated. We believe that these gains and losses are immaterial. 63
