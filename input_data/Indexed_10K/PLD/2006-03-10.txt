Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Liquidity and Capital Resources for our definitions of market equity and our share of total debt. The aggregate amount of indebtedness that we may incur under our policy increases directly with an increase in the market price per share of our capital stock. Further, our management could alter or eliminate this policy without stockholder approval. If we change this policy, then we could become more highly leveraged, resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect the cash available for distribution to our stockholders. We face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk. As of December 31, 2005, we had total debt outstanding of $3.4 billion. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to the senior debt securities referenced in our financial statements. We are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest. We anticipate that we will repay only a small portion of the principal of our debt prior to maturity. Accordingly, we will likely need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds of other capital transactions, then we expect that our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repay all such maturing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at 13 Table of Contents the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. In addition, if we mortgage one or more of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments, then the property could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income and asset value. A foreclosure on one or more of our properties could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Covenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our financial condition. The terms of our credit agreements and other indebtedness require that we comply with a number of financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage. These covenants may limit flexibility in our operations, and our failure to comply with these covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt agreement even if we have satisfied our payment obligations. As of December 31, 2005, we had certain non recourse, secured loans, which are cross collateralized by multiple properties. If we default on any of these loans, we may then be required to repay such indebtedness, together with applicable prepayment charges, to avoid foreclosure on all the cross collateralized properties within the applicable pool. Foreclosure on our properties, or our inability to refinance our loans on favorable terms, could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. In addition, our credit facilities and senior debt securities contain certain cross default provisions, which are triggered in the event that our other material indebtedness is in default. These cross default provisions may require us to repay or restructure the credit facilities and the senior debt securities in addition to any mortgage or other debt that is in default, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rates may adversely affect results of operations. We seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements, such as interest rate cap agreements and interest rate swap agreements. These agreements involve risks, such as the risk that the counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes and that a court could rule that such agreements are not legally enforceable. Hedging may reduce overall returns on our investments. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may materially adversely affect our results of operations. Conflicts of Interest Risks Some of our directors and executive officers are involved in other real estate activities and investments and, therefore, may have conflicts of interest with us. Certain of our executive officers and directors own interests in other real estate related businesses and investments, including retail development projects, office buildings and de minimis holdings of the equity securities of public and private real estate companies. Our executive officers continued involvement in other real estate related activities could divert their attention from our day to day operations. Our executive officers have entered into non competition agreements with us pursuant to which they have agreed not to engage in any activities, directly or indirectly, in respect of commercial real estate, and not to make any investment in respect of any industrial or retail real estate, other than through ownership of not more than 5% of the outstanding shares of a public company engaged in such activities or through certain specified investments. State law may limit our ability to enforce these agreements. We believe that these properties and activities generally do not directly compete with any of our properties. However, it is possible that a property in which an executive officer or director, or an affiliate of an executive officer or director, has an interest may compete with us in the future if we were to invest in a property similar in type and in close proximity to that property. 14 Table of Contents We will not acquire any properties from our executive officers, directors or their affiliates unless the transaction is approved by a majority of the disinterested and independent (as defined by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange) members of our board of directors with respect to that transaction. Our role as general partner of the operating partnership may conflict with the interests of our stockholders. As the general partner of the operating partnership, we have fiduciary obligations to the operating partnerships limited partners, the discharge of which may conflict with the interests of our stockholders. In addition, those persons holding limited partnership units will have the right to vote as a class on certain amendments to the operating partnerships partnership agreement and individually to approve certain amendments that would adversely affect their rights. The limited partners may exercise these voting rights in a manner that conflicts with the interests of our stockholders. In addition, under the terms of the operating partnerships partnership agreement, holders of limited partnership units will have certain approval rights with respect to certain transactions that affect all stockholders but which they may not exercise in a manner that reflects the interests of all stockholders. Risks Associated with Government Regulations The costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations and any related potential liability could exceed our budgets for these items. Under various environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at, on, under or in its property. The costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial. These laws typically impose liability and clean up responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean up costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury, property damage or other costs, including investigation and clean up costs, resulting from the environmental contamination. Environmental laws in some countries, including the U.S., also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos. Some of our properties may contain asbestos containing building materials. In addition, some of our properties are leased or have been leased, in part, to owners and operators of businesses that use, store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances. Further, certain of our properties are on, adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, or upon which others have engaged, are engaged or may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances. From time to time, we may acquire properties, or interests in properties, with known adverse environmental conditions where we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior risk adjusted return. In such an instance, we underwrite the costs of environmental investigation, clean up and monitoring into the acquisition cost and obtain appropriate environmental insurance for the property. Further, in connection with certain divested properties, we have agreed to remain responsible for, and to bear the cost of, remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties. At the time of acquisition, we subject all of our properties to a Phase I or similar environmental assessments by independent environmental consultants and we may have additional Phase II testing performed upon the consultants recommendation. These environmental assessments have not revealed, and 15 Table of Contents we are not aware of, any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. Nonetheless, it is possible that the assessments did not reveal all environmental liabilities and that there are material environmental liabilities unknown to us, or that known environmental conditions may give rise to liabilities that are greater than we anticipated. Further, our properties current environmental condition may be affected by customers, the condition of land, operations in the vicinity of the properties (such as releases from underground storage tanks) or by unrelated third parties. If the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations exceed our budgets for these items, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar regulations could result in substantial costs. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, places of public accommodation must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. If we are required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, including removing access barriers, then our cash flow and the amounts available for dividends to our stockholders may be adversely affected. Our properties are also subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. We could incur fines or private damage awards if we fail to comply with these requirements. While we believe that our properties are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements, the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us that will affect our cash flow and results of operations. Federal Income Tax Risks Our failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust would have serious adverse consequences to our stockholders. We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1997. We currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code and believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify. Qualification as a real estate investment trust requires us to satisfy numerous requirements (some on an annual and others on a quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. For example, in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we must derive at least 95% of our gross income in any year from qualifying sources. In addition, we must pay dividends to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis. These provisions and the applicable Treasury regulations are more complicated in our case because we hold our assets through the operating partnership. Legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a real estate investment trust or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. However, we are not aware of any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect our ability to qualify as a real estate investment trust. If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment trust for the four taxable years following the year in which we lost 16 Table of Contents qualification. If we lose our real estate investment trust status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved. In addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. Certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction. From time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. Under the Internal Revenue Code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100% penalty tax. Since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are properly treated as prohibited transactions. However, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. While we believe that the Internal Revenue Service would not prevail in any such dispute, if the Internal Revenue Service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction. In addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes. Risks Associated With Our Dependence on Key Personnel We depend on the efforts of our executive officers. While we believe that we could find suitable replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers. Risks Associated with Our Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting. The design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. While management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Deficiencies, including any material weakness, in our internal control over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, a decline in our stock price, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Risks Associated with Ownership of Our Stock Limitations in our charter and bylaws could prevent a change in control. Certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay, defer or prevent a change in control or other transaction that could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for the common stock. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock may be owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code to include certain entities) during the last half of a taxable year after the first taxable year for which a real estate investment trust election is made. Furthermore, our common stock must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a 12 month taxable year (or a proportionate part of a short tax year). In addition, if we, or an owner of 10% or more of our stock, actually or constructively owns 10% or more of one of our customers 17 Table of Contents (or a tenant of any partnership in which we are a partner), then the rent received by us (either directly or through any such partnership) from that tenant will not be qualifying income for purposes of the real estate investment trust gross income tests of the Internal Revenue Code. To help us maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, we prohibit the ownership, actually or by virtue of the constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, by any single person, of more than 9.8% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the issued and outstanding shares of each of our common stock, series L preferred stock, series M preferred stock and series O preferred stock. We also prohibit the ownership, actually or constructively, of any shares of our series D, E, F, H, I, J and K preferred stock by any single person so that no such person, taking into account all of our stock so owned by such person, including any common stock or other series of preferred stock, may own in excess of 9.8% of our issued and outstanding capital stock. We refer to this limitation as the ownership limit. Shares acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary. Any person who acquires shares in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any dividends on the shares or be entitled to vote the shares or receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the shares in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the shares or the amount realized from the sale. A transfer of shares in violation of the above limits may be void under certain circumstances. The ownership limit may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control and, therefore, could adversely affect our stockholders ability to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for the shares of our common stock in connection with such transaction. Our charter authorizes us to issue additional shares of common and preferred stock and to establish the preferences, rights and other terms of any series or class of preferred stock that we issue. Although our board of directors has no intention to do so at the present time, it could establish a series or class of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction, including a change in control, that might involve a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. Our charter and bylaws and Maryland law also contain other provisions that may impede various actions by stockholders without approval of our board of directors, which in turn may delay, defer or prevent a transaction, including a change in control. Those provisions in our charter and bylaws include: directors may be removed only for cause and only upon a two thirds vote of stockholders; our board can fix the number of directors within set limits (which limits are subject to change by our board), and fill vacant directorships upon the vote of a majority of the remaining directors, even though less than a quorum, or in the case of a vacancy resulting from an increase in the size of the board, a majority of the entire board; stockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or propose business for consideration at a stockholders meeting; and the request of the holders of 50% or more of our common stock is necessary for stockholders to call a special meeting. Those provisions provided for under Maryland law include: a two thirds vote of stockholders is required to amend our charter; and stockholders may only act by written consent with the unanimous approval of all stockholders entitled to vote on the matter in question. In addition, our board could elect to adopt, without stockholder approval, certain other provisions under Maryland law that may impede a change in control. 18 Table of Contents The market value of our stock could be substantially affected by various factors. As with other publicly traded securities, the trading price of our stock will depend on many factors that are not within our control and may change from time to time, including: the extent of investor interest in us; the market for similar securities issued by real estate investment trusts; the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate based companies); general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of our stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends; terrorist activity may adversely affect the markets in which our securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending; general economic conditions; and our financial condition, performance and prospects. Other factors such as governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws could also have a significant impact on the future trading price of our stock. Earnings, cash dividends, asset value and market interest rates affect the price of our stock. As a real estate investment trust the market value of our equity securities, in general, is based primarily upon the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash dividends. Our equity securities market value is based secondarily upon the market value of our underlying real estate assets. For this reason, shares of our stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than our net asset value per share. To the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working capital reserves, or other purposes, these retained funds, while increasing the value of our underlying assets, may not correspondingly increase the market price of our stock. Our failure to meet the markets expectations with regard to future earnings and cash dividends likely would adversely affect the market price of our stock. Further, the distribution yield on the stock (as a percentage of the price of the stock) relative to market interest rates may also influence the price of our stock. An increase in market interest rates might lead prospective purchasers of our stock to expect a higher distribution yield, which would adversely affect our stocks market price. Additionally, if the market price of our stock declines significantly, then we might breach certain covenants with respect to our debt obligations, which could adversely affect our liquidity and ability to make future acquisitions and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. If we issue additional securities, then the investment of existing stockholders will be diluted. We have authority to issue shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities, and to cause the operating partnership to issue limited partnership units, in exchange for property or otherwise. Existing stockholders have no preemptive right to acquire any additional securities issued by the operating partnership or us and any issuance of additional equity securities could result in dilution of an existing stockholders investment. We could change our investment and financing policies without a vote of stockholders. Subject to our current investment policy to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust (unless a change is approved by our board of directors under certain circumstances), our board of directors determines our investment and financing policies, our growth strategy and our debt, capitalization, distribution and operating policies. Although our board of directors does not presently intend to revise or amend these strategies and policies, they may do so at any time without a vote of stockholders. Any such changes may not 19 Table of Contents serve the interests of all stockholders and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations, including our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. Shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The operating partnership and AMB Property II, L.P. had 4,396,525 common limited partnership units issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2005, which may be exchanged generally one year after their issuance on a one for one basis into shares of our common stock. In the future, the operating partnership or AMB Property II, L.P. may issue additional limited partnership units, and we may issue shares of common stock, in connection with the acquisition of properties or in private placements. These shares of common stock and the shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of limited partnership units may be sold in the public securities markets over time, pursuant to registration rights that we have granted, or may grant in connection with future issuances, or pursuant to Rule 144. In addition, common stock issued under our stock option and incentive plans may also be sold in the market pursuant to registration statements that we have filed or pursuant to Rule 144. As of December 31, 2005, under our stock option and incentive plans, we had 3,872,024 shares of common stock reserved and available for future issuance, had outstanding options to purchase 9,148,437 shares of common stock (of which 7,236,870 are vested and exercisable) and had 547,524 unvested restricted shares of common stock outstanding. Future sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Further, the existence of the operating partnerships limited partnership units and the shares of our common stock reserved for issuance upon exchange of limited partnership units and the exercise of options, and registration rights referred to above, may adversely affect the terms upon which we are able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES As of December 31, 2005, on a consolidated basis, we owned 876 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 87.8 million rentable square feet, located in 33 markets throughout the United States and in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands. Our industrial properties accounted for $527.3 million or 99.7% of our total annualized base rent as of December 31, 2005. Our industrial properties were 95.8% leased to 2,202 customers, the largest of which accounted for no more than 3.7% of our annualized base rent from our industrial properties. See Part IV, Item 15: Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for segment information related to our operations. Property Characteristics. Our industrial properties, which consist primarily of warehouse distribution facilities suitable for single or multiple customers, are typically comprised of multiple buildings. 20 Table of Contents The following table identifies type and characteristics of our industrial buildings and each types percentage of our total portfolio based on square footage at December 31: Building Type Description 2005 2004 Warehouse Customers typically 15,000 75,000 square feet, single or multi tenant 44.2 % 41.4 % Bulk Warehouse Customers typically over 75,000 square feet, single or multi tenant 40.0 % 38.9 % Flex Industrial Includes assembly or research & development, single or multi customer 5.9 % 7.1 % Light Industrial Smaller customers, 15,000 square feet or less, higher office finish 4.6 % 5.9 % Trans Shipment Unique configurations for truck terminals and cross docking 1.7 % 2.3 % Air Cargo On tarmac or airport land for transfer of air cargo goods 3.1 % 3.2 % Office Single or multi customer, used strictly for office 0.5 % 1.2 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Lease Terms. Our industrial properties are typically subject to lease on a triple net basis, in which customers pay their proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance and operating costs, or are subject to leases on a modified gross basis, in which customers pay expenses over certain threshold levels. In addition, most of our leases include fixed rental increases or Consumer Price Index based rental increases. Lease terms typically range from three to ten years, with a weighted average of six years, excluding renewal options. However, the majority of our industrial leases do not include renewal options. Overview of Major Target Markets. Our industrial properties are typically located near major airports, key interstate highways and seaports in major domestic metropolitan areas, such as Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas/ Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Miami, Northern New Jersey/ New York City, the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle. Our international industrial properties are located in major distribution markets, including Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Guadalajara, Hamburg, Mexico City, Paris, Shanghai, Singapore and Tokyo. Within these metropolitan areas, industrial properties are generally concentrated in locations with limited new construction opportunities within established, relatively large submarkets, which we believe should provide a higher rate of occupancy and rent growth than properties located elsewhere. These in fill locations are typically near major airports, seaports or convenient to major highways and rail lines, and are proximate to large and diverse labor pools. There is typically broad demand for industrial space in these centrally located submarkets due to a diverse mix of industries and types of industrial uses, including warehouse distribution, light assembly and manufacturing.

Properties held through Joint Ventures, Limited Liability Companies and Partnerships Consolidated Joint Ventures: As of December 31, 2005, we held interests in joint ventures, limited liability companies and partnerships with institutional investors and other third parties, which we consolidate in our financial statements. Such investments are consolidated because we own a majority interest or, as general partner, exercise significant control over major operating decisions such as acquisition or disposition decisions, approval of budgets, selection of property managers and changes in financing. Under the agreements governing the joint ventures, we and the other party to the joint venture may be required to make additional capital contributions and, subject to certain limitations, the joint ventures may incur additional debt. Such agreements also impose certain restrictions on the transfer of joint venture interests by us or the other party to the joint venture and typically provide certain rights to us or the other party to the joint venture to sell our or their interest in the joint venture to the joint venture or to the other joint venture partner on terms specified in the agreement. In addition, under certain circumstances, many of the joint ventures include buy/sell provisions. See Part IV, Item 15: Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. 31 Table of Contents The tables that follow summarize our consolidated joint ventures as of December 31, 2005: Co investment Consolidated Joint Ventures Our JV Partners Ownership Number of Square Gross Book Property Share of Joint Ventures Percentage Buildings Feet(1) Value(2) Debt Debt(3) (Dollars in thousands) Co Investment Operating Joint Ventures: AMB Erie(4) 50 % 15 1,921,432 $ 99,722 $ 40,710 $ 20,354 AMB Partners II(6) 20 % 105 8,618,386 557,461 285,668 229,017 AMB SGP(7) 50 % 74 8,287,007 436,713 239,944 119,666 AMB Institutional Alliance Fund II(5) 20 % 70 7,964,444 498,161 245,056 193,486 AMB AMS(8) 39 % 32 1,891,934 115,852 49,159 30,130 AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III(9) 20 % 57 7,219,725 743,322 421,290 333,156 Total Co Investment Operating Joint Ventures 27 % 353 35,902,928 2,451,231 1,281,827 925,809 Co Investment Development Joint Ventures: AMB Partners II(6) 20 % 4 478,880 34,654 6,016 4,765 AMB Institutional Alliance Fund II(5) 20 % 1 108,640 9,332 AMB AMS(8) 39 % 1 279,431 30,155 13,984 8,597 AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III(9) 20 % 1 179,400 6,312 Total Co Investment Development Joint Ventures 27 % 7 1,046,351 80,453 20,000 13,362 Total Co Investment Consolidated Joint Ventures 27 % 360 36,949,279 $ 2,531,684 $ 1,301,827 $ 939,171 (1) For development properties, this represents estimated square feet at completion of development for committed phases of development and renovation projects.

(2) Basic and diluted net income per weighted average share equals the net income available to common stockholders divided by 84,048,936 and 87,873,399 shares, respectively, for 2005; 82,133,627 and 85,368,626 shares, respectively, for 2004; 81,096,062 and 82,852,528 shares, respectively, for 2003; 83,310,885 and 84,795,987 shares, respectively, for 2002; 84,174,644 and 85,214,066 shares, respectively, for 2001. (3) Our share of total debt is the pro rata portion of the total debt based on our percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated ventures holding the debt. We believe that our share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze our leverage and to compare our leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of our debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their joint ventures. Our share of total debt is not intended to reflect our actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures. For a reconciliation of our share of total debt to total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure, please see the table of debt maturities and capitalization in Part II, Item 7: Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources. 38 Table of Contents Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations GENERAL You should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements. We commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company effective with the completion of our initial public offering on November 26, 1997, and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with our initial tax return for the year ended December 31, 1997. AMB Property Corporation and AMB Property, L.P. were formed shortly before the consummation of our initial public offering. Managements Overview The primary source of our revenue and earnings is rent received from customers under long term (generally three to ten years) operating leases at our properties, including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs, and from partnership distributions and fees from our private capital business. We also produce earnings from the strategic disposition of operating assets, from the disposition of projects in our development for sale or contribution program and from contributions of properties to our co investment joint ventures. Our long term growth is driven by our ability to maintain and increase occupancy rates or increase rental rates at our properties, and by our ability to continue to acquire and develop new properties. National industrial markets improved during 2005 when compared with market conditions in 2004. According to Torto Wheaton Research, the positive trend in demand began in the second quarter of 2004 and reversed 14 prior quarters of negatively trending, or rising, space availability. We believe the protracted period of rising availability created a difficult national leasing environment which is now improving, particularly in large industrial property markets tied to global trade. During the three and a half year period of negatively trending industrial space availability, investor demand for industrial property (as supported by our observation of strong national sales volumes and declining acquisition capitalization rates) remained consistently strong. We believe we capitalized on the demand for acquisition property by accelerating the repositioning of our portfolio through the disposition of non core properties. We plan to continue selling selected assets on an opportunistic basis but believe we have substantially achieved our repositioning goals.

(2) Our total other markets include other domestic target markets, other non target markets, international target markets and retail. We observed two positive trends nationally for industrial real estate during the year ended December 31, 2005, supported by data provided by Torto Wheaton Research. First, national industrial space availability 39 Table of Contents declined 130 basis points during the year from 10.9% to 9.6%. The availability rate has fallen for seven consecutive quarters, reversing the trend of the prior 14 quarters in which national industrial space availability increased on average 36 basis points per quarter. Second, national absorption of industrial space, defined as the net change in occupied stock as measured by square feet of completions less the change in available square feet, totaled approximately 281 million square feet in the year ended December 31, 2005, substantially exceeding the 183 million square feet of space absorbed in 2004 and well above the previous ten year historical average of 139 million square feet of space absorbed annually. In this improved environment, our industrial portfolios occupancy levels increased to 95.8% at December 31, 2005 from 94.8% at December 31, 2004, which we believe reflects higher levels of demand for industrial space generally and in our portfolio specifically. During the year ended December 31, 2005, our lease expirations totaled approximately 17.6 million square feet while commencements of new or renewed leases totaled approximately 21.3 million square feet, resulting in an increase in our occupancy level of approximately 100 basis points. Rental rates on industrial renewals and rollovers in our portfolio decreased 9.7% during the year ended December 31, 2005 as leases were entered into or renewed at rates consistent with what we believe to be current market levels. We believe this decline in rents on lease renewals and rollovers reflects trends in national industrial space availability. We believe that relatively high levels of national industrial space availability have caused market rents for industrial properties to decline between 10% and 20% from their peak levels in 2001 based on our research data; 42.5% of the space that rolled over in our portfolio in 2005 had commenced between 1999 and 2001. Rental rates in our portfolio declined at successively lower rates in each of the last three quarters during 2005, which we believe indicates a stabilization of market rental rate levels. While the level of rental rate reduction varied by market, we achieved occupancy levels in our portfolio 540 basis points in excess of the national industrial market, as determined by Torto Wheaton Research, by pricing lease renewals and new leases with sensitivity to local market conditions. During periods of decreasing or stabilizing rental rates, we strove to sign leases with shorter terms to prevent locking in lower rent levels for long periods and to be prepared to sign new, longer term leases during periods of growing rental rates. When we sign leases of shorter duration, we attempt to limit overall leasing costs and capital expenditures by offering different grades of tenant improvement packages, appropriate to the lease term. We expect development to be a significant driver of our earnings growth as we expand our land and development pipeline, and contribute completed development projects into our co investment program and recognize development profits. We believe that development, renovation and expansion of well located, high quality industrial properties should generally continue to provide us with attractive investment opportunities at a higher rate of return than we may obtain from the purchase of existing properties. We believe that our development opportunities in Mexico and Japan are particularly attractive given the current lack of supply of modern industrial distribution facilities in the major metropolitan markets of these countries. Globally, we have increased our development pipeline from $106.8 million at the end of 2002 to approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2005. In addition to our committed development pipeline, we hold a total of 1,307 acres for future development or sale. We believe these 1,307 acres of land could support approximately 24.3 million square feet of future development. Going forward, we believe that our co investment program with private capital investors will continue to serve as a significant source of revenues and capital for acquisitions. Through these co investment joint ventures, we typically earn acquisition and development fees, asset management fees and priority distributions, as well as promoted interests and incentive distributions based on the performance of the co investment joint ventures; however, we can not assure you that we will continue to do so. Through contribution of development properties to our co investment joint ventures, we expect to recognize value creation from our development pipeline. As of December 31, 2005, we owned approximately 54.8 million square feet of our properties (47.7% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these co investment joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. 40 Table of Contents By the end of 2007, we plan to have approximately 15% of our operating portfolio (based on both consolidated and unconsolidated annualized base rent) invested in international markets. Our North American target markets outside of the United States currently include Guadalajara, Mexico City, Monterrey and Toronto. Our European target markets currently include Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt, Hamburg, London, Lyon, Madrid, Milan and Paris. Our Asian target markets currently include Beijing, Busan, Nagoya, Osaka, the Pearl River Delta, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore and Tokyo. It is possible that our target markets will change over time to reflect experience, market opportunities, customer needs and changes in global distribution patterns. As of December 31, 2005, our international operating properties comprised 7.1% of our annualized base rents, including properties owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust, we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income. As a result, we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our on going operations to the same extent that other corporations that are not real estate investment trusts can. We must continue to raise capital in both the debt and equity markets to fund our working capital needs, acquisitions and developments. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for a complete discussion of the sources of our capital. Summary of Key Transactions in 2005 During the year ended December 31, 2005, we completed the following significant capital deployment transactions: Acquired 41 buildings in North America, Europe and Asia, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet, for $555.0 million, including two buildings that were acquired by two of our unconsolidated co investment joint ventures; Acquired an approximate 43% unconsolidated equity interest in G.Accion, one of Mexicos largest real estate companies for $46.1 million; Committed to 30 development projects in North America, Europe and Asia totaling 7.0 million square feet with an estimated total investment of approximately $522.4 million; Acquired 341 acres of land for industrial warehouse development in North America, Europe and Asia for approximately $193.9 million; Sold five land parcels and five development projects available for sale, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet, for an aggregate price of approximately $155.2 million; and Divested ourselves of 142 industrial buildings and one retail center aggregating approximately 9.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of approximately $926.6 million. Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Alliance Fund I for $618.5 million. The multi investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. We received cash and a distribution of an on tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund. We also received a net incentive distribution of approximately $26.4 million in cash. See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our acquisition, development and disposition activity. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we completed the following significant capital markets and other financing transactions: Formed an unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., with planned investment of capacity of approximately 247.3 billion Yen ($2.1 billion U.S. dollars, using exchange rate at December 31, 2005). We contributed $106.9 million (using exchange rate in effect at contribution) of operating properties to the fund; Contributed an industrial property for $23.6 million to AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, an unconsolidated co investment joint venture; 41 Table of Contents Obtained $69.7 million of debt (using exchange rates in effect at applicable quarter end dates) with a weighted average interest rate of 3.8% for international acquisitions; Assumed $62.8 million of debt for our consolidated co investment joint ventures at a weighted average interest rate of 7.4%; Obtained long term secured debt financings for our co investment joint ventures of $139.7 million with a weighted average rate of 5.4%; Exchanged $100.0 million of 6.9% Reset Put Securities for approximately $112.5 million of 5.094% Notes due 2015; Raised $72.3 million in net proceeds from the issuance of $75.0 million of our 7.0% Series O Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock; and Issued $175.0 million of unsecured senior debt securities due 2010. See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 6, 9 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our capital markets transactions. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Investments in Real Estate. Investments in real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. We also record at acquisition an intangible asset or liability for the value attributable to above or below market leases, in place leases and lease origination costs for all acquisitions. Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a property by property basis quarterly and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable. Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying amount of the property. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future market conditions and the availability of capital. Examples of certain situations that could affect future cash flows of a property may include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in occupancy; unforeseen bankruptcy, lease termination and move out of a major customer; or a significant decrease in annual base rents of that property. If impairment analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying amount of our long lived assets could occur in the future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings. Revenue Recognition. We record rental revenue from operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts, security deposits and letters of credit, then we may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our customers on an on going basis by reviewing their financial condition periodically as appropriate. Each period we review our outstanding accounts receivable, including straight line rents, for doubtful accounts and 42 Table of Contents provide allowances as needed. We also record lease termination fees when a customer has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us. If a customer remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement, the applicable termination fees are deferred and recognized over the term of such customers occupancy. Property Dispositions. We report real estate dispositions in three separate categories on our consolidated statements of operations. First, when we divest a portion of our interests in real estate entities or properties, gains from the sale represent the interests acquired by third party investors for cash. Second, we dispose of value added conversion projects and build to suit and speculative development projects for which we have not generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable. Lastly, beginning in 2002, SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, required us to separately report as discontinued operations the historical operating results attributable to operating properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the properties. The consolidated statements of operations for prior periods are also adjusted to conform with this classification. There is no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial position, net income or cash flows. In all cases, gains and losses are recognized using the full accrual method of accounting. Gains relating to transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met. Joint Ventures. We hold interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We determine consolidation based on standards set forth in EITF 96 16, Investors Accounting for an Investee When the Investor Has a Majority of the Voting Interest but the Minority Shareholder or Shareholders Have Certain Approval or Veto Rights, Statement of Position 78 9, Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures and FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN 46. Based on the guidance set forth in these pronouncements, we consolidate certain joint venture investments because we exercise significant control over major operating decisions, such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, asset management, investment activity and changes in financing. For joint ventures that are variable interest entities as defined under FIN 46 where we are not the primary beneficiaries, we do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. For joint ventures where we do not exercise significant control over major operating and management decisions, but where we exercise significant influence, we use the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. In June 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued EITF 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights. Under this consensus, a sole general partner is presumed to control a limited partnership (or similar entity) and should consolidate that entity unless the limited partners possess kick out rights or other substantive participating rights as described in EITF 96 16, Investors Accounting for an Investee When the Investor has a Majority of the Voting Interest but the Minority Shareholder or Shareholders Have Certain Approval or Veto rights. As of June 29, 2005, this consensus was effective immediately for all new or modified agreements, and effective beginning in the first reporting period that ends after December 15, 2005 for all existing agreements. We adopted the consolidation requirements of this consensus in the third quarter 2005 for all new or modified agreements and will adopt the consensus for existing agreements in the first quarter of 2006. There was not a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows upon the adoption of the consolidation requirements of this consensus for all new or modified agreements. We do not believe that there will be a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, upon adopting the consensus for existing agreements. Real Estate Investment Trust. As a real estate investment trust, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes in the U.S. if we meet minimum distribution, income, asset and shareholder tests. However, some of our subsidiaries may be subject to federal and state taxes. In addition, foreign entities may also be subject to the taxes of the host country. An income tax allocation is required to be estimated on our taxable income arising from our taxable REIT subsidiaries and international entities. A deferred tax component could arise based upon the differences in GAAP versus tax income for items such as 43 Table of Contents depreciation and gain recognition. However, we believe deferred tax is an immaterial component of our consolidated balance sheet. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The analysis below includes changes attributable to same store growth, acquisitions, development activity and divestitures. Same store properties are those that we owned during both the current and prior year reporting periods, excluding development properties stabilized after December 31, 2003 (generally defined as properties that are 90% leased or properties for which we have held a certificate of occupancy or where building has been substantially complete for at least 12 months). As of December 31, 2005, same store industrial properties consisted of properties aggregating approximately 72.5 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. During 2005, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 150 buildings, aggregating approximately 10.6 million square feet. In 2004, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 29 industrial buildings, two retail centers and one office, aggregating approximately 4.4 million square feet. Our future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition of additional properties and dispositions. Our future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical results.

These decreases were partially offset by increased occupancy. Industrial same store occupancy was 95.6% at December 31, 2005 and 95.2% at December 31, 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005, rents in the same store portfolio decreased 9.8% on industrial renewals and rollovers (cash basis) on 13.0 million square feet leased due to decreases in market rates. The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2004 and 2005, we continued to acquire properties in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial revenues. The increase in private capital income of $31.0 million was primarily due to incentive distributions for 2005 of $26.4 million for the sale of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, asset 44 Table of Contents management priority distributions from AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., and acquisition fees from AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P.

The 2004 acquisitions consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. The 2005 acquisitions consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2004 and 2005, we continued to acquire properties in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial operating costs. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase of $17.0 million in personnel costs related to additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international and development expansions, and an increase of $1.5 million due to the expansion of satellite offices. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our consolidated co investment joint ventures.

The increase in interest and other income was primarily due to increased bank interest income and a $1.0 million other fee. The 2005 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted primarily from our contribution of $106.9 million (using exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties to our newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. The 2004 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted from our contribution of $71.5 million in operating properties to our unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC. Development profits represent gains from the sale of development projects and land as part of our development for sale program. The increase in development profits was due to increased volume in 2005. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $1.9 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. During 2004, we sold seven land parcels and six development projects as part of our development for sale program, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet for an aggregate price of $40.4 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $6.5 million. During 2004, we also contributed one completed development project into a newly formed unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $2.0 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash.

Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Alliance Fund I for $618.5 million. The multi investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. We received cash and a distribution of an on tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund. During 2004, we divested ourselves of 21 industrial buildings, two retail centers and one office building, aggregating approximately 3.1 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $200.3 million, with a resulting net gain of $42.0 million.

The increase in preferred stock dividends is due to the newly issued shares. 46 Table of Contents For the Years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 (dollars in millions) Revenues 2004 2003 $ Change % Change Rental revenues U.S. industrial: Same store $ 514.1 $ 485.4 $ 28.7 5.9 % 2004 acquisitions 25.2 25.2 % Development 6.2 6.9 (0.7 ) (10.1 )% Other industrial 7.7 4.4 3.3 75.0 % International industrial 25.2 6.1 19.1 313.1 % Retail 1.1 0.9 0.2 22.2 % Total rental revenues 579.5 503.7 75.8 15.0 % Private capital income 12.9 13.3 (0.4 ) (3.0 )% Total revenues $ 592.4 $ 517.0 $ 75.4 14.6 % The increase in U.S. industrial same store rental revenues was primarily driven by increased lease termination fees. Industrial same store occupancy was 95.2% at December 31, 2004 and 93.0% at December 31, 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2004, rents in the same store portfolio decreased 14.7% on industrial renewals and rollovers (cash basis) on 16.2 million square feet leased due to decreases in market rates. The properties acquired during 2003 consisted of 82 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.5 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2003 and 2004, we continued to acquire properties in France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial revenues. The decrease in private capital income was due to greater incentive fees earned in the prior year.

The 2004 acquisitions consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2003 and 2004, we continued to acquire properties in France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial property operating costs. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The 2003 impairment loss was on investments in real estate and leasehold interests. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased stock based compensation expense of $2.3 million and additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international and development expansions. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our co investment joint ventures. The increase in fund costs was due to additional formation of co investment joint ventures in 2004.

This decrease was offset by the receipt of a lease termination fee at a property in Chicago in the first quarter of 2004. The gains from dispositions of real estate (not classified as discontinued operations) in 2004, resulted from our contribution of $71.5 million in operating properties to our newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC. The gains from disposition of real estate (not classified as discontinued operations) in 2003, resulted from our contribution of $94.0 million in operating properties to our unconsolidated co investment joint venture, Industrial Fund I, LLC. Development profits represent gains from sales from our development for sale and contribution program. During 2004, we sold seven land parcels and six development projects as part of our development for sale program, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet for an aggregate price of $40.4 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $6.5 million. During 2004, we also contributed one completed development project into a newly formed unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $2.0 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. During 2003, we sold seven development for sale and other projects, for an aggregate price of $74.8 million, with a resulting gain of $14.4 million, net of taxes. The increase in interest expense, including amortization, was due to the issuance of additional unsecured debt under our 2002 medium term note program, increased borrowings on the unsecured credit facilities and additional secured debt borrowings in our co investment joint ventures.

In addition, on November 26, 2003, the operating partnership redeemed all 1,300,000 of its outstanding 85/8% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Partnership Units and we recognized a reduction of income available to common stockholders of $1.7 million for the original issuance costs. In June and November 2003, we issued 2,000,000 shares of 6.5% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and 2,300,000 shares of 6.75% Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, respectively. The timing of the newly issued shares contributed to the increase in preferred stock dividends. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Balance Sheet Strategy. In general, we use unsecured lines of credit, unsecured notes, preferred stock and common equity (issued by us and or the operating partnership and its subsidiaries) to capitalize our 100% owned assets. Over time, we plan to retire non recourse, secured debt encumbering our 100% owned assets and replace that debt with unsecured notes. In managing our co investment joint ventures, in general, we use non recourse, secured debt to capitalize our co investment joint ventures. We currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for acquisitions, development, expansion and renovation of properties will include: retained earnings and cash flow from operations; borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities; other forms of secured or unsecured financing; proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the operating partnership (including issuances of limited partnership units in the operating partnership or its subsidiaries); net proceeds from divestitures of properties; private capital contributions from co investment partners; and net proceeds from contribution of properties and completed development projects to our co investment joint ventures. We currently expect that our principal funding requirements will include: working capital; development, expansion and renovation of properties; acquisitions, including our global expansion; debt service; and dividends and distributions on outstanding common and preferred stock and limited partnership units. 49 Table of Contents We believe that our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow from operations, borrowings available under our unsecured credit facilities and our ability to access private and public debt and equity capital, are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Resources Dispositions of Real Estate Interests. During 2005, we recognized a gain of $1.3 million from disposition of real estate interests, representing the additional value received from the contribution of properties in 2004 to AMB SGP Mexico, LLC. During 2005, we contributed $106.9 million (using exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties, consisting of six industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet, to our newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. We recognized a total gain of $17.8 million on the contribution, representing the partial sale of our interests in the contributed properties acquired by the third party investors for cash. Property Divestitures. During 2005, we divested ourselves of 142 industrial buildings and one retail center, aggregating approximately 9.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $926.6 million, with a resulting net gain of $113.6 million. Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Alliance Fund I for $618.5 million. The multi investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. We received cash and a distribution of an on tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund. We also received a net incentive distribution of approximately $26.4 million in cash which is classified under private capital income on the consolidated statement of operations. Development Sales and Contributions. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $1.9 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. Properties Held for Contribution. As of December 31, 2005, we held for contribution to a co investment joint venture one industrial building with an aggregate net book value of $32.8 million, which, when contributed to the joint venture, will reduce our current ownership interest from approximately 98% to an expected range of 20 50%. This asset is not being held for divestiture under SFAS No. 144. Properties Held for Divestiture. As of December 31, 2005, we held for divestiture five industrial buildings and one undeveloped land parcel, which are not in our core markets, do not meet our current strategic objectives or which we have included as part of our development for sale program. The divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. As of December 31, 2005, the net carrying value of the properties held for divestiture was $17.9 million. Expected net sales proceeds exceed the net carrying value of the properties. Co investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund certain acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. We generally consolidate these joint ventures for financial reporting purposes because they are not variable interest entities and because we are the sole managing general partner and control all major operating decisions. However, in certain cases, our co investment joint ventures are unconsolidated because we do not control all major operating decisions. Third party equity interests in the joint ventures are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2005, we owned approximately 54.8 million square feet of our 50 Table of Contents properties (47.7% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so.

We have authorized for issuance 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which the following series were designated as of December 31, 2005: 1,595,337 shares of series D preferred; 220,440 shares of series E cumulative redeemable preferred; 267,439 shares of series F cumulative redeemable preferred of which 201,139 are outstanding; 840,000 shares of series H cumulative redeemable preferred; 510,000 shares of series I cumulative redeemable preferred; 800,000 shares of series J cumulative redeemable preferred; 800,000 shares of series K cumulative redeemable preferred; 2,300,000 shares of series L cumulative redeemable preferred, of which 2,000,000 are outstanding; 2,300,000 shares of series M cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which are outstanding and 3,000,000 shares of series O cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which are outstanding. 51 Table of Contents On December 13, 2005, we issued and sold 3,000,000 shares of 7.00% Series O Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at $25.00 per share. Dividends are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable quarterly in arrears at a rate per share equal to $1.75 per annum. The series O preferred stock is redeemable by us on or after December 13, 2010, subject to certain conditions, for cash at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, if any, to the redemption date. We contributed the net proceeds of $72.3 million to the operating partnership, and in exchange, the operating partnership issued to us 3,000,000 7.00% Series O Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units. On June 23, 2003, we issued and sold 2,000,000 shares of 6.5% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at a price of $25.00 per share. Dividends are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable quarterly in arrears at a rate per share equal to $1.625 per annum. The series L preferred stock is redeemable by us on or after June 23, 2008, subject to certain conditions, for cash at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, if any, to the redemption date. We contributed the net proceeds of approximately $48.0 million to the operating partnership, and in exchange, the operating partnership issued to us 2,000,000 6.5% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units. The operating partnership used the proceeds, in addition to proceeds previously contributed to the operating partnership from other equity issuances, to redeem all 3,995,800 of its 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units from us on July 28, 2003. We, in turn, used those proceeds to redeem all 3,995,800 of our 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for $100.2 million, including all accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, to the redemption date. On November 25, 2003, we issued and sold 2,300,000 shares of 6.75% Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at $25.00 per share. Dividends are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable quarterly in arrears at a rate per share equal to $1.6875 per annum.

We contributed the net proceeds of $55.4 million to the operating partnership, and in exchange, the operating partnership issued to us 2,300,000 6.75% Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units. On September 24, 2004, AMB Property II, L.P., a partnership in which Texas AMB I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and our indirect subsidiary, owns an approximate 1.0% general partnership interest and the operating partnership owns an approximate 99% common limited partnership interest, issued 729,582 5.0% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units at a price of $50.00 per unit. The series N preferred units were issued to Robert Pattillo Properties, Inc. in exchange for the contribution of certain parcels of land that are located in multiple markets to AMB Property II, L.P. Effective January 27, 2006, Robert Pattillo Properties, Inc. exercised its rights under its Put Agreement, dated September 24, 2004, with the operating partnership, and sold all of its series N preferred units to the operating partnership at a price equal to $50.00 per unit, plus all accrued and unpaid distributions to the date of such sale. Also on January 27, 2006, AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased all of the series N preferred units from the operating partnership at a price equal to $50.00 per unit, plus all accrued and unpaid distributions to the date of such sale and cancelled all of the outstanding series N preferred units as of such date. As of December 31, 2005, $142.8 million in preferred units with a weighted average rate of 7.87%, issued by the operating partnership, were callable under the terms of the partnership agreement and $102.0 million in preferred units with a weighted average rate of 6.9% become callable in 2006. In December 2005, our board of directors approved a new two year common stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of our common stock. We did not repurchase or retire any shares of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2005. Debt. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, we presently intend to operate with an our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio of approximately 45% or less. As of December 31, 2005, our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio was 34.7%. (See footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratios table below for our definitions of our share of total market capitalization, market equity and our share of total debt.) However, we typically finance our consolidated co investment joint ventures with secured debt at a loan to 52 Table of Contents value ratio of 50 65% per our joint venture partnership agreements. Additionally, we currently intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these policies, however, our organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our management could alter or eliminate these policies without stockholder approval or circumstances could arise that could render us unable to comply with these policies. As of December 31, 2005, the aggregate principal amount of our secured debt was $1.9 billion, excluding unamortized debt premiums of $12.0 million. Of the $1.9 billion of secured debt, $1.4 billion is secured by properties in our joint ventures. The secured debt is generally non recourse and bears interest at rates varying from 0.6% to 10.4% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 5.7%) and final maturity dates ranging from January 2006 to January 2025. As of December 31, 2005, $1.6 billion of the secured debt obligations bears interest at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% while the remaining $291.7 million bears interest at variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 2.1%). As of December 31, 2005, the operating partnership had outstanding an aggregate of $975.0 million in unsecured senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 6.2% and had an average term of 5.2 years. These unsecured senior debt securities include $300.0 million in notes issued in June 1998, $250.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2000 medium term note program, $325.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2002 medium term note program, and approximately $112.5 million of 5.094% Notes Due 2015, which were issued to Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America on July 11, 2005 in a private placement, in exchange for the cancellation of $100 million of notes that were issued in June 1998 resulting in a discount of approximately $12.5 million. The unsecured senior debt securities are subject to various covenants. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to its senior debt securities. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then our cash flow may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Credit Facilities. On June 1, 2004, the operating partnership completed the early renewal of its senior unsecured revolving line of credit in the amount of $500.0 million. We remain a guarantor of the operating partnerships obligations under the credit facility. The three year credit facility includes a multi currency component under which up to $250.0 million can be drawn in Yen, Euros or British Pounds Sterling. The line, which matures in June 2007 and carries a one year extension option, can be increased up to $700.0 million upon certain conditions, and replaces the operating partnerships previous $500.0 million credit facility that was to mature in December 2005. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the operating partnerships long term debt rating, which is currently 60 basis points with an annual facility fee of 20 basis points, based on the current credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt. The operating partnership uses its unsecured credit facility principally for acquisitions, funding development activity and general working capital requirements. The total amount available under the credit facility fluctuates based upon the borrowing base, as defined in the agreement governing the credit facility, which is generally based upon the value of our unencumbered properties. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding balance on the credit facility was $216.8 million and the remaining amount available was $244.8 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $38.4 million (excluding the additional $200.0 million of potential additional capacity). The outstanding balance included borrowings denominated in Euros and Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, would equal approximately $173.1 million and $43.7 million in U.S. dollars, respectively. On June 29, 2004, AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating partnership, entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement providing for loans or letters of credit. On December 8, 2005, the unsecured revolving credit agreement was amended to increase the maximum principal amount outstanding at 53 Table of Contents any time to up to 35.0 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, equaled approximately $297.2 million U.S. dollars, and can be increased to up to 40.0 billion Yen upon certain conditions. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K. under the revolving credit facility, as well as the obligations of any other entity in which the operating partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest, and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the revolving credit agreement. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and for other real estate purposes in Japan. Generally, borrowers under the revolving credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the revolving credit facility with certain real estate assets or equity in entities holding such real estate assets. The revolving credit facility matures in June 2007 and has a one year extension option, which is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.25% of the outstanding commitments under the facility at that time. The rate on the borrowings is generally TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the current credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt and is currently 60 basis points. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, payable in quarterly amounts, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt, and is currently 20 basis points of the outstanding commitments under the facility. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, was $205.8 million in U.S. dollars. On November 24, 2004, AMB Tokai TMK, a Japanese subsidiary of the operating partnership, entered into a secured multi advance project financing, providing for loans in a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of up to 20.0 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, would equal approximately $169.9 million U.S. dollars. The financing agreement is among AMB Tokai TMK, us, the operating partnership, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and a syndicate of banks. We, along with the operating partnership, jointly and severally guarantee AMB Tokai TMKs obligations under the financing agreement, pursuant to a guaranty of payment executed in connection with the project financing. The financing is secured by a mortgage on certain real property located in Tokai, Tokyo, Japan, and matures on October 31, 2006 with a one year extension option. The rate on the borrowings will generally be TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt and is currently 60 basis points per annum, except that AMB Tokai TMK has purchased from Sumitomo an interest rate swap, which has fixed the interest rate payable on a principal amount equal to 13.0 billion Yen at 1.32% per annum plus the applicable margin. In addition, there is an annual commitment fee based on unused commitments, payable quarterly, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt, and is currently 20 basis points of the amount of unused commitments. The financing agreement contains affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. In addition, Sumitomo, AMB Tokai TMK and the operating partnership signed a commitment letter on November 24, 2004, pursuant to which Sumitomo committed to purchase bonds that may be issued by AMB Tokai TMK in an amount between 10.0 billion Yen and 15.0 billion Yen (such amount to be determined by AMB Tokai TMK). The bonds would be secured by the AMB Ohta Distribution Center and would generally accrue interest at a rate of TIBOR plus 1.10% per annum; because the swap purchased by AMB Tokai TMK from Sumitomo is coterminous with the maturity date of the proposed bonds, AMB Tokai TMK will have fixed the interest rate payable on, in general, a principal amount equal to 13.0 billion Yen at 2.42% per annum. The bonds, if issued, would mature on October 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding balance on this financing agreement was 19.5 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, equaled approximately $165.6 million U.S. dollars and is accounted for as wholly owned secured debt. On February 16, 2006, the operating partnership and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries entered into a third amended and restated credit agreement for a $250 million unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility with a maturity date of February 2010, that replaced the then existing $100 million unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility that was to mature in June 2008. As of December 31, 2005, we had an additional outstanding balance of $67.5 million under the then existing facility. 54 Table of Contents Mortgages Receivable. Through a wholly owned subsidiary, we hold a mortgage loan receivable on AMB Pier One, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture. The note bears interest at 13.0% and matures in May 2026. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding balance on the note was $12.8 million. We also hold a loan receivable on G. Accion, an unconsolidated joint venture totaling $8.8 million with an interest rate of 10.0%. The loan matures in November 2006. The tables below summarize our debt maturities, capitalization and reconcile our share of total debt to total consolidated debt as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands): Debt Our Joint Unsecured Secured Venture Senior Debt Unsecured Credit Debt(4) Debt Securities Debt Facilities(1) Total Debt 2006 $ 65,369 $ 79,262 $ 75,000 $ 16,280 $ $ 235,911 2007 12,680 58,124 75,000 752 422,602 569,158 2008 40,705 178,795 175,000 810 67,470 462,780 2009 5,264 120,551 100,000 873 226,688 2010 71,078 116,927 250,000 941 438,946 2011 21,573 357,207 75,000 1,014 454,794 2012 254,996 171,442 1,093 427,531 2013 14,773 196,894 920 212,587 2014 15,066 4,684 616 20,366 2015 1,951 61,653 100,000 664 164,268 Thereafter 19,004 32,544 125,000 176,548 Subtotal 522,459 1,378,083 975,000 23,963 490,072 3,389,577 Unamortized premiums 2,577 9,407 11,984 Total consolidated debt 525,036 1,387,490 975,000 23,963 490,072 3,401,561 Our share of unconsolidated joint venture debt(2) 161,120 161,120 Total debt 525,036 1,548,610 975,000 23,963 490,072 3,562,681 Joint venture partners share of consolidated joint venture debt (960,803 ) (960,803 ) Our share of total debt(3) $ 525,036 $ 587,807 $ 975,000 $ 23,963 $ 490,072 $ 2,601,878 Weighted average interest rate 4.1 % 6.3 % 6.2 % 8.2 % 2.2 % 5.3 % Weighted average maturity (in years) 5.8 5.7 5.2 3.1 1.6 4.9 (1) Includes $173.1 million, $249.5 million and $67.5 million in Euro, Yen and Canadian dollar based borrowings, respectively, translated to U.S. dollars using the functional exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2005. (2) The weighted average interest and maturity for the unconsolidated joint venture debt were 5.3% and 3.7 years, respectively. (3) Our share of total debt is the pro rata portion of the total debt based on our percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated or unconsolidated ventures holding the debt. We believe that our share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze our leverage and to compare our leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of our debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their joint ventures. Our share of total debt is not intended to reflect our actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures. The above table reconciles our share of total debt to total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure. 55 Table of Contents (4) Our secured debt and joint venture debt include debt related to international assets in the amount of $383.0 million. Of this, $250.5 million is associated with assets located in Asia and the remaining $132.5 million is related to assets located in Europe.

We 56 Table of Contents believe that our share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze our leverage and to compare our leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of our debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their joint ventures. Our share of total debt is not intended to reflect our actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures. For a reconciliation of our share of total debt to total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure, please see the table of debt maturities and capitalization above. Liquidity As of December 31, 2005, we had $232.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and $368.8 million of additional available borrowings under our credit facilities. As of December 31, 2005, we had $34.4 million in restricted cash. Our board of directors declared a regular cash dividend for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 of $0.44 per share of common stock, and the operating partnership announced its intention to pay a regular cash distribution for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 of $0.44 per common unit. The dividends and distributions were payable on January 6, 2006 to stockholders and unitholders of record on December 22, 2005. The series L and M preferred stock dividends were payable on January 16, 2006 to stockholders of record on January 6, 2006. The series E, F, J and K preferred unit quarterly distributions were payable on January 15, 2006. The series O preferred stock dividends are payable on April 15, 2006. The series D, H, I and N preferred unit quarterly distributions were paid on December 25, 2005. The following table sets forth the dividends and distributions paid or payable per share or unit for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003: Paying Entity Security 2005 2004 2003 AMB Property Corporation Common stock $ 1.76 $ 1.70 $ 1.66 AMB Property Corporation Series A preferred stock n/a n/a $ 1.15 AMB Property Corporation Series L preferred stock $ 1.63 $ 1.63 $ 0.85 AMB Property Corporation Series M preferred stock $ 1.69 $ 1.69 $ 0.17 AMB Property Corporation Series O preferred stock $ 0.09 n/a n/a Operating Partnership Common limited partnership units $ 1.76 $ 1.70 $ 1.66 Operating Partnership Series B preferred units n/a n/a $ 3.71 Operating Partnership Series J preferred units $ 3.98 $ 3.98 $ 3.98 Operating Partnership Series K preferred units $ 3.98 $ 3.98 $ 3.98 AMB Property II, L.P.

The anticipated size of our distributions, using only cash from operations, will not allow us to retire all of our debt as it comes due. Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would 57 Table of Contents adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Commitments Developments. In addition to recurring capital expenditures, which consist of building improvements and leasing costs incurred to renew or re tenant space, during 2005, we initiated 30 new industrial development projects in North America, Europe and Asia with a total estimated investment of $522.4 million, aggregating an estimated 7.0 million square feet. As of December 31, 2005, we had 47 projects in our development pipeline representing a total estimated investment of $1.1 billion upon completion, of which two industrial projects with a total of 0.3 million square feet and an aggregate estimated investment of $24.5 million upon completion are held in unconsolidated joint ventures. In addition, we held one development project available for sale or contribution, representing a total estimated investment of $32.8 million upon completion. Of the total development pipeline, $681.4 million had been funded as of December 31, 2005 and an estimated $405.2 million was required to complete current and planned projects. We expect to fund these expenditures with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances, net proceeds from property divestitures and private capital from co investment partners, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow. Acquisitions. During 2005, we acquired 41 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet for a total expected investment of $555.0 million, including two buildings that were acquired by two of our unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. Additional acquisition activity in 2005 included the purchase of an approximate 43% unconsolidated equity interest in G.Accion, one of Mexicos largest real estate companies, for $46.1 million. We generally fund our acquisitions through private capital contributions, borrowings under our credit facility, cash, debt issuances and net proceeds from property divestitures. Lease Commitments. We have entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily on tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms from one to 57 years. These operating lease payments are amortized ratably over the terms of the related leases. Future minimum rental payments required under non cancelable operating leases in effect as of December 31, 2005 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2006 $ 20,894 2007 21,036 2008 20,617 2009 20,327 2010 19,997 Thereafter 278,759 Total $ 381,630 Co investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. As of December 31, 2005, we had investments in co investment joint ventures with a gross book value of $2.5 billion, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, and net equity investments in two unconsolidated co investment joint ventures of $26.3 million. As of December 31, 2005, we may make additional capital contributions to current and planned co investment joint ventures of up to $133.7 million (using the exchange rates at December 31, 2005). From time to time, we may raise additional equity commitments for AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open ended consolidated co investment joint venture formed in 2004 with institutional investors, which invest through a private real estate investment trust. This would increase our obligation to make additional capital commitments. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of this fund, we are obligated to contribute 20% of the total equity commitments to the fund until such time our total equity commitment is greater than 58 Table of Contents $150.0 million, at which time, our obligation is reduced to 10% of the total equity commitments. We expect to fund these contributions with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances or net proceeds from property divestitures, which could adversely effect our cash flow. Captive Insurance Company. In December 2001, we formed a wholly owned captive insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., which provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the deductible under our third party policies. We capitalized Arcata National Insurance Ltd. in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata National Insurance Ltd. established annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss experience of our properties. Annually, we engage an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims, related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata National Insurance Ltd. may be adjusted based on this estimate. Premiums paid to Arcata National Insurance Ltd. have a retrospective component, so that if expenses, including losses, deductibles and reserves, are less than premiums collected, the excess may be returned to the property owners (and, in turn, as appropriate, to the customers) and, conversely, subject to certain limitations, if expenses, including losses, deductibles and reserves, are greater than premiums collected, an additional premium will be charged. As with all recoverable expenses, differences between estimated and actual insurance premiums are recognized in the subsequent year. Through this structure, we believe that we have more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market. Potential Unknown Liabilities. Unknown liabilities may include the following: liabilities for clean up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to our formation transactions that had not been asserted prior to our formation transactions; accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; tax liabilities; and claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these entities. Overview of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our debt, interest and lease payments due by period as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands): Less than More than Contractual Obligations 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Total Debt $ 235,911 $ 1,031,938 $ 665,634 $ 1,456,094 $ 3,389,577 Debt interest payments 14,459 46,749 37,056 83,106 181,370 Operating lease commitments 20,894 41,653 49,324 278,759 381,630 Construction commitments 136,600 136,600 Total $ 271,264 $ 1,256,940 $ 743,014 $ 1,817,959 $ 4,089,177 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Standby Letters of Credit. As of December 31, 2005, we had provided approximately $48.7 million in letters of credit, of which $38.4 million was provided under the operating partnerships $500.0 million unsecured credit facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other commitments. Guarantees. As of December 31, 2005, we had outstanding guarantees in the aggregate amount of $128.2 million in connection with certain acquisitions. As of December 31, 2005, we guaranteed $23.4 million 59 Table of Contents and $2.3 million on outstanding loans on two of our consolidated joint ventures and one of our unconsolidated joint ventures, respectively. Performance and Surety Bonds. As of December 31, 2005, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $0.9 million. These bonds were issued in connection with certain of its development projects and were posted to guarantee certain tax obligations and the construction of certain real property improvements and infrastructure, such as grading, sewers and streets. Performance and surety bonds are commonly required by public agencies from real estate developers. Performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the taxes due or the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. Promoted Interests and Other Contractual Obligations. Upon the achievement of certain return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, we may be obligated to make payments to certain of joint venture partners pursuant to the terms and provisions of their contractual agreements with us. From time to time in the normal course of our business, we enter into various contracts with third parties that may obligate us to make payments or perform other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. SUPPLEMENTAL EARNINGS MEASURES FFO. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider funds from operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. FFO is defined as net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, less gains (or losses) from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estate related depreciation, and adjustments to derive our pro rata share of FFO of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. Further, we do not adjust FFO to eliminate the effects of non recurring charges. We believe that FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. We believe that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. 60 Table of Contents The following table reflects the calculation of FFO reconciled from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands): 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Net income(1) $ 257,807 $ 125,471 $ 129,128 $ 121,119 $ 136,200 Gains from dispositions of real estate, net of minority interests(2) (132,652 ) (47,224 ) (50,325 ) (19,383 ) (41,859 ) Real estate, related depreciation and amortization: Total depreciation and amortization 165,438 141,120 116,067 107,097 90,527 Discontinued operations depreciation 14,866 26,230 26,270 29,406 23,016 Non real estate depreciation (3,388 ) (871 ) (720 ) (712 ) (731 ) Ground lease amortization (2,301 ) (1,232 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from consolidated joint ventures: Joint venture partners minority interests (Net income) 36,398 29,544 21,015 15,112 11,288 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Net income) 3,681 2,615 2,378 3,572 4,836 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Development profits) 2,262 435 344 57 764 Discontinued operations minority interests (Net income) 8,502 13,549 16,214 17,745 17,595 FFO attributable to minority interests (100,275 ) (80,192 ) (65,603 ) (52,051 ) (40,144 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures: Our share of net income (10,770 ) (3,781 ) (5,445 ) (5,674 ) (5,467 ) Our share of FFO 14,441 7,549 9,755 9,291 8,014 Our share of development profits, net of taxes 5,441 Preferred stock dividends (7,388 ) (7,131 ) (6,999 ) (8,496 ) (8,500 ) Preferred stock and unit redemption discount (issuance costs) (5,413 ) 412 (7,600 ) Funds from operations $ 254,363 $ 207,314 $ 186,666 $ 215,194 $ 186,707 Basic FFO per common share and unit $ 2.87 $ 2.39 $ 2.17 $ 2.44 $ 2.09 Diluted FFO per common share and unit $ 2.75 $ 2.30 $ 2.13 $ 2.40 $ 2.07 Weighted average common shares and units: Basic 88,684,262 86,885,250 85,859,899 88,204,208 89,286,379 Diluted 92,508,725 90,120,250 87,616,365 89,689,310 90,325,801 61 Table of Contents (1) Includes gains from undepreciated land sales of $25.0 million, $3.7 million and $1.2 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. (2) 2005 includes accumulated depreciation re capture of approximately $1.1 million associated with the sale of the Interstate Crossdock redevelopment project. SS NOI. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider same store net operating income (SS NOI) to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. For properties that are considered part of the same store pool, see Part I, Item 2: Properties Industrial Properties Industrial Market Operating Statistics, Note 5, and Operating and Leasing Statistics Industrial Same Store Operating Statistics, Note 1. In deriving SS NOI, we define NOI as rental revenues (as calculated in accordance with GAAP), including reimbursements, less straight line rents, property operating expenses and real estate taxes. We exclude straight line rents in calculating SS NOI because we believe it provides a better measure of actual cash basis rental growth for a year over year comparison. In addition, we believe that SS NOI helps the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate as compared to other companies. While SS NOI is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. SS NOI also does not reflect general and administrative expenses, interest expenses, depreciation and amortization costs, capital expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development and construction activities that could materially impact our results from operations. Further, our computation of SS NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating SS NOI. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices, interest rates and international exchange rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings and our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2005, we had two outstanding interest rate swaps with aggregate notional amount of $119.5 million (in U.S. dollars). See Financial Instruments below. The table below summarizes the market risks associated with our fixed and variable rate debt outstanding before unamortized debt premiums of $12.0 million as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands): 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total Fixed rate debt(1) $ 165,953 $ 129,214 $ 374,174 $ 190,548 $ 437,934 $ 1,260,015 $ 2,557,838 Average interest rate 6.9 % 7.2 % 6.9 % 5.0 % 6.1 % 6.3 % 6.3 % Variable rate debt(2) $ 69,958 $ 439,944 $ 88,606 $ 36,140 $ 1,012 $ 196,079 $ 831,739 Average interest rate 4.3 % 2.2 % 2.2 % 2.2 % 2.0 % 1.9 % 2.3 % Interest Payments $ 14,459 $ 18,982 $ 27,767 $ 10,322 $ 26,734 $ 83,106 $ 181,370 (1) Represents 75.5% of all outstanding debt. (2) Represents 24.5% of all outstanding debt. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased or decreased by 10%, then the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would be $1.9 million annually. As of December 31, 2005, the book value and the estimated fair value of our total consolidated debt (both secured and unsecured) was $3.4 billion based on our estimate of current market interest rates. 62 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, variable rate debt comprised 24.5% and 15.3%, respectively, of all our outstanding debt. Variable rate debt was $831.7 million and $498.3 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. The increase is primarily due to higher outstanding balances on our credit facilities. This increase in our outstanding variable rate debt increases our risk associated with unfavorable interest rate fluctuations. Financial Instruments. We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income or income. For revenues or expenses denominated in non functional currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments in effect at December 31, 2005 were two interest rate swaps hedging cash flows of our variable rate borrowings based on Euribor (Europe) and Japanese TIBOR (Japan) and two put options hedging against adverse foreign fluctuations of the Mexican Peso and the Euro against the U.S. dollar.

Our exposure to market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries operating in the United States and Mexico. The functional currency for our subsidiaries operating outside North America is generally the local currency of the country in which the entity is located, mitigating the effect of foreign exchange gains and losses. Our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement 63 Table of Contents date. We translate income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. The losses resulting from the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity and totaled $1.8 million for year ended December 31, 2005. Our international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. In these instances, non monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2005, gains from remeasurement and the sale of one foreign exchange agreement included in our results of operations totaled $0.6 million. We also record gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated. We believe that these gains or losses are immaterial.

Secured Debt As of December 31, 2005, we had $1.9 billion of secured indebtedness, net of unamortized premiums, secured by deeds of trust or mortgages. As of December 31, 2005, the total gross consolidated investment value of those properties securing the debt was $3.6 billion. Of the $1.9 billion of secured indebtedness, $1.4 billion was joint venture debt secured by properties with a gross investment value of $2.5 billion.

(2) Basic and diluted net income per weighted average share equals the net income available to common stockholders divided by 84,048,936 and 87,873,399 shares, respectively, for 2005; 82,133,627 and 85,368,626 shares, respectively, for 2004; 81,096,062 and 82,852,528 shares, respectively, for 2003; 83,310,885 and 84,795,987 shares, respectively, for 2002; 84,174,644 and 85,214,066 shares, respectively, for 2001. (3) Our share of total debt is the pro rata portion of the total debt based on our percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated ventures holding the debt. We believe that our share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze our leverage and to compare our leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of our debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their joint ventures. Our share of total debt is not intended to reflect our actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures. For a reconciliation of our share of total debt to total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure, please see the table of debt maturities and capitalization in Part II, Item 7: Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources. 38 Table of Contents Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations GENERAL You should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements. We commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company effective with the completion of our initial public offering on November 26, 1997, and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with our initial tax return for the year ended December 31, 1997. AMB Property Corporation and AMB Property, L.P. were formed shortly before the consummation of our initial public offering. Managements Overview The primary source of our revenue and earnings is rent received from customers under long term (generally three to ten years) operating leases at our properties, including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs, and from partnership distributions and fees from our private capital business. We also produce earnings from the strategic disposition of operating assets, from the disposition of projects in our development for sale or contribution program and from contributions of properties to our co investment joint ventures. Our long term growth is driven by our ability to maintain and increase occupancy rates or increase rental rates at our properties, and by our ability to continue to acquire and develop new properties. National industrial markets improved during 2005 when compared with market conditions in 2004. According to Torto Wheaton Research, the positive trend in demand began in the second quarter of 2004 and reversed 14 prior quarters of negatively trending, or rising, space availability. We believe the protracted period of rising availability created a difficult national leasing environment which is now improving, particularly in large industrial property markets tied to global trade. During the three and a half year period of negatively trending industrial space availability, investor demand for industrial property (as supported by our observation of strong national sales volumes and declining acquisition capitalization rates) remained consistently strong. We believe we capitalized on the demand for acquisition property by accelerating the repositioning of our portfolio through the disposition of non core properties. We plan to continue selling selected assets on an opportunistic basis but believe we have substantially achieved our repositioning goals. U.S. Hub and Total Other Total/Weighted Property Data Gateway Markets(1) Markets(2) Average For the year ended December 31, 2005: % of total rentable square feet 74.9 % 25.1 % 100.0 % Occupancy percentage at year end 96.2 % 94.6 % 95.8 % Same space square footage leased 11,032,482 2,574,944 13,607,426 Rent decreases on renewals and rollovers (10.8 )% (4.3 )% (9.7 )% For the year ended December 31, 2004: % of total rentable square feet 74.1 % 25.9 % 100.0 % Occupancy percentage at year end 95.0 % 94.2 % 94.8 % Same space square footage leased 13,932,213 3,553,563 17,485,776 Rent decreases on renewals and rollovers (15.3 )% (3.6 )% (13.2 )% (1) Our U.S. hub and gateway markets include on tarmac and Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas/ Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Northern New Jersey/ New York City, the San Francisco Bay Area, Miami and Seattle. (2) Our total other markets include other domestic target markets, other non target markets, international target markets and retail. We observed two positive trends nationally for industrial real estate during the year ended December 31, 2005, supported by data provided by Torto Wheaton Research. First, national industrial space availability 39 Table of Contents declined 130 basis points during the year from 10.9% to 9.6%. The availability rate has fallen for seven consecutive quarters, reversing the trend of the prior 14 quarters in which national industrial space availability increased on average 36 basis points per quarter. Second, national absorption of industrial space, defined as the net change in occupied stock as measured by square feet of completions less the change in available square feet, totaled approximately 281 million square feet in the year ended December 31, 2005, substantially exceeding the 183 million square feet of space absorbed in 2004 and well above the previous ten year historical average of 139 million square feet of space absorbed annually. In this improved environment, our industrial portfolios occupancy levels increased to 95.8% at December 31, 2005 from 94.8% at December 31, 2004, which we believe reflects higher levels of demand for industrial space generally and in our portfolio specifically. During the year ended December 31, 2005, our lease expirations totaled approximately 17.6 million square feet while commencements of new or renewed leases totaled approximately 21.3 million square feet, resulting in an increase in our occupancy level of approximately 100 basis points. Rental rates on industrial renewals and rollovers in our portfolio decreased 9.7% during the year ended December 31, 2005 as leases were entered into or renewed at rates consistent with what we believe to be current market levels. We believe this decline in rents on lease renewals and rollovers reflects trends in national industrial space availability. We believe that relatively high levels of national industrial space availability have caused market rents for industrial properties to decline between 10% and 20% from their peak levels in 2001 based on our research data; 42.5% of the space that rolled over in our portfolio in 2005 had commenced between 1999 and 2001. Rental rates in our portfolio declined at successively lower rates in each of the last three quarters during 2005, which we believe indicates a stabilization of market rental rate levels. While the level of rental rate reduction varied by market, we achieved occupancy levels in our portfolio 540 basis points in excess of the national industrial market, as determined by Torto Wheaton Research, by pricing lease renewals and new leases with sensitivity to local market conditions. During periods of decreasing or stabilizing rental rates, we strove to sign leases with shorter terms to prevent locking in lower rent levels for long periods and to be prepared to sign new, longer term leases during periods of growing rental rates. When we sign leases of shorter duration, we attempt to limit overall leasing costs and capital expenditures by offering different grades of tenant improvement packages, appropriate to the lease term. We expect development to be a significant driver of our earnings growth as we expand our land and development pipeline, and contribute completed development projects into our co investment program and recognize development profits. We believe that development, renovation and expansion of well located, high quality industrial properties should generally continue to provide us with attractive investment opportunities at a higher rate of return than we may obtain from the purchase of existing properties. We believe that our development opportunities in Mexico and Japan are particularly attractive given the current lack of supply of modern industrial distribution facilities in the major metropolitan markets of these countries. Globally, we have increased our development pipeline from $106.8 million at the end of 2002 to approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2005. In addition to our committed development pipeline, we hold a total of 1,307 acres for future development or sale. We believe these 1,307 acres of land could support approximately 24.3 million square feet of future development. Going forward, we believe that our co investment program with private capital investors will continue to serve as a significant source of revenues and capital for acquisitions. Through these co investment joint ventures, we typically earn acquisition and development fees, asset management fees and priority distributions, as well as promoted interests and incentive distributions based on the performance of the co investment joint ventures; however, we can not assure you that we will continue to do so. Through contribution of development properties to our co investment joint ventures, we expect to recognize value creation from our development pipeline. As of December 31, 2005, we owned approximately 54.8 million square feet of our properties (47.7% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these co investment joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. 40 Table of Contents By the end of 2007, we plan to have approximately 15% of our operating portfolio (based on both consolidated and unconsolidated annualized base rent) invested in international markets. Our North American target markets outside of the United States currently include Guadalajara, Mexico City, Monterrey and Toronto. Our European target markets currently include Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt, Hamburg, London, Lyon, Madrid, Milan and Paris. Our Asian target markets currently include Beijing, Busan, Nagoya, Osaka, the Pearl River Delta, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore and Tokyo. It is possible that our target markets will change over time to reflect experience, market opportunities, customer needs and changes in global distribution patterns. As of December 31, 2005, our international operating properties comprised 7.1% of our annualized base rents, including properties owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust, we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income. As a result, we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our on going operations to the same extent that other corporations that are not real estate investment trusts can. We must continue to raise capital in both the debt and equity markets to fund our working capital needs, acquisitions and developments. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for a complete discussion of the sources of our capital. Summary of Key Transactions in 2005 During the year ended December 31, 2005, we completed the following significant capital deployment transactions: Acquired 41 buildings in North America, Europe and Asia, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet, for $555.0 million, including two buildings that were acquired by two of our unconsolidated co investment joint ventures; Acquired an approximate 43% unconsolidated equity interest in G.Accion, one of Mexicos largest real estate companies for $46.1 million; Committed to 30 development projects in North America, Europe and Asia totaling 7.0 million square feet with an estimated total investment of approximately $522.4 million; Acquired 341 acres of land for industrial warehouse development in North America, Europe and Asia for approximately $193.9 million; Sold five land parcels and five development projects available for sale, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet, for an aggregate price of approximately $155.2 million; and Divested ourselves of 142 industrial buildings and one retail center aggregating approximately 9.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of approximately $926.6 million. Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Alliance Fund I for $618.5 million. The multi investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. We received cash and a distribution of an on tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund. We also received a net incentive distribution of approximately $26.4 million in cash. See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our acquisition, development and disposition activity. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we completed the following significant capital markets and other financing transactions: Formed an unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., with planned investment of capacity of approximately 247.3 billion Yen ($2.1 billion U.S. dollars, using exchange rate at December 31, 2005). We contributed $106.9 million (using exchange rate in effect at contribution) of operating properties to the fund; Contributed an industrial property for $23.6 million to AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, an unconsolidated co investment joint venture; 41 Table of Contents Obtained $69.7 million of debt (using exchange rates in effect at applicable quarter end dates) with a weighted average interest rate of 3.8% for international acquisitions; Assumed $62.8 million of debt for our consolidated co investment joint ventures at a weighted average interest rate of 7.4%; Obtained long term secured debt financings for our co investment joint ventures of $139.7 million with a weighted average rate of 5.4%; Exchanged $100.0 million of 6.9% Reset Put Securities for approximately $112.5 million of 5.094% Notes due 2015; Raised $72.3 million in net proceeds from the issuance of $75.0 million of our 7.0% Series O Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock; and Issued $175.0 million of unsecured senior debt securities due 2010. See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 6, 9 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our capital markets transactions. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Investments in Real Estate. Investments in real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. We also record at acquisition an intangible asset or liability for the value attributable to above or below market leases, in place leases and lease origination costs for all acquisitions. Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a property by property basis quarterly and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable. Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying amount of the property. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future market conditions and the availability of capital. Examples of certain situations that could affect future cash flows of a property may include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in occupancy; unforeseen bankruptcy, lease termination and move out of a major customer; or a significant decrease in annual base rents of that property. If impairment analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying amount of our long lived assets could occur in the future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings. Revenue Recognition. We record rental revenue from operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts, security deposits and letters of credit, then we may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our customers on an on going basis by reviewing their financial condition periodically as appropriate. Each period we review our outstanding accounts receivable, including straight line rents, for doubtful accounts and 42 Table of Contents provide allowances as needed. We also record lease termination fees when a customer has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us. If a customer remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement, the applicable termination fees are deferred and recognized over the term of such customers occupancy. Property Dispositions. We report real estate dispositions in three separate categories on our consolidated statements of operations. First, when we divest a portion of our interests in real estate entities or properties, gains from the sale represent the interests acquired by third party investors for cash. Second, we dispose of value added conversion projects and build to suit and speculative development projects for which we have not generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable. Lastly, beginning in 2002, SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, required us to separately report as discontinued operations the historical operating results attributable to operating properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the properties. The consolidated statements of operations for prior periods are also adjusted to conform with this classification. There is no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial position, net income or cash flows. In all cases, gains and losses are recognized using the full accrual method of accounting. Gains relating to transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met. Joint Ventures. We hold interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We determine consolidation based on standards set forth in EITF 96 16, Investors Accounting for an Investee When the Investor Has a Majority of the Voting Interest but the Minority Shareholder or Shareholders Have Certain Approval or Veto Rights, Statement of Position 78 9, Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures and FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN 46. Based on the guidance set forth in these pronouncements, we consolidate certain joint venture investments because we exercise significant control over major operating decisions, such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, asset management, investment activity and changes in financing. For joint ventures that are variable interest entities as defined under FIN 46 where we are not the primary beneficiaries, we do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. For joint ventures where we do not exercise significant control over major operating and management decisions, but where we exercise significant influence, we use the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. In June 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued EITF 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights. Under this consensus, a sole general partner is presumed to control a limited partnership (or similar entity) and should consolidate that entity unless the limited partners possess kick out rights or other substantive participating rights as described in EITF 96 16, Investors Accounting for an Investee When the Investor has a Majority of the Voting Interest but the Minority Shareholder or Shareholders Have Certain Approval or Veto rights. As of June 29, 2005, this consensus was effective immediately for all new or modified agreements, and effective beginning in the first reporting period that ends after December 15, 2005 for all existing agreements. We adopted the consolidation requirements of this consensus in the third quarter 2005 for all new or modified agreements and will adopt the consensus for existing agreements in the first quarter of 2006. There was not a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows upon the adoption of the consolidation requirements of this consensus for all new or modified agreements. We do not believe that there will be a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, upon adopting the consensus for existing agreements. Real Estate Investment Trust. As a real estate investment trust, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes in the U.S. if we meet minimum distribution, income, asset and shareholder tests. However, some of our subsidiaries may be subject to federal and state taxes. In addition, foreign entities may also be subject to the taxes of the host country. An income tax allocation is required to be estimated on our taxable income arising from our taxable REIT subsidiaries and international entities. A deferred tax component could arise based upon the differences in GAAP versus tax income for items such as 43 Table of Contents depreciation and gain recognition. However, we believe deferred tax is an immaterial component of our consolidated balance sheet. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The analysis below includes changes attributable to same store growth, acquisitions, development activity and divestitures. Same store properties are those that we owned during both the current and prior year reporting periods, excluding development properties stabilized after December 31, 2003 (generally defined as properties that are 90% leased or properties for which we have held a certificate of occupancy or where building has been substantially complete for at least 12 months). As of December 31, 2005, same store industrial properties consisted of properties aggregating approximately 72.5 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. During 2005, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 150 buildings, aggregating approximately 10.6 million square feet. In 2004, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 29 industrial buildings, two retail centers and one office, aggregating approximately 4.4 million square feet. Our future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition of additional properties and dispositions. Our future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical results.

These decreases were partially offset by increased occupancy. Industrial same store occupancy was 95.6% at December 31, 2005 and 95.2% at December 31, 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005, rents in the same store portfolio decreased 9.8% on industrial renewals and rollovers (cash basis) on 13.0 million square feet leased due to decreases in market rates. The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2004 and 2005, we continued to acquire properties in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial revenues. The increase in private capital income of $31.0 million was primarily due to incentive distributions for 2005 of $26.4 million for the sale of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, asset 44 Table of Contents management priority distributions from AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., and acquisition fees from AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P.

Other industrial expenses include expenses from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2004 and 2005, we continued to acquire properties in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial operating costs. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase of $17.0 million in personnel costs related to additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international and development expansions, and an increase of $1.5 million due to the expansion of satellite offices. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our consolidated co investment joint ventures.

The increase in interest and other income was primarily due to increased bank interest income and a $1.0 million other fee. The 2005 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted primarily from our contribution of $106.9 million (using exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties to our newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. The 2004 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted from our contribution of $71.5 million in operating properties to our unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC. Development profits represent gains from the sale of development projects and land as part of our development for sale program. The increase in development profits was due to increased volume in 2005. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $1.9 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. During 2004, we sold seven land parcels and six development projects as part of our development for sale program, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet for an aggregate price of $40.4 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $6.5 million. During 2004, we also contributed one completed development project into a newly formed unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $2.0 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash.

Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Alliance Fund I for $618.5 million. The multi investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. We received cash and a distribution of an on tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund. During 2004, we divested ourselves of 21 industrial buildings, two retail centers and one office building, aggregating approximately 3.1 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $200.3 million, with a resulting net gain of $42.0 million.

Industrial same store occupancy was 95.2% at December 31, 2004 and 93.0% at December 31, 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2004, rents in the same store portfolio decreased 14.7% on industrial renewals and rollovers (cash basis) on 16.2 million square feet leased due to decreases in market rates. The properties acquired during 2003 consisted of 82 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.5 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2003 and 2004, we continued to acquire properties in France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial revenues. The decrease in private capital income was due to greater incentive fees earned in the prior year.

The 2004 acquisitions consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2003 and 2004, we continued to acquire properties in France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial property operating costs. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The 2003 impairment loss was on investments in real estate and leasehold interests. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased stock based compensation expense of $2.3 million and additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international and development expansions. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our co investment joint ventures. The increase in fund costs was due to additional formation of co investment joint ventures in 2004.

This decrease was offset by the receipt of a lease termination fee at a property in Chicago in the first quarter of 2004. The gains from dispositions of real estate (not classified as discontinued operations) in 2004, resulted from our contribution of $71.5 million in operating properties to our newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC. The gains from disposition of real estate (not classified as discontinued operations) in 2003, resulted from our contribution of $94.0 million in operating properties to our unconsolidated co investment joint venture, Industrial Fund I, LLC. Development profits represent gains from sales from our development for sale and contribution program. During 2004, we sold seven land parcels and six development projects as part of our development for sale program, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet for an aggregate price of $40.4 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $6.5 million. During 2004, we also contributed one completed development project into a newly formed unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $2.0 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. During 2003, we sold seven development for sale and other projects, for an aggregate price of $74.8 million, with a resulting gain of $14.4 million, net of taxes. The increase in interest expense, including amortization, was due to the issuance of additional unsecured debt under our 2002 medium term note program, increased borrowings on the unsecured credit facilities and additional secured debt borrowings in our co investment joint ventures.

In addition, on November 26, 2003, the operating partnership redeemed all 1,300,000 of its outstanding 85/8% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Partnership Units and we recognized a reduction of income available to common stockholders of $1.7 million for the original issuance costs. In June and November 2003, we issued 2,000,000 shares of 6.5% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and 2,300,000 shares of 6.75% Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, respectively. The timing of the newly issued shares contributed to the increase in preferred stock dividends. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Balance Sheet Strategy. In general, we use unsecured lines of credit, unsecured notes, preferred stock and common equity (issued by us and or the operating partnership and its subsidiaries) to capitalize our 100% owned assets. Over time, we plan to retire non recourse, secured debt encumbering our 100% owned assets and replace that debt with unsecured notes. In managing our co investment joint ventures, in general, we use non recourse, secured debt to capitalize our co investment joint ventures. We currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for acquisitions, development, expansion and renovation of properties will include: retained earnings and cash flow from operations; borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities; other forms of secured or unsecured financing; proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the operating partnership (including issuances of limited partnership units in the operating partnership or its subsidiaries); net proceeds from divestitures of properties; private capital contributions from co investment partners; and net proceeds from contribution of properties and completed development projects to our co investment joint ventures. We currently expect that our principal funding requirements will include: working capital; development, expansion and renovation of properties; acquisitions, including our global expansion; debt service; and dividends and distributions on outstanding common and preferred stock and limited partnership units. 49 Table of Contents We believe that our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow from operations, borrowings available under our unsecured credit facilities and our ability to access private and public debt and equity capital, are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Resources Dispositions of Real Estate Interests. During 2005, we recognized a gain of $1.3 million from disposition of real estate interests, representing the additional value received from the contribution of properties in 2004 to AMB SGP Mexico, LLC. During 2005, we contributed $106.9 million (using exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties, consisting of six industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet, to our newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. We recognized a total gain of $17.8 million on the contribution, representing the partial sale of our interests in the contributed properties acquired by the third party investors for cash. Property Divestitures. During 2005, we divested ourselves of 142 industrial buildings and one retail center, aggregating approximately 9.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $926.6 million, with a resulting net gain of $113.6 million. Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Alliance Fund I for $618.5 million. The multi investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. We received cash and a distribution of an on tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund. We also received a net incentive distribution of approximately $26.4 million in cash which is classified under private capital income on the consolidated statement of operations. Development Sales and Contributions. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $1.9 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. Properties Held for Contribution. As of December 31, 2005, we held for contribution to a co investment joint venture one industrial building with an aggregate net book value of $32.8 million, which, when contributed to the joint venture, will reduce our current ownership interest from approximately 98% to an expected range of 20 50%. This asset is not being held for divestiture under SFAS No. 144. Properties Held for Divestiture. As of December 31, 2005, we held for divestiture five industrial buildings and one undeveloped land parcel, which are not in our core markets, do not meet our current strategic objectives or which we have included as part of our development for sale program. The divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. As of December 31, 2005, the net carrying value of the properties held for divestiture was $17.9 million. Expected net sales proceeds exceed the net carrying value of the properties. Co investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund certain acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. We generally consolidate these joint ventures for financial reporting purposes because they are not variable interest entities and because we are the sole managing general partner and control all major operating decisions. However, in certain cases, our co investment joint ventures are unconsolidated because we do not control all major operating decisions. Third party equity interests in the joint ventures are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2005, we owned approximately 54.8 million square feet of our 50 Table of Contents properties (47.7% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so.

We, in turn, used those proceeds to redeem all 3,995,800 of our 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for $100.2 million, including all accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, to the redemption date. On November 25, 2003, we issued and sold 2,300,000 shares of 6.75% Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at $25.00 per share.

On September 24, 2004, AMB Property II, L.P., a partnership in which Texas AMB I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and our indirect subsidiary, owns an approximate 1.0% general partnership interest and the operating partnership owns an approximate 99% common limited partnership interest, issued 729,582 5.0% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units at a price of $50.00 per unit. The series N preferred units were issued to Robert Pattillo Properties, Inc. in exchange for the contribution of certain parcels of land that are located in multiple markets to AMB Property II, L.P. Effective January 27, 2006, Robert Pattillo Properties, Inc. exercised its rights under its Put Agreement, dated September 24, 2004, with the operating partnership, and sold all of its series N preferred units to the operating partnership at a price equal to $50.00 per unit, plus all accrued and unpaid distributions to the date of such sale. Also on January 27, 2006, AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased all of the series N preferred units from the operating partnership at a price equal to $50.00 per unit, plus all accrued and unpaid distributions to the date of such sale and cancelled all of the outstanding series N preferred units as of such date. As of December 31, 2005, $142.8 million in preferred units with a weighted average rate of 7.87%, issued by the operating partnership, were callable under the terms of the partnership agreement and $102.0 million in preferred units with a weighted average rate of 6.9% become callable in 2006. In December 2005, our board of directors approved a new two year common stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of our common stock. We did not repurchase or retire any shares of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2005. Debt. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, we presently intend to operate with an our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio of approximately 45% or less. As of December 31, 2005, our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio was 34.7%. (See footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratios table below for our definitions of our share of total market capitalization, market equity and our share of total debt.) However, we typically finance our consolidated co investment joint ventures with secured debt at a loan to 52 Table of Contents value ratio of 50 65% per our joint venture partnership agreements. Additionally, we currently intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these policies, however, our organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our management could alter or eliminate these policies without stockholder approval or circumstances could arise that could render us unable to comply with these policies. As of December 31, 2005, the aggregate principal amount of our secured debt was $1.9 billion, excluding unamortized debt premiums of $12.0 million. Of the $1.9 billion of secured debt, $1.4 billion is secured by properties in our joint ventures. The secured debt is generally non recourse and bears interest at rates varying from 0.6% to 10.4% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 5.7%) and final maturity dates ranging from January 2006 to January 2025. As of December 31, 2005, $1.6 billion of the secured debt obligations bears interest at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% while the remaining $291.7 million bears interest at variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 2.1%). As of December 31, 2005, the operating partnership had outstanding an aggregate of $975.0 million in unsecured senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 6.2% and had an average term of 5.2 years. These unsecured senior debt securities include $300.0 million in notes issued in June 1998, $250.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2000 medium term note program, $325.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2002 medium term note program, and approximately $112.5 million of 5.094% Notes Due 2015, which were issued to Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America on July 11, 2005 in a private placement, in exchange for the cancellation of $100 million of notes that were issued in June 1998 resulting in a discount of approximately $12.5 million. The unsecured senior debt securities are subject to various covenants. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to its senior debt securities. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then our cash flow may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Credit Facilities. On June 1, 2004, the operating partnership completed the early renewal of its senior unsecured revolving line of credit in the amount of $500.0 million. We remain a guarantor of the operating partnerships obligations under the credit facility. The three year credit facility includes a multi currency component under which up to $250.0 million can be drawn in Yen, Euros or British Pounds Sterling. The line, which matures in June 2007 and carries a one year extension option, can be increased up to $700.0 million upon certain conditions, and replaces the operating partnerships previous $500.0 million credit facility that was to mature in December 2005. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the operating partnerships long term debt rating, which is currently 60 basis points with an annual facility fee of 20 basis points, based on the current credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt. The operating partnership uses its unsecured credit facility principally for acquisitions, funding development activity and general working capital requirements. The total amount available under the credit facility fluctuates based upon the borrowing base, as defined in the agreement governing the credit facility, which is generally based upon the value of our unencumbered properties. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding balance on the credit facility was $216.8 million and the remaining amount available was $244.8 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $38.4 million (excluding the additional $200.0 million of potential additional capacity). The outstanding balance included borrowings denominated in Euros and Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, would equal approximately $173.1 million and $43.7 million in U.S. dollars, respectively. On June 29, 2004, AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating partnership, entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement providing for loans or letters of credit. On December 8, 2005, the unsecured revolving credit agreement was amended to increase the maximum principal amount outstanding at 53 Table of Contents any time to up to 35.0 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, equaled approximately $297.2 million U.S. dollars, and can be increased to up to 40.0 billion Yen upon certain conditions. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K. under the revolving credit facility, as well as the obligations of any other entity in which the operating partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest, and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the revolving credit agreement. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and for other real estate purposes in Japan. Generally, borrowers under the revolving credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the revolving credit facility with certain real estate assets or equity in entities holding such real estate assets. The revolving credit facility matures in June 2007 and has a one year extension option, which is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.25% of the outstanding commitments under the facility at that time. The rate on the borrowings is generally TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the current credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt and is currently 60 basis points. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, payable in quarterly amounts, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt, and is currently 20 basis points of the outstanding commitments under the facility. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, was $205.8 million in U.S. dollars. On November 24, 2004, AMB Tokai TMK, a Japanese subsidiary of the operating partnership, entered into a secured multi advance project financing, providing for loans in a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of up to 20.0 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, would equal approximately $169.9 million U.S. dollars. The financing agreement is among AMB Tokai TMK, us, the operating partnership, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and a syndicate of banks. We, along with the operating partnership, jointly and severally guarantee AMB Tokai TMKs obligations under the financing agreement, pursuant to a guaranty of payment executed in connection with the project financing. The financing is secured by a mortgage on certain real property located in Tokai, Tokyo, Japan, and matures on October 31, 2006 with a one year extension option. The rate on the borrowings will generally be TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt and is currently 60 basis points per annum, except that AMB Tokai TMK has purchased from Sumitomo an interest rate swap, which has fixed the interest rate payable on a principal amount equal to 13.0 billion Yen at 1.32% per annum plus the applicable margin. In addition, there is an annual commitment fee based on unused commitments, payable quarterly, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt, and is currently 20 basis points of the amount of unused commitments. The financing agreement contains affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. In addition, Sumitomo, AMB Tokai TMK and the operating partnership signed a commitment letter on November 24, 2004, pursuant to which Sumitomo committed to purchase bonds that may be issued by AMB Tokai TMK in an amount between 10.0 billion Yen and 15.0 billion Yen (such amount to be determined by AMB Tokai TMK). The bonds would be secured by the AMB Ohta Distribution Center and would generally accrue interest at a rate of TIBOR plus 1.10% per annum; because the swap purchased by AMB Tokai TMK from Sumitomo is coterminous with the maturity date of the proposed bonds, AMB Tokai TMK will have fixed the interest rate payable on, in general, a principal amount equal to 13.0 billion Yen at 2.42% per annum. The bonds, if issued, would mature on October 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding balance on this financing agreement was 19.5 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, equaled approximately $165.6 million U.S. dollars and is accounted for as wholly owned secured debt. On February 16, 2006, the operating partnership and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries entered into a third amended and restated credit agreement for a $250 million unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility with a maturity date of February 2010, that replaced the then existing $100 million unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility that was to mature in June 2008. As of December 31, 2005, we had an additional outstanding balance of $67.5 million under the then existing facility. 54 Table of Contents Mortgages Receivable. Through a wholly owned subsidiary, we hold a mortgage loan receivable on AMB Pier One, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture. The note bears interest at 13.0% and matures in May 2026. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding balance on the note was $12.8 million. We also hold a loan receivable on G. Accion, an unconsolidated joint venture totaling $8.8 million with an interest rate of 10.0%. The loan matures in November 2006.

Liquidity As of December 31, 2005, we had $232.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and $368.8 million of additional available borrowings under our credit facilities. As of December 31, 2005, we had $34.4 million in restricted cash. Our board of directors declared a regular cash dividend for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 of $0.44 per share of common stock, and the operating partnership announced its intention to pay a regular cash distribution for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 of $0.44 per common unit. The dividends and distributions were payable on January 6, 2006 to stockholders and unitholders of record on December 22, 2005. The series L and M preferred stock dividends were payable on January 16, 2006 to stockholders of record on January 6, 2006. The series E, F, J and K preferred unit quarterly distributions were payable on January 15, 2006. The series O preferred stock dividends are payable on April 15, 2006. The series D, H, I and N preferred unit quarterly distributions were paid on December 25, 2005.

The anticipated size of our distributions, using only cash from operations, will not allow us to retire all of our debt as it comes due. Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would 57 Table of Contents adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Commitments Developments. In addition to recurring capital expenditures, which consist of building improvements and leasing costs incurred to renew or re tenant space, during 2005, we initiated 30 new industrial development projects in North America, Europe and Asia with a total estimated investment of $522.4 million, aggregating an estimated 7.0 million square feet. As of December 31, 2005, we had 47 projects in our development pipeline representing a total estimated investment of $1.1 billion upon completion, of which two industrial projects with a total of 0.3 million square feet and an aggregate estimated investment of $24.5 million upon completion are held in unconsolidated joint ventures. In addition, we held one development project available for sale or contribution, representing a total estimated investment of $32.8 million upon completion. Of the total development pipeline, $681.4 million had been funded as of December 31, 2005 and an estimated $405.2 million was required to complete current and planned projects. We expect to fund these expenditures with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances, net proceeds from property divestitures and private capital from co investment partners, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow. Acquisitions. During 2005, we acquired 41 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet for a total expected investment of $555.0 million, including two buildings that were acquired by two of our unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. Additional acquisition activity in 2005 included the purchase of an approximate 43% unconsolidated equity interest in G.Accion, one of Mexicos largest real estate companies, for $46.1 million. We generally fund our acquisitions through private capital contributions, borrowings under our credit facility, cash, debt issuances and net proceeds from property divestitures. Lease Commitments. We have entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily on tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms from one to 57 years. These operating lease payments are amortized ratably over the terms of the related leases. Future minimum rental payments required under non cancelable operating leases in effect as of December 31, 2005 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2006 $ 20,894 2007 21,036 2008 20,617 2009 20,327 2010 19,997 Thereafter 278,759 Total $ 381,630 Co investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. As of December 31, 2005, we had investments in co investment joint ventures with a gross book value of $2.5 billion, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, and net equity investments in two unconsolidated co investment joint ventures of $26.3 million. As of December 31, 2005, we may make additional capital contributions to current and planned co investment joint ventures of up to $133.7 million (using the exchange rates at December 31, 2005). From time to time, we may raise additional equity commitments for AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open ended consolidated co investment joint venture formed in 2004 with institutional investors, which invest through a private real estate investment trust. This would increase our obligation to make additional capital commitments. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of this fund, we are obligated to contribute 20% of the total equity commitments to the fund until such time our total equity commitment is greater than 58 Table of Contents $150.0 million, at which time, our obligation is reduced to 10% of the total equity commitments. We expect to fund these contributions with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances or net proceeds from property divestitures, which could adversely effect our cash flow. Captive Insurance Company. In December 2001, we formed a wholly owned captive insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., which provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the deductible under our third party policies. We capitalized Arcata National Insurance Ltd. in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata National Insurance Ltd. established annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss experience of our properties. Annually, we engage an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims, related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata National Insurance Ltd. may be adjusted based on this estimate. Premiums paid to Arcata National Insurance Ltd. have a retrospective component, so that if expenses, including losses, deductibles and reserves, are less than premiums collected, the excess may be returned to the property owners (and, in turn, as appropriate, to the customers) and, conversely, subject to certain limitations, if expenses, including losses, deductibles and reserves, are greater than premiums collected, an additional premium will be charged. As with all recoverable expenses, differences between estimated and actual insurance premiums are recognized in the subsequent year. Through this structure, we believe that we have more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market. Potential Unknown Liabilities. Unknown liabilities may include the following: liabilities for clean up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to our formation transactions that had not been asserted prior to our formation transactions; accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; tax liabilities; and claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these entities. Overview of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our debt, interest and lease payments due by period as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands): Less than More than Contractual Obligations 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Total Debt $ 235,911 $ 1,031,938 $ 665,634 $ 1,456,094 $ 3,389,577 Debt interest payments 14,459 46,749 37,056 83,106 181,370 Operating lease commitments 20,894 41,653 49,324 278,759 381,630 Construction commitments 136,600 136,600 Total $ 271,264 $ 1,256,940 $ 743,014 $ 1,817,959 $ 4,089,177 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Standby Letters of Credit. As of December 31, 2005, we had provided approximately $48.7 million in letters of credit, of which $38.4 million was provided under the operating partnerships $500.0 million unsecured credit facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other commitments. Guarantees. As of December 31, 2005, we had outstanding guarantees in the aggregate amount of $128.2 million in connection with certain acquisitions. As of December 31, 2005, we guaranteed $23.4 million 59 Table of Contents and $2.3 million on outstanding loans on two of our consolidated joint ventures and one of our unconsolidated joint ventures, respectively. Performance and Surety Bonds. As of December 31, 2005, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $0.9 million. These bonds were issued in connection with certain of its development projects and were posted to guarantee certain tax obligations and the construction of certain real property improvements and infrastructure, such as grading, sewers and streets. Performance and surety bonds are commonly required by public agencies from real estate developers. Performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the taxes due or the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. Promoted Interests and Other Contractual Obligations. Upon the achievement of certain return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, we may be obligated to make payments to certain of joint venture partners pursuant to the terms and provisions of their contractual agreements with us. From time to time in the normal course of our business, we enter into various contracts with third parties that may obligate us to make payments or perform other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. SUPPLEMENTAL EARNINGS MEASURES FFO. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider funds from operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. FFO is defined as net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, less gains (or losses) from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estate related depreciation, and adjustments to derive our pro rata share of FFO of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. Further, we do not adjust FFO to eliminate the effects of non recurring charges. We believe that FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. We believe that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. 60 Table of Contents The following table reflects the calculation of FFO reconciled from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands): 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Net income(1) $ 257,807 $ 125,471 $ 129,128 $ 121,119 $ 136,200 Gains from dispositions of real estate, net of minority interests(2) (132,652 ) (47,224 ) (50,325 ) (19,383 ) (41,859 ) Real estate, related depreciation and amortization: Total depreciation and amortization 165,438 141,120 116,067 107,097 90,527 Discontinued operations depreciation 14,866 26,230 26,270 29,406 23,016 Non real estate depreciation (3,388 ) (871 ) (720 ) (712 ) (731 ) Ground lease amortization (2,301 ) (1,232 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from consolidated joint ventures: Joint venture partners minority interests (Net income) 36,398 29,544 21,015 15,112 11,288 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Net income) 3,681 2,615 2,378 3,572 4,836 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Development profits) 2,262 435 344 57 764 Discontinued operations minority interests (Net income) 8,502 13,549 16,214 17,745 17,595 FFO attributable to minority interests (100,275 ) (80,192 ) (65,603 ) (52,051 ) (40,144 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures: Our share of net income (10,770 ) (3,781 ) (5,445 ) (5,674 ) (5,467 ) Our share of FFO 14,441 7,549 9,755 9,291 8,014 Our share of development profits, net of taxes 5,441 Preferred stock dividends (7,388 ) (7,131 ) (6,999 ) (8,496 ) (8,500 ) Preferred stock and unit redemption discount (issuance costs) (5,413 ) 412 (7,600 ) Funds from operations $ 254,363 $ 207,314 $ 186,666 $ 215,194 $ 186,707 Basic FFO per common share and unit $ 2.87 $ 2.39 $ 2.17 $ 2.44 $ 2.09 Diluted FFO per common share and unit $ 2.75 $ 2.30 $ 2.13 $ 2.40 $ 2.07 Weighted average common shares and units: Basic 88,684,262 86,885,250 85,859,899 88,204,208 89,286,379 Diluted 92,508,725 90,120,250 87,616,365 89,689,310 90,325,801 61 Table of Contents (1) Includes gains from undepreciated land sales of $25.0 million, $3.7 million and $1.2 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. (2) 2005 includes accumulated depreciation re capture of approximately $1.1 million associated with the sale of the Interstate Crossdock redevelopment project. SS NOI. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider same store net operating income (SS NOI) to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. For properties that are considered part of the same store pool, see Part I, Item 2: Properties Industrial Properties Industrial Market Operating Statistics, Note 5, and Operating and Leasing Statistics Industrial Same Store Operating Statistics, Note 1. In deriving SS NOI, we define NOI as rental revenues (as calculated in accordance with GAAP), including reimbursements, less straight line rents, property operating expenses and real estate taxes. We exclude straight line rents in calculating SS NOI because we believe it provides a better measure of actual cash basis rental growth for a year over year comparison. In addition, we believe that SS NOI helps the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate as compared to other companies. While SS NOI is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. SS NOI also does not reflect general and administrative expenses, interest expenses, depreciation and amortization costs, capital expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development and construction activities that could materially impact our results from operations. Further, our computation of SS NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating SS NOI. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices, interest rates and international exchange rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings and our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2005, we had two outstanding interest rate swaps with aggregate notional amount of $119.5 million (in U.S. dollars). See Financial Instruments below. The table below summarizes the market risks associated with our fixed and variable rate debt outstanding before unamortized debt premiums of $12.0 million as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands): 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total Fixed rate debt(1) $ 165,953 $ 129,214 $ 374,174 $ 190,548 $ 437,934 $ 1,260,015 $ 2,557,838 Average interest rate 6.9 % 7.2 % 6.9 % 5.0 % 6.1 % 6.3 % 6.3 % Variable rate debt(2) $ 69,958 $ 439,944 $ 88,606 $ 36,140 $ 1,012 $ 196,079 $ 831,739 Average interest rate 4.3 % 2.2 % 2.2 % 2.2 % 2.0 % 1.9 % 2.3 % Interest Payments $ 14,459 $ 18,982 $ 27,767 $ 10,322 $ 26,734 $ 83,106 $ 181,370 (1) Represents 75.5% of all outstanding debt. (2) Represents 24.5% of all outstanding debt. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased or decreased by 10%, then the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would be $1.9 million annually. As of December 31, 2005, the book value and the estimated fair value of our total consolidated debt (both secured and unsecured) was $3.4 billion based on our estimate of current market interest rates. 62 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, variable rate debt comprised 24.5% and 15.3%, respectively, of all our outstanding debt. Variable rate debt was $831.7 million and $498.3 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. The increase is primarily due to higher outstanding balances on our credit facilities. This increase in our outstanding variable rate debt increases our risk associated with unfavorable interest rate fluctuations. Financial Instruments. We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income or income. For revenues or expenses denominated in non functional currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments in effect at December 31, 2005 were two interest rate swaps hedging cash flows of our variable rate borrowings based on Euribor (Europe) and Japanese TIBOR (Japan) and two put options hedging against adverse foreign fluctuations of the Mexican Peso and the Euro against the U.S. dollar.

Our exposure to market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries operating in the United States and Mexico. The functional currency for our subsidiaries operating outside North America is generally the local currency of the country in which the entity is located, mitigating the effect of foreign exchange gains and losses. Our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement 63 Table of Contents date. We translate income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. The losses resulting from the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity and totaled $1.8 million for year ended December 31, 2005. Our international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. In these instances, non monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2005, gains from remeasurement and the sale of one foreign exchange agreement included in our results of operations totaled $0.6 million. We also record gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated. We believe that these gains or losses are immaterial.

Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, Mortgage and Loan Receivables and Other Investments: As of December 31, 2005, we held interests in 12 equity investment joint ventures that are not consolidated in our financial statements. The management and control over significant aspects of these investments are held by the third party joint venture partners and we are not the primary beneficiary for the investments that meet the variable interest entity consolidation criteria under FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.

Secured Debt As of December 31, 2005, we had $1.9 billion of secured indebtedness, net of unamortized premiums, secured by deeds of trust or mortgages. As of December 31, 2005, the total gross consolidated investment value of those properties securing the debt was $3.6 billion. Of the $1.9 billion of secured indebtedness, $1.4 billion was joint venture debt secured by properties with a gross investment value of $2.5 billion.

(2) Basic and diluted net income per weighted average share equals the net income available to common stockholders divided by 84,048,936 and 87,873,399 shares, respectively, for 2005; 82,133,627 and 85,368,626 shares, respectively, for 2004; 81,096,062 and 82,852,528 shares, respectively, for 2003; 83,310,885 and 84,795,987 shares, respectively, for 2002; 84,174,644 and 85,214,066 shares, respectively, for 2001. (3) Our share of total debt is the pro rata portion of the total debt based on our percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated ventures holding the debt. We believe that our share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze our leverage and to compare our leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of our debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their joint ventures. Our share of total debt is not intended to reflect our actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures. For a reconciliation of our share of total debt to total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure, please see the table of debt maturities and capitalization in Part II, Item 7: Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources. 38 Table of Contents Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations GENERAL You should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements. We commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company effective with the completion of our initial public offering on November 26, 1997, and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with our initial tax return for the year ended December 31, 1997. AMB Property Corporation and AMB Property, L.P. were formed shortly before the consummation of our initial public offering. Managements Overview The primary source of our revenue and earnings is rent received from customers under long term (generally three to ten years) operating leases at our properties, including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs, and from partnership distributions and fees from our private capital business. We also produce earnings from the strategic disposition of operating assets, from the disposition of projects in our development for sale or contribution program and from contributions of properties to our co investment joint ventures. Our long term growth is driven by our ability to maintain and increase occupancy rates or increase rental rates at our properties, and by our ability to continue to acquire and develop new properties. National industrial markets improved during 2005 when compared with market conditions in 2004. According to Torto Wheaton Research, the positive trend in demand began in the second quarter of 2004 and reversed 14 prior quarters of negatively trending, or rising, space availability. We believe the protracted period of rising availability created a difficult national leasing environment which is now improving, particularly in large industrial property markets tied to global trade. During the three and a half year period of negatively trending industrial space availability, investor demand for industrial property (as supported by our observation of strong national sales volumes and declining acquisition capitalization rates) remained consistently strong. We believe we capitalized on the demand for acquisition property by accelerating the repositioning of our portfolio through the disposition of non core properties. We plan to continue selling selected assets on an opportunistic basis but believe we have substantially achieved our repositioning goals.

(2) Our total other markets include other domestic target markets, other non target markets, international target markets and retail. We observed two positive trends nationally for industrial real estate during the year ended December 31, 2005, supported by data provided by Torto Wheaton Research. First, national industrial space availability 39 Table of Contents declined 130 basis points during the year from 10.9% to 9.6%. The availability rate has fallen for seven consecutive quarters, reversing the trend of the prior 14 quarters in which national industrial space availability increased on average 36 basis points per quarter. Second, national absorption of industrial space, defined as the net change in occupied stock as measured by square feet of completions less the change in available square feet, totaled approximately 281 million square feet in the year ended December 31, 2005, substantially exceeding the 183 million square feet of space absorbed in 2004 and well above the previous ten year historical average of 139 million square feet of space absorbed annually. In this improved environment, our industrial portfolios occupancy levels increased to 95.8% at December 31, 2005 from 94.8% at December 31, 2004, which we believe reflects higher levels of demand for industrial space generally and in our portfolio specifically. During the year ended December 31, 2005, our lease expirations totaled approximately 17.6 million square feet while commencements of new or renewed leases totaled approximately 21.3 million square feet, resulting in an increase in our occupancy level of approximately 100 basis points. Rental rates on industrial renewals and rollovers in our portfolio decreased 9.7% during the year ended December 31, 2005 as leases were entered into or renewed at rates consistent with what we believe to be current market levels. We believe this decline in rents on lease renewals and rollovers reflects trends in national industrial space availability. We believe that relatively high levels of national industrial space availability have caused market rents for industrial properties to decline between 10% and 20% from their peak levels in 2001 based on our research data; 42.5% of the space that rolled over in our portfolio in 2005 had commenced between 1999 and 2001. Rental rates in our portfolio declined at successively lower rates in each of the last three quarters during 2005, which we believe indicates a stabilization of market rental rate levels. While the level of rental rate reduction varied by market, we achieved occupancy levels in our portfolio 540 basis points in excess of the national industrial market, as determined by Torto Wheaton Research, by pricing lease renewals and new leases with sensitivity to local market conditions. During periods of decreasing or stabilizing rental rates, we strove to sign leases with shorter terms to prevent locking in lower rent levels for long periods and to be prepared to sign new, longer term leases during periods of growing rental rates. When we sign leases of shorter duration, we attempt to limit overall leasing costs and capital expenditures by offering different grades of tenant improvement packages, appropriate to the lease term. We expect development to be a significant driver of our earnings growth as we expand our land and development pipeline, and contribute completed development projects into our co investment program and recognize development profits. We believe that development, renovation and expansion of well located, high quality industrial properties should generally continue to provide us with attractive investment opportunities at a higher rate of return than we may obtain from the purchase of existing properties. We believe that our development opportunities in Mexico and Japan are particularly attractive given the current lack of supply of modern industrial distribution facilities in the major metropolitan markets of these countries. Globally, we have increased our development pipeline from $106.8 million at the end of 2002 to approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2005. In addition to our committed development pipeline, we hold a total of 1,307 acres for future development or sale. We believe these 1,307 acres of land could support approximately 24.3 million square feet of future development. Going forward, we believe that our co investment program with private capital investors will continue to serve as a significant source of revenues and capital for acquisitions. Through these co investment joint ventures, we typically earn acquisition and development fees, asset management fees and priority distributions, as well as promoted interests and incentive distributions based on the performance of the co investment joint ventures; however, we can not assure you that we will continue to do so. Through contribution of development properties to our co investment joint ventures, we expect to recognize value creation from our development pipeline. As of December 31, 2005, we owned approximately 54.8 million square feet of our properties (47.7% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these co investment joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. 40 Table of Contents By the end of 2007, we plan to have approximately 15% of our operating portfolio (based on both consolidated and unconsolidated annualized base rent) invested in international markets. Our North American target markets outside of the United States currently include Guadalajara, Mexico City, Monterrey and Toronto. Our European target markets currently include Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt, Hamburg, London, Lyon, Madrid, Milan and Paris. Our Asian target markets currently include Beijing, Busan, Nagoya, Osaka, the Pearl River Delta, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore and Tokyo. It is possible that our target markets will change over time to reflect experience, market opportunities, customer needs and changes in global distribution patterns. As of December 31, 2005, our international operating properties comprised 7.1% of our annualized base rents, including properties owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust, we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income. As a result, we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our on going operations to the same extent that other corporations that are not real estate investment trusts can. We must continue to raise capital in both the debt and equity markets to fund our working capital needs, acquisitions and developments. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for a complete discussion of the sources of our capital. Summary of Key Transactions in 2005 During the year ended December 31, 2005, we completed the following significant capital deployment transactions: Acquired 41 buildings in North America, Europe and Asia, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet, for $555.0 million, including two buildings that were acquired by two of our unconsolidated co investment joint ventures; Acquired an approximate 43% unconsolidated equity interest in G.Accion, one of Mexicos largest real estate companies for $46.1 million; Committed to 30 development projects in North America, Europe and Asia totaling 7.0 million square feet with an estimated total investment of approximately $522.4 million; Acquired 341 acres of land for industrial warehouse development in North America, Europe and Asia for approximately $193.9 million; Sold five land parcels and five development projects available for sale, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet, for an aggregate price of approximately $155.2 million; and Divested ourselves of 142 industrial buildings and one retail center aggregating approximately 9.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of approximately $926.6 million. Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Alliance Fund I for $618.5 million. The multi investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. We received cash and a distribution of an on tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund. We also received a net incentive distribution of approximately $26.4 million in cash. See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our acquisition, development and disposition activity. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we completed the following significant capital markets and other financing transactions: Formed an unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., with planned investment of capacity of approximately 247.3 billion Yen ($2.1 billion U.S. dollars, using exchange rate at December 31, 2005). We contributed $106.9 million (using exchange rate in effect at contribution) of operating properties to the fund; Contributed an industrial property for $23.6 million to AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, an unconsolidated co investment joint venture; 41 Table of Contents Obtained $69.7 million of debt (using exchange rates in effect at applicable quarter end dates) with a weighted average interest rate of 3.8% for international acquisitions; Assumed $62.8 million of debt for our consolidated co investment joint ventures at a weighted average interest rate of 7.4%; Obtained long term secured debt financings for our co investment joint ventures of $139.7 million with a weighted average rate of 5.4%; Exchanged $100.0 million of 6.9% Reset Put Securities for approximately $112.5 million of 5.094% Notes due 2015; Raised $72.3 million in net proceeds from the issuance of $75.0 million of our 7.0% Series O Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock; and Issued $175.0 million of unsecured senior debt securities due 2010. See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 6, 9 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our capital markets transactions. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Investments in Real Estate. Investments in real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. We also record at acquisition an intangible asset or liability for the value attributable to above or below market leases, in place leases and lease origination costs for all acquisitions. Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a property by property basis quarterly and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable. Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying amount of the property. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future market conditions and the availability of capital. Examples of certain situations that could affect future cash flows of a property may include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in occupancy; unforeseen bankruptcy, lease termination and move out of a major customer; or a significant decrease in annual base rents of that property. If impairment analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying amount of our long lived assets could occur in the future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings. Revenue Recognition. We record rental revenue from operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts, security deposits and letters of credit, then we may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our customers on an on going basis by reviewing their financial condition periodically as appropriate. Each period we review our outstanding accounts receivable, including straight line rents, for doubtful accounts and 42 Table of Contents provide allowances as needed. We also record lease termination fees when a customer has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us. If a customer remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement, the applicable termination fees are deferred and recognized over the term of such customers occupancy. Property Dispositions. We report real estate dispositions in three separate categories on our consolidated statements of operations. First, when we divest a portion of our interests in real estate entities or properties, gains from the sale represent the interests acquired by third party investors for cash. Second, we dispose of value added conversion projects and build to suit and speculative development projects for which we have not generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable. Lastly, beginning in 2002, SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, required us to separately report as discontinued operations the historical operating results attributable to operating properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the properties. The consolidated statements of operations for prior periods are also adjusted to conform with this classification. There is no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial position, net income or cash flows. In all cases, gains and losses are recognized using the full accrual method of accounting. Gains relating to transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met. Joint Ventures. We hold interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We determine consolidation based on standards set forth in EITF 96 16, Investors Accounting for an Investee When the Investor Has a Majority of the Voting Interest but the Minority Shareholder or Shareholders Have Certain Approval or Veto Rights, Statement of Position 78 9, Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures and FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN 46. Based on the guidance set forth in these pronouncements, we consolidate certain joint venture investments because we exercise significant control over major operating decisions, such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, asset management, investment activity and changes in financing. For joint ventures that are variable interest entities as defined under FIN 46 where we are not the primary beneficiaries, we do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. For joint ventures where we do not exercise significant control over major operating and management decisions, but where we exercise significant influence, we use the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. In June 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued EITF 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights. Under this consensus, a sole general partner is presumed to control a limited partnership (or similar entity) and should consolidate that entity unless the limited partners possess kick out rights or other substantive participating rights as described in EITF 96 16, Investors Accounting for an Investee When the Investor has a Majority of the Voting Interest but the Minority Shareholder or Shareholders Have Certain Approval or Veto rights. As of June 29, 2005, this consensus was effective immediately for all new or modified agreements, and effective beginning in the first reporting period that ends after December 15, 2005 for all existing agreements. We adopted the consolidation requirements of this consensus in the third quarter 2005 for all new or modified agreements and will adopt the consensus for existing agreements in the first quarter of 2006. There was not a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows upon the adoption of the consolidation requirements of this consensus for all new or modified agreements. We do not believe that there will be a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, upon adopting the consensus for existing agreements. Real Estate Investment Trust. As a real estate investment trust, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes in the U.S. if we meet minimum distribution, income, asset and shareholder tests. However, some of our subsidiaries may be subject to federal and state taxes. In addition, foreign entities may also be subject to the taxes of the host country. An income tax allocation is required to be estimated on our taxable income arising from our taxable REIT subsidiaries and international entities. A deferred tax component could arise based upon the differences in GAAP versus tax income for items such as 43 Table of Contents depreciation and gain recognition. However, we believe deferred tax is an immaterial component of our consolidated balance sheet. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The analysis below includes changes attributable to same store growth, acquisitions, development activity and divestitures. Same store properties are those that we owned during both the current and prior year reporting periods, excluding development properties stabilized after December 31, 2003 (generally defined as properties that are 90% leased or properties for which we have held a certificate of occupancy or where building has been substantially complete for at least 12 months). As of December 31, 2005, same store industrial properties consisted of properties aggregating approximately 72.5 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. During 2005, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 150 buildings, aggregating approximately 10.6 million square feet. In 2004, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 29 industrial buildings, two retail centers and one office, aggregating approximately 4.4 million square feet. Our future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition of additional properties and dispositions. Our future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical results.

These decreases were partially offset by increased occupancy. Industrial same store occupancy was 95.6% at December 31, 2005 and 95.2% at December 31, 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005, rents in the same store portfolio decreased 9.8% on industrial renewals and rollovers (cash basis) on 13.0 million square feet leased due to decreases in market rates. The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2004 and 2005, we continued to acquire properties in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial revenues. The increase in private capital income of $31.0 million was primarily due to incentive distributions for 2005 of $26.4 million for the sale of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, asset 44 Table of Contents management priority distributions from AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., and acquisition fees from AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P.

The 2004 acquisitions consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. The 2005 acquisitions consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2004 and 2005, we continued to acquire properties in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial operating costs. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase of $17.0 million in personnel costs related to additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international and development expansions, and an increase of $1.5 million due to the expansion of satellite offices. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our consolidated co investment joint ventures.

The increase in interest and other income was primarily due to increased bank interest income and a $1.0 million other fee. The 2005 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted primarily from our contribution of $106.9 million (using exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties to our newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. The 2004 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted from our contribution of $71.5 million in operating properties to our unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC. Development profits represent gains from the sale of development projects and land as part of our development for sale program. The increase in development profits was due to increased volume in 2005. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $1.9 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. During 2004, we sold seven land parcels and six development projects as part of our development for sale program, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet for an aggregate price of $40.4 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $6.5 million. During 2004, we also contributed one completed development project into a newly formed unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $2.0 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash.

Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Alliance Fund I for $618.5 million. The multi investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. We received cash and a distribution of an on tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund. During 2004, we divested ourselves of 21 industrial buildings, two retail centers and one office building, aggregating approximately 3.1 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $200.3 million, with a resulting net gain of $42.0 million.

The increase in preferred stock dividends is due to the newly issued shares. 46 Table of Contents For the Years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 (dollars in millions) Revenues 2004 2003 $ Change % Change Rental revenues U.S. industrial: Same store $ 514.1 $ 485.4 $ 28.7 5.9 % 2004 acquisitions 25.2 25.2 % Development 6.2 6.9 (0.7 ) (10.1 )% Other industrial 7.7 4.4 3.3 75.0 % International industrial 25.2 6.1 19.1 313.1 % Retail 1.1 0.9 0.2 22.2 % Total rental revenues 579.5 503.7 75.8 15.0 % Private capital income 12.9 13.3 (0.4 ) (3.0 )% Total revenues $ 592.4 $ 517.0 $ 75.4 14.6 % The increase in U.S. industrial same store rental revenues was primarily driven by increased lease termination fees. Industrial same store occupancy was 95.2% at December 31, 2004 and 93.0% at December 31, 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2004, rents in the same store portfolio decreased 14.7% on industrial renewals and rollovers (cash basis) on 16.2 million square feet leased due to decreases in market rates. The properties acquired during 2003 consisted of 82 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.5 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2003 and 2004, we continued to acquire properties in France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial revenues. The decrease in private capital income was due to greater incentive fees earned in the prior year.

The 2004 acquisitions consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2003 and 2004, we continued to acquire properties in France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial property operating costs. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The 2003 impairment loss was on investments in real estate and leasehold interests. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased stock based compensation expense of $2.3 million and additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international and development expansions. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our co investment joint ventures. The increase in fund costs was due to additional formation of co investment joint ventures in 2004.

This decrease was offset by the receipt of a lease termination fee at a property in Chicago in the first quarter of 2004. The gains from dispositions of real estate (not classified as discontinued operations) in 2004, resulted from our contribution of $71.5 million in operating properties to our newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC. The gains from disposition of real estate (not classified as discontinued operations) in 2003, resulted from our contribution of $94.0 million in operating properties to our unconsolidated co investment joint venture, Industrial Fund I, LLC. Development profits represent gains from sales from our development for sale and contribution program. During 2004, we sold seven land parcels and six development projects as part of our development for sale program, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet for an aggregate price of $40.4 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $6.5 million. During 2004, we also contributed one completed development project into a newly formed unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $2.0 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. During 2003, we sold seven development for sale and other projects, for an aggregate price of $74.8 million, with a resulting gain of $14.4 million, net of taxes. The increase in interest expense, including amortization, was due to the issuance of additional unsecured debt under our 2002 medium term note program, increased borrowings on the unsecured credit facilities and additional secured debt borrowings in our co investment joint ventures.

During 2003, we divested ourselves of 24 industrial buildings and two retail centers, aggregating approximately 2.8 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $272.3 million, with a resulting net gain of $42.9 million.

In addition, on November 26, 2003, the operating partnership redeemed all 1,300,000 of its outstanding 85/8% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Partnership Units and we recognized a reduction of income available to common stockholders of $1.7 million for the original issuance costs. In June and November 2003, we issued 2,000,000 shares of 6.5% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and 2,300,000 shares of 6.75% Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, respectively. The timing of the newly issued shares contributed to the increase in preferred stock dividends. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Balance Sheet Strategy. In general, we use unsecured lines of credit, unsecured notes, preferred stock and common equity (issued by us and or the operating partnership and its subsidiaries) to capitalize our 100% owned assets. Over time, we plan to retire non recourse, secured debt encumbering our 100% owned assets and replace that debt with unsecured notes. In managing our co investment joint ventures, in general, we use non recourse, secured debt to capitalize our co investment joint ventures. We currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for acquisitions, development, expansion and renovation of properties will include: retained earnings and cash flow from operations; borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities; other forms of secured or unsecured financing; proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the operating partnership (including issuances of limited partnership units in the operating partnership or its subsidiaries); net proceeds from divestitures of properties; private capital contributions from co investment partners; and net proceeds from contribution of properties and completed development projects to our co investment joint ventures. We currently expect that our principal funding requirements will include: working capital; development, expansion and renovation of properties; acquisitions, including our global expansion; debt service; and dividends and distributions on outstanding common and preferred stock and limited partnership units. 49 Table of Contents We believe that our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow from operations, borrowings available under our unsecured credit facilities and our ability to access private and public debt and equity capital, are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Resources Dispositions of Real Estate Interests. During 2005, we recognized a gain of $1.3 million from disposition of real estate interests, representing the additional value received from the contribution of properties in 2004 to AMB SGP Mexico, LLC. During 2005, we contributed $106.9 million (using exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties, consisting of six industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet, to our newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. We recognized a total gain of $17.8 million on the contribution, representing the partial sale of our interests in the contributed properties acquired by the third party investors for cash. Property Divestitures. During 2005, we divested ourselves of 142 industrial buildings and one retail center, aggregating approximately 9.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $926.6 million, with a resulting net gain of $113.6 million. Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Alliance Fund I for $618.5 million. The multi investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. We received cash and a distribution of an on tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund. We also received a net incentive distribution of approximately $26.4 million in cash which is classified under private capital income on the consolidated statement of operations. Development Sales and Contributions. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $1.9 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. Properties Held for Contribution. As of December 31, 2005, we held for contribution to a co investment joint venture one industrial building with an aggregate net book value of $32.8 million, which, when contributed to the joint venture, will reduce our current ownership interest from approximately 98% to an expected range of 20 50%. This asset is not being held for divestiture under SFAS No. 144. Properties Held for Divestiture. As of December 31, 2005, we held for divestiture five industrial buildings and one undeveloped land parcel, which are not in our core markets, do not meet our current strategic objectives or which we have included as part of our development for sale program. The divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. As of December 31, 2005, the net carrying value of the properties held for divestiture was $17.9 million. Expected net sales proceeds exceed the net carrying value of the properties. Co investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund certain acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. We generally consolidate these joint ventures for financial reporting purposes because they are not variable interest entities and because we are the sole managing general partner and control all major operating decisions. However, in certain cases, our co investment joint ventures are unconsolidated because we do not control all major operating decisions. Third party equity interests in the joint ventures are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2005, we owned approximately 54.8 million square feet of our 50 Table of Contents properties (47.7% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so.

We have authorized for issuance 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which the following series were designated as of December 31, 2005: 1,595,337 shares of series D preferred; 220,440 shares of series E cumulative redeemable preferred; 267,439 shares of series F cumulative redeemable preferred of which 201,139 are outstanding; 840,000 shares of series H cumulative redeemable preferred; 510,000 shares of series I cumulative redeemable preferred; 800,000 shares of series J cumulative redeemable preferred; 800,000 shares of series K cumulative redeemable preferred; 2,300,000 shares of series L cumulative redeemable preferred, of which 2,000,000 are outstanding; 2,300,000 shares of series M cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which are outstanding and 3,000,000 shares of series O cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which are outstanding. 51 Table of Contents On December 13, 2005, we issued and sold 3,000,000 shares of 7.00% Series O Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at $25.00 per share. Dividends are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable quarterly in arrears at a rate per share equal to $1.75 per annum. The series O preferred stock is redeemable by us on or after December 13, 2010, subject to certain conditions, for cash at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, if any, to the redemption date. We contributed the net proceeds of $72.3 million to the operating partnership, and in exchange, the operating partnership issued to us 3,000,000 7.00% Series O Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units. On June 23, 2003, we issued and sold 2,000,000 shares of 6.5% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at a price of $25.00 per share. Dividends are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable quarterly in arrears at a rate per share equal to $1.625 per annum. The series L preferred stock is redeemable by us on or after June 23, 2008, subject to certain conditions, for cash at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, if any, to the redemption date. We contributed the net proceeds of approximately $48.0 million to the operating partnership, and in exchange, the operating partnership issued to us 2,000,000 6.5% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units. The operating partnership used the proceeds, in addition to proceeds previously contributed to the operating partnership from other equity issuances, to redeem all 3,995,800 of its 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units from us on July 28, 2003. We, in turn, used those proceeds to redeem all 3,995,800 of our 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for $100.2 million, including all accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, to the redemption date. On November 25, 2003, we issued and sold 2,300,000 shares of 6.75% Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at $25.00 per share. Dividends are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable quarterly in arrears at a rate per share equal to $1.6875 per annum. The series M preferred stock is redeemable by us on or after November 25, 2008, subject to certain conditions, for cash at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends theron, if any, to the redemption date. We contributed the net proceeds of $55.4 million to the operating partnership, and in exchange, the operating partnership issued to us 2,300,000 6.75% Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units. On September 24, 2004, AMB Property II, L.P., a partnership in which Texas AMB I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and our indirect subsidiary, owns an approximate 1.0% general partnership interest and the operating partnership owns an approximate 99% common limited partnership interest, issued 729,582 5.0% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units at a price of $50.00 per unit. The series N preferred units were issued to Robert Pattillo Properties, Inc. in exchange for the contribution of certain parcels of land that are located in multiple markets to AMB Property II, L.P. Effective January 27, 2006, Robert Pattillo Properties, Inc. exercised its rights under its Put Agreement, dated September 24, 2004, with the operating partnership, and sold all of its series N preferred units to the operating partnership at a price equal to $50.00 per unit, plus all accrued and unpaid distributions to the date of such sale. Also on January 27, 2006, AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased all of the series N preferred units from the operating partnership at a price equal to $50.00 per unit, plus all accrued and unpaid distributions to the date of such sale and cancelled all of the outstanding series N preferred units as of such date. As of December 31, 2005, $142.8 million in preferred units with a weighted average rate of 7.87%, issued by the operating partnership, were callable under the terms of the partnership agreement and $102.0 million in preferred units with a weighted average rate of 6.9% become callable in 2006. In December 2005, our board of directors approved a new two year common stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of our common stock. We did not repurchase or retire any shares of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2005. Debt. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, we presently intend to operate with an our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio of approximately 45% or less. As of December 31, 2005, our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio was 34.7%. (See footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratios table below for our definitions of our share of total market capitalization, market equity and our share of total debt.) However, we typically finance our consolidated co investment joint ventures with secured debt at a loan to 52 Table of Contents value ratio of 50 65% per our joint venture partnership agreements. Additionally, we currently intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these policies, however, our organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our management could alter or eliminate these policies without stockholder approval or circumstances could arise that could render us unable to comply with these policies. As of December 31, 2005, the aggregate principal amount of our secured debt was $1.9 billion, excluding unamortized debt premiums of $12.0 million. Of the $1.9 billion of secured debt, $1.4 billion is secured by properties in our joint ventures. The secured debt is generally non recourse and bears interest at rates varying from 0.6% to 10.4% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 5.7%) and final maturity dates ranging from January 2006 to January 2025. As of December 31, 2005, $1.6 billion of the secured debt obligations bears interest at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% while the remaining $291.7 million bears interest at variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 2.1%). As of December 31, 2005, the operating partnership had outstanding an aggregate of $975.0 million in unsecured senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 6.2% and had an average term of 5.2 years. These unsecured senior debt securities include $300.0 million in notes issued in June 1998, $250.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2000 medium term note program, $325.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2002 medium term note program, and approximately $112.5 million of 5.094% Notes Due 2015, which were issued to Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America on July 11, 2005 in a private placement, in exchange for the cancellation of $100 million of notes that were issued in June 1998 resulting in a discount of approximately $12.5 million. The unsecured senior debt securities are subject to various covenants. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to its senior debt securities. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then our cash flow may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Credit Facilities. On June 1, 2004, the operating partnership completed the early renewal of its senior unsecured revolving line of credit in the amount of $500.0 million. We remain a guarantor of the operating partnerships obligations under the credit facility. The three year credit facility includes a multi currency component under which up to $250.0 million can be drawn in Yen, Euros or British Pounds Sterling. The line, which matures in June 2007 and carries a one year extension option, can be increased up to $700.0 million upon certain conditions, and replaces the operating partnerships previous $500.0 million credit facility that was to mature in December 2005. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the operating partnerships long term debt rating, which is currently 60 basis points with an annual facility fee of 20 basis points, based on the current credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt. The operating partnership uses its unsecured credit facility principally for acquisitions, funding development activity and general working capital requirements. The total amount available under the credit facility fluctuates based upon the borrowing base, as defined in the agreement governing the credit facility, which is generally based upon the value of our unencumbered properties. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding balance on the credit facility was $216.8 million and the remaining amount available was $244.8 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $38.4 million (excluding the additional $200.0 million of potential additional capacity). The outstanding balance included borrowings denominated in Euros and Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, would equal approximately $173.1 million and $43.7 million in U.S. dollars, respectively. On June 29, 2004, AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating partnership, entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement providing for loans or letters of credit. On December 8, 2005, the unsecured revolving credit agreement was amended to increase the maximum principal amount outstanding at 53 Table of Contents any time to up to 35.0 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, equaled approximately $297.2 million U.S. dollars, and can be increased to up to 40.0 billion Yen upon certain conditions. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K. under the revolving credit facility, as well as the obligations of any other entity in which the operating partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest, and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the revolving credit agreement. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and for other real estate purposes in Japan. Generally, borrowers under the revolving credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the revolving credit facility with certain real estate assets or equity in entities holding such real estate assets. The revolving credit facility matures in June 2007 and has a one year extension option, which is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.25% of the outstanding commitments under the facility at that time. The rate on the borrowings is generally TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the current credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt and is currently 60 basis points. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, payable in quarterly amounts, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt, and is currently 20 basis points of the outstanding commitments under the facility. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, was $205.8 million in U.S. dollars. On November 24, 2004, AMB Tokai TMK, a Japanese subsidiary of the operating partnership, entered into a secured multi advance project financing, providing for loans in a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of up to 20.0 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, would equal approximately $169.9 million U.S. dollars. The financing agreement is among AMB Tokai TMK, us, the operating partnership, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and a syndicate of banks. We, along with the operating partnership, jointly and severally guarantee AMB Tokai TMKs obligations under the financing agreement, pursuant to a guaranty of payment executed in connection with the project financing. The financing is secured by a mortgage on certain real property located in Tokai, Tokyo, Japan, and matures on October 31, 2006 with a one year extension option. The rate on the borrowings will generally be TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt and is currently 60 basis points per annum, except that AMB Tokai TMK has purchased from Sumitomo an interest rate swap, which has fixed the interest rate payable on a principal amount equal to 13.0 billion Yen at 1.32% per annum plus the applicable margin. In addition, there is an annual commitment fee based on unused commitments, payable quarterly, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt, and is currently 20 basis points of the amount of unused commitments. The financing agreement contains affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. In addition, Sumitomo, AMB Tokai TMK and the operating partnership signed a commitment letter on November 24, 2004, pursuant to which Sumitomo committed to purchase bonds that may be issued by AMB Tokai TMK in an amount between 10.0 billion Yen and 15.0 billion Yen (such amount to be determined by AMB Tokai TMK). The bonds would be secured by the AMB Ohta Distribution Center and would generally accrue interest at a rate of TIBOR plus 1.10% per annum; because the swap purchased by AMB Tokai TMK from Sumitomo is coterminous with the maturity date of the proposed bonds, AMB Tokai TMK will have fixed the interest rate payable on, in general, a principal amount equal to 13.0 billion Yen at 2.42% per annum. The bonds, if issued, would mature on October 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding balance on this financing agreement was 19.5 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, equaled approximately $165.6 million U.S. dollars and is accounted for as wholly owned secured debt. On February 16, 2006, the operating partnership and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries entered into a third amended and restated credit agreement for a $250 million unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility with a maturity date of February 2010, that replaced the then existing $100 million unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility that was to mature in June 2008. As of December 31, 2005, we had an additional outstanding balance of $67.5 million under the then existing facility. 54 Table of Contents Mortgages Receivable. Through a wholly owned subsidiary, we hold a mortgage loan receivable on AMB Pier One, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture. The note bears interest at 13.0% and matures in May 2026. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding balance on the note was $12.8 million. We also hold a loan receivable on G. Accion, an unconsolidated joint venture totaling $8.8 million with an interest rate of 10.0%. The loan matures in November 2006. The tables below summarize our debt maturities, capitalization and reconcile our share of total debt to total consolidated debt as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands): Debt Our Joint Unsecured Secured Venture Senior Debt Unsecured Credit Debt(4) Debt Securities Debt Facilities(1) Total Debt 2006 $ 65,369 $ 79,262 $ 75,000 $ 16,280 $ $ 235,911 2007 12,680 58,124 75,000 752 422,602 569,158 2008 40,705 178,795 175,000 810 67,470 462,780 2009 5,264 120,551 100,000 873 226,688 2010 71,078 116,927 250,000 941 438,946 2011 21,573 357,207 75,000 1,014 454,794 2012 254,996 171,442 1,093 427,531 2013 14,773 196,894 920 212,587 2014 15,066 4,684 616 20,366 2015 1,951 61,653 100,000 664 164,268 Thereafter 19,004 32,544 125,000 176,548 Subtotal 522,459 1,378,083 975,000 23,963 490,072 3,389,577 Unamortized premiums 2,577 9,407 11,984 Total consolidated debt 525,036 1,387,490 975,000 23,963 490,072 3,401,561 Our share of unconsolidated joint venture debt(2) 161,120 161,120 Total debt 525,036 1,548,610 975,000 23,963 490,072 3,562,681 Joint venture partners share of consolidated joint venture debt (960,803 ) (960,803 ) Our share of total debt(3) $ 525,036 $ 587,807 $ 975,000 $ 23,963 $ 490,072 $ 2,601,878 Weighted average interest rate 4.1 % 6.3 % 6.2 % 8.2 % 2.2 % 5.3 % Weighted average maturity (in years) 5.8 5.7 5.2 3.1 1.6 4.9 (1) Includes $173.1 million, $249.5 million and $67.5 million in Euro, Yen and Canadian dollar based borrowings, respectively, translated to U.S. dollars using the functional exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2005. (2) The weighted average interest and maturity for the unconsolidated joint venture debt were 5.3% and 3.7 years, respectively. (3) Our share of total debt is the pro rata portion of the total debt based on our percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated or unconsolidated ventures holding the debt. We believe that our share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze our leverage and to compare our leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of our debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their joint ventures. Our share of total debt is not intended to reflect our actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures. The above table reconciles our share of total debt to total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure. 55 Table of Contents (4) Our secured debt and joint venture debt include debt related to international assets in the amount of $383.0 million. Of this, $250.5 million is associated with assets located in Asia and the remaining $132.5 million is related to assets located in Europe.

Our definition of our share of total market capitalization is our share of total debt plus preferred equity liquidation preferences plus market equity. Our definition of market equity is the total number of outstanding shares of our common stock and common limited partnership units multiplied by the closing price per share of our common stock as of December 31, 2005. Our definition of preferred is preferred equity liquidation preferences. Our share of total book capitalization is defined as our share of total debt plus minority interests to preferred unitholders and limited partnership unitholders plus stockholders equity. Our share of total debt is the pro rata portion of the total debt based on our percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated or unconsolidated ventures holding the debt. We 56 Table of Contents believe that our share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze our leverage and to compare our leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of our debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their joint ventures. Our share of total debt is not intended to reflect our actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures. For a reconciliation of our share of total debt to total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure, please see the table of debt maturities and capitalization above. Liquidity As of December 31, 2005, we had $232.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and $368.8 million of additional available borrowings under our credit facilities. As of December 31, 2005, we had $34.4 million in restricted cash. Our board of directors declared a regular cash dividend for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 of $0.44 per share of common stock, and the operating partnership announced its intention to pay a regular cash distribution for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 of $0.44 per common unit. The dividends and distributions were payable on January 6, 2006 to stockholders and unitholders of record on December 22, 2005. The series L and M preferred stock dividends were payable on January 16, 2006 to stockholders of record on January 6, 2006. The series E, F, J and K preferred unit quarterly distributions were payable on January 15, 2006. The series O preferred stock dividends are payable on April 15, 2006. The series D, H, I and N preferred unit quarterly distributions were paid on December 25, 2005.

The anticipated size of our distributions, using only cash from operations, will not allow us to retire all of our debt as it comes due. Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would 57 Table of Contents adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Commitments Developments. In addition to recurring capital expenditures, which consist of building improvements and leasing costs incurred to renew or re tenant space, during 2005, we initiated 30 new industrial development projects in North America, Europe and Asia with a total estimated investment of $522.4 million, aggregating an estimated 7.0 million square feet. As of December 31, 2005, we had 47 projects in our development pipeline representing a total estimated investment of $1.1 billion upon completion, of which two industrial projects with a total of 0.3 million square feet and an aggregate estimated investment of $24.5 million upon completion are held in unconsolidated joint ventures. In addition, we held one development project available for sale or contribution, representing a total estimated investment of $32.8 million upon completion. Of the total development pipeline, $681.4 million had been funded as of December 31, 2005 and an estimated $405.2 million was required to complete current and planned projects. We expect to fund these expenditures with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances, net proceeds from property divestitures and private capital from co investment partners, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow. Acquisitions. During 2005, we acquired 41 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet for a total expected investment of $555.0 million, including two buildings that were acquired by two of our unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. Additional acquisition activity in 2005 included the purchase of an approximate 43% unconsolidated equity interest in G.Accion, one of Mexicos largest real estate companies, for $46.1 million. We generally fund our acquisitions through private capital contributions, borrowings under our credit facility, cash, debt issuances and net proceeds from property divestitures. Lease Commitments. We have entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily on tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms from one to 57 years. These operating lease payments are amortized ratably over the terms of the related leases. Future minimum rental payments required under non cancelable operating leases in effect as of December 31, 2005 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2006 $ 20,894 2007 21,036 2008 20,617 2009 20,327 2010 19,997 Thereafter 278,759 Total $ 381,630 Co investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. As of December 31, 2005, we had investments in co investment joint ventures with a gross book value of $2.5 billion, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, and net equity investments in two unconsolidated co investment joint ventures of $26.3 million. As of December 31, 2005, we may make additional capital contributions to current and planned co investment joint ventures of up to $133.7 million (using the exchange rates at December 31, 2005). From time to time, we may raise additional equity commitments for AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open ended consolidated co investment joint venture formed in 2004 with institutional investors, which invest through a private real estate investment trust. This would increase our obligation to make additional capital commitments. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of this fund, we are obligated to contribute 20% of the total equity commitments to the fund until such time our total equity commitment is greater than 58 Table of Contents $150.0 million, at which time, our obligation is reduced to 10% of the total equity commitments. We expect to fund these contributions with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances or net proceeds from property divestitures, which could adversely effect our cash flow. Captive Insurance Company. In December 2001, we formed a wholly owned captive insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., which provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the deductible under our third party policies. We capitalized Arcata National Insurance Ltd. in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata National Insurance Ltd. established annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss experience of our properties. Annually, we engage an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims, related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata National Insurance Ltd. may be adjusted based on this estimate. Premiums paid to Arcata National Insurance Ltd. have a retrospective component, so that if expenses, including losses, deductibles and reserves, are less than premiums collected, the excess may be returned to the property owners (and, in turn, as appropriate, to the customers) and, conversely, subject to certain limitations, if expenses, including losses, deductibles and reserves, are greater than premiums collected, an additional premium will be charged. As with all recoverable expenses, differences between estimated and actual insurance premiums are recognized in the subsequent year. Through this structure, we believe that we have more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market. Potential Unknown Liabilities. Unknown liabilities may include the following: liabilities for clean up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to our formation transactions that had not been asserted prior to our formation transactions; accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; tax liabilities; and claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these entities. Overview of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our debt, interest and lease payments due by period as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands): Less than More than Contractual Obligations 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Total Debt $ 235,911 $ 1,031,938 $ 665,634 $ 1,456,094 $ 3,389,577 Debt interest payments 14,459 46,749 37,056 83,106 181,370 Operating lease commitments 20,894 41,653 49,324 278,759 381,630 Construction commitments 136,600 136,600 Total $ 271,264 $ 1,256,940 $ 743,014 $ 1,817,959 $ 4,089,177 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Standby Letters of Credit. As of December 31, 2005, we had provided approximately $48.7 million in letters of credit, of which $38.4 million was provided under the operating partnerships $500.0 million unsecured credit facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other commitments. Guarantees. As of December 31, 2005, we had outstanding guarantees in the aggregate amount of $128.2 million in connection with certain acquisitions. As of December 31, 2005, we guaranteed $23.4 million 59 Table of Contents and $2.3 million on outstanding loans on two of our consolidated joint ventures and one of our unconsolidated joint ventures, respectively. Performance and Surety Bonds. As of December 31, 2005, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $0.9 million. These bonds were issued in connection with certain of its development projects and were posted to guarantee certain tax obligations and the construction of certain real property improvements and infrastructure, such as grading, sewers and streets. Performance and surety bonds are commonly required by public agencies from real estate developers. Performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the taxes due or the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. Promoted Interests and Other Contractual Obligations. Upon the achievement of certain return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, we may be obligated to make payments to certain of joint venture partners pursuant to the terms and provisions of their contractual agreements with us. From time to time in the normal course of our business, we enter into various contracts with third parties that may obligate us to make payments or perform other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. SUPPLEMENTAL EARNINGS MEASURES FFO. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider funds from operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. FFO is defined as net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, less gains (or losses) from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estate related depreciation, and adjustments to derive our pro rata share of FFO of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. Further, we do not adjust FFO to eliminate the effects of non recurring charges. We believe that FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. We believe that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. 60 Table of Contents The following table reflects the calculation of FFO reconciled from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands): 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Net income(1) $ 257,807 $ 125,471 $ 129,128 $ 121,119 $ 136,200 Gains from dispositions of real estate, net of minority interests(2) (132,652 ) (47,224 ) (50,325 ) (19,383 ) (41,859 ) Real estate, related depreciation and amortization: Total depreciation and amortization 165,438 141,120 116,067 107,097 90,527 Discontinued operations depreciation 14,866 26,230 26,270 29,406 23,016 Non real estate depreciation (3,388 ) (871 ) (720 ) (712 ) (731 ) Ground lease amortization (2,301 ) (1,232 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from consolidated joint ventures: Joint venture partners minority interests (Net income) 36,398 29,544 21,015 15,112 11,288 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Net income) 3,681 2,615 2,378 3,572 4,836 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Development profits) 2,262 435 344 57 764 Discontinued operations minority interests (Net income) 8,502 13,549 16,214 17,745 17,595 FFO attributable to minority interests (100,275 ) (80,192 ) (65,603 ) (52,051 ) (40,144 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures: Our share of net income (10,770 ) (3,781 ) (5,445 ) (5,674 ) (5,467 ) Our share of FFO 14,441 7,549 9,755 9,291 8,014 Our share of development profits, net of taxes 5,441 Preferred stock dividends (7,388 ) (7,131 ) (6,999 ) (8,496 ) (8,500 ) Preferred stock and unit redemption discount (issuance costs) (5,413 ) 412 (7,600 ) Funds from operations $ 254,363 $ 207,314 $ 186,666 $ 215,194 $ 186,707 Basic FFO per common share and unit $ 2.87 $ 2.39 $ 2.17 $ 2.44 $ 2.09 Diluted FFO per common share and unit $ 2.75 $ 2.30 $ 2.13 $ 2.40 $ 2.07 Weighted average common shares and units: Basic 88,684,262 86,885,250 85,859,899 88,204,208 89,286,379 Diluted 92,508,725 90,120,250 87,616,365 89,689,310 90,325,801 61 Table of Contents (1) Includes gains from undepreciated land sales of $25.0 million, $3.7 million and $1.2 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. (2) 2005 includes accumulated depreciation re capture of approximately $1.1 million associated with the sale of the Interstate Crossdock redevelopment project. SS NOI. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider same store net operating income (SS NOI) to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. For properties that are considered part of the same store pool, see Part I, Item 2: Properties Industrial Properties Industrial Market Operating Statistics, Note 5, and Operating and Leasing Statistics Industrial Same Store Operating Statistics, Note 1. In deriving SS NOI, we define NOI as rental revenues (as calculated in accordance with GAAP), including reimbursements, less straight line rents, property operating expenses and real estate taxes. We exclude straight line rents in calculating SS NOI because we believe it provides a better measure of actual cash basis rental growth for a year over year comparison. In addition, we believe that SS NOI helps the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate as compared to other companies. While SS NOI is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. SS NOI also does not reflect general and administrative expenses, interest expenses, depreciation and amortization costs, capital expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development and construction activities that could materially impact our results from operations. Further, our computation of SS NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating SS NOI. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices, interest rates and international exchange rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings and our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2005, we had two outstanding interest rate swaps with aggregate notional amount of $119.5 million (in U.S. dollars). See Financial Instruments below. The table below summarizes the market risks associated with our fixed and variable rate debt outstanding before unamortized debt premiums of $12.0 million as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands): 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total Fixed rate debt(1) $ 165,953 $ 129,214 $ 374,174 $ 190,548 $ 437,934 $ 1,260,015 $ 2,557,838 Average interest rate 6.9 % 7.2 % 6.9 % 5.0 % 6.1 % 6.3 % 6.3 % Variable rate debt(2) $ 69,958 $ 439,944 $ 88,606 $ 36,140 $ 1,012 $ 196,079 $ 831,739 Average interest rate 4.3 % 2.2 % 2.2 % 2.2 % 2.0 % 1.9 % 2.3 % Interest Payments $ 14,459 $ 18,982 $ 27,767 $ 10,322 $ 26,734 $ 83,106 $ 181,370 (1) Represents 75.5% of all outstanding debt. (2) Represents 24.5% of all outstanding debt. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased or decreased by 10%, then the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would be $1.9 million annually. As of December 31, 2005, the book value and the estimated fair value of our total consolidated debt (both secured and unsecured) was $3.4 billion based on our estimate of current market interest rates. 62 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, variable rate debt comprised 24.5% and 15.3%, respectively, of all our outstanding debt. Variable rate debt was $831.7 million and $498.3 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. The increase is primarily due to higher outstanding balances on our credit facilities. This increase in our outstanding variable rate debt increases our risk associated with unfavorable interest rate fluctuations. Financial Instruments. We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income or income. For revenues or expenses denominated in non functional currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments in effect at December 31, 2005 were two interest rate swaps hedging cash flows of our variable rate borrowings based on Euribor (Europe) and Japanese TIBOR (Japan) and two put options hedging against adverse foreign fluctuations of the Mexican Peso and the Euro against the U.S. dollar. The following table summarizes our financial instruments as of December 31, 2005: Maturity Dates January 8, March 31, December 8, October 29, Notional Related Derivatives (In thousands) 2006 2006 2008 2012 Amount Fair Value Interest Rate Swaps: Plain Interest Rate Swap, Japan Notional Amount (U.S. Dollars) $ 110,403 $ 110,403 Receive Floating(%) 3M TIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 1.32 % Fair Market Value $ 760 Plain Interest Rate Swap, Europe Notional Amount (U.S. Dollars) $ 9,118 9,118 Receive Floating(%) 3M EURIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 3.72 % Fair Market Value Foreign Exchange Agreements: Mexico Options to Sell MXN/ Buy USD Contract Amount (U.S. Dollars) $ 4,492 4,492 Contract FX Rate 10.96 Contract Premium $ 64 41 Europe Options to Sell EUR/ Buy (U.S. Dollars) Contract Amount (U.S. Dollars) $ 1,180 1,184 Contract FX Rate 1.18 Contract Premium $ 5 3 Total $ 125,197 $ 631 International Operations. Our exposure to market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries operating in the United States and Mexico. The functional currency for our subsidiaries operating outside North America is generally the local currency of the country in which the entity is located, mitigating the effect of foreign exchange gains and losses. Our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement 63 Table of Contents date. We translate income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. The losses resulting from the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity and totaled $1.8 million for year ended December 31, 2005. Our international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. In these instances, non monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2005, gains from remeasurement and the sale of one foreign exchange agreement included in our results of operations totaled $0.6 million. We also record gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated. We believe that these gains or losses are immaterial.

(2) AMB SGP Mexico, LLC is an unconsolidated co investment joint venture formed in 2004 with Industrial (Mexico) JV Pte. Ltd., a real estate investment subsidiary of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation. Includes $7.3 million of shareholder loans outstanding at December 31, 2005 between us and the co investment partnership and its subsidiaries. (3) AMB Japan Fund I is a co investment partnership formed in 2005 with 13 institutional investors as limited partners. (4) Square feet for development joint ventures represents estimated square feet at completion of development project. (5) AMB has an 0.1% unconsolidated equity interest (with a 33% economic interest) in this property and also has an option to purchase the remaining equity interest beginning January 1, 2007 and expiring December 31, 2009. 34 Table of Contents (6) We hold inter company loans that we eliminate in consolidation. (7) We also have a 39% unconsolidated equity interest in G. Accion, a Mexican real estate company. G. Accion provides management and development services for industrial, retail, residential and office properties in Mexico. (8) We also have an approximate 5% equity interest in IAT Air Cargo Facilities Income Fund, a public Canadian real estate income trust. Secured Debt As of December 31, 2005, we had $1.9 billion of secured indebtedness, net of unamortized premiums, secured by deeds of trust or mortgages. As of December 31, 2005, the total gross consolidated investment value of those properties securing the debt was $3.6 billion. Of the $1.9 billion of secured indebtedness, $1.4 billion was joint venture debt secured by properties with a gross investment value of $2.5 billion. For additional details, see Part II, Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources and Part IV, Item 15: Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. We believe that as of December 31, 2005, the fair value of the properties securing the respective obligations in each case exceeded the principal amount of the outstanding obligations. Item 3. Legal Proceedings As of December 31, 2005, there were no pending legal proceedings to which we were a party or of which any of our properties was the subject, the adverse determination of which we anticipate would have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

(2) Basic and diluted net income per weighted average share equals the net income available to common stockholders divided by 84,048,936 and 87,873,399 shares, respectively, for 2005; 82,133,627 and 85,368,626 shares, respectively, for 2004; 81,096,062 and 82,852,528 shares, respectively, for 2003; 83,310,885 and 84,795,987 shares, respectively, for 2002; 84,174,644 and 85,214,066 shares, respectively, for 2001. (3) Our share of total debt is the pro rata portion of the total debt based on our percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated ventures holding the debt. We believe that our share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze our leverage and to compare our leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of our debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their joint ventures. Our share of total debt is not intended to reflect our actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures. For a reconciliation of our share of total debt to total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure, please see the table of debt maturities and capitalization in Part II, Item 7: Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources. 38 Table of Contents Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations GENERAL You should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements. We commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company effective with the completion of our initial public offering on November 26, 1997, and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with our initial tax return for the year ended December 31, 1997. AMB Property Corporation and AMB Property, L.P. were formed shortly before the consummation of our initial public offering. Managements Overview The primary source of our revenue and earnings is rent received from customers under long term (generally three to ten years) operating leases at our properties, including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs, and from partnership distributions and fees from our private capital business. We also produce earnings from the strategic disposition of operating assets, from the disposition of projects in our development for sale or contribution program and from contributions of properties to our co investment joint ventures. Our long term growth is driven by our ability to maintain and increase occupancy rates or increase rental rates at our properties, and by our ability to continue to acquire and develop new properties. National industrial markets improved during 2005 when compared with market conditions in 2004. According to Torto Wheaton Research, the positive trend in demand began in the second quarter of 2004 and reversed 14 prior quarters of negatively trending, or rising, space availability. We believe the protracted period of rising availability created a difficult national leasing environment which is now improving, particularly in large industrial property markets tied to global trade. During the three and a half year period of negatively trending industrial space availability, investor demand for industrial property (as supported by our observation of strong national sales volumes and declining acquisition capitalization rates) remained consistently strong. We believe we capitalized on the demand for acquisition property by accelerating the repositioning of our portfolio through the disposition of non core properties. We plan to continue selling selected assets on an opportunistic basis but believe we have substantially achieved our repositioning goals. U.S. Hub and Total Other Total/Weighted Property Data Gateway Markets(1) Markets(2) Average For the year ended December 31, 2005: % of total rentable square feet 74.9 % 25.1 % 100.0 % Occupancy percentage at year end 96.2 % 94.6 % 95.8 % Same space square footage leased 11,032,482 2,574,944 13,607,426 Rent decreases on renewals and rollovers (10.8 )% (4.3 )% (9.7 )% For the year ended December 31, 2004: % of total rentable square feet 74.1 % 25.9 % 100.0 % Occupancy percentage at year end 95.0 % 94.2 % 94.8 % Same space square footage leased 13,932,213 3,553,563 17,485,776 Rent decreases on renewals and rollovers (15.3 )% (3.6 )% (13.2 )% (1) Our U.S. hub and gateway markets include on tarmac and Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas/ Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Northern New Jersey/ New York City, the San Francisco Bay Area, Miami and Seattle. (2) Our total other markets include other domestic target markets, other non target markets, international target markets and retail. We observed two positive trends nationally for industrial real estate during the year ended December 31, 2005, supported by data provided by Torto Wheaton Research. First, national industrial space availability 39 Table of Contents declined 130 basis points during the year from 10.9% to 9.6%. The availability rate has fallen for seven consecutive quarters, reversing the trend of the prior 14 quarters in which national industrial space availability increased on average 36 basis points per quarter. Second, national absorption of industrial space, defined as the net change in occupied stock as measured by square feet of completions less the change in available square feet, totaled approximately 281 million square feet in the year ended December 31, 2005, substantially exceeding the 183 million square feet of space absorbed in 2004 and well above the previous ten year historical average of 139 million square feet of space absorbed annually. In this improved environment, our industrial portfolios occupancy levels increased to 95.8% at December 31, 2005 from 94.8% at December 31, 2004, which we believe reflects higher levels of demand for industrial space generally and in our portfolio specifically. During the year ended December 31, 2005, our lease expirations totaled approximately 17.6 million square feet while commencements of new or renewed leases totaled approximately 21.3 million square feet, resulting in an increase in our occupancy level of approximately 100 basis points. Rental rates on industrial renewals and rollovers in our portfolio decreased 9.7% during the year ended December 31, 2005 as leases were entered into or renewed at rates consistent with what we believe to be current market levels. We believe this decline in rents on lease renewals and rollovers reflects trends in national industrial space availability. We believe that relatively high levels of national industrial space availability have caused market rents for industrial properties to decline between 10% and 20% from their peak levels in 2001 based on our research data; 42.5% of the space that rolled over in our portfolio in 2005 had commenced between 1999 and 2001. Rental rates in our portfolio declined at successively lower rates in each of the last three quarters during 2005, which we believe indicates a stabilization of market rental rate levels. While the level of rental rate reduction varied by market, we achieved occupancy levels in our portfolio 540 basis points in excess of the national industrial market, as determined by Torto Wheaton Research, by pricing lease renewals and new leases with sensitivity to local market conditions. During periods of decreasing or stabilizing rental rates, we strove to sign leases with shorter terms to prevent locking in lower rent levels for long periods and to be prepared to sign new, longer term leases during periods of growing rental rates. When we sign leases of shorter duration, we attempt to limit overall leasing costs and capital expenditures by offering different grades of tenant improvement packages, appropriate to the lease term. We expect development to be a significant driver of our earnings growth as we expand our land and development pipeline, and contribute completed development projects into our co investment program and recognize development profits. We believe that development, renovation and expansion of well located, high quality industrial properties should generally continue to provide us with attractive investment opportunities at a higher rate of return than we may obtain from the purchase of existing properties. We believe that our development opportunities in Mexico and Japan are particularly attractive given the current lack of supply of modern industrial distribution facilities in the major metropolitan markets of these countries. Globally, we have increased our development pipeline from $106.8 million at the end of 2002 to approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2005. In addition to our committed development pipeline, we hold a total of 1,307 acres for future development or sale. We believe these 1,307 acres of land could support approximately 24.3 million square feet of future development. Going forward, we believe that our co investment program with private capital investors will continue to serve as a significant source of revenues and capital for acquisitions. Through these co investment joint ventures, we typically earn acquisition and development fees, asset management fees and priority distributions, as well as promoted interests and incentive distributions based on the performance of the co investment joint ventures; however, we can not assure you that we will continue to do so. Through contribution of development properties to our co investment joint ventures, we expect to recognize value creation from our development pipeline. As of December 31, 2005, we owned approximately 54.8 million square feet of our properties (47.7% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these co investment joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. 40 Table of Contents By the end of 2007, we plan to have approximately 15% of our operating portfolio (based on both consolidated and unconsolidated annualized base rent) invested in international markets. Our North American target markets outside of the United States currently include Guadalajara, Mexico City, Monterrey and Toronto. Our European target markets currently include Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt, Hamburg, London, Lyon, Madrid, Milan and Paris. Our Asian target markets currently include Beijing, Busan, Nagoya, Osaka, the Pearl River Delta, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore and Tokyo. It is possible that our target markets will change over time to reflect experience, market opportunities, customer needs and changes in global distribution patterns. As of December 31, 2005, our international operating properties comprised 7.1% of our annualized base rents, including properties owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust, we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income. As a result, we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our on going operations to the same extent that other corporations that are not real estate investment trusts can. We must continue to raise capital in both the debt and equity markets to fund our working capital needs, acquisitions and developments. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for a complete discussion of the sources of our capital. Summary of Key Transactions in 2005 During the year ended December 31, 2005, we completed the following significant capital deployment transactions: Acquired 41 buildings in North America, Europe and Asia, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet, for $555.0 million, including two buildings that were acquired by two of our unconsolidated co investment joint ventures; Acquired an approximate 43% unconsolidated equity interest in G.Accion, one of Mexicos largest real estate companies for $46.1 million; Committed to 30 development projects in North America, Europe and Asia totaling 7.0 million square feet with an estimated total investment of approximately $522.4 million; Acquired 341 acres of land for industrial warehouse development in North America, Europe and Asia for approximately $193.9 million; Sold five land parcels and five development projects available for sale, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet, for an aggregate price of approximately $155.2 million; and Divested ourselves of 142 industrial buildings and one retail center aggregating approximately 9.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of approximately $926.6 million. Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Alliance Fund I for $618.5 million. The multi investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. We received cash and a distribution of an on tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund. We also received a net incentive distribution of approximately $26.4 million in cash. See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our acquisition, development and disposition activity. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we completed the following significant capital markets and other financing transactions: Formed an unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., with planned investment of capacity of approximately 247.3 billion Yen ($2.1 billion U.S. dollars, using exchange rate at December 31, 2005). We contributed $106.9 million (using exchange rate in effect at contribution) of operating properties to the fund; Contributed an industrial property for $23.6 million to AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, an unconsolidated co investment joint venture; 41 Table of Contents Obtained $69.7 million of debt (using exchange rates in effect at applicable quarter end dates) with a weighted average interest rate of 3.8% for international acquisitions; Assumed $62.8 million of debt for our consolidated co investment joint ventures at a weighted average interest rate of 7.4%; Obtained long term secured debt financings for our co investment joint ventures of $139.7 million with a weighted average rate of 5.4%; Exchanged $100.0 million of 6.9% Reset Put Securities for approximately $112.5 million of 5.094% Notes due 2015; Raised $72.3 million in net proceeds from the issuance of $75.0 million of our 7.0% Series O Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock; and Issued $175.0 million of unsecured senior debt securities due 2010. See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 6, 9 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our capital markets transactions. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Investments in Real Estate. Investments in real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. We also record at acquisition an intangible asset or liability for the value attributable to above or below market leases, in place leases and lease origination costs for all acquisitions. Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a property by property basis quarterly and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable. Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying amount of the property. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future market conditions and the availability of capital. Examples of certain situations that could affect future cash flows of a property may include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in occupancy; unforeseen bankruptcy, lease termination and move out of a major customer; or a significant decrease in annual base rents of that property. If impairment analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying amount of our long lived assets could occur in the future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings. Revenue Recognition. We record rental revenue from operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts, security deposits and letters of credit, then we may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our customers on an on going basis by reviewing their financial condition periodically as appropriate. Each period we review our outstanding accounts receivable, including straight line rents, for doubtful accounts and 42 Table of Contents provide allowances as needed. We also record lease termination fees when a customer has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us. If a customer remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement, the applicable termination fees are deferred and recognized over the term of such customers occupancy. Property Dispositions. We report real estate dispositions in three separate categories on our consolidated statements of operations. First, when we divest a portion of our interests in real estate entities or properties, gains from the sale represent the interests acquired by third party investors for cash. Second, we dispose of value added conversion projects and build to suit and speculative development projects for which we have not generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable. Lastly, beginning in 2002, SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, required us to separately report as discontinued operations the historical operating results attributable to operating properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the properties. The consolidated statements of operations for prior periods are also adjusted to conform with this classification. There is no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial position, net income or cash flows. In all cases, gains and losses are recognized using the full accrual method of accounting. Gains relating to transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met. Joint Ventures. We hold interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We determine consolidation based on standards set forth in EITF 96 16, Investors Accounting for an Investee When the Investor Has a Majority of the Voting Interest but the Minority Shareholder or Shareholders Have Certain Approval or Veto Rights, Statement of Position 78 9, Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures and FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN 46. Based on the guidance set forth in these pronouncements, we consolidate certain joint venture investments because we exercise significant control over major operating decisions, such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, asset management, investment activity and changes in financing. For joint ventures that are variable interest entities as defined under FIN 46 where we are not the primary beneficiaries, we do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. For joint ventures where we do not exercise significant control over major operating and management decisions, but where we exercise significant influence, we use the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. In June 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued EITF 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights. Under this consensus, a sole general partner is presumed to control a limited partnership (or similar entity) and should consolidate that entity unless the limited partners possess kick out rights or other substantive participating rights as described in EITF 96 16, Investors Accounting for an Investee When the Investor has a Majority of the Voting Interest but the Minority Shareholder or Shareholders Have Certain Approval or Veto rights. As of June 29, 2005, this consensus was effective immediately for all new or modified agreements, and effective beginning in the first reporting period that ends after December 15, 2005 for all existing agreements. We adopted the consolidation requirements of this consensus in the third quarter 2005 for all new or modified agreements and will adopt the consensus for existing agreements in the first quarter of 2006. There was not a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows upon the adoption of the consolidation requirements of this consensus for all new or modified agreements. We do not believe that there will be a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, upon adopting the consensus for existing agreements. Real Estate Investment Trust. As a real estate investment trust, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes in the U.S. if we meet minimum distribution, income, asset and shareholder tests. However, some of our subsidiaries may be subject to federal and state taxes. In addition, foreign entities may also be subject to the taxes of the host country. An income tax allocation is required to be estimated on our taxable income arising from our taxable REIT subsidiaries and international entities. A deferred tax component could arise based upon the differences in GAAP versus tax income for items such as 43 Table of Contents depreciation and gain recognition. However, we believe deferred tax is an immaterial component of our consolidated balance sheet. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The analysis below includes changes attributable to same store growth, acquisitions, development activity and divestitures. Same store properties are those that we owned during both the current and prior year reporting periods, excluding development properties stabilized after December 31, 2003 (generally defined as properties that are 90% leased or properties for which we have held a certificate of occupancy or where building has been substantially complete for at least 12 months). As of December 31, 2005, same store industrial properties consisted of properties aggregating approximately 72.5 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. During 2005, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 150 buildings, aggregating approximately 10.6 million square feet. In 2004, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 29 industrial buildings, two retail centers and one office, aggregating approximately 4.4 million square feet. Our future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition of additional properties and dispositions. Our future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical results.

These decreases were partially offset by increased occupancy. Industrial same store occupancy was 95.6% at December 31, 2005 and 95.2% at December 31, 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005, rents in the same store portfolio decreased 9.8% on industrial renewals and rollovers (cash basis) on 13.0 million square feet leased due to decreases in market rates. The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2004 and 2005, we continued to acquire properties in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial revenues. The increase in private capital income of $31.0 million was primarily due to incentive distributions for 2005 of $26.4 million for the sale of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, asset 44 Table of Contents management priority distributions from AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., and acquisition fees from AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P.

Other industrial expenses include expenses from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2004 and 2005, we continued to acquire properties in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial operating costs. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase of $17.0 million in personnel costs related to additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international and development expansions, and an increase of $1.5 million due to the expansion of satellite offices. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our consolidated co investment joint ventures.

The increase in interest and other income was primarily due to increased bank interest income and a $1.0 million other fee. The 2005 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted primarily from our contribution of $106.9 million (using exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties to our newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. The 2004 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted from our contribution of $71.5 million in operating properties to our unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC. Development profits represent gains from the sale of development projects and land as part of our development for sale program. The increase in development profits was due to increased volume in 2005. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $1.9 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. During 2004, we sold seven land parcels and six development projects as part of our development for sale program, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet for an aggregate price of $40.4 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $6.5 million. During 2004, we also contributed one completed development project into a newly formed unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $2.0 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash.

Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Alliance Fund I for $618.5 million. The multi investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. We received cash and a distribution of an on tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund. During 2004, we divested ourselves of 21 industrial buildings, two retail centers and one office building, aggregating approximately 3.1 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $200.3 million, with a resulting net gain of $42.0 million.

Industrial same store occupancy was 95.2% at December 31, 2004 and 93.0% at December 31, 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2004, rents in the same store portfolio decreased 14.7% on industrial renewals and rollovers (cash basis) on 16.2 million square feet leased due to decreases in market rates. The properties acquired during 2003 consisted of 82 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.5 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2003 and 2004, we continued to acquire properties in France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial revenues. The decrease in private capital income was due to greater incentive fees earned in the prior year.

The 2004 acquisitions consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2003 and 2004, we continued to acquire properties in France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial property operating costs. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The 2003 impairment loss was on investments in real estate and leasehold interests. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased stock based compensation expense of $2.3 million and additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international and development expansions. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our co investment joint ventures. The increase in fund costs was due to additional formation of co investment joint ventures in 2004.

This decrease was offset by the receipt of a lease termination fee at a property in Chicago in the first quarter of 2004. The gains from dispositions of real estate (not classified as discontinued operations) in 2004, resulted from our contribution of $71.5 million in operating properties to our newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC. The gains from disposition of real estate (not classified as discontinued operations) in 2003, resulted from our contribution of $94.0 million in operating properties to our unconsolidated co investment joint venture, Industrial Fund I, LLC. Development profits represent gains from sales from our development for sale and contribution program. During 2004, we sold seven land parcels and six development projects as part of our development for sale program, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet for an aggregate price of $40.4 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $6.5 million. During 2004, we also contributed one completed development project into a newly formed unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $2.0 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. During 2003, we sold seven development for sale and other projects, for an aggregate price of $74.8 million, with a resulting gain of $14.4 million, net of taxes. The increase in interest expense, including amortization, was due to the issuance of additional unsecured debt under our 2002 medium term note program, increased borrowings on the unsecured credit facilities and additional secured debt borrowings in our co investment joint ventures.

During 2003, we divested ourselves of 24 industrial buildings and two retail centers, aggregating approximately 2.8 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $272.3 million, with a resulting net gain of $42.9 million.

In addition, on November 26, 2003, the operating partnership redeemed all 1,300,000 of its outstanding 85/8% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Partnership Units and we recognized a reduction of income available to common stockholders of $1.7 million for the original issuance costs. In June and November 2003, we issued 2,000,000 shares of 6.5% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and 2,300,000 shares of 6.75% Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, respectively. The timing of the newly issued shares contributed to the increase in preferred stock dividends. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Balance Sheet Strategy. In general, we use unsecured lines of credit, unsecured notes, preferred stock and common equity (issued by us and or the operating partnership and its subsidiaries) to capitalize our 100% owned assets. Over time, we plan to retire non recourse, secured debt encumbering our 100% owned assets and replace that debt with unsecured notes. In managing our co investment joint ventures, in general, we use non recourse, secured debt to capitalize our co investment joint ventures. We currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for acquisitions, development, expansion and renovation of properties will include: retained earnings and cash flow from operations; borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities; other forms of secured or unsecured financing; proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the operating partnership (including issuances of limited partnership units in the operating partnership or its subsidiaries); net proceeds from divestitures of properties; private capital contributions from co investment partners; and net proceeds from contribution of properties and completed development projects to our co investment joint ventures. We currently expect that our principal funding requirements will include: working capital; development, expansion and renovation of properties; acquisitions, including our global expansion; debt service; and dividends and distributions on outstanding common and preferred stock and limited partnership units. 49 Table of Contents We believe that our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow from operations, borrowings available under our unsecured credit facilities and our ability to access private and public debt and equity capital, are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Resources Dispositions of Real Estate Interests. During 2005, we recognized a gain of $1.3 million from disposition of real estate interests, representing the additional value received from the contribution of properties in 2004 to AMB SGP Mexico, LLC. During 2005, we contributed $106.9 million (using exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties, consisting of six industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet, to our newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. We recognized a total gain of $17.8 million on the contribution, representing the partial sale of our interests in the contributed properties acquired by the third party investors for cash. Property Divestitures. During 2005, we divested ourselves of 142 industrial buildings and one retail center, aggregating approximately 9.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $926.6 million, with a resulting net gain of $113.6 million. Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Alliance Fund I for $618.5 million. The multi investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. We received cash and a distribution of an on tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund. We also received a net incentive distribution of approximately $26.4 million in cash which is classified under private capital income on the consolidated statement of operations. Development Sales and Contributions. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $1.9 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. Properties Held for Contribution. As of December 31, 2005, we held for contribution to a co investment joint venture one industrial building with an aggregate net book value of $32.8 million, which, when contributed to the joint venture, will reduce our current ownership interest from approximately 98% to an expected range of 20 50%. This asset is not being held for divestiture under SFAS No. 144. Properties Held for Divestiture. As of December 31, 2005, we held for divestiture five industrial buildings and one undeveloped land parcel, which are not in our core markets, do not meet our current strategic objectives or which we have included as part of our development for sale program. The divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. As of December 31, 2005, the net carrying value of the properties held for divestiture was $17.9 million. Expected net sales proceeds exceed the net carrying value of the properties. Co investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund certain acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. We generally consolidate these joint ventures for financial reporting purposes because they are not variable interest entities and because we are the sole managing general partner and control all major operating decisions. However, in certain cases, our co investment joint ventures are unconsolidated because we do not control all major operating decisions. Third party equity interests in the joint ventures are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2005, we owned approximately 54.8 million square feet of our 50 Table of Contents properties (47.7% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so.

The operating partnership used the proceeds, in addition to proceeds previously contributed to the operating partnership from other equity issuances, to redeem all 3,995,800 of its 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units from us on July 28, 2003. We, in turn, used those proceeds to redeem all 3,995,800 of our 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for $100.2 million, including all accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, to the redemption date. On November 25, 2003, we issued and sold 2,300,000 shares of 6.75% Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at $25.00 per share. Dividends are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable quarterly in arrears at a rate per share equal to $1.6875 per annum.

We contributed the net proceeds of $55.4 million to the operating partnership, and in exchange, the operating partnership issued to us 2,300,000 6.75% Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units. On September 24, 2004, AMB Property II, L.P., a partnership in which Texas AMB I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and our indirect subsidiary, owns an approximate 1.0% general partnership interest and the operating partnership owns an approximate 99% common limited partnership interest, issued 729,582 5.0% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units at a price of $50.00 per unit. The series N preferred units were issued to Robert Pattillo Properties, Inc. in exchange for the contribution of certain parcels of land that are located in multiple markets to AMB Property II, L.P. Effective January 27, 2006, Robert Pattillo Properties, Inc. exercised its rights under its Put Agreement, dated September 24, 2004, with the operating partnership, and sold all of its series N preferred units to the operating partnership at a price equal to $50.00 per unit, plus all accrued and unpaid distributions to the date of such sale. Also on January 27, 2006, AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased all of the series N preferred units from the operating partnership at a price equal to $50.00 per unit, plus all accrued and unpaid distributions to the date of such sale and cancelled all of the outstanding series N preferred units as of such date. As of December 31, 2005, $142.8 million in preferred units with a weighted average rate of 7.87%, issued by the operating partnership, were callable under the terms of the partnership agreement and $102.0 million in preferred units with a weighted average rate of 6.9% become callable in 2006. In December 2005, our board of directors approved a new two year common stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of our common stock. We did not repurchase or retire any shares of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2005. Debt. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, we presently intend to operate with an our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio of approximately 45% or less. As of December 31, 2005, our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio was 34.7%. (See footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratios table below for our definitions of our share of total market capitalization, market equity and our share of total debt.) However, we typically finance our consolidated co investment joint ventures with secured debt at a loan to 52 Table of Contents value ratio of 50 65% per our joint venture partnership agreements. Additionally, we currently intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these policies, however, our organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our management could alter or eliminate these policies without stockholder approval or circumstances could arise that could render us unable to comply with these policies. As of December 31, 2005, the aggregate principal amount of our secured debt was $1.9 billion, excluding unamortized debt premiums of $12.0 million. Of the $1.9 billion of secured debt, $1.4 billion is secured by properties in our joint ventures. The secured debt is generally non recourse and bears interest at rates varying from 0.6% to 10.4% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 5.7%) and final maturity dates ranging from January 2006 to January 2025. As of December 31, 2005, $1.6 billion of the secured debt obligations bears interest at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% while the remaining $291.7 million bears interest at variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 2.1%). As of December 31, 2005, the operating partnership had outstanding an aggregate of $975.0 million in unsecured senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 6.2% and had an average term of 5.2 years. These unsecured senior debt securities include $300.0 million in notes issued in June 1998, $250.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2000 medium term note program, $325.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2002 medium term note program, and approximately $112.5 million of 5.094% Notes Due 2015, which were issued to Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America on July 11, 2005 in a private placement, in exchange for the cancellation of $100 million of notes that were issued in June 1998 resulting in a discount of approximately $12.5 million. The unsecured senior debt securities are subject to various covenants. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to its senior debt securities. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then our cash flow may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Credit Facilities. On June 1, 2004, the operating partnership completed the early renewal of its senior unsecured revolving line of credit in the amount of $500.0 million. We remain a guarantor of the operating partnerships obligations under the credit facility. The three year credit facility includes a multi currency component under which up to $250.0 million can be drawn in Yen, Euros or British Pounds Sterling. The line, which matures in June 2007 and carries a one year extension option, can be increased up to $700.0 million upon certain conditions, and replaces the operating partnerships previous $500.0 million credit facility that was to mature in December 2005. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the operating partnerships long term debt rating, which is currently 60 basis points with an annual facility fee of 20 basis points, based on the current credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt. The operating partnership uses its unsecured credit facility principally for acquisitions, funding development activity and general working capital requirements. The total amount available under the credit facility fluctuates based upon the borrowing base, as defined in the agreement governing the credit facility, which is generally based upon the value of our unencumbered properties. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding balance on the credit facility was $216.8 million and the remaining amount available was $244.8 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $38.4 million (excluding the additional $200.0 million of potential additional capacity). The outstanding balance included borrowings denominated in Euros and Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, would equal approximately $173.1 million and $43.7 million in U.S. dollars, respectively. On June 29, 2004, AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating partnership, entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement providing for loans or letters of credit. On December 8, 2005, the unsecured revolving credit agreement was amended to increase the maximum principal amount outstanding at 53 Table of Contents any time to up to 35.0 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, equaled approximately $297.2 million U.S. dollars, and can be increased to up to 40.0 billion Yen upon certain conditions. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K. under the revolving credit facility, as well as the obligations of any other entity in which the operating partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest, and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the revolving credit agreement. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and for other real estate purposes in Japan. Generally, borrowers under the revolving credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the revolving credit facility with certain real estate assets or equity in entities holding such real estate assets. The revolving credit facility matures in June 2007 and has a one year extension option, which is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.25% of the outstanding commitments under the facility at that time. The rate on the borrowings is generally TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the current credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt and is currently 60 basis points. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, payable in quarterly amounts, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt, and is currently 20 basis points of the outstanding commitments under the facility. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, was $205.8 million in U.S. dollars. On November 24, 2004, AMB Tokai TMK, a Japanese subsidiary of the operating partnership, entered into a secured multi advance project financing, providing for loans in a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of up to 20.0 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, would equal approximately $169.9 million U.S. dollars. The financing agreement is among AMB Tokai TMK, us, the operating partnership, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and a syndicate of banks. We, along with the operating partnership, jointly and severally guarantee AMB Tokai TMKs obligations under the financing agreement, pursuant to a guaranty of payment executed in connection with the project financing. The financing is secured by a mortgage on certain real property located in Tokai, Tokyo, Japan, and matures on October 31, 2006 with a one year extension option. The rate on the borrowings will generally be TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt and is currently 60 basis points per annum, except that AMB Tokai TMK has purchased from Sumitomo an interest rate swap, which has fixed the interest rate payable on a principal amount equal to 13.0 billion Yen at 1.32% per annum plus the applicable margin. In addition, there is an annual commitment fee based on unused commitments, payable quarterly, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt, and is currently 20 basis points of the amount of unused commitments. The financing agreement contains affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. In addition, Sumitomo, AMB Tokai TMK and the operating partnership signed a commitment letter on November 24, 2004, pursuant to which Sumitomo committed to purchase bonds that may be issued by AMB Tokai TMK in an amount between 10.0 billion Yen and 15.0 billion Yen (such amount to be determined by AMB Tokai TMK). The bonds would be secured by the AMB Ohta Distribution Center and would generally accrue interest at a rate of TIBOR plus 1.10% per annum; because the swap purchased by AMB Tokai TMK from Sumitomo is coterminous with the maturity date of the proposed bonds, AMB Tokai TMK will have fixed the interest rate payable on, in general, a principal amount equal to 13.0 billion Yen at 2.42% per annum. The bonds, if issued, would mature on October 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding balance on this financing agreement was 19.5 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, equaled approximately $165.6 million U.S. dollars and is accounted for as wholly owned secured debt. On February 16, 2006, the operating partnership and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries entered into a third amended and restated credit agreement for a $250 million unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility with a maturity date of February 2010, that replaced the then existing $100 million unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility that was to mature in June 2008. As of December 31, 2005, we had an additional outstanding balance of $67.5 million under the then existing facility. 54 Table of Contents Mortgages Receivable. Through a wholly owned subsidiary, we hold a mortgage loan receivable on AMB Pier One, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture. The note bears interest at 13.0% and matures in May 2026. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding balance on the note was $12.8 million. We also hold a loan receivable on G. Accion, an unconsolidated joint venture totaling $8.8 million with an interest rate of 10.0%. The loan matures in November 2006.

Liquidity As of December 31, 2005, we had $232.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and $368.8 million of additional available borrowings under our credit facilities. As of December 31, 2005, we had $34.4 million in restricted cash. Our board of directors declared a regular cash dividend for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 of $0.44 per share of common stock, and the operating partnership announced its intention to pay a regular cash distribution for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 of $0.44 per common unit. The dividends and distributions were payable on January 6, 2006 to stockholders and unitholders of record on December 22, 2005. The series L and M preferred stock dividends were payable on January 16, 2006 to stockholders of record on January 6, 2006. The series E, F, J and K preferred unit quarterly distributions were payable on January 15, 2006. The series O preferred stock dividends are payable on April 15, 2006. The series D, H, I and N preferred unit quarterly distributions were paid on December 25, 2005.

The anticipated size of our distributions, using only cash from operations, will not allow us to retire all of our debt as it comes due. Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would 57 Table of Contents adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Commitments Developments. In addition to recurring capital expenditures, which consist of building improvements and leasing costs incurred to renew or re tenant space, during 2005, we initiated 30 new industrial development projects in North America, Europe and Asia with a total estimated investment of $522.4 million, aggregating an estimated 7.0 million square feet. As of December 31, 2005, we had 47 projects in our development pipeline representing a total estimated investment of $1.1 billion upon completion, of which two industrial projects with a total of 0.3 million square feet and an aggregate estimated investment of $24.5 million upon completion are held in unconsolidated joint ventures. In addition, we held one development project available for sale or contribution, representing a total estimated investment of $32.8 million upon completion. Of the total development pipeline, $681.4 million had been funded as of December 31, 2005 and an estimated $405.2 million was required to complete current and planned projects. We expect to fund these expenditures with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances, net proceeds from property divestitures and private capital from co investment partners, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow. Acquisitions. During 2005, we acquired 41 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet for a total expected investment of $555.0 million, including two buildings that were acquired by two of our unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. Additional acquisition activity in 2005 included the purchase of an approximate 43% unconsolidated equity interest in G.Accion, one of Mexicos largest real estate companies, for $46.1 million. We generally fund our acquisitions through private capital contributions, borrowings under our credit facility, cash, debt issuances and net proceeds from property divestitures. Lease Commitments. We have entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily on tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms from one to 57 years. These operating lease payments are amortized ratably over the terms of the related leases. Future minimum rental payments required under non cancelable operating leases in effect as of December 31, 2005 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2006 $ 20,894 2007 21,036 2008 20,617 2009 20,327 2010 19,997 Thereafter 278,759 Total $ 381,630 Co investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. As of December 31, 2005, we had investments in co investment joint ventures with a gross book value of $2.5 billion, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, and net equity investments in two unconsolidated co investment joint ventures of $26.3 million. As of December 31, 2005, we may make additional capital contributions to current and planned co investment joint ventures of up to $133.7 million (using the exchange rates at December 31, 2005). From time to time, we may raise additional equity commitments for AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open ended consolidated co investment joint venture formed in 2004 with institutional investors, which invest through a private real estate investment trust. This would increase our obligation to make additional capital commitments. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of this fund, we are obligated to contribute 20% of the total equity commitments to the fund until such time our total equity commitment is greater than 58 Table of Contents $150.0 million, at which time, our obligation is reduced to 10% of the total equity commitments. We expect to fund these contributions with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances or net proceeds from property divestitures, which could adversely effect our cash flow. Captive Insurance Company. In December 2001, we formed a wholly owned captive insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., which provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the deductible under our third party policies. We capitalized Arcata National Insurance Ltd. in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata National Insurance Ltd. established annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss experience of our properties. Annually, we engage an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims, related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata National Insurance Ltd. may be adjusted based on this estimate. Premiums paid to Arcata National Insurance Ltd. have a retrospective component, so that if expenses, including losses, deductibles and reserves, are less than premiums collected, the excess may be returned to the property owners (and, in turn, as appropriate, to the customers) and, conversely, subject to certain limitations, if expenses, including losses, deductibles and reserves, are greater than premiums collected, an additional premium will be charged. As with all recoverable expenses, differences between estimated and actual insurance premiums are recognized in the subsequent year. Through this structure, we believe that we have more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market. Potential Unknown Liabilities. Unknown liabilities may include the following: liabilities for clean up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to our formation transactions that had not been asserted prior to our formation transactions; accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; tax liabilities; and claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these entities. Overview of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our debt, interest and lease payments due by period as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands): Less than More than Contractual Obligations 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Total Debt $ 235,911 $ 1,031,938 $ 665,634 $ 1,456,094 $ 3,389,577 Debt interest payments 14,459 46,749 37,056 83,106 181,370 Operating lease commitments 20,894 41,653 49,324 278,759 381,630 Construction commitments 136,600 136,600 Total $ 271,264 $ 1,256,940 $ 743,014 $ 1,817,959 $ 4,089,177 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Standby Letters of Credit. As of December 31, 2005, we had provided approximately $48.7 million in letters of credit, of which $38.4 million was provided under the operating partnerships $500.0 million unsecured credit facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other commitments. Guarantees. As of December 31, 2005, we had outstanding guarantees in the aggregate amount of $128.2 million in connection with certain acquisitions. As of December 31, 2005, we guaranteed $23.4 million 59 Table of Contents and $2.3 million on outstanding loans on two of our consolidated joint ventures and one of our unconsolidated joint ventures, respectively. Performance and Surety Bonds. As of December 31, 2005, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $0.9 million. These bonds were issued in connection with certain of its development projects and were posted to guarantee certain tax obligations and the construction of certain real property improvements and infrastructure, such as grading, sewers and streets. Performance and surety bonds are commonly required by public agencies from real estate developers. Performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the taxes due or the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. Promoted Interests and Other Contractual Obligations. Upon the achievement of certain return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, we may be obligated to make payments to certain of joint venture partners pursuant to the terms and provisions of their contractual agreements with us. From time to time in the normal course of our business, we enter into various contracts with third parties that may obligate us to make payments or perform other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. SUPPLEMENTAL EARNINGS MEASURES FFO. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider funds from operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. FFO is defined as net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, less gains (or losses) from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estate related depreciation, and adjustments to derive our pro rata share of FFO of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. Further, we do not adjust FFO to eliminate the effects of non recurring charges. We believe that FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. We believe that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. 60 Table of Contents The following table reflects the calculation of FFO reconciled from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands): 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Net income(1) $ 257,807 $ 125,471 $ 129,128 $ 121,119 $ 136,200 Gains from dispositions of real estate, net of minority interests(2) (132,652 ) (47,224 ) (50,325 ) (19,383 ) (41,859 ) Real estate, related depreciation and amortization: Total depreciation and amortization 165,438 141,120 116,067 107,097 90,527 Discontinued operations depreciation 14,866 26,230 26,270 29,406 23,016 Non real estate depreciation (3,388 ) (871 ) (720 ) (712 ) (731 ) Ground lease amortization (2,301 ) (1,232 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from consolidated joint ventures: Joint venture partners minority interests (Net income) 36,398 29,544 21,015 15,112 11,288 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Net income) 3,681 2,615 2,378 3,572 4,836 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Development profits) 2,262 435 344 57 764 Discontinued operations minority interests (Net income) 8,502 13,549 16,214 17,745 17,595 FFO attributable to minority interests (100,275 ) (80,192 ) (65,603 ) (52,051 ) (40,144 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures: Our share of net income (10,770 ) (3,781 ) (5,445 ) (5,674 ) (5,467 ) Our share of FFO 14,441 7,549 9,755 9,291 8,014 Our share of development profits, net of taxes 5,441 Preferred stock dividends (7,388 ) (7,131 ) (6,999 ) (8,496 ) (8,500 ) Preferred stock and unit redemption discount (issuance costs) (5,413 ) 412 (7,600 ) Funds from operations $ 254,363 $ 207,314 $ 186,666 $ 215,194 $ 186,707 Basic FFO per common share and unit $ 2.87 $ 2.39 $ 2.17 $ 2.44 $ 2.09 Diluted FFO per common share and unit $ 2.75 $ 2.30 $ 2.13 $ 2.40 $ 2.07 Weighted average common shares and units: Basic 88,684,262 86,885,250 85,859,899 88,204,208 89,286,379 Diluted 92,508,725 90,120,250 87,616,365 89,689,310 90,325,801 61 Table of Contents (1) Includes gains from undepreciated land sales of $25.0 million, $3.7 million and $1.2 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. (2) 2005 includes accumulated depreciation re capture of approximately $1.1 million associated with the sale of the Interstate Crossdock redevelopment project. SS NOI. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider same store net operating income (SS NOI) to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. For properties that are considered part of the same store pool, see Part I, Item 2: Properties Industrial Properties Industrial Market Operating Statistics, Note 5, and Operating and Leasing Statistics Industrial Same Store Operating Statistics, Note 1. In deriving SS NOI, we define NOI as rental revenues (as calculated in accordance with GAAP), including reimbursements, less straight line rents, property operating expenses and real estate taxes. We exclude straight line rents in calculating SS NOI because we believe it provides a better measure of actual cash basis rental growth for a year over year comparison. In addition, we believe that SS NOI helps the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate as compared to other companies. While SS NOI is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. SS NOI also does not reflect general and administrative expenses, interest expenses, depreciation and amortization costs, capital expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development and construction activities that could materially impact our results from operations. Further, our computation of SS NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating SS NOI. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices, interest rates and international exchange rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings and our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2005, we had two outstanding interest rate swaps with aggregate notional amount of $119.5 million (in U.S. dollars). See Financial Instruments below. The table below summarizes the market risks associated with our fixed and variable rate debt outstanding before unamortized debt premiums of $12.0 million as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands): 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total Fixed rate debt(1) $ 165,953 $ 129,214 $ 374,174 $ 190,548 $ 437,934 $ 1,260,015 $ 2,557,838 Average interest rate 6.9 % 7.2 % 6.9 % 5.0 % 6.1 % 6.3 % 6.3 % Variable rate debt(2) $ 69,958 $ 439,944 $ 88,606 $ 36,140 $ 1,012 $ 196,079 $ 831,739 Average interest rate 4.3 % 2.2 % 2.2 % 2.2 % 2.0 % 1.9 % 2.3 % Interest Payments $ 14,459 $ 18,982 $ 27,767 $ 10,322 $ 26,734 $ 83,106 $ 181,370 (1) Represents 75.5% of all outstanding debt. (2) Represents 24.5% of all outstanding debt. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased or decreased by 10%, then the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would be $1.9 million annually. As of December 31, 2005, the book value and the estimated fair value of our total consolidated debt (both secured and unsecured) was $3.4 billion based on our estimate of current market interest rates. 62 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, variable rate debt comprised 24.5% and 15.3%, respectively, of all our outstanding debt. Variable rate debt was $831.7 million and $498.3 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. The increase is primarily due to higher outstanding balances on our credit facilities. This increase in our outstanding variable rate debt increases our risk associated with unfavorable interest rate fluctuations. Financial Instruments. We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income or income. For revenues or expenses denominated in non functional currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments in effect at December 31, 2005 were two interest rate swaps hedging cash flows of our variable rate borrowings based on Euribor (Europe) and Japanese TIBOR (Japan) and two put options hedging against adverse foreign fluctuations of the Mexican Peso and the Euro against the U.S. dollar. The following table summarizes our financial instruments as of December 31, 2005: Maturity Dates January 8, March 31, December 8, October 29, Notional Related Derivatives (In thousands) 2006 2006 2008 2012 Amount Fair Value Interest Rate Swaps: Plain Interest Rate Swap, Japan Notional Amount (U.S. Dollars) $ 110,403 $ 110,403 Receive Floating(%) 3M TIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 1.32 % Fair Market Value $ 760 Plain Interest Rate Swap, Europe Notional Amount (U.S. Dollars) $ 9,118 9,118 Receive Floating(%) 3M EURIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 3.72 % Fair Market Value Foreign Exchange Agreements: Mexico Options to Sell MXN/ Buy USD Contract Amount (U.S. Dollars) $ 4,492 4,492 Contract FX Rate 10.96 Contract Premium $ 64 41 Europe Options to Sell EUR/ Buy (U.S. Dollars) Contract Amount (U.S. Dollars) $ 1,180 1,184 Contract FX Rate 1.18 Contract Premium $ 5 3 Total $ 125,197 $ 631 International Operations. Our exposure to market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries operating in the United States and Mexico. The functional currency for our subsidiaries operating outside North America is generally the local currency of the country in which the entity is located, mitigating the effect of foreign exchange gains and losses. Our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement 63 Table of Contents date. We translate income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. The losses resulting from the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity and totaled $1.8 million for year ended December 31, 2005. Our international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. In these instances, non monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2005, gains from remeasurement and the sale of one foreign exchange agreement included in our results of operations totaled $0.6 million. We also record gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated. We believe that these gains or losses are immaterial. 
 
Item 7: Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources. 38 Table of Contents Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations GENERAL You should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements. We commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company effective with the completion of our initial public offering on November 26, 1997, and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with our initial tax return for the year ended December 31, 1997. AMB Property Corporation and AMB Property, L.P. were formed shortly before the consummation of our initial public offering. Managements Overview The primary source of our revenue and earnings is rent received from customers under long term (generally three to ten years) operating leases at our properties, including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs, and from partnership distributions and fees from our private capital business. We also produce earnings from the strategic disposition of operating assets, from the disposition of projects in our development for sale or contribution program and from contributions of properties to our co investment joint ventures. Our long term growth is driven by our ability to maintain and increase occupancy rates or increase rental rates at our properties, and by our ability to continue to acquire and develop new properties. National industrial markets improved during 2005 when compared with market conditions in 2004. According to Torto Wheaton Research, the positive trend in demand began in the second quarter of 2004 and reversed 14 prior quarters of negatively trending, or rising, space availability. We believe the protracted period of rising availability created a difficult national leasing environment which is now improving, particularly in large industrial property markets tied to global trade. During the three and a half year period of negatively trending industrial space availability, investor demand for industrial property (as supported by our observation of strong national sales volumes and declining acquisition capitalization rates) remained consistently strong. We believe we capitalized on the demand for acquisition property by accelerating the repositioning of our portfolio through the disposition of non core properties. We plan to continue selling selected assets on an opportunistic basis but believe we have substantially achieved our repositioning goals. U.S. Hub and Total Other Total/Weighted Property Data Gateway Markets(1) Markets(2) Average For the year ended December 31, 2005: % of total rentable square feet 74.9 % 25.1 % 100.0 % Occupancy percentage at year end 96.2 % 94.6 % 95.8 % Same space square footage leased 11,032,482 2,574,944 13,607,426 Rent decreases on renewals and rollovers (10.8 )% (4.3 )% (9.7 )% For the year ended December 31, 2004: % of total rentable square feet 74.1 % 25.9 % 100.0 % Occupancy percentage at year end 95.0 % 94.2 % 94.8 % Same space square footage leased 13,932,213 3,553,563 17,485,776 Rent decreases on renewals and rollovers (15.3 )% (3.6 )% (13.2 )% (1) Our U.S. hub and gateway markets include on tarmac and Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas/ Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Northern New Jersey/ New York City, the San Francisco Bay Area, Miami and Seattle. (2) Our total other markets include other domestic target markets, other non target markets, international target markets and retail. We observed two positive trends nationally for industrial real estate during the year ended December 31, 2005, supported by data provided by Torto Wheaton Research. First, national industrial space availability 39 Table of Contents declined 130 basis points during the year from 10.9% to 9.6%. The availability rate has fallen for seven consecutive quarters, reversing the trend of the prior 14 quarters in which national industrial space availability increased on average 36 basis points per quarter. Second, national absorption of industrial space, defined as the net change in occupied stock as measured by square feet of completions less the change in available square feet, totaled approximately 281 million square feet in the year ended December 31, 2005, substantially exceeding the 183 million square feet of space absorbed in 2004 and well above the previous ten year historical average of 139 million square feet of space absorbed annually. In this improved environment, our industrial portfolios occupancy levels increased to 95.8% at December 31, 2005 from 94.8% at December 31, 2004, which we believe reflects higher levels of demand for industrial space generally and in our portfolio specifically. During the year ended December 31, 2005, our lease expirations totaled approximately 17.6 million square feet while commencements of new or renewed leases totaled approximately 21.3 million square feet, resulting in an increase in our occupancy level of approximately 100 basis points. Rental rates on industrial renewals and rollovers in our portfolio decreased 9.7% during the year ended December 31, 2005 as leases were entered into or renewed at rates consistent with what we believe to be current market levels. We believe this decline in rents on lease renewals and rollovers reflects trends in national industrial space availability. We believe that relatively high levels of national industrial space availability have caused market rents for industrial properties to decline between 10% and 20% from their peak levels in 2001 based on our research data; 42.5% of the space that rolled over in our portfolio in 2005 had commenced between 1999 and 2001. Rental rates in our portfolio declined at successively lower rates in each of the last three quarters during 2005, which we believe indicates a stabilization of market rental rate levels. While the level of rental rate reduction varied by market, we achieved occupancy levels in our portfolio 540 basis points in excess of the national industrial market, as determined by Torto Wheaton Research, by pricing lease renewals and new leases with sensitivity to local market conditions. During periods of decreasing or stabilizing rental rates, we strove to sign leases with shorter terms to prevent locking in lower rent levels for long periods and to be prepared to sign new, longer term leases during periods of growing rental rates. When we sign leases of shorter duration, we attempt to limit overall leasing costs and capital expenditures by offering different grades of tenant improvement packages, appropriate to the lease term. We expect development to be a significant driver of our earnings growth as we expand our land and development pipeline, and contribute completed development projects into our co investment program and recognize development profits. We believe that development, renovation and expansion of well located, high quality industrial properties should generally continue to provide us with attractive investment opportunities at a higher rate of return than we may obtain from the purchase of existing properties. We believe that our development opportunities in Mexico and Japan are particularly attractive given the current lack of supply of modern industrial distribution facilities in the major metropolitan markets of these countries. Globally, we have increased our development pipeline from $106.8 million at the end of 2002 to approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2005. In addition to our committed development pipeline, we hold a total of 1,307 acres for future development or sale. We believe these 1,307 acres of land could support approximately 24.3 million square feet of future development. Going forward, we believe that our co investment program with private capital investors will continue to serve as a significant source of revenues and capital for acquisitions. Through these co investment joint ventures, we typically earn acquisition and development fees, asset management fees and priority distributions, as well as promoted interests and incentive distributions based on the performance of the co investment joint ventures; however, we can not assure you that we will continue to do so. Through contribution of development properties to our co investment joint ventures, we expect to recognize value creation from our development pipeline. As of December 31, 2005, we owned approximately 54.8 million square feet of our properties (47.7% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these co investment joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. 40 Table of Contents By the end of 2007, we plan to have approximately 15% of our operating portfolio (based on both consolidated and unconsolidated annualized base rent) invested in international markets. Our North American target markets outside of the United States currently include Guadalajara, Mexico City, Monterrey and Toronto. Our European target markets currently include Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt, Hamburg, London, Lyon, Madrid, Milan and Paris. Our Asian target markets currently include Beijing, Busan, Nagoya, Osaka, the Pearl River Delta, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore and Tokyo. It is possible that our target markets will change over time to reflect experience, market opportunities, customer needs and changes in global distribution patterns. As of December 31, 2005, our international operating properties comprised 7.1% of our annualized base rents, including properties owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust, we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income. As a result, we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our on going operations to the same extent that other corporations that are not real estate investment trusts can. We must continue to raise capital in both the debt and equity markets to fund our working capital needs, acquisitions and developments. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for a complete discussion of the sources of our capital. Summary of Key Transactions in 2005 During the year ended December 31, 2005, we completed the following significant capital deployment transactions: Acquired 41 buildings in North America, Europe and Asia, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet, for $555.0 million, including two buildings that were acquired by two of our unconsolidated co investment joint ventures; Acquired an approximate 43% unconsolidated equity interest in G.Accion, one of Mexicos largest real estate companies for $46.1 million; Committed to 30 development projects in North America, Europe and Asia totaling 7.0 million square feet with an estimated total investment of approximately $522.4 million; Acquired 341 acres of land for industrial warehouse development in North America, Europe and Asia for approximately $193.9 million; Sold five land parcels and five development projects available for sale, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet, for an aggregate price of approximately $155.2 million; and Divested ourselves of 142 industrial buildings and one retail center aggregating approximately 9.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of approximately $926.6 million. Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Alliance Fund I for $618.5 million. The multi investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. We received cash and a distribution of an on tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund. We also received a net incentive distribution of approximately $26.4 million in cash. See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our acquisition, development and disposition activity. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we completed the following significant capital markets and other financing transactions: Formed an unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., with planned investment of capacity of approximately 247.3 billion Yen ($2.1 billion U.S. dollars, using exchange rate at December 31, 2005). We contributed $106.9 million (using exchange rate in effect at contribution) of operating properties to the fund; Contributed an industrial property for $23.6 million to AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, an unconsolidated co investment joint venture; 41 Table of Contents Obtained $69.7 million of debt (using exchange rates in effect at applicable quarter end dates) with a weighted average interest rate of 3.8% for international acquisitions; Assumed $62.8 million of debt for our consolidated co investment joint ventures at a weighted average interest rate of 7.4%; Obtained long term secured debt financings for our co investment joint ventures of $139.7 million with a weighted average rate of 5.4%; Exchanged $100.0 million of 6.9% Reset Put Securities for approximately $112.5 million of 5.094% Notes due 2015; Raised $72.3 million in net proceeds from the issuance of $75.0 million of our 7.0% Series O Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock; and Issued $175.0 million of unsecured senior debt securities due 2010. See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 6, 9 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our capital markets transactions. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Investments in Real Estate. Investments in real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. We also record at acquisition an intangible asset or liability for the value attributable to above or below market leases, in place leases and lease origination costs for all acquisitions. Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a property by property basis quarterly and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable. Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying amount of the property. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future market conditions and the availability of capital. Examples of certain situations that could affect future cash flows of a property may include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in occupancy; unforeseen bankruptcy, lease termination and move out of a major customer; or a significant decrease in annual base rents of that property. If impairment analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying amount of our long lived assets could occur in the future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings. Revenue Recognition. We record rental revenue from operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts, security deposits and letters of credit, then we may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our customers on an on going basis by reviewing their financial condition periodically as appropriate. Each period we review our outstanding accounts receivable, including straight line rents, for doubtful accounts and 42 Table of Contents provide allowances as needed. We also record lease termination fees when a customer has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us. If a customer remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement, the applicable termination fees are deferred and recognized over the term of such customers occupancy. Property Dispositions. We report real estate dispositions in three separate categories on our consolidated statements of operations. First, when we divest a portion of our interests in real estate entities or properties, gains from the sale represent the interests acquired by third party investors for cash. Second, we dispose of value added conversion projects and build to suit and speculative development projects for which we have not generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable. Lastly, beginning in 2002, SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, required us to separately report as discontinued operations the historical operating results attributable to operating properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the properties. The consolidated statements of operations for prior periods are also adjusted to conform with this classification. There is no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial position, net income or cash flows. In all cases, gains and losses are recognized using the full accrual method of accounting. Gains relating to transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met. Joint Ventures. We hold interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We determine consolidation based on standards set forth in EITF 96 16, Investors Accounting for an Investee When the Investor Has a Majority of the Voting Interest but the Minority Shareholder or Shareholders Have Certain Approval or Veto Rights, Statement of Position 78 9, Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures and FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN 46. Based on the guidance set forth in these pronouncements, we consolidate certain joint venture investments because we exercise significant control over major operating decisions, such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, asset management, investment activity and changes in financing. For joint ventures that are variable interest entities as defined under FIN 46 where we are not the primary beneficiaries, we do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. For joint ventures where we do not exercise significant control over major operating and management decisions, but where we exercise significant influence, we use the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. In June 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued EITF 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights. Under this consensus, a sole general partner is presumed to control a limited partnership (or similar entity) and should consolidate that entity unless the limited partners possess kick out rights or other substantive participating rights as described in EITF 96 16, Investors Accounting for an Investee When the Investor has a Majority of the Voting Interest but the Minority Shareholder or Shareholders Have Certain Approval or Veto rights. As of June 29, 2005, this consensus was effective immediately for all new or modified agreements, and effective beginning in the first reporting period that ends after December 15, 2005 for all existing agreements. We adopted the consolidation requirements of this consensus in the third quarter 2005 for all new or modified agreements and will adopt the consensus for existing agreements in the first quarter of 2006. There was not a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows upon the adoption of the consolidation requirements of this consensus for all new or modified agreements. We do not believe that there will be a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, upon adopting the consensus for existing agreements. Real Estate Investment Trust. As a real estate investment trust, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes in the U.S. if we meet minimum distribution, income, asset and shareholder tests. However, some of our subsidiaries may be subject to federal and state taxes. In addition, foreign entities may also be subject to the taxes of the host country. An income tax allocation is required to be estimated on our taxable income arising from our taxable REIT subsidiaries and international entities. A deferred tax component could arise based upon the differences in GAAP versus tax income for items such as 43 Table of Contents depreciation and gain recognition. However, we believe deferred tax is an immaterial component of our consolidated balance sheet. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The analysis below includes changes attributable to same store growth, acquisitions, development activity and divestitures. Same store properties are those that we owned during both the current and prior year reporting periods, excluding development properties stabilized after December 31, 2003 (generally defined as properties that are 90% leased or properties for which we have held a certificate of occupancy or where building has been substantially complete for at least 12 months). As of December 31, 2005, same store industrial properties consisted of properties aggregating approximately 72.5 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. During 2005, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 150 buildings, aggregating approximately 10.6 million square feet. In 2004, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 29 industrial buildings, two retail centers and one office, aggregating approximately 4.4 million square feet. Our future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition of additional properties and dispositions. Our future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical results.

These decreases were partially offset by increased occupancy. Industrial same store occupancy was 95.6% at December 31, 2005 and 95.2% at December 31, 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005, rents in the same store portfolio decreased 9.8% on industrial renewals and rollovers (cash basis) on 13.0 million square feet leased due to decreases in market rates. The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2004 and 2005, we continued to acquire properties in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial revenues. The increase in private capital income of $31.0 million was primarily due to incentive distributions for 2005 of $26.4 million for the sale of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, asset 44 Table of Contents management priority distributions from AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., and acquisition fees from AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P.

The 2004 acquisitions consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. The 2005 acquisitions consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2004 and 2005, we continued to acquire properties in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial operating costs. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase of $17.0 million in personnel costs related to additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international and development expansions, and an increase of $1.5 million due to the expansion of satellite offices. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our consolidated co investment joint ventures.

The increase in interest and other income was primarily due to increased bank interest income and a $1.0 million other fee. The 2005 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted primarily from our contribution of $106.9 million (using exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties to our newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. The 2004 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted from our contribution of $71.5 million in operating properties to our unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC. Development profits represent gains from the sale of development projects and land as part of our development for sale program. The increase in development profits was due to increased volume in 2005. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $1.9 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. During 2004, we sold seven land parcels and six development projects as part of our development for sale program, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet for an aggregate price of $40.4 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $6.5 million. During 2004, we also contributed one completed development project into a newly formed unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $2.0 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash.

Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Alliance Fund I for $618.5 million. The multi investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. We received cash and a distribution of an on tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund. During 2004, we divested ourselves of 21 industrial buildings, two retail centers and one office building, aggregating approximately 3.1 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $200.3 million, with a resulting net gain of $42.0 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, rents in the same store portfolio decreased 14.7% on industrial renewals and rollovers (cash basis) on 16.2 million square feet leased due to decreases in market rates. The properties acquired during 2003 consisted of 82 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.5 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2003 and 2004, we continued to acquire properties in France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial revenues. The decrease in private capital income was due to greater incentive fees earned in the prior year.

The 2004 acquisitions consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2003 and 2004, we continued to acquire properties in France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial property operating costs. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The 2003 impairment loss was on investments in real estate and leasehold interests. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased stock based compensation expense of $2.3 million and additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international and development expansions. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our co investment joint ventures. The increase in fund costs was due to additional formation of co investment joint ventures in 2004.

This decrease was offset by the receipt of a lease termination fee at a property in Chicago in the first quarter of 2004. The gains from dispositions of real estate (not classified as discontinued operations) in 2004, resulted from our contribution of $71.5 million in operating properties to our newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC. The gains from disposition of real estate (not classified as discontinued operations) in 2003, resulted from our contribution of $94.0 million in operating properties to our unconsolidated co investment joint venture, Industrial Fund I, LLC. Development profits represent gains from sales from our development for sale and contribution program. During 2004, we sold seven land parcels and six development projects as part of our development for sale program, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet for an aggregate price of $40.4 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $6.5 million. During 2004, we also contributed one completed development project into a newly formed unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $2.0 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. During 2003, we sold seven development for sale and other projects, for an aggregate price of $74.8 million, with a resulting gain of $14.4 million, net of taxes. The increase in interest expense, including amortization, was due to the issuance of additional unsecured debt under our 2002 medium term note program, increased borrowings on the unsecured credit facilities and additional secured debt borrowings in our co investment joint ventures.

In addition, on November 26, 2003, the operating partnership redeemed all 1,300,000 of its outstanding 85/8% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Partnership Units and we recognized a reduction of income available to common stockholders of $1.7 million for the original issuance costs. In June and November 2003, we issued 2,000,000 shares of 6.5% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and 2,300,000 shares of 6.75% Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, respectively. The timing of the newly issued shares contributed to the increase in preferred stock dividends. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Balance Sheet Strategy. In general, we use unsecured lines of credit, unsecured notes, preferred stock and common equity (issued by us and or the operating partnership and its subsidiaries) to capitalize our 100% owned assets. Over time, we plan to retire non recourse, secured debt encumbering our 100% owned assets and replace that debt with unsecured notes. In managing our co investment joint ventures, in general, we use non recourse, secured debt to capitalize our co investment joint ventures. We currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for acquisitions, development, expansion and renovation of properties will include: retained earnings and cash flow from operations; borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities; other forms of secured or unsecured financing; proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the operating partnership (including issuances of limited partnership units in the operating partnership or its subsidiaries); net proceeds from divestitures of properties; private capital contributions from co investment partners; and net proceeds from contribution of properties and completed development projects to our co investment joint ventures. We currently expect that our principal funding requirements will include: working capital; development, expansion and renovation of properties; acquisitions, including our global expansion; debt service; and dividends and distributions on outstanding common and preferred stock and limited partnership units. 49 Table of Contents We believe that our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow from operations, borrowings available under our unsecured credit facilities and our ability to access private and public debt and equity capital, are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Resources Dispositions of Real Estate Interests. During 2005, we recognized a gain of $1.3 million from disposition of real estate interests, representing the additional value received from the contribution of properties in 2004 to AMB SGP Mexico, LLC. During 2005, we contributed $106.9 million (using exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties, consisting of six industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet, to our newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. We recognized a total gain of $17.8 million on the contribution, representing the partial sale of our interests in the contributed properties acquired by the third party investors for cash. Property Divestitures. During 2005, we divested ourselves of 142 industrial buildings and one retail center, aggregating approximately 9.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $926.6 million, with a resulting net gain of $113.6 million. Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Alliance Fund I for $618.5 million. The multi investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. We received cash and a distribution of an on tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund. We also received a net incentive distribution of approximately $26.4 million in cash which is classified under private capital income on the consolidated statement of operations. Development Sales and Contributions. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $1.9 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. Properties Held for Contribution. As of December 31, 2005, we held for contribution to a co investment joint venture one industrial building with an aggregate net book value of $32.8 million, which, when contributed to the joint venture, will reduce our current ownership interest from approximately 98% to an expected range of 20 50%. This asset is not being held for divestiture under SFAS No. 144. Properties Held for Divestiture. As of December 31, 2005, we held for divestiture five industrial buildings and one undeveloped land parcel, which are not in our core markets, do not meet our current strategic objectives or which we have included as part of our development for sale program. The divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. As of December 31, 2005, the net carrying value of the properties held for divestiture was $17.9 million. Expected net sales proceeds exceed the net carrying value of the properties. Co investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund certain acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. We generally consolidate these joint ventures for financial reporting purposes because they are not variable interest entities and because we are the sole managing general partner and control all major operating decisions. However, in certain cases, our co investment joint ventures are unconsolidated because we do not control all major operating decisions. Third party equity interests in the joint ventures are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2005, we owned approximately 54.8 million square feet of our 50 Table of Contents properties (47.7% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so.

As of December 31, 2005, $142.8 million in preferred units with a weighted average rate of 7.87%, issued by the operating partnership, were callable under the terms of the partnership agreement and $102.0 million in preferred units with a weighted average rate of 6.9% become callable in 2006. In December 2005, our board of directors approved a new two year common stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of our common stock. We did not repurchase or retire any shares of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2005. Debt. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, we presently intend to operate with an our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio of approximately 45% or less. As of December 31, 2005, our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio was 34.7%. (See footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratios table below for our definitions of our share of total market capitalization, market equity and our share of total debt.) However, we typically finance our consolidated co investment joint ventures with secured debt at a loan to 52 Table of Contents value ratio of 50 65% per our joint venture partnership agreements. Additionally, we currently intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these policies, however, our organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our management could alter or eliminate these policies without stockholder approval or circumstances could arise that could render us unable to comply with these policies. As of December 31, 2005, the aggregate principal amount of our secured debt was $1.9 billion, excluding unamortized debt premiums of $12.0 million. Of the $1.9 billion of secured debt, $1.4 billion is secured by properties in our joint ventures. The secured debt is generally non recourse and bears interest at rates varying from 0.6% to 10.4% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 5.7%) and final maturity dates ranging from January 2006 to January 2025. As of December 31, 2005, $1.6 billion of the secured debt obligations bears interest at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% while the remaining $291.7 million bears interest at variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 2.1%). As of December 31, 2005, the operating partnership had outstanding an aggregate of $975.0 million in unsecured senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 6.2% and had an average term of 5.2 years. These unsecured senior debt securities include $300.0 million in notes issued in June 1998, $250.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2000 medium term note program, $325.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2002 medium term note program, and approximately $112.5 million of 5.094% Notes Due 2015, which were issued to Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America on July 11, 2005 in a private placement, in exchange for the cancellation of $100 million of notes that were issued in June 1998 resulting in a discount of approximately $12.5 million. The unsecured senior debt securities are subject to various covenants. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to its senior debt securities. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then our cash flow may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Credit Facilities. On June 1, 2004, the operating partnership completed the early renewal of its senior unsecured revolving line of credit in the amount of $500.0 million. We remain a guarantor of the operating partnerships obligations under the credit facility. The three year credit facility includes a multi currency component under which up to $250.0 million can be drawn in Yen, Euros or British Pounds Sterling. The line, which matures in June 2007 and carries a one year extension option, can be increased up to $700.0 million upon certain conditions, and replaces the operating partnerships previous $500.0 million credit facility that was to mature in December 2005. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the operating partnerships long term debt rating, which is currently 60 basis points with an annual facility fee of 20 basis points, based on the current credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt. The operating partnership uses its unsecured credit facility principally for acquisitions, funding development activity and general working capital requirements. The total amount available under the credit facility fluctuates based upon the borrowing base, as defined in the agreement governing the credit facility, which is generally based upon the value of our unencumbered properties. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding balance on the credit facility was $216.8 million and the remaining amount available was $244.8 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $38.4 million (excluding the additional $200.0 million of potential additional capacity). The outstanding balance included borrowings denominated in Euros and Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, would equal approximately $173.1 million and $43.7 million in U.S. dollars, respectively. On June 29, 2004, AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating partnership, entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement providing for loans or letters of credit. On December 8, 2005, the unsecured revolving credit agreement was amended to increase the maximum principal amount outstanding at 53 Table of Contents any time to up to 35.0 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, equaled approximately $297.2 million U.S. dollars, and can be increased to up to 40.0 billion Yen upon certain conditions. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K. under the revolving credit facility, as well as the obligations of any other entity in which the operating partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest, and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the revolving credit agreement. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and for other real estate purposes in Japan. Generally, borrowers under the revolving credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the revolving credit facility with certain real estate assets or equity in entities holding such real estate assets. The revolving credit facility matures in June 2007 and has a one year extension option, which is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.25% of the outstanding commitments under the facility at that time. The rate on the borrowings is generally TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the current credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt and is currently 60 basis points. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, payable in quarterly amounts, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt, and is currently 20 basis points of the outstanding commitments under the facility. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, was $205.8 million in U.S. dollars. On November 24, 2004, AMB Tokai TMK, a Japanese subsidiary of the operating partnership, entered into a secured multi advance project financing, providing for loans in a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of up to 20.0 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, would equal approximately $169.9 million U.S. dollars. The financing agreement is among AMB Tokai TMK, us, the operating partnership, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and a syndicate of banks. We, along with the operating partnership, jointly and severally guarantee AMB Tokai TMKs obligations under the financing agreement, pursuant to a guaranty of payment executed in connection with the project financing. The financing is secured by a mortgage on certain real property located in Tokai, Tokyo, Japan, and matures on October 31, 2006 with a one year extension option. The rate on the borrowings will generally be TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt and is currently 60 basis points per annum, except that AMB Tokai TMK has purchased from Sumitomo an interest rate swap, which has fixed the interest rate payable on a principal amount equal to 13.0 billion Yen at 1.32% per annum plus the applicable margin. In addition, there is an annual commitment fee based on unused commitments, payable quarterly, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt, and is currently 20 basis points of the amount of unused commitments. The financing agreement contains affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. In addition, Sumitomo, AMB Tokai TMK and the operating partnership signed a commitment letter on November 24, 2004, pursuant to which Sumitomo committed to purchase bonds that may be issued by AMB Tokai TMK in an amount between 10.0 billion Yen and 15.0 billion Yen (such amount to be determined by AMB Tokai TMK). The bonds would be secured by the AMB Ohta Distribution Center and would generally accrue interest at a rate of TIBOR plus 1.10% per annum; because the swap purchased by AMB Tokai TMK from Sumitomo is coterminous with the maturity date of the proposed bonds, AMB Tokai TMK will have fixed the interest rate payable on, in general, a principal amount equal to 13.0 billion Yen at 2.42% per annum. The bonds, if issued, would mature on October 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding balance on this financing agreement was 19.5 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, equaled approximately $165.6 million U.S. dollars and is accounted for as wholly owned secured debt. On February 16, 2006, the operating partnership and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries entered into a third amended and restated credit agreement for a $250 million unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility with a maturity date of February 2010, that replaced the then existing $100 million unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility that was to mature in June 2008. As of December 31, 2005, we had an additional outstanding balance of $67.5 million under the then existing facility. 54 Table of Contents Mortgages Receivable. Through a wholly owned subsidiary, we hold a mortgage loan receivable on AMB Pier One, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture. The note bears interest at 13.0% and matures in May 2026. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding balance on the note was $12.8 million. We also hold a loan receivable on G. Accion, an unconsolidated joint venture totaling $8.8 million with an interest rate of 10.0%. The loan matures in November 2006.

(3) Our share of total debt is the pro rata portion of the total debt based on our percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated or unconsolidated ventures holding the debt.

In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of our debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their joint ventures. Our share of total debt is not intended to reflect our actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures. The above table reconciles our share of total debt to total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure. 55 Table of Contents (4) Our secured debt and joint venture debt include debt related to international assets in the amount of $383.0 million. Of this, $250.5 million is associated with assets located in Asia and the remaining $132.5 million is related to assets located in Europe.

Liquidity As of December 31, 2005, we had $232.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and $368.8 million of additional available borrowings under our credit facilities. As of December 31, 2005, we had $34.4 million in restricted cash. Our board of directors declared a regular cash dividend for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 of $0.44 per share of common stock, and the operating partnership announced its intention to pay a regular cash distribution for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 of $0.44 per common unit. The dividends and distributions were payable on January 6, 2006 to stockholders and unitholders of record on December 22, 2005. The series L and M preferred stock dividends were payable on January 16, 2006 to stockholders of record on January 6, 2006. The series E, F, J and K preferred unit quarterly distributions were payable on January 15, 2006. The series O preferred stock dividends are payable on April 15, 2006. The series D, H, I and N preferred unit quarterly distributions were paid on December 25, 2005.

The anticipated size of our distributions, using only cash from operations, will not allow us to retire all of our debt as it comes due. Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would 57 Table of Contents adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Commitments Developments. In addition to recurring capital expenditures, which consist of building improvements and leasing costs incurred to renew or re tenant space, during 2005, we initiated 30 new industrial development projects in North America, Europe and Asia with a total estimated investment of $522.4 million, aggregating an estimated 7.0 million square feet. As of December 31, 2005, we had 47 projects in our development pipeline representing a total estimated investment of $1.1 billion upon completion, of which two industrial projects with a total of 0.3 million square feet and an aggregate estimated investment of $24.5 million upon completion are held in unconsolidated joint ventures. In addition, we held one development project available for sale or contribution, representing a total estimated investment of $32.8 million upon completion. Of the total development pipeline, $681.4 million had been funded as of December 31, 2005 and an estimated $405.2 million was required to complete current and planned projects. We expect to fund these expenditures with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances, net proceeds from property divestitures and private capital from co investment partners, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow. Acquisitions. During 2005, we acquired 41 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet for a total expected investment of $555.0 million, including two buildings that were acquired by two of our unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. Additional acquisition activity in 2005 included the purchase of an approximate 43% unconsolidated equity interest in G.Accion, one of Mexicos largest real estate companies, for $46.1 million. We generally fund our acquisitions through private capital contributions, borrowings under our credit facility, cash, debt issuances and net proceeds from property divestitures. Lease Commitments. We have entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily on tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms from one to 57 years. These operating lease payments are amortized ratably over the terms of the related leases. Future minimum rental payments required under non cancelable operating leases in effect as of December 31, 2005 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2006 $ 20,894 2007 21,036 2008 20,617 2009 20,327 2010 19,997 Thereafter 278,759 Total $ 381,630 Co investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. As of December 31, 2005, we had investments in co investment joint ventures with a gross book value of $2.5 billion, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, and net equity investments in two unconsolidated co investment joint ventures of $26.3 million. As of December 31, 2005, we may make additional capital contributions to current and planned co investment joint ventures of up to $133.7 million (using the exchange rates at December 31, 2005). From time to time, we may raise additional equity commitments for AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open ended consolidated co investment joint venture formed in 2004 with institutional investors, which invest through a private real estate investment trust. This would increase our obligation to make additional capital commitments. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of this fund, we are obligated to contribute 20% of the total equity commitments to the fund until such time our total equity commitment is greater than 58 Table of Contents $150.0 million, at which time, our obligation is reduced to 10% of the total equity commitments. We expect to fund these contributions with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances or net proceeds from property divestitures, which could adversely effect our cash flow. Captive Insurance Company. In December 2001, we formed a wholly owned captive insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., which provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the deductible under our third party policies. We capitalized Arcata National Insurance Ltd. in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata National Insurance Ltd. established annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss experience of our properties. Annually, we engage an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims, related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata National Insurance Ltd. may be adjusted based on this estimate. Premiums paid to Arcata National Insurance Ltd. have a retrospective component, so that if expenses, including losses, deductibles and reserves, are less than premiums collected, the excess may be returned to the property owners (and, in turn, as appropriate, to the customers) and, conversely, subject to certain limitations, if expenses, including losses, deductibles and reserves, are greater than premiums collected, an additional premium will be charged. As with all recoverable expenses, differences between estimated and actual insurance premiums are recognized in the subsequent year. Through this structure, we believe that we have more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market. Potential Unknown Liabilities. Unknown liabilities may include the following: liabilities for clean up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to our formation transactions that had not been asserted prior to our formation transactions; accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; tax liabilities; and claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these entities. Overview of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our debt, interest and lease payments due by period as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands): Less than More than Contractual Obligations 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Total Debt $ 235,911 $ 1,031,938 $ 665,634 $ 1,456,094 $ 3,389,577 Debt interest payments 14,459 46,749 37,056 83,106 181,370 Operating lease commitments 20,894 41,653 49,324 278,759 381,630 Construction commitments 136,600 136,600 Total $ 271,264 $ 1,256,940 $ 743,014 $ 1,817,959 $ 4,089,177 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Standby Letters of Credit. As of December 31, 2005, we had provided approximately $48.7 million in letters of credit, of which $38.4 million was provided under the operating partnerships $500.0 million unsecured credit facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other commitments. Guarantees. As of December 31, 2005, we had outstanding guarantees in the aggregate amount of $128.2 million in connection with certain acquisitions. As of December 31, 2005, we guaranteed $23.4 million 59 Table of Contents and $2.3 million on outstanding loans on two of our consolidated joint ventures and one of our unconsolidated joint ventures, respectively. Performance and Surety Bonds. As of December 31, 2005, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $0.9 million. These bonds were issued in connection with certain of its development projects and were posted to guarantee certain tax obligations and the construction of certain real property improvements and infrastructure, such as grading, sewers and streets. Performance and surety bonds are commonly required by public agencies from real estate developers. Performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the taxes due or the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. Promoted Interests and Other Contractual Obligations. Upon the achievement of certain return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, we may be obligated to make payments to certain of joint venture partners pursuant to the terms and provisions of their contractual agreements with us. From time to time in the normal course of our business, we enter into various contracts with third parties that may obligate us to make payments or perform other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. SUPPLEMENTAL EARNINGS MEASURES FFO. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider funds from operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. FFO is defined as net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, less gains (or losses) from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estate related depreciation, and adjustments to derive our pro rata share of FFO of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. Further, we do not adjust FFO to eliminate the effects of non recurring charges. We believe that FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. We believe that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. 60 Table of Contents The following table reflects the calculation of FFO reconciled from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands): 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Net income(1) $ 257,807 $ 125,471 $ 129,128 $ 121,119 $ 136,200 Gains from dispositions of real estate, net of minority interests(2) (132,652 ) (47,224 ) (50,325 ) (19,383 ) (41,859 ) Real estate, related depreciation and amortization: Total depreciation and amortization 165,438 141,120 116,067 107,097 90,527 Discontinued operations depreciation 14,866 26,230 26,270 29,406 23,016 Non real estate depreciation (3,388 ) (871 ) (720 ) (712 ) (731 ) Ground lease amortization (2,301 ) (1,232 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from consolidated joint ventures: Joint venture partners minority interests (Net income) 36,398 29,544 21,015 15,112 11,288 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Net income) 3,681 2,615 2,378 3,572 4,836 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Development profits) 2,262 435 344 57 764 Discontinued operations minority interests (Net income) 8,502 13,549 16,214 17,745 17,595 FFO attributable to minority interests (100,275 ) (80,192 ) (65,603 ) (52,051 ) (40,144 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures: Our share of net income (10,770 ) (3,781 ) (5,445 ) (5,674 ) (5,467 ) Our share of FFO 14,441 7,549 9,755 9,291 8,014 Our share of development profits, net of taxes 5,441 Preferred stock dividends (7,388 ) (7,131 ) (6,999 ) (8,496 ) (8,500 ) Preferred stock and unit redemption discount (issuance costs) (5,413 ) 412 (7,600 ) Funds from operations $ 254,363 $ 207,314 $ 186,666 $ 215,194 $ 186,707 Basic FFO per common share and unit $ 2.87 $ 2.39 $ 2.17 $ 2.44 $ 2.09 Diluted FFO per common share and unit $ 2.75 $ 2.30 $ 2.13 $ 2.40 $ 2.07 Weighted average common shares and units: Basic 88,684,262 86,885,250 85,859,899 88,204,208 89,286,379 Diluted 92,508,725 90,120,250 87,616,365 89,689,310 90,325,801 61 Table of Contents (1) Includes gains from undepreciated land sales of $25.0 million, $3.7 million and $1.2 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. (2) 2005 includes accumulated depreciation re capture of approximately $1.1 million associated with the sale of the Interstate Crossdock redevelopment project. SS NOI. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider same store net operating income (SS NOI) to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. For properties that are considered part of the same store pool, see Part I, Item 2: Properties Industrial Properties Industrial Market Operating Statistics, Note 5, and Operating and Leasing Statistics Industrial Same Store Operating Statistics, Note 1. In deriving SS NOI, we define NOI as rental revenues (as calculated in accordance with GAAP), including reimbursements, less straight line rents, property operating expenses and real estate taxes. We exclude straight line rents in calculating SS NOI because we believe it provides a better measure of actual cash basis rental growth for a year over year comparison. In addition, we believe that SS NOI helps the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate as compared to other companies. While SS NOI is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. SS NOI also does not reflect general and administrative expenses, interest expenses, depreciation and amortization costs, capital expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development and construction activities that could materially impact our results from operations. Further, our computation of SS NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating SS NOI. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices, interest rates and international exchange rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings and our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2005, we had two outstanding interest rate swaps with aggregate notional amount of $119.5 million (in U.S. dollars). See Financial Instruments below. The table below summarizes the market risks associated with our fixed and variable rate debt outstanding before unamortized debt premiums of $12.0 million as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands): 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total Fixed rate debt(1) $ 165,953 $ 129,214 $ 374,174 $ 190,548 $ 437,934 $ 1,260,015 $ 2,557,838 Average interest rate 6.9 % 7.2 % 6.9 % 5.0 % 6.1 % 6.3 % 6.3 % Variable rate debt(2) $ 69,958 $ 439,944 $ 88,606 $ 36,140 $ 1,012 $ 196,079 $ 831,739 Average interest rate 4.3 % 2.2 % 2.2 % 2.2 % 2.0 % 1.9 % 2.3 % Interest Payments $ 14,459 $ 18,982 $ 27,767 $ 10,322 $ 26,734 $ 83,106 $ 181,370 (1) Represents 75.5% of all outstanding debt. (2) Represents 24.5% of all outstanding debt. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased or decreased by 10%, then the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would be $1.9 million annually. As of December 31, 2005, the book value and the estimated fair value of our total consolidated debt (both secured and unsecured) was $3.4 billion based on our estimate of current market interest rates. 62 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, variable rate debt comprised 24.5% and 15.3%, respectively, of all our outstanding debt. Variable rate debt was $831.7 million and $498.3 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. The increase is primarily due to higher outstanding balances on our credit facilities. This increase in our outstanding variable rate debt increases our risk associated with unfavorable interest rate fluctuations. Financial Instruments. We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income or income. For revenues or expenses denominated in non functional currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments in effect at December 31, 2005 were two interest rate swaps hedging cash flows of our variable rate borrowings based on Euribor (Europe) and Japanese TIBOR (Japan) and two put options hedging against adverse foreign fluctuations of the Mexican Peso and the Euro against the U.S. dollar. The following table summarizes our financial instruments as of December 31, 2005: Maturity Dates January 8, March 31, December 8, October 29, Notional Related Derivatives (In thousands) 2006 2006 2008 2012 Amount Fair Value Interest Rate Swaps: Plain Interest Rate Swap, Japan Notional Amount (U.S. Dollars) $ 110,403 $ 110,403 Receive Floating(%) 3M TIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 1.32 % Fair Market Value $ 760 Plain Interest Rate Swap, Europe Notional Amount (U.S. Dollars) $ 9,118 9,118 Receive Floating(%) 3M EURIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 3.72 % Fair Market Value Foreign Exchange Agreements: Mexico Options to Sell MXN/ Buy USD Contract Amount (U.S. Dollars) $ 4,492 4,492 Contract FX Rate 10.96 Contract Premium $ 64 41 Europe Options to Sell EUR/ Buy (U.S. Dollars) Contract Amount (U.S. Dollars) $ 1,180 1,184 Contract FX Rate 1.18 Contract Premium $ 5 3 Total $ 125,197 $ 631 International Operations. Our exposure to market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries operating in the United States and Mexico. The functional currency for our subsidiaries operating outside North America is generally the local currency of the country in which the entity is located, mitigating the effect of foreign exchange gains and losses. Our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement 63 Table of Contents date. We translate income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. The losses resulting from the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity and totaled $1.8 million for year ended December 31, 2005. Our international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. In these instances, non monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2005, gains from remeasurement and the sale of one foreign exchange agreement included in our results of operations totaled $0.6 million. We also record gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated. We believe that these gains or losses are immaterial. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations GENERAL You should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements. We commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company effective with the completion of our initial public offering on November 26, 1997, and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with our initial tax return for the year ended December 31, 1997. AMB Property Corporation and AMB Property, L.P. were formed shortly before the consummation of our initial public offering. Managements Overview The primary source of our revenue and earnings is rent received from customers under long term (generally three to ten years) operating leases at our properties, including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs, and from partnership distributions and fees from our private capital business. We also produce earnings from the strategic disposition of operating assets, from the disposition of projects in our development for sale or contribution program and from contributions of properties to our co investment joint ventures. Our long term growth is driven by our ability to maintain and increase occupancy rates or increase rental rates at our properties, and by our ability to continue to acquire and develop new properties. National industrial markets improved during 2005 when compared with market conditions in 2004. According to Torto Wheaton Research, the positive trend in demand began in the second quarter of 2004 and reversed 14 prior quarters of negatively trending, or rising, space availability. We believe the protracted period of rising availability created a difficult national leasing environment which is now improving, particularly in large industrial property markets tied to global trade. During the three and a half year period of negatively trending industrial space availability, investor demand for industrial property (as supported by our observation of strong national sales volumes and declining acquisition capitalization rates) remained consistently strong. We believe we capitalized on the demand for acquisition property by accelerating the repositioning of our portfolio through the disposition of non core properties. We plan to continue selling selected assets on an opportunistic basis but believe we have substantially achieved our repositioning goals. U.S. Hub and Total Other Total/Weighted Property Data Gateway Markets(1) Markets(2) Average For the year ended December 31, 2005: % of total rentable square feet 74.9 % 25.1 % 100.0 % Occupancy percentage at year end 96.2 % 94.6 % 95.8 % Same space square footage leased 11,032,482 2,574,944 13,607,426 Rent decreases on renewals and rollovers (10.8 )% (4.3 )% (9.7 )% For the year ended December 31, 2004: % of total rentable square feet 74.1 % 25.9 % 100.0 % Occupancy percentage at year end 95.0 % 94.2 % 94.8 % Same space square footage leased 13,932,213 3,553,563 17,485,776 Rent decreases on renewals and rollovers (15.3 )% (3.6 )% (13.2 )% (1) Our U.S. hub and gateway markets include on tarmac and Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas/ Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Northern New Jersey/ New York City, the San Francisco Bay Area, Miami and Seattle. (2) Our total other markets include other domestic target markets, other non target markets, international target markets and retail. We observed two positive trends nationally for industrial real estate during the year ended December 31, 2005, supported by data provided by Torto Wheaton Research. First, national industrial space availability 39 Table of Contents declined 130 basis points during the year from 10.9% to 9.6%. The availability rate has fallen for seven consecutive quarters, reversing the trend of the prior 14 quarters in which national industrial space availability increased on average 36 basis points per quarter. Second, national absorption of industrial space, defined as the net change in occupied stock as measured by square feet of completions less the change in available square feet, totaled approximately 281 million square feet in the year ended December 31, 2005, substantially exceeding the 183 million square feet of space absorbed in 2004 and well above the previous ten year historical average of 139 million square feet of space absorbed annually. In this improved environment, our industrial portfolios occupancy levels increased to 95.8% at December 31, 2005 from 94.8% at December 31, 2004, which we believe reflects higher levels of demand for industrial space generally and in our portfolio specifically. During the year ended December 31, 2005, our lease expirations totaled approximately 17.6 million square feet while commencements of new or renewed leases totaled approximately 21.3 million square feet, resulting in an increase in our occupancy level of approximately 100 basis points. Rental rates on industrial renewals and rollovers in our portfolio decreased 9.7% during the year ended December 31, 2005 as leases were entered into or renewed at rates consistent with what we believe to be current market levels. We believe this decline in rents on lease renewals and rollovers reflects trends in national industrial space availability. We believe that relatively high levels of national industrial space availability have caused market rents for industrial properties to decline between 10% and 20% from their peak levels in 2001 based on our research data; 42.5% of the space that rolled over in our portfolio in 2005 had commenced between 1999 and 2001. Rental rates in our portfolio declined at successively lower rates in each of the last three quarters during 2005, which we believe indicates a stabilization of market rental rate levels. While the level of rental rate reduction varied by market, we achieved occupancy levels in our portfolio 540 basis points in excess of the national industrial market, as determined by Torto Wheaton Research, by pricing lease renewals and new leases with sensitivity to local market conditions. During periods of decreasing or stabilizing rental rates, we strove to sign leases with shorter terms to prevent locking in lower rent levels for long periods and to be prepared to sign new, longer term leases during periods of growing rental rates. When we sign leases of shorter duration, we attempt to limit overall leasing costs and capital expenditures by offering different grades of tenant improvement packages, appropriate to the lease term. We expect development to be a significant driver of our earnings growth as we expand our land and development pipeline, and contribute completed development projects into our co investment program and recognize development profits. We believe that development, renovation and expansion of well located, high quality industrial properties should generally continue to provide us with attractive investment opportunities at a higher rate of return than we may obtain from the purchase of existing properties. We believe that our development opportunities in Mexico and Japan are particularly attractive given the current lack of supply of modern industrial distribution facilities in the major metropolitan markets of these countries. Globally, we have increased our development pipeline from $106.8 million at the end of 2002 to approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2005. In addition to our committed development pipeline, we hold a total of 1,307 acres for future development or sale. We believe these 1,307 acres of land could support approximately 24.3 million square feet of future development. Going forward, we believe that our co investment program with private capital investors will continue to serve as a significant source of revenues and capital for acquisitions. Through these co investment joint ventures, we typically earn acquisition and development fees, asset management fees and priority distributions, as well as promoted interests and incentive distributions based on the performance of the co investment joint ventures; however, we can not assure you that we will continue to do so. Through contribution of development properties to our co investment joint ventures, we expect to recognize value creation from our development pipeline. As of December 31, 2005, we owned approximately 54.8 million square feet of our properties (47.7% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these co investment joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. 40 Table of Contents By the end of 2007, we plan to have approximately 15% of our operating portfolio (based on both consolidated and unconsolidated annualized base rent) invested in international markets. Our North American target markets outside of the United States currently include Guadalajara, Mexico City, Monterrey and Toronto. Our European target markets currently include Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt, Hamburg, London, Lyon, Madrid, Milan and Paris. Our Asian target markets currently include Beijing, Busan, Nagoya, Osaka, the Pearl River Delta, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore and Tokyo. It is possible that our target markets will change over time to reflect experience, market opportunities, customer needs and changes in global distribution patterns. As of December 31, 2005, our international operating properties comprised 7.1% of our annualized base rents, including properties owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust, we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income. As a result, we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our on going operations to the same extent that other corporations that are not real estate investment trusts can. We must continue to raise capital in both the debt and equity markets to fund our working capital needs, acquisitions and developments. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for a complete discussion of the sources of our capital. Summary of Key Transactions in 2005 During the year ended December 31, 2005, we completed the following significant capital deployment transactions: Acquired 41 buildings in North America, Europe and Asia, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet, for $555.0 million, including two buildings that were acquired by two of our unconsolidated co investment joint ventures; Acquired an approximate 43% unconsolidated equity interest in G.Accion, one of Mexicos largest real estate companies for $46.1 million; Committed to 30 development projects in North America, Europe and Asia totaling 7.0 million square feet with an estimated total investment of approximately $522.4 million; Acquired 341 acres of land for industrial warehouse development in North America, Europe and Asia for approximately $193.9 million; Sold five land parcels and five development projects available for sale, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet, for an aggregate price of approximately $155.2 million; and Divested ourselves of 142 industrial buildings and one retail center aggregating approximately 9.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of approximately $926.6 million. Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Alliance Fund I for $618.5 million. The multi investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. We received cash and a distribution of an on tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund. We also received a net incentive distribution of approximately $26.4 million in cash. See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our acquisition, development and disposition activity. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we completed the following significant capital markets and other financing transactions: Formed an unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., with planned investment of capacity of approximately 247.3 billion Yen ($2.1 billion U.S. dollars, using exchange rate at December 31, 2005). We contributed $106.9 million (using exchange rate in effect at contribution) of operating properties to the fund; Contributed an industrial property for $23.6 million to AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, an unconsolidated co investment joint venture; 41 Table of Contents Obtained $69.7 million of debt (using exchange rates in effect at applicable quarter end dates) with a weighted average interest rate of 3.8% for international acquisitions; Assumed $62.8 million of debt for our consolidated co investment joint ventures at a weighted average interest rate of 7.4%; Obtained long term secured debt financings for our co investment joint ventures of $139.7 million with a weighted average rate of 5.4%; Exchanged $100.0 million of 6.9% Reset Put Securities for approximately $112.5 million of 5.094% Notes due 2015; Raised $72.3 million in net proceeds from the issuance of $75.0 million of our 7.0% Series O Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock; and Issued $175.0 million of unsecured senior debt securities due 2010. See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 6, 9 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our capital markets transactions. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Investments in Real Estate. Investments in real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. We also record at acquisition an intangible asset or liability for the value attributable to above or below market leases, in place leases and lease origination costs for all acquisitions. Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a property by property basis quarterly and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable. Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying amount of the property. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future market conditions and the availability of capital. Examples of certain situations that could affect future cash flows of a property may include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in occupancy; unforeseen bankruptcy, lease termination and move out of a major customer; or a significant decrease in annual base rents of that property. If impairment analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying amount of our long lived assets could occur in the future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings. Revenue Recognition. We record rental revenue from operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts, security deposits and letters of credit, then we may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our customers on an on going basis by reviewing their financial condition periodically as appropriate. Each period we review our outstanding accounts receivable, including straight line rents, for doubtful accounts and 42 Table of Contents provide allowances as needed. We also record lease termination fees when a customer has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us. If a customer remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement, the applicable termination fees are deferred and recognized over the term of such customers occupancy. Property Dispositions. We report real estate dispositions in three separate categories on our consolidated statements of operations. First, when we divest a portion of our interests in real estate entities or properties, gains from the sale represent the interests acquired by third party investors for cash. Second, we dispose of value added conversion projects and build to suit and speculative development projects for which we have not generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable. Lastly, beginning in 2002, SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, required us to separately report as discontinued operations the historical operating results attributable to operating properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the properties. The consolidated statements of operations for prior periods are also adjusted to conform with this classification. There is no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial position, net income or cash flows. In all cases, gains and losses are recognized using the full accrual method of accounting. Gains relating to transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met. Joint Ventures. We hold interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We determine consolidation based on standards set forth in EITF 96 16, Investors Accounting for an Investee When the Investor Has a Majority of the Voting Interest but the Minority Shareholder or Shareholders Have Certain Approval or Veto Rights, Statement of Position 78 9, Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures and FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN 46. Based on the guidance set forth in these pronouncements, we consolidate certain joint venture investments because we exercise significant control over major operating decisions, such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, asset management, investment activity and changes in financing. For joint ventures that are variable interest entities as defined under FIN 46 where we are not the primary beneficiaries, we do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. For joint ventures where we do not exercise significant control over major operating and management decisions, but where we exercise significant influence, we use the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. In June 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued EITF 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights. Under this consensus, a sole general partner is presumed to control a limited partnership (or similar entity) and should consolidate that entity unless the limited partners possess kick out rights or other substantive participating rights as described in EITF 96 16, Investors Accounting for an Investee When the Investor has a Majority of the Voting Interest but the Minority Shareholder or Shareholders Have Certain Approval or Veto rights. As of June 29, 2005, this consensus was effective immediately for all new or modified agreements, and effective beginning in the first reporting period that ends after December 15, 2005 for all existing agreements. We adopted the consolidation requirements of this consensus in the third quarter 2005 for all new or modified agreements and will adopt the consensus for existing agreements in the first quarter of 2006. There was not a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows upon the adoption of the consolidation requirements of this consensus for all new or modified agreements. We do not believe that there will be a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, upon adopting the consensus for existing agreements. Real Estate Investment Trust. As a real estate investment trust, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes in the U.S. if we meet minimum distribution, income, asset and shareholder tests. However, some of our subsidiaries may be subject to federal and state taxes. In addition, foreign entities may also be subject to the taxes of the host country. An income tax allocation is required to be estimated on our taxable income arising from our taxable REIT subsidiaries and international entities. A deferred tax component could arise based upon the differences in GAAP versus tax income for items such as 43 Table of Contents depreciation and gain recognition. However, we believe deferred tax is an immaterial component of our consolidated balance sheet. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The analysis below includes changes attributable to same store growth, acquisitions, development activity and divestitures. Same store properties are those that we owned during both the current and prior year reporting periods, excluding development properties stabilized after December 31, 2003 (generally defined as properties that are 90% leased or properties for which we have held a certificate of occupancy or where building has been substantially complete for at least 12 months). As of December 31, 2005, same store industrial properties consisted of properties aggregating approximately 72.5 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. During 2005, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 150 buildings, aggregating approximately 10.6 million square feet. In 2004, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 29 industrial buildings, two retail centers and one office, aggregating approximately 4.4 million square feet. Our future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition of additional properties and dispositions. Our future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical results.

These decreases were partially offset by increased occupancy. Industrial same store occupancy was 95.6% at December 31, 2005 and 95.2% at December 31, 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005, rents in the same store portfolio decreased 9.8% on industrial renewals and rollovers (cash basis) on 13.0 million square feet leased due to decreases in market rates. The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2004 and 2005, we continued to acquire properties in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial revenues. The increase in private capital income of $31.0 million was primarily due to incentive distributions for 2005 of $26.4 million for the sale of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, asset 44 Table of Contents management priority distributions from AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., and acquisition fees from AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P.

The 2004 acquisitions consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. The 2005 acquisitions consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2004 and 2005, we continued to acquire properties in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial operating costs. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase of $17.0 million in personnel costs related to additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international and development expansions, and an increase of $1.5 million due to the expansion of satellite offices. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our consolidated co investment joint ventures.

The increase in interest and other income was primarily due to increased bank interest income and a $1.0 million other fee. The 2005 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted primarily from our contribution of $106.9 million (using exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties to our newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. The 2004 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted from our contribution of $71.5 million in operating properties to our unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC. Development profits represent gains from the sale of development projects and land as part of our development for sale program. The increase in development profits was due to increased volume in 2005. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $1.9 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. During 2004, we sold seven land parcels and six development projects as part of our development for sale program, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet for an aggregate price of $40.4 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $6.5 million. During 2004, we also contributed one completed development project into a newly formed unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $2.0 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash.

Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Alliance Fund I for $618.5 million. The multi investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. We received cash and a distribution of an on tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund. During 2004, we divested ourselves of 21 industrial buildings, two retail centers and one office building, aggregating approximately 3.1 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $200.3 million, with a resulting net gain of $42.0 million.

The increase in preferred stock dividends is due to the newly issued shares. 46 Table of Contents For the Years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 (dollars in millions) Revenues 2004 2003 $ Change % Change Rental revenues U.S. industrial: Same store $ 514.1 $ 485.4 $ 28.7 5.9 % 2004 acquisitions 25.2 25.2 % Development 6.2 6.9 (0.7 ) (10.1 )% Other industrial 7.7 4.4 3.3 75.0 % International industrial 25.2 6.1 19.1 313.1 % Retail 1.1 0.9 0.2 22.2 % Total rental revenues 579.5 503.7 75.8 15.0 % Private capital income 12.9 13.3 (0.4 ) (3.0 )% Total revenues $ 592.4 $ 517.0 $ 75.4 14.6 % The increase in U.S. industrial same store rental revenues was primarily driven by increased lease termination fees. Industrial same store occupancy was 95.2% at December 31, 2004 and 93.0% at December 31, 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2004, rents in the same store portfolio decreased 14.7% on industrial renewals and rollovers (cash basis) on 16.2 million square feet leased due to decreases in market rates. The properties acquired during 2003 consisted of 82 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.5 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2003 and 2004, we continued to acquire properties in France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial revenues. The decrease in private capital income was due to greater incentive fees earned in the prior year.

The 2004 acquisitions consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2003 and 2004, we continued to acquire properties in France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial property operating costs. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The 2003 impairment loss was on investments in real estate and leasehold interests. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased stock based compensation expense of $2.3 million and additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international and development expansions. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our co investment joint ventures. The increase in fund costs was due to additional formation of co investment joint ventures in 2004.

This decrease was offset by the receipt of a lease termination fee at a property in Chicago in the first quarter of 2004. The gains from dispositions of real estate (not classified as discontinued operations) in 2004, resulted from our contribution of $71.5 million in operating properties to our newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC. The gains from disposition of real estate (not classified as discontinued operations) in 2003, resulted from our contribution of $94.0 million in operating properties to our unconsolidated co investment joint venture, Industrial Fund I, LLC. Development profits represent gains from sales from our development for sale and contribution program. During 2004, we sold seven land parcels and six development projects as part of our development for sale program, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet for an aggregate price of $40.4 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $6.5 million. During 2004, we also contributed one completed development project into a newly formed unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $2.0 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. During 2003, we sold seven development for sale and other projects, for an aggregate price of $74.8 million, with a resulting gain of $14.4 million, net of taxes. The increase in interest expense, including amortization, was due to the issuance of additional unsecured debt under our 2002 medium term note program, increased borrowings on the unsecured credit facilities and additional secured debt borrowings in our co investment joint ventures.

During 2003, we divested ourselves of 24 industrial buildings and two retail centers, aggregating approximately 2.8 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $272.3 million, with a resulting net gain of $42.9 million.

In addition, on November 26, 2003, the operating partnership redeemed all 1,300,000 of its outstanding 85/8% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Partnership Units and we recognized a reduction of income available to common stockholders of $1.7 million for the original issuance costs. In June and November 2003, we issued 2,000,000 shares of 6.5% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and 2,300,000 shares of 6.75% Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, respectively. The timing of the newly issued shares contributed to the increase in preferred stock dividends. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Balance Sheet Strategy. In general, we use unsecured lines of credit, unsecured notes, preferred stock and common equity (issued by us and or the operating partnership and its subsidiaries) to capitalize our 100% owned assets. Over time, we plan to retire non recourse, secured debt encumbering our 100% owned assets and replace that debt with unsecured notes. In managing our co investment joint ventures, in general, we use non recourse, secured debt to capitalize our co investment joint ventures. We currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for acquisitions, development, expansion and renovation of properties will include: retained earnings and cash flow from operations; borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities; other forms of secured or unsecured financing; proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the operating partnership (including issuances of limited partnership units in the operating partnership or its subsidiaries); net proceeds from divestitures of properties; private capital contributions from co investment partners; and net proceeds from contribution of properties and completed development projects to our co investment joint ventures. We currently expect that our principal funding requirements will include: working capital; development, expansion and renovation of properties; acquisitions, including our global expansion; debt service; and dividends and distributions on outstanding common and preferred stock and limited partnership units. 49 Table of Contents We believe that our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow from operations, borrowings available under our unsecured credit facilities and our ability to access private and public debt and equity capital, are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Resources Dispositions of Real Estate Interests. During 2005, we recognized a gain of $1.3 million from disposition of real estate interests, representing the additional value received from the contribution of properties in 2004 to AMB SGP Mexico, LLC. During 2005, we contributed $106.9 million (using exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties, consisting of six industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet, to our newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. We recognized a total gain of $17.8 million on the contribution, representing the partial sale of our interests in the contributed properties acquired by the third party investors for cash. Property Divestitures. During 2005, we divested ourselves of 142 industrial buildings and one retail center, aggregating approximately 9.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $926.6 million, with a resulting net gain of $113.6 million. Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Alliance Fund I for $618.5 million. The multi investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. We received cash and a distribution of an on tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund. We also received a net incentive distribution of approximately $26.4 million in cash which is classified under private capital income on the consolidated statement of operations. Development Sales and Contributions. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $1.9 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. Properties Held for Contribution. As of December 31, 2005, we held for contribution to a co investment joint venture one industrial building with an aggregate net book value of $32.8 million, which, when contributed to the joint venture, will reduce our current ownership interest from approximately 98% to an expected range of 20 50%. This asset is not being held for divestiture under SFAS No. 144. Properties Held for Divestiture. As of December 31, 2005, we held for divestiture five industrial buildings and one undeveloped land parcel, which are not in our core markets, do not meet our current strategic objectives or which we have included as part of our development for sale program. The divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. As of December 31, 2005, the net carrying value of the properties held for divestiture was $17.9 million. Expected net sales proceeds exceed the net carrying value of the properties. Co investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund certain acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. We generally consolidate these joint ventures for financial reporting purposes because they are not variable interest entities and because we are the sole managing general partner and control all major operating decisions. However, in certain cases, our co investment joint ventures are unconsolidated because we do not control all major operating decisions. Third party equity interests in the joint ventures are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2005, we owned approximately 54.8 million square feet of our 50 Table of Contents properties (47.7% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so.

The series M preferred stock is redeemable by us on or after November 25, 2008, subject to certain conditions, for cash at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends theron, if any, to the redemption date. We contributed the net proceeds of $55.4 million to the operating partnership, and in exchange, the operating partnership issued to us 2,300,000 6.75% Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units. On September 24, 2004, AMB Property II, L.P., a partnership in which Texas AMB I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and our indirect subsidiary, owns an approximate 1.0% general partnership interest and the operating partnership owns an approximate 99% common limited partnership interest, issued 729,582 5.0% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units at a price of $50.00 per unit. The series N preferred units were issued to Robert Pattillo Properties, Inc. in exchange for the contribution of certain parcels of land that are located in multiple markets to AMB Property II, L.P. Effective January 27, 2006, Robert Pattillo Properties, Inc. exercised its rights under its Put Agreement, dated September 24, 2004, with the operating partnership, and sold all of its series N preferred units to the operating partnership at a price equal to $50.00 per unit, plus all accrued and unpaid distributions to the date of such sale. Also on January 27, 2006, AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased all of the series N preferred units from the operating partnership at a price equal to $50.00 per unit, plus all accrued and unpaid distributions to the date of such sale and cancelled all of the outstanding series N preferred units as of such date. As of December 31, 2005, $142.8 million in preferred units with a weighted average rate of 7.87%, issued by the operating partnership, were callable under the terms of the partnership agreement and $102.0 million in preferred units with a weighted average rate of 6.9% become callable in 2006. In December 2005, our board of directors approved a new two year common stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of our common stock. We did not repurchase or retire any shares of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2005. Debt. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, we presently intend to operate with an our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio of approximately 45% or less. As of December 31, 2005, our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio was 34.7%. (See footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratios table below for our definitions of our share of total market capitalization, market equity and our share of total debt.) However, we typically finance our consolidated co investment joint ventures with secured debt at a loan to 52 Table of Contents value ratio of 50 65% per our joint venture partnership agreements. Additionally, we currently intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these policies, however, our organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our management could alter or eliminate these policies without stockholder approval or circumstances could arise that could render us unable to comply with these policies. As of December 31, 2005, the aggregate principal amount of our secured debt was $1.9 billion, excluding unamortized debt premiums of $12.0 million. Of the $1.9 billion of secured debt, $1.4 billion is secured by properties in our joint ventures. The secured debt is generally non recourse and bears interest at rates varying from 0.6% to 10.4% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 5.7%) and final maturity dates ranging from January 2006 to January 2025. As of December 31, 2005, $1.6 billion of the secured debt obligations bears interest at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% while the remaining $291.7 million bears interest at variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 2.1%). As of December 31, 2005, the operating partnership had outstanding an aggregate of $975.0 million in unsecured senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 6.2% and had an average term of 5.2 years. These unsecured senior debt securities include $300.0 million in notes issued in June 1998, $250.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2000 medium term note program, $325.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2002 medium term note program, and approximately $112.5 million of 5.094% Notes Due 2015, which were issued to Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America on July 11, 2005 in a private placement, in exchange for the cancellation of $100 million of notes that were issued in June 1998 resulting in a discount of approximately $12.5 million. The unsecured senior debt securities are subject to various covenants. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to its senior debt securities. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then our cash flow may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Credit Facilities. On June 1, 2004, the operating partnership completed the early renewal of its senior unsecured revolving line of credit in the amount of $500.0 million. We remain a guarantor of the operating partnerships obligations under the credit facility. The three year credit facility includes a multi currency component under which up to $250.0 million can be drawn in Yen, Euros or British Pounds Sterling. The line, which matures in June 2007 and carries a one year extension option, can be increased up to $700.0 million upon certain conditions, and replaces the operating partnerships previous $500.0 million credit facility that was to mature in December 2005. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the operating partnerships long term debt rating, which is currently 60 basis points with an annual facility fee of 20 basis points, based on the current credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt. The operating partnership uses its unsecured credit facility principally for acquisitions, funding development activity and general working capital requirements. The total amount available under the credit facility fluctuates based upon the borrowing base, as defined in the agreement governing the credit facility, which is generally based upon the value of our unencumbered properties. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding balance on the credit facility was $216.8 million and the remaining amount available was $244.8 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $38.4 million (excluding the additional $200.0 million of potential additional capacity). The outstanding balance included borrowings denominated in Euros and Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, would equal approximately $173.1 million and $43.7 million in U.S. dollars, respectively. On June 29, 2004, AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating partnership, entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement providing for loans or letters of credit. On December 8, 2005, the unsecured revolving credit agreement was amended to increase the maximum principal amount outstanding at 53 Table of Contents any time to up to 35.0 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, equaled approximately $297.2 million U.S. dollars, and can be increased to up to 40.0 billion Yen upon certain conditions. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K. under the revolving credit facility, as well as the obligations of any other entity in which the operating partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest, and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the revolving credit agreement. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and for other real estate purposes in Japan. Generally, borrowers under the revolving credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the revolving credit facility with certain real estate assets or equity in entities holding such real estate assets. The revolving credit facility matures in June 2007 and has a one year extension option, which is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.25% of the outstanding commitments under the facility at that time. The rate on the borrowings is generally TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the current credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt and is currently 60 basis points. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, payable in quarterly amounts, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt, and is currently 20 basis points of the outstanding commitments under the facility. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, was $205.8 million in U.S. dollars. On November 24, 2004, AMB Tokai TMK, a Japanese subsidiary of the operating partnership, entered into a secured multi advance project financing, providing for loans in a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of up to 20.0 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, would equal approximately $169.9 million U.S. dollars. The financing agreement is among AMB Tokai TMK, us, the operating partnership, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and a syndicate of banks. We, along with the operating partnership, jointly and severally guarantee AMB Tokai TMKs obligations under the financing agreement, pursuant to a guaranty of payment executed in connection with the project financing. The financing is secured by a mortgage on certain real property located in Tokai, Tokyo, Japan, and matures on October 31, 2006 with a one year extension option. The rate on the borrowings will generally be TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt and is currently 60 basis points per annum, except that AMB Tokai TMK has purchased from Sumitomo an interest rate swap, which has fixed the interest rate payable on a principal amount equal to 13.0 billion Yen at 1.32% per annum plus the applicable margin. In addition, there is an annual commitment fee based on unused commitments, payable quarterly, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt, and is currently 20 basis points of the amount of unused commitments. The financing agreement contains affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. In addition, Sumitomo, AMB Tokai TMK and the operating partnership signed a commitment letter on November 24, 2004, pursuant to which Sumitomo committed to purchase bonds that may be issued by AMB Tokai TMK in an amount between 10.0 billion Yen and 15.0 billion Yen (such amount to be determined by AMB Tokai TMK). The bonds would be secured by the AMB Ohta Distribution Center and would generally accrue interest at a rate of TIBOR plus 1.10% per annum; because the swap purchased by AMB Tokai TMK from Sumitomo is coterminous with the maturity date of the proposed bonds, AMB Tokai TMK will have fixed the interest rate payable on, in general, a principal amount equal to 13.0 billion Yen at 2.42% per annum. The bonds, if issued, would mature on October 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding balance on this financing agreement was 19.5 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, equaled approximately $165.6 million U.S. dollars and is accounted for as wholly owned secured debt. On February 16, 2006, the operating partnership and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries entered into a third amended and restated credit agreement for a $250 million unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility with a maturity date of February 2010, that replaced the then existing $100 million unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility that was to mature in June 2008. As of December 31, 2005, we had an additional outstanding balance of $67.5 million under the then existing facility. 54 Table of Contents Mortgages Receivable. Through a wholly owned subsidiary, we hold a mortgage loan receivable on AMB Pier One, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture. The note bears interest at 13.0% and matures in May 2026. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding balance on the note was $12.8 million. We also hold a loan receivable on G. Accion, an unconsolidated joint venture totaling $8.8 million with an interest rate of 10.0%. The loan matures in November 2006.

Liquidity As of December 31, 2005, we had $232.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and $368.8 million of additional available borrowings under our credit facilities. As of December 31, 2005, we had $34.4 million in restricted cash. Our board of directors declared a regular cash dividend for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 of $0.44 per share of common stock, and the operating partnership announced its intention to pay a regular cash distribution for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 of $0.44 per common unit. The dividends and distributions were payable on January 6, 2006 to stockholders and unitholders of record on December 22, 2005. The series L and M preferred stock dividends were payable on January 16, 2006 to stockholders of record on January 6, 2006. The series E, F, J and K preferred unit quarterly distributions were payable on January 15, 2006. The series O preferred stock dividends are payable on April 15, 2006. The series D, H, I and N preferred unit quarterly distributions were paid on December 25, 2005.

The anticipated size of our distributions, using only cash from operations, will not allow us to retire all of our debt as it comes due. Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would 57 Table of Contents adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Commitments Developments. In addition to recurring capital expenditures, which consist of building improvements and leasing costs incurred to renew or re tenant space, during 2005, we initiated 30 new industrial development projects in North America, Europe and Asia with a total estimated investment of $522.4 million, aggregating an estimated 7.0 million square feet. As of December 31, 2005, we had 47 projects in our development pipeline representing a total estimated investment of $1.1 billion upon completion, of which two industrial projects with a total of 0.3 million square feet and an aggregate estimated investment of $24.5 million upon completion are held in unconsolidated joint ventures. In addition, we held one development project available for sale or contribution, representing a total estimated investment of $32.8 million upon completion. Of the total development pipeline, $681.4 million had been funded as of December 31, 2005 and an estimated $405.2 million was required to complete current and planned projects. We expect to fund these expenditures with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances, net proceeds from property divestitures and private capital from co investment partners, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow. Acquisitions. During 2005, we acquired 41 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet for a total expected investment of $555.0 million, including two buildings that were acquired by two of our unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. Additional acquisition activity in 2005 included the purchase of an approximate 43% unconsolidated equity interest in G.Accion, one of Mexicos largest real estate companies, for $46.1 million. We generally fund our acquisitions through private capital contributions, borrowings under our credit facility, cash, debt issuances and net proceeds from property divestitures. Lease Commitments. We have entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily on tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms from one to 57 years. These operating lease payments are amortized ratably over the terms of the related leases. Future minimum rental payments required under non cancelable operating leases in effect as of December 31, 2005 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2006 $ 20,894 2007 21,036 2008 20,617 2009 20,327 2010 19,997 Thereafter 278,759 Total $ 381,630 Co investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. As of December 31, 2005, we had investments in co investment joint ventures with a gross book value of $2.5 billion, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, and net equity investments in two unconsolidated co investment joint ventures of $26.3 million. As of December 31, 2005, we may make additional capital contributions to current and planned co investment joint ventures of up to $133.7 million (using the exchange rates at December 31, 2005). From time to time, we may raise additional equity commitments for AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open ended consolidated co investment joint venture formed in 2004 with institutional investors, which invest through a private real estate investment trust. This would increase our obligation to make additional capital commitments. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of this fund, we are obligated to contribute 20% of the total equity commitments to the fund until such time our total equity commitment is greater than 58 Table of Contents $150.0 million, at which time, our obligation is reduced to 10% of the total equity commitments. We expect to fund these contributions with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances or net proceeds from property divestitures, which could adversely effect our cash flow. Captive Insurance Company. In December 2001, we formed a wholly owned captive insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., which provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the deductible under our third party policies. We capitalized Arcata National Insurance Ltd. in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata National Insurance Ltd. established annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss experience of our properties. Annually, we engage an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims, related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata National Insurance Ltd. may be adjusted based on this estimate. Premiums paid to Arcata National Insurance Ltd. have a retrospective component, so that if expenses, including losses, deductibles and reserves, are less than premiums collected, the excess may be returned to the property owners (and, in turn, as appropriate, to the customers) and, conversely, subject to certain limitations, if expenses, including losses, deductibles and reserves, are greater than premiums collected, an additional premium will be charged. As with all recoverable expenses, differences between estimated and actual insurance premiums are recognized in the subsequent year. Through this structure, we believe that we have more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market. Potential Unknown Liabilities. Unknown liabilities may include the following: liabilities for clean up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to our formation transactions that had not been asserted prior to our formation transactions; accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; tax liabilities; and claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these entities.

The letters of credit were required to be issued under certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other commitments. Guarantees. As of December 31, 2005, we had outstanding guarantees in the aggregate amount of $128.2 million in connection with certain acquisitions. As of December 31, 2005, we guaranteed $23.4 million 59 Table of Contents and $2.3 million on outstanding loans on two of our consolidated joint ventures and one of our unconsolidated joint ventures, respectively. Performance and Surety Bonds. As of December 31, 2005, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $0.9 million. These bonds were issued in connection with certain of its development projects and were posted to guarantee certain tax obligations and the construction of certain real property improvements and infrastructure, such as grading, sewers and streets. Performance and surety bonds are commonly required by public agencies from real estate developers. Performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the taxes due or the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. Promoted Interests and Other Contractual Obligations. Upon the achievement of certain return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, we may be obligated to make payments to certain of joint venture partners pursuant to the terms and provisions of their contractual agreements with us. From time to time in the normal course of our business, we enter into various contracts with third parties that may obligate us to make payments or perform other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. SUPPLEMENTAL EARNINGS MEASURES FFO. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider funds from operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. FFO is defined as net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, less gains (or losses) from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estate related depreciation, and adjustments to derive our pro rata share of FFO of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. Further, we do not adjust FFO to eliminate the effects of non recurring charges. We believe that FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. We believe that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. 60 Table of Contents The following table reflects the calculation of FFO reconciled from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands): 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Net income(1) $ 257,807 $ 125,471 $ 129,128 $ 121,119 $ 136,200 Gains from dispositions of real estate, net of minority interests(2) (132,652 ) (47,224 ) (50,325 ) (19,383 ) (41,859 ) Real estate, related depreciation and amortization: Total depreciation and amortization 165,438 141,120 116,067 107,097 90,527 Discontinued operations depreciation 14,866 26,230 26,270 29,406 23,016 Non real estate depreciation (3,388 ) (871 ) (720 ) (712 ) (731 ) Ground lease amortization (2,301 ) (1,232 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from consolidated joint ventures: Joint venture partners minority interests (Net income) 36,398 29,544 21,015 15,112 11,288 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Net income) 3,681 2,615 2,378 3,572 4,836 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Development profits) 2,262 435 344 57 764 Discontinued operations minority interests (Net income) 8,502 13,549 16,214 17,745 17,595 FFO attributable to minority interests (100,275 ) (80,192 ) (65,603 ) (52,051 ) (40,144 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures: Our share of net income (10,770 ) (3,781 ) (5,445 ) (5,674 ) (5,467 ) Our share of FFO 14,441 7,549 9,755 9,291 8,014 Our share of development profits, net of taxes 5,441 Preferred stock dividends (7,388 ) (7,131 ) (6,999 ) (8,496 ) (8,500 ) Preferred stock and unit redemption discount (issuance costs) (5,413 ) 412 (7,600 ) Funds from operations $ 254,363 $ 207,314 $ 186,666 $ 215,194 $ 186,707 Basic FFO per common share and unit $ 2.87 $ 2.39 $ 2.17 $ 2.44 $ 2.09 Diluted FFO per common share and unit $ 2.75 $ 2.30 $ 2.13 $ 2.40 $ 2.07 Weighted average common shares and units: Basic 88,684,262 86,885,250 85,859,899 88,204,208 89,286,379 Diluted 92,508,725 90,120,250 87,616,365 89,689,310 90,325,801 61 Table of Contents (1) Includes gains from undepreciated land sales of $25.0 million, $3.7 million and $1.2 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. (2) 2005 includes accumulated depreciation re capture of approximately $1.1 million associated with the sale of the Interstate Crossdock redevelopment project. SS NOI. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider same store net operating income (SS NOI) to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. For properties that are considered part of the same store pool, see Part I, Item 2: Properties Industrial Properties Industrial Market Operating Statistics, Note 5, and Operating and Leasing Statistics Industrial Same Store Operating Statistics, Note 1. In deriving SS NOI, we define NOI as rental revenues (as calculated in accordance with GAAP), including reimbursements, less straight line rents, property operating expenses and real estate taxes. We exclude straight line rents in calculating SS NOI because we believe it provides a better measure of actual cash basis rental growth for a year over year comparison. In addition, we believe that SS NOI helps the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate as compared to other companies. While SS NOI is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. SS NOI also does not reflect general and administrative expenses, interest expenses, depreciation and amortization costs, capital expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development and construction activities that could materially impact our results from operations. Further, our computation of SS NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating SS NOI. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices, interest rates and international exchange rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings and our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2005, we had two outstanding interest rate swaps with aggregate notional amount of $119.5 million (in U.S. dollars). See Financial Instruments below. The table below summarizes the market risks associated with our fixed and variable rate debt outstanding before unamortized debt premiums of $12.0 million as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands): 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total Fixed rate debt(1) $ 165,953 $ 129,214 $ 374,174 $ 190,548 $ 437,934 $ 1,260,015 $ 2,557,838 Average interest rate 6.9 % 7.2 % 6.9 % 5.0 % 6.1 % 6.3 % 6.3 % Variable rate debt(2) $ 69,958 $ 439,944 $ 88,606 $ 36,140 $ 1,012 $ 196,079 $ 831,739 Average interest rate 4.3 % 2.2 % 2.2 % 2.2 % 2.0 % 1.9 % 2.3 % Interest Payments $ 14,459 $ 18,982 $ 27,767 $ 10,322 $ 26,734 $ 83,106 $ 181,370 (1) Represents 75.5% of all outstanding debt. (2) Represents 24.5% of all outstanding debt. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased or decreased by 10%, then the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would be $1.9 million annually. As of December 31, 2005, the book value and the estimated fair value of our total consolidated debt (both secured and unsecured) was $3.4 billion based on our estimate of current market interest rates. 62 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, variable rate debt comprised 24.5% and 15.3%, respectively, of all our outstanding debt. Variable rate debt was $831.7 million and $498.3 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. The increase is primarily due to higher outstanding balances on our credit facilities. This increase in our outstanding variable rate debt increases our risk associated with unfavorable interest rate fluctuations. Financial Instruments. We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income or income. For revenues or expenses denominated in non functional currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments in effect at December 31, 2005 were two interest rate swaps hedging cash flows of our variable rate borrowings based on Euribor (Europe) and Japanese TIBOR (Japan) and two put options hedging against adverse foreign fluctuations of the Mexican Peso and the Euro against the U.S. dollar. The following table summarizes our financial instruments as of December 31, 2005: Maturity Dates January 8, March 31, December 8, October 29, Notional Related Derivatives (In thousands) 2006 2006 2008 2012 Amount Fair Value Interest Rate Swaps: Plain Interest Rate Swap, Japan Notional Amount (U.S. Dollars) $ 110,403 $ 110,403 Receive Floating(%) 3M TIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 1.32 % Fair Market Value $ 760 Plain Interest Rate Swap, Europe Notional Amount (U.S. Dollars) $ 9,118 9,118 Receive Floating(%) 3M EURIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 3.72 % Fair Market Value Foreign Exchange Agreements: Mexico Options to Sell MXN/ Buy USD Contract Amount (U.S. Dollars) $ 4,492 4,492 Contract FX Rate 10.96 Contract Premium $ 64 41 Europe Options to Sell EUR/ Buy (U.S. Dollars) Contract Amount (U.S. Dollars) $ 1,180 1,184 Contract FX Rate 1.18 Contract Premium $ 5 3 Total $ 125,197 $ 631 International Operations. Our exposure to market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries operating in the United States and Mexico. The functional currency for our subsidiaries operating outside North America is generally the local currency of the country in which the entity is located, mitigating the effect of foreign exchange gains and losses. Our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement 63 Table of Contents date. We translate income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. The losses resulting from the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity and totaled $1.8 million for year ended December 31, 2005. Our international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. In these instances, non monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2005, gains from remeasurement and the sale of one foreign exchange agreement included in our results of operations totaled $0.6 million. We also record gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated. We believe that these gains or losses are immaterial.
