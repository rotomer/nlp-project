Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Liquidity and Capital Resources for our definitions of market equity and our share of total debt. The aggregate amount of indebtedness that we may incur under our policy increases directly with an increase in the market price per share of our capital stock. Further, our management could alter or eliminate this policy without stockholder approval. If we change this policy, then we 14 could become more highly leveraged, resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect the cash available for distribution to our stockholders. We face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk. As of December 31, 2006, we had total debt outstanding of $3.4 billion. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to the senior debt securities referenced in our financial statements. We are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest. We anticipate that we will repay only a small portion of the principal of our debt prior to maturity. Accordingly, we will likely need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds of other capital transactions, then we expect that our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repay all such maturing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. In addition, if we mortgage one or more of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments, then the property could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income and asset value. A foreclosure on one or more of our properties could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Covenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our financial condition. The terms of our credit agreements and other indebtedness require that we comply with a number of financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage. These covenants may limit flexibility in our operations, and our failure to comply with these covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt agreement even if we have satisfied our payment obligations. As of December 31, 2006, we had certain non recourse, secured loans, which are cross collateralized by multiple properties. If we default on any of these loans, we may then be required to repay such indebtedness, together with applicable prepayment charges, to avoid foreclosure on all the cross collateralized properties within the applicable pool. Foreclosure on our properties, or our inability to refinance our loans on favorable terms, could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. In addition, our credit facilities and senior debt securities contain certain cross default provisions, which are triggered in the event that our other material indebtedness is in default. These cross default provisions may require us to repay or restructure the credit facilities and the senior debt securities in addition to any mortgage or other debt that is in default, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rates may adversely affect results of operations. We seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements, such as interest rate cap agreements and interest rate swap agreements. These agreements involve risks, such as the risk that the counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes and that a court could rule that such agreements are not legally enforceable. Hedging may reduce overall returns on our investments. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may materially adversely affect our results of operations. 15 Conflicts of Interest Risks Some of our directors and executive officers are involved in other real estate activities and investments and, therefore, may have conflicts of interest with us. From time to time, certain of our executive officers and directors may own interests in other real estate related businesses and investments, including de minimis holdings of the equity securities of public and private real estate companies. Our executive officers involvement in other real estate related activities could divert their attention from our day to day operations. Our executive officers have entered into non competition agreements with us pursuant to which they have agreed not to engage in any activities, directly or indirectly, in respect of commercial real estate, and not to make any investment in respect of any industrial or retail real estate, other than through ownership of not more than 5% of the outstanding shares of a public company engaged in such activities or through certain specified investments. State law may limit our ability to enforce these agreements. We will not acquire any properties from our executive officers, directors or their affiliates unless the transaction is approved by a majority of the disinterested and independent (as defined by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange) members of our board of directors with respect to that transaction. Our role as general partner of the operating partnership may conflict with the interests of our stockholders. As the general partner of the operating partnership, we have fiduciary obligations to the operating partnerships limited partners, the discharge of which may conflict with the interests of our stockholders. In addition, those persons holding limited partnership units will have the right to vote as a class on certain amendments to the operating partnerships partnership agreement and individually to approve certain amendments that would adversely affect their rights. The limited partners may exercise these voting rights in a manner that conflicts with the interests of our stockholders. In addition, under the terms of the operating partnerships partnership agreement, holders of limited partnership units will have certain approval rights with respect to certain transactions that affect all stockholders but which they may not exercise in a manner that reflects the interests of all stockholders. Risks Associated with Government Regulations The costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations and any related potential liability could exceed our budgets for these items. Under various environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at, on, under or in its property. The costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial. These laws typically impose liability and clean up responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean up costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury, property damage or other costs, including investigation and clean up costs, resulting from the environmental contamination. Environmental laws in some countries, including the U.S., also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos. Some of our properties may contain asbestos containing building materials. In addition, some of our properties are leased or have been leased, in part, to owners and operators of businesses that use, store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances. Further, certain of our properties are on, adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic 16 substances, or upon which others have engaged, are engaged or may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances. From time to time, we may acquire properties, or interests in properties, with known adverse environmental conditions where we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior risk adjusted return. In such an instance, we underwrite the costs of environmental investigation, clean up and monitoring into the acquisition cost and obtain appropriate environmental insurance for the property. Further, in connection with certain divested properties, we have agreed to remain responsible for, and to bear the cost of, remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties. At the time of acquisition, we subject all of our properties to a Phase I or similar environmental assessments by independent environmental consultants and we may have additional Phase II testing performed upon the consultants recommendation. These environmental assessments have not revealed, and we are not aware of, any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. Nonetheless, it is possible that the assessments did not reveal all environmental liabilities and that there are material environmental liabilities unknown to us, or that known environmental conditions may give rise to liabilities that are greater than we anticipated. Further, our properties current environmental condition may be affected by customers, the condition of land, operations in the vicinity of the properties (such as releases from underground storage tanks) or by unrelated third parties. If the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations exceed our budgets for these items, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar regulations could result in substantial costs. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, places of public accommodation must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. If we are required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, including removing access barriers, then our cash flow and the amounts available for dividends to our stockholders may be adversely affected. Our properties are also subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. We could incur fines or private damage awards if we fail to comply with these requirements. While we believe that our properties are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements, the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us that will affect our cash flow and results of operations. Federal Income Tax Risks Our failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust would have serious adverse consequences to our stockholders. We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Internal Revenue Code) commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1997. We currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code and believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify. Qualification as a real estate investment trust requires us to satisfy numerous requirements (some on an annual and others on a quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. For example, in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we must derive at least 95% of our gross income in any year from qualifying sources. In addition, we must pay dividends to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains) and must satisfy 17 specified asset tests on a quarterly basis. These provisions and the applicable Treasury regulations are more complicated in our case because we hold our assets through the operating partnership. Legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a real estate investment trust or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. However, we are not aware of any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect our ability to qualify as a real estate investment trust. If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment trust for the four taxable years following the year in which we lost qualification. If we lose our real estate investment trust status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved. In addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. Certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction. From time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties, including the contribution of properties to our joint venture funds. Under the Internal Revenue Code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100% penalty tax. Since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property or our contributions of properties into our joint venture funds are properly treated as prohibited transactions. However, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us or contributions of properties into our joint venture funds are prohibited transactions. While we believe that the Internal Revenue Service would not prevail in any such dispute, if the Internal Revenue Service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition or contribution of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction. In addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes. Risks Associated With Our Dependence on Key Personnel We depend on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. From time to time, our personnel and their roles may change. While we believe that we could find suitable employees to meet our personnel needs, the loss of key personnel, any change in their roles, or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers. Because our compensation packages include equity based incentives, pressure on our stock price or limitations on our ability to award such incentives could affect our ability to offer competitive compensation packages to our executives and key employees. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain our executive officers, or if compensation costs required to attract and retain key employees become more expensive, our performance and competitive position could be materially adversely affected. Risks Associated with Our Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting. The design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. While management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, 18 there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Deficiencies, including any material weakness, in our internal control over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, a decline in our stock price, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Risks Associated with Ownership of Our Stock Limitations in our charter and bylaws could prevent a change in control. Certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay, defer or prevent a change in control or other transaction that could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for the common stock. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock may be owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code to include certain entities) during the last half of a taxable year after the first taxable year for which a real estate investment trust election is made. Furthermore, our common stock must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a 12 month taxable year (or a proportionate part of a short tax year). In addition, if we, or an owner of 10% or more of our stock, actually or constructively owns 10% or more of one of our customers (or a customer of any partnership in which we are a partner), then the rent received by us (either directly or through any such partnership) from that customer will not be qualifying income for purposes of the real estate investment trust gross income tests of the Internal Revenue Code. To help us maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, we prohibit the ownership, actually or by virtue of the constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, by any single person, of more than 9.8% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the issued and outstanding shares of each of our common stock, series L preferred stock, series M preferred stock, series O preferred stock, and series P preferred stock. We also prohibit the ownership, actually or constructively, of any shares of our series D, I, J and K preferred stock by any single person so that no such person, taking into account all of our stock so owned by such person, including any common stock or other series of preferred stock, may own in excess of 9.8% of our issued and outstanding capital stock. We refer to this limitation as the ownership limit. Shares acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary. Any person who acquires shares in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any dividends on the shares or be entitled to vote the shares or receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the shares in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the shares or the amount realized from the sale. A transfer of shares in violation of the above limits may be void under certain circumstances. The ownership limit may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control and, therefore, could adversely affect our stockholders ability to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for the shares of our common stock in connection with such transaction. Our charter authorizes us to issue additional shares of common and preferred stock and to establish the preferences, rights and other terms of any series or class of preferred stock that we issue. Although our board of directors has no intention to do so at the present time, it could establish a series or class of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction, including a change in control, that might involve a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. Our charter and bylaws and Maryland law also contain other provisions that may impede various actions by stockholders without approval of our board of directors, which in turn may delay, defer or prevent a transaction, including a change in control. Those provisions in our charter and bylaws include: directors may be removed only for cause and only upon a two thirds vote of stockholders; our board can fix the number of directors within set limits (which limits are subject to change by our board), and fill vacant directorships upon the vote of a majority of the remaining directors, even though less than a quorum, or in the case of a vacancy resulting from an increase in the size of the board, a majority of the entire board; 19 stockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or propose business for consideration at a stockholders meeting; and the request of the holders of 50% or more of our common stock is necessary for stockholders to call a special meeting. Those provisions provided for under Maryland law include: a two thirds vote of stockholders is required to amend our charter; and stockholders may only act by written consent with the unanimous approval of all stockholders entitled to vote on the matter in question. In addition, our board could elect to adopt, without stockholder approval, certain other provisions under Maryland law that may impede a change in control. The market value of our stock could be substantially affected by various factors. As with other publicly traded securities, the trading price of our stock will depend on many factors that are not within our control and may change from time to time, including: the extent of investor interest in us; the market for similar securities issued by real estate investment trusts; the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate based companies); general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of our stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends; terrorist activity may adversely affect the markets in which our securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending; general economic conditions; and our financial condition, performance and prospects. Other factors such as governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws could also have a significant impact on the future trading price of our stock. If we issue additional securities, then the investment of existing stockholders will be diluted. As a real estate investment trust, we are dependent on external sources of capital and may issue common or preferred stock or debt securities to fund our future capital needs. We have authority to issue shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities, and to cause the operating partnership or AMB Property II, L.P., to issue limited partnership units, in exchange for property or otherwise. Existing stockholders have no preemptive right to acquire any additional securities issued by the operating partnership, AMB Property II, L.P., or us and any issuance of additional equity securities may adversely effect the market price of our stock and could result in dilution of an existing stockholders investment. Earnings, cash dividends, asset value and market interest rates affect the price of our stock. As a real estate investment trust, the market value of our equity securities, in general, is based primarily upon the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash dividends. Our equity securities market value is based secondarily upon the market value of our underlying real estate assets. For this reason, shares of our stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than our net asset value per share. To the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working capital reserves, or other purposes, these retained funds, while increasing the value of our underlying assets, may not correspondingly increase the market price of our stock. Our failure to meet the markets expectations with regard to future earnings and cash dividends likely would adversely affect the market price of our stock. Further, the distribution yield on the stock (as 20 a percentage of the price of the stock) relative to market interest rates may also influence the price of our stock. An increase in market interest rates might lead prospective purchasers of our stock to expect a higher distribution yield, which would adversely affect our stocks market price. Additionally, if the market price of our stock declines significantly, then we might breach certain covenants with respect to our debt obligations, which could adversely affect our liquidity and ability to make future acquisitions and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. We could change our investment and financing policies without a vote of stockholders. Subject to our current investment policy to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust (unless a change is approved by our board of directors under certain circumstances), our board of directors determines our investment and financing policies, our growth strategy and our debt, capitalization, distribution and operating policies. Our board of directors may revise or amend these strategies and policies at any time without a vote of stockholders. Any such changes may not serve the interests of all stockholders and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations, including our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. Shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The operating partnership and AMB Property II, L.P. had 4,709,056 common limited partnership units issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2006, which may be exchanged generally one year after their issuance on a one for one basis into shares of our common stock. In the future, the operating partnership or AMB Property II, L.P. may issue additional limited partnership units, and we may issue shares of common stock, in connection with the acquisition of properties or in private placements. These shares of common stock and the shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of limited partnership units may be sold in the public securities markets over time, pursuant to registration rights that we have granted, or may grant in connection with future issuances, or pursuant to Rule 144. In addition, common stock issued under our stock option and incentive plans may also be sold in the market pursuant to registration statements that we have filed or pursuant to Rule 144. As of December 31, 2006, under our stock option and incentive plans, we had 3,230,106 shares of common stock reserved and available for future issuance, had outstanding options to purchase 6,843,025 shares of common stock (of which 5,404,361 are vested and exercisable) and had 611,549 unvested restricted shares of common stock outstanding. Future sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Further, the existence of the operating partnerships limited partnership units and the shares of our common stock reserved for issuance upon exchange of limited partnership units and the exercise of options, and registration rights referred to above, may adversely affect the terms upon which we are able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES As of December 31, 2006, we owned and managed 964 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 100.7 million rentable square feet (on a consolidated basis, we had 820 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 80.3 million rentable square feet), excluding development and renovation projects and recently completed development projects available for sale or contribution, located in 34 markets throughout the United States and in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands. Our industrial properties were 96.1% leased to 2,633 customers, the largest of which accounted for no more than 3.1% of our annualized base rent from our industrial properties. See Part IV, Item 15: Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for segment information related to our operations. Property Characteristics. Our industrial properties, which consist primarily of warehouse distribution facilities suitable for single or multiple customers, are typically comprised of multiple buildings. 21 The following table identifies types and characteristics of our industrial buildings and each types percentage, based on square footage, of our total owned and managed operating portfolio, which we define as properties in which we have at least a 10% ownership interest, for which we are the property or asset manager, and which we intend to hold for the long term. December 31, Building Type Description 2006 2005(1) Warehouse Customers typically 15,000 75,000 square feet, single or multi customer 48.4 % 44.2 % Bulk Warehouse Customers typically over 75,000 square feet, single or multi customer 38.3 % 40.0 % Flex Industrial Includes assembly or research & development, single or multi customer 4.5 % 5.9 % Light Industrial Smaller customers, 15,000 square feet or less, higher office finish 3.5 % 4.6 % Trans Shipment Unique configurations for truck terminals and cross docking 1.5 % 1.7 % Air Cargo On tarmac or airport land for transfer of air cargo goods 3.2 % 3.1 % Office Single or multi customer, used strictly for office 0.6 % 0.5 % 100.0 % 100.0 % (1) The information for 2005 is presented on a consolidated basis while the information for 2006 is presented on an owned and managed basis. Management believes that the difference in comparability between 2006 and 2005 is not significant. Lease Terms. Our industrial properties are typically subject to lease on a triple net basis, in which customers pay their proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance and operating costs, or are subject to leases on a modified gross basis, in which customers pay expenses over certain threshold levels. In addition, most of our leases include fixed rental increases or Consumer Price Index based rental increases. Lease terms typically range from three to ten years, with a weighted average of six years, excluding renewal options. However, the majority of our industrial leases do not include renewal options. Overview of Major Target Markets. Our industrial properties are typically located near major airports, key interstate highways and seaports in major U.S. metropolitan areas, which currently comprise Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, Northern New Jersey/New York City, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Seattle. Our other U.S. target markets include Austin, Baltimore/Washington D.C., Boston, Houston, Minneapolis and Orlando. Our non U.S. industrial properties are located in major distribution markets, including Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Guadalajara, Hamburg, Lyon, Mexico City, Osaka, Paris, Queretaro, Shanghai, Singapore, Tokyo and Toronto. Within these metropolitan areas, our industrial properties are generally concentrated in locations with limited new construction opportunities within established, relatively large submarkets, which we believe should provide a higher rate of occupancy and rent growth than properties located elsewhere. These in fill locations are typically near major airports, seaports or convenient to major highways and rail lines, and are proximate to large and diverse labor pools. There is typically broad demand for industrial space in these centrally located submarkets due to a diverse mix of industries and types of industrial uses, including warehouse distribution, light assembly and manufacturing. We generally avoid locations at the periphery of metropolitan areas where there are fewer constraints to the supply of additional industrial properties. 22 Owned and Managed Market Operating Statistics(1) As of December 31, 2006, we held investments in operating properties in 34 markets in our owned and managed operating portfolio throughout the United States and in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands.

Properties held through Joint Ventures, Limited Liability Companies and Partnerships Consolidated Joint Ventures: As of December 31, 2006, we held interests in joint ventures, limited liability companies and partnerships with institutional investors and other third parties, which we consolidate in our financial statements. Such investments are consolidated because we own a majority interest or, as general partner, exercise significant control over major operating decisions such as acquisition or disposition decisions, approval of budgets, selection of property managers and changes in financing. Under the agreements governing the joint ventures, we and the other party to the joint venture may be required to make additional capital contributions and, subject to certain limitations, the joint ventures may incur additional debt. Such agreements also impose certain restrictions on the transfer of joint venture interests by us or the other party to the joint venture and typically provide certain rights to us or the other party to the joint venture to sell our or their interest in the joint venture to the joint venture or to the other joint venture partner on terms specified in the agreement. In addition, under certain circumstances, many of the joint 31 ventures include buy/sell provisions.

(2) Basic and diluted net income per weighted average share equals the net income available to common stockholders divided by 87,710,500 and 91,106,893 shares, respectively, for 2006; 84,048,936 and 87,873,399 shares, respectively, for 2005; 82,133,627 and 85,368,626 shares, respectively, for 2004; 81,096,062 and 82,852,528 shares, respectively, for 2003; 83,310,885 and 84,795,987 shares, respectively, for 2002. (3) See Part II, Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Supplemental Earnings Measures FFO, for a discussion of why we believe FFO is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance, of ways in which investors might use FFO when assessing our financial performance, and of FFOs limitations as a measurement tool. (4) Our share of total debt is the pro rata portion of the total debt based on our percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated ventures holding the debt. We believe that our share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze our leverage and to compare our leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of our debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their joint ventures. Our share of total debt is not intended to reflect our actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures. For a reconciliation of our share of total debt to total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure, please see the table of debt maturities and capitalization in Part II, Item 7: Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources. (5) Effective October 1, 2006, we deconsolidated AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. on a prospective basis, due to the re evaluation of the accounting for our investment in the fund in light of changes to the partnership agreement regarding the general partners rights effective October 1, 2006. As a result, the financial measures for the years 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002, included in our operating data, other data and balance sheet data above are not comparable. 39 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations GENERAL You should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements. We commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company effective with the completion of our initial public offering on November 26, 1997, and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, with our initial tax return for the year ended December 31, 1997. AMB Property Corporation and AMB Property, L.P. were formed shortly before the consummation of our initial public offering. Managements Overview The primary source of our revenue and earnings is rent received from customers under long term (generally three to ten years) operating leases at our properties, including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs, and from partnership distributions and fees from our private capital business. We also produce earnings from the disposition of operating assets that no longer fit our strategy, from the disposition of projects in our development for sale program and from the contributions of properties to our co investment joint ventures. Our long term growth is driven by our ability to maintain and increase occupancy rates or increase rental rates at our properties, and by our ability to continue to acquire and develop new properties. National industrial markets continued to improve during 2006 when compared with market conditions in 2005. According to Torto Wheaton Research, availability dropped 10 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2006 to 9.4%, and availability for the year dropped 50 basis points. We believe the strongest industrial markets in the U.S. are the coastal gateway markets tied to global trade, including Los Angeles, our largest market, Miami, the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle, and to a lesser degree Northern New Jersey/New York (with the exception of the Exit 8A submarket). While we believe that the broader Chicago market is showing signs of stabilization, certain submarkets, like the OHare submarket, are relatively strong. We believe Dallas continues to recover, and Atlanta continues to suffer from a large increase in supply. We believe the operating environment in our U.S. on tarmac business remains good with improving cargo volumes and essentially no new supply. Investor demand for industrial property (as supported by our observation of strong national sales volumes and declining acquisition capitalization rates) has remained consistently strong over the past several years. We believe we capitalized on this demand for industrial property by accelerating the repositioning of our portfolio, through the disposition of non core properties, which was effectively completed in 2006 with our exit from the Charlotte and Memphis markets. We plan to continue selling selected assets on an opportunistic basis or that no longer fit our strategic investment objectives, but we believe we have substantially achieved our repositioning goals. Occupancy levels in our portfolio continue to outperform the national industrial market, as determined by Torto Wheaton Research, by pricing lease renewals and new leases with sensitivity to local market conditions. During the prior periods of decreasing or stabilizing rental rates, we strove to sign leases with shorter terms to prevent locking in lower rent levels for long periods and to be prepared to sign new, longer term leases during periods of growing rental rates. When we sign leases of shorter duration, we attempt to limit overall leasing costs and capital expenditures by offering different grades of tenant improvement packages, appropriate to the lease term. In our stronger markets, we are increasing rents as opposed to occupancy. 40 The table below summarizes key operating and leasing statistics for our owned and managed operating properties for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: U.S. Hub and Total Other Total/Weighted Owned and Managed Property Data(1) Gateway Markets(2) Markets(3) Average For the year ended December 31, 2006: % of total rentable square feet 72.0 % 28.0 % 100.0 % Occupancy percentage at year end 96.5 % 95.0 % 96.1 % Same space square footage leased 13,016,726 3,186,854 16,203,580 Rent (decreases) increases on renewals and rollovers(4) (0.4 )% 1.6 % (0.1 )% For the year ended December 31, 2005:(5) % of total rentable square feet 74.9 % 25.1 % 100.0 % Occupancy percentage at year end 96.2 % 94.6 % 95.8 % Same space square footage leased 11,032,482 2,574,944 13,607,426 Rent decreases on renewals and rollovers (10.8 )% (4.3 )% (9.7 )% (1) Schedule includes owned and managed operating properties which we define as properties in which we have at least a 10% ownership interest, for which we are the property or asset manager, and which we intend to hold for the long term. (2) Our U.S. hub and gateway markets include on tarmac and Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, Northern New Jersey/New York City, San Francisco Bay Area, and Seattle. (3) Our total markets include other U.S. target markets, other non target markets, and non U.S. target markets. (4) On a consolidated basis, rent increases on renewals and rollovers were 4.4% and 3.0%, respectively, for U.S. hub and gateway markets and total other markets. (5) The information for 2005 is presented on a consolidated basis while the information for 2006 is presented on an owned and managed basis. Management believes that the difference in comparability between the information for 2006 and 2005 is not significant. At December 31, 2006, our operating portfolios occupancy rate was 96.1%, on an owned and managed basis (97.0% on a consolidated basis), an increase from both the prior quarter and December 31, 2005. Rental rates on lease renewals and rollovers in our portfolio increased 4.1% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and decreased 0.1% for the full year. Cash basis same store net operating income (rental revenues less property operating expenses and real estate taxes for properties included in the same store pool, which is set annually and excludes properties purchased or developments stabilized after December 31, 2004) grew by 1.3% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and 2.6% for the full year 2006, on an owned and managed basis. Excluding lease termination fees, same store net operating income grew 3.0% and 3.2% in the quarter and for the full year (decreased 0.5% and increased 1.6%, respectively, on a consolidated basis), respectively, on an owned and managed basis. See Part II, Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Supplemental Earnings Measures for a discussion of same store net operating income and a reconciliation of same store net operating income and net income. We currently expect that same store growth in our operating portfolio, excluding lease termination fees, will be about 3% to 4% for 2007, on an owned and managed basis. Market rents continue to rebound from their lows and in many of our hub and gateway markets are back to or above their prior peak levels of 2001. We believe that industrial market rents in the San Francisco Bay Area are improving. While market rents in the San Francisco Bay Area were up 10% to 15% in 2006, rents still have not yet fully recovered to normal levels. Rents on lease renewals and rollovers in the San Francisco Bay Area declined 21.0% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and 13.2% for the full year 2006, on an owned and managed basis. Without the effect of the San Francisco Bay Area, rents on renewals and rollovers for the full year 2006 would have been 2.0%, on an owned and managed basis, which we believe reflects the generally positive trends in U.S. industrial space availability. We expect development to be a significant driver of our earnings growth as we expand our land and development pipeline, and contribute completed development projects into our co investment program and recognize development profits. We believe that development, renovation and expansion of well located, high 41 quality industrial properties should generally continue to provide us with attractive investment opportunities at a higher rate of return than we may obtain from the purchase of existing properties. We believe that our development opportunities in Mexico, Japan and China are particularly attractive given the current lack of supply of modern industrial distribution facilities in the major metropolitan markets of these countries. Prior to our global expansion, our development pipeline was $106.8 million at the end of 2002. As a result of our global expansion and increased development capabilities, we have increased our development pipeline to approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2006. In addition to our committed development pipeline, we hold a total of 1,735 acres for future development or sale, of which 92% is in North America. We believe these 1,735 acres of land could support approximately 30.5 million square feet of future development. Going forward, we believe that our co investment program with private capital investors will continue to serve as a significant source of revenues and capital for new investments. Through these co investment joint ventures, we typically earn acquisition fees, asset management fees and priority distributions, as well as promoted interests and incentive distributions based on the performance of the co investment joint ventures; however, we cannot assure you that we will continue to do so. Through contribution of development properties to our co investment joint ventures, we expect to recognize value creation from our development pipeline. As of December 31, 2006, we owned approximately 64.3 million square feet of our properties (51.6% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these co investment joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. By the end of 2010, we expect to have approximately 50% of our owned and managed operating portfolio invested in non U.S. markets (based on owned and managed annualized base rent). As of December 31, 2006, our non U.S. operating properties comprised 14.1% of our owned and managed operating portfolio (based on annualized base rent) and 7.4% of our consolidated operating portfolio (based on annualized base rent). Our North American target countries outside of the United States currently comprise Canada and Mexico. Our European target countries currently comprise Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. Our Asian target countries currently comprise China, India, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. We expect to add additional target countries outside the United States in the future. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust, we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income. As a result, we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our on going operations to the same extent that other corporations that are not real estate investment trusts can. We must continue to raise capital in both the debt and equity markets to fund our working capital needs, acquisitions and developments. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for a complete discussion of the sources of our capital. Summary of Key Transactions in 2006 During the year ended December 31, 2006, we completed the following significant capital deployment and other transactions: Acquired, on an owned and managed basis, 106 buildings in North America and Europe, aggregating approximately 9.8 million square feet, for $834.2 million; Committed to 30 development projects in North America, Asia and Europe totaling 10.4 million square feet with an estimated total investment of approximately $914.3 million; Acquired 835 acres of land for development in North America and Asia for approximately $293.2 million; Sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million; Contributed four completed development projects for $486.2 million to AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., two completed development projects for $56.4 million to AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, three completed development projects for $64.8 million to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. and one land parcel for $77.5 million to AMB DFS Fund I, LLC, all of which entities are unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. As a result of these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after tax gain of $94.1 million, 42 representing the portion of our interest in the contributed properties acquired by the third party co investors for cash; Divested ourselves of 73 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 6.4 million square feet, for an aggregate price of approximately $335.1 million, including 34 industrial buildings that were sold by two of our unconsolidated joint ventures; and Acquired the 50% interest in AMB BlackPine that we did not previously own; Received an incentive distribution of $19.8 million from AMB Partners II, L.P.; and Deconsolidated AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., on a prospective basis, as of October 1, 2006. See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our acquisition, development and disposition activity. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we completed the following significant capital markets and other financing transactions: Obtained long term secured debt financings for our co investment joint ventures of $141.6 million with a weighted average interest rate of 6.1%; Assumed $29.9 million of debt for our co investment joint ventures at a weighted average interest rate of 6.0%; Obtained $177.7 million of new debt (using exchange rates in effect at applicable quarter end dates) with a weighted average interest rate of 4.2% for international acquisitions; Obtained a $65.0 million floating rate unsecured revolving credit facility for one of our co investment joint ventures; Entered into a third amended and restated credit agreement for a $250.0 million unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility which replaced an existing $100.0 million unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility; Repurchased all of AMB Property II, L.P.s outstanding 7.75% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units for an aggregate cost of $10.9 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions; Repurchased all of AMB Property II, L.P.s outstanding 7.95% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units for an aggregate cost of $10.0 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions; Repurchased all of AMB Property II, L.P.s outstanding 8.125% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units for an aggregate cost of $42.8 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions; Purchased all of AMB Property II, L.P.s outstanding 5.00% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units for an aggregate cost of $36.6 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions; Completed the early renewal and increase of our senior unsecured revolving line of credit in the amount of $550.0 million, an increase of $50.0 million; Entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement for a 45.0 billion Yen (approximately $377.9 million U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at December 31, 2006) unsecured revolving credit facility that replaced an existing 35.0 billion Yen (approximately $293.9 million U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at December 31, 2006) unsecured revolving credit facility; Raised approximately $48.1 million in net proceeds from the issuance and sale of $50.0 million of our 6.85% Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock; Issued $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior unsecured notes under the operating partnerships 2006 medium term note program which mature on August 15, 2013 and bear interest at a rate of 5.90% per annum; and 43 Entered into a 228.0 million Euro (approximately $300.9 million U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at December 31, 2006) revolving credit facility agreement, which provides for loans on a secured and unsecured basis. See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 6, 9 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our capital markets transactions. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Investments in Real Estate. Investments in real estate and leasehold interests are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. We also regularly review the impact of above or below market leases, in place leases and lease origination costs for all new acquisitions, and record an intangible asset or liability accordingly. Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a property by property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable. Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying value of the property. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future economics and market conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying value of our long lived assets could occur in the future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings. As a result of leasing activity and the economic environment, we re evaluated the carrying value of our investments and recorded impairment charges of $6.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 on certain of our investments. Revenue Recognition. We record rental revenue from operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts, security deposits and letters of credit, then we may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our customers on an on going basis by reviewing their financial condition periodically as appropriate. Each period we review our outstanding accounts receivable, including straight line rents, for doubtful accounts and provide allowances as needed. We also record lease termination fees when a customer has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us. If a customer remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement, the applicable termination fees are deferred and recognized over the term of such customers occupancy. Property Dispositions. We report real estate dispositions in three separate categories on our consolidated statements of operations. First, when we divest a portion of our interests in real estate entities or properties, gains from the sale represent the interests acquired by third party investors for cash and are included in gains from disposition of real estate interests in the statement of operations. Second, we dispose of value added conversion projects and build to suit and speculative development projects for which we have not generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable, and are included in development profits, net of taxes, in the statement of operations. Lastly, 44 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, requires us to separately report as discontinued operations the historical operating results attributable to operating properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the properties, which is included in gains from dispositions of real estate, net of minority interests, in the statement of operations. The consolidated statements of operations for prior periods are also adjusted to conform with this classification. There is no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial position, net income or cash flows. In all cases, gains and losses are recognized using the full accrual method of accounting. Gains relating to transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met. Joint Ventures. We hold interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We determine consolidation based on standards set forth in EITF 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights or FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN 46. Based on the guidance set forth in EITF 04 5, we consolidate certain joint venture investments because we exercise significant control over major operating decisions, such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, asset management, investment activity and changes in financing. For joint ventures that are variable interest entities as defined under FIN 46 where we are not the primary beneficiaries, we do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. For joint ventures under EITF 04 5, where we do not exercise significant control over major operating and management decisions, but where we exercise significant influence, we use the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. Real Estate Investment Trust. As a real estate investment trust, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes in the U.S. if we meet minimum distribution, income, asset and shareholder tests. However, some of our subsidiaries may be subject to federal and state taxes. In addition, foreign entities may also be subject to the taxes of the host country. An income tax allocation is required to be estimated on our taxable income arising from our taxable real estate investment trust subsidiaries and international entities. A deferred tax component could arise based upon the differences in GAAP versus tax income for items such as depreciation and gain recognition. However, we believe deferred tax is an immaterial component of our consolidated balance sheet. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Effective October 1, 2006, we deconsolidated AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., on a prospective basis, due to the re evaluation of the accounting for our investment in the fund in light of changes to the partnership agreement regarding the general partners rights effective October 1, 2006. As a result, our results of operations presented below are not comparable between years presented. The analysis below includes changes attributable to same store growth, acquisitions, development activity and divestitures. Same store properties are those that we owned during both the current and prior year reporting periods, excluding development properties stabilized after December 31, 2004 (generally defined as properties that are 90% leased or properties for which we have held a certificate of occupancy or where building has been substantially complete for at least 12 months). As of December 31, 2006, same store industrial properties consisted of properties aggregating approximately 71.2 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2006 consisted of 73 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. During 2006, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 50 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.5 million square feet. In 2005, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 150 buildings, aggregating approximately 10.6 million square feet. Our future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition of additional properties and dispositions. Our future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical results. 45 For the Years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (dollars in millions) Revenues 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Rental revenues U.S. industrial: Same store $ 514.9 $ 501.5 $ 13.4 2.7 % 2006 acquisitions 4.4 4.4 % 2005 acquisitions 19.4 11.4 8.0 70.2 % Development 8.3 7.4 0.9 12.2 % Other industrial 74.3 63.6 10.7 16.8 % Non U.S. industrial 62.5 33.1 29.4 88.8 % Total rental revenues 683.8 617.0 66.8 10.8 % Private capital income 46.1 43.9 2.2 5.0 % Total revenues $ 729.9 $ 660.9 $ 69.0 10.4 % U.S. industrial same store revenues increased $13.4 million from the prior year despite the decrease of $12.8 million in same store revenues due to the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., effective October 1, 2006, attributable primarily to improved occupancy and increased rental rates in various markets. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2006 consisted of 73 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. Non U.S. industrial revenues increased approximately $29.4 million from the prior year due primarily to the stabilization of three properties in Japan and the continued acquisition of properties in France, Germany and Mexico. The increase in private capital income was primarily due to increased asset management and acquisition fees from additional assets held in co investment joint ventures, which were partially offset by a decrease in incentive distributions of approximately $3.9 million. During 2006, we received 46 incentive distributions of $22.5 million, of which $19.8 million was from AMB Partners II, L.P., as compared to incentive distribution of $26.4 million for the sale of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., during 2005.

The 2005 acquisitions consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. The 2006 acquisitions consisted of 73 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. Non U.S. industrial revenues increased approximately $6.0 million from the prior year due primarily to the stabilization of three properties in Japan and the continued acquisition of properties in France, Germany and Mexico. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The 2006 impairment loss was taken on several non core assets as a result of leasing activities and changes in the economic environment and the holding period of certain assets. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased stock based compensation expense as a result of higher values assigned to option and stock awards and executive departures, additional staffing and expenses for our international expansion, and the acquisition of AMB Blackpine. Other expenses decreased approximately $2.4 million from the prior year due primarily to a decrease in losses associated with our deferred compensation plan and a decrease in certain deal costs. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our co investment joint ventures. 47 Other Income and (Expenses) 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures, net $ 23.2 $ 10.8 $ 12.4 114.8 % Other income 9.4 5.6 3.8 67.9 % Gains from dispositions of real estate interests, net 19.1 (19.1 ) (100.0 )% Development profits, net of taxes 106.4 54.8 51.6 94.2 % Interest expense, including amortization (165.2 ) (147.3 ) 17.9 12.2 % Total other income and (expenses), net $ (26.2 ) $ (57.0 ) $ (30.8 ) (54.0 )% The $12.4 million increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was primarily due to gains of $17.5 million from the disposition of real estate by our unconsolidated co investment joint ventures during 2006 as opposed to $5.5 million of such gains during 2005 and, effective October 1, 2006, the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., which resulted in an increase of approximately $5.1 million. These increases were partially offset by an increase in expenses by our unconsolidated joint ventures. The increase in other income was primarily due to increased bank interest income and an increase in property management income due to the expansion of our property management business. The 2005 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted primarily from our contribution of $106.9 million (using the exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties to our then newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. Development profits represent gains from the sale of development projects and land as part of our development for sale program. The increase in development profits was due to increased disposition and contribution volume during 2006. During 2006, we sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $13.3 million. In addition, during 2006, we received approximately $0.4 million in connection with the condemnation of a parcel of land resulting in a loss of $1.0 million, $0.8 million of which was the joint venture partners share. During 2006, we also contributed a total of ten completed development projects into unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. Four projects totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Japan Fund I, L.P, two projects totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet were contributed into AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, three projects totaling approximately 0.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and one land parcel into AMB DFS Fund I, LLC. As a result of these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after tax gain of $94.1 million, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party investors for cash. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $1.9 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. The increase in interest expense, including amortization, was due primarily to increased borrowings on unsecured credit facilities and other debt.

During 2005, we divested ourselves of 142 industrial buildings and one retail center, aggregating approximately 9.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $926.6 million, with a resulting net gain of $113.6 million. Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., for $618.5 million. The multi investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. We 48 received cash and a distribution of an on tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund.

In August 2006, we issued 2,000,000 shares of 6.85% Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. The increase in preferred stock dividends is due to the newly issued shares. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2006, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, repurchased all 840,000 of its outstanding 8.125% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units, all 220,440 of its outstanding 7.75% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units, all 201,139 of its outstanding 7.95% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units and all 729,582 of its outstanding 5.00% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units. As a result, we recognized a decrease in income available to common stockholders of $1.1 million for the original issuance costs, net of discount on repurchase.

The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2004 and 2005, we continued to acquire properties in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial revenues. The increase in private capital income was primarily due to increased asset management fees from additional assets held in co investment joint ventures and incentive distributions for 2005 of $26.4 million for the sale of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, asset 49 management priority distributions from AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., and acquisition fees from AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P.

The 2004 acquisitions consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. The 2005 acquisitions consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2004 and 2005, we continued to acquire properties in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial property operating costs. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate during the year. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international and development expansions and the expansion of satellite offices. Other expenses increased approximately $2.4 million from the prior year due primarily to greater losses on our non qualified deferred compensation plan in 2005 and an increase in certain deal costs. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our co investment joint ventures.

The increase in other income was primarily due to increased bank interest income. The 2005 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted primarily from our contribution of $106.9 million (using exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties to our newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. The 2004 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted from our contribution of $71.5 million in operating properties to our unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC. Development profits represent gains from the sale of development projects and land as part of our development for sale program. The increase in development profits was due to increased volume in 2005. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $1.9 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. During 2004, we sold seven land parcels and six development projects as part of our development for sale program, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet for an aggregate price of $40.4 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $6.5 million. During 2004, we also contributed one completed development project into a newly formed unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $2.0 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash.

We received cash and a distribution of an on tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund. During 2004, we divested ourselves of 21 industrial buildings, two retail centers and one office building, aggregating approximately 3.1 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $200.3 million, with a resulting net gain of $42.0 million.

The increase in preferred stock dividends is due to the newly issued shares. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Balance Sheet Strategy. In general, we use unsecured lines of credit, unsecured notes, preferred stock and common equity (issued by us and or the operating partnership and its subsidiaries) to capitalize our 100% owned assets. Over time, we plan to retire non recourse, secured debt encumbering our 100% owned assets and replace that debt with unsecured notes. In managing our co investment joint ventures, in general, we use non recourse, secured debt to capitalize our co investment joint ventures. We currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for acquisitions, development, expansion and renovation of properties will include: retained earnings and cash flow from operations; 51 private capital from co investment partners; net proceeds from contribution of properties and completed development projects to our co investment joint ventures; borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities; other forms of secured or unsecured financing; proceeds from equity (common and preferred) or debt securities offerings; proceeds from limited partnership unit offerings (including issuances of limited partnership units by our subsidiaries); and net proceeds from divestitures of properties. We currently expect that our principal funding requirements will include: working capital; development, expansion and renovation of properties; acquisitions, including our global expansion; debt service; and dividends and distributions on outstanding common and preferred stock and limited partnership units. Cash flows. As of December 31, 2006, cash provided by operating activities was $335.9 million as compared to $295.8 million for the same period in 2005. This change is primarily due to increases in rental rates, partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses primarily due to additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international and development expansions and increased occupancy costs related to the expansion of regional offices. Cash used for investing activities was $880.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to cash used for investing activities of $60.4 million for the same period in 2005. This change is primarily due to an increase in funds used for property acquisitions and capital expenditures, and a decrease in proceeds from property divestitures (mainly due to the divesture of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., portfolio in 2005), offset by less funds used for additions to interests in unconsolidated joint ventures and an increase in capital distributions received from unconsolidated joint ventures. Cash provided by financing activities was $483.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to cash used in financing activities of $101.9 million for the same period in 2005. This change is due primarily to an increase in borrowings, net of repayments, issuance of common stock upon the exercise of options and issuances of preferred stock, offset by the cost of the repurchase of preferred units for the year ended December 31, 2006. We believe that our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow from operations, borrowings available under our unsecured credit facilities and our ability to access private and public debt and equity capital, are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Resources Property Divestitures. During 2006, we divested ourselves of 39 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 3.5 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $175.3 million, with a resulting net gain of $42.6 million. Development Sales. During 2006, we sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $13.3 million. In addition, during 2006, we received approximately $0.4 million in connection with the condemnation of a parcel of land resulting in a loss of $1.0 million, $0.8 million of which was the joint venture partners share. 52 Development Contributions. During 2006, we contributed a total of nine completed development projects and one land parcel into unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. Four projects totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Japan Fund I, L.P, two projects totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet were contributed into AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and three projects totaling approximately 0.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. In addition, one land parcel was contributed into AMB DFS Fund I, LLC. As a result of these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after tax gain of $94.1 million, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party investors for cash. These gains are included in development profits, net of taxes, in the statement of operations. Properties Held for Contribution. As of December 31, 2006, we held for contribution to co investment joint ventures, nine industrial projects with an aggregate net book value of $154.0 million, which, when contributed to a joint venture, will reduce our current ownership interest from approximately 100% to an expected range of 15 50%. Properties Held for Divestiture. As of December 31, 2006, we held for divestiture four industrial projects, which are not in our core markets, do not meet our current strategic objectives or which we have included as part of our development for sale program. The divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. As of December 31, 2006, the net carrying value of the properties held for divestiture was $20.9 million. Expected net sales proceeds exceed the net carrying value of the properties. Co investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund certain acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. We generally consolidate these joint ventures for financial reporting purposes because they are not variable interest entities and because we are the sole managing general partner and control all major operating decisions. However, in certain cases, our co investment joint ventures are unconsolidated because we do not control all major operating decisions and the general partners do not have significant rights under EITF 04 5. Third party equity interests in the joint ventures are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2006, we owned approximately 64.3 million square feet of our properties (51.6% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so.

(6) The planned gross capitalization and investment capacity of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. as an open end fund, is not limited. The planned gross capitalization represents the gross book value of real estate assets as of the most recent quarter end. (7) AMB DFS Fund I, LLC is a co investment partnership formed in 2006 with a subsidiary of GE Real Estate to build and sell properties. We also have a 0.1% unconsolidated equity interest (with an approximate 33% economic interest) in AMB Pier One, LLC, a joint venture related to the 2000 redevelopment of the pier which houses our office space in the San Francisco Bay Area. The investment is not consolidated because we do not exercise control over major operating decisions such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, investment activity and changes in financing. We have an option to purchase the remaining equity interest beginning January 1, 2007 and expiring December 31, 2009, based on the fair market value as stipulated in the joint venture agreement. As of December 31, 2006, we also had an approximate 39.0% unconsolidated equity interest in G.Accion, a Mexican real estate company. G.Accion provides management and development services for industrial, retail, residential and office properties in Mexico. In addition, as of December 31, 2006, one of our subsidiaries also had an approximate 5% interest in IAT Air Cargo Facilities Income Fund (IAT), a Canadian income trust specializing in aviation related real estate at Canadas leading international airports. This equity investment is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Common and Preferred Equity.

In connection with this repurchase, we reclassified all of our 840,000 shares of 8.125% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock as preferred stock. On September 24, 2004, AMB Property II, L.P., a partnership in which Texas AMB I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and our indirect subsidiary, owns an approximate 8.0% general partnership interest and the operating partnership owns an approximate 92% common limited partnership interest, issued 729,582 5.00% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units at a price of $50.00 per unit. The series N preferred units were issued to Robert Pattillo Properties, Inc. in exchange for the contribution to AMB Property II, L.P of certain parcels of land that are located in multiple markets. Effective January 27, 2006, Robert Pattillo Properties, Inc. exercised its rights under its Put Agreement, dated September 24, 2004, with the operating partnership, and sold all of the series N preferred units to the operating partnership for an aggregate price of $36.6 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions.

We, in turn, used those proceeds to redeem all 3,995,800 of our 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for $100.2 million, including all accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, to the redemption date. In December 2005, our board of directors approved a new two year common stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of our common stock. We did not repurchase or retire any shares of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2006. Debt. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, we presently intend to operate with an our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio of approximately 45% or less. As of December 31, 2006, our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio was 34.2%. (See footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratios table below for our definitions of our share of total market capitalization, market equity and our share of total debt.) However, we typically finance our co investment joint ventures with secured debt at a loan to value ratio of 50 65% per our joint venture agreements. Additionally, we currently intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these policies, however, our organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our management could alter or eliminate these policies without stockholder approval or circumstances could arise that could render us unable to comply with these policies. As of December 31, 2006, the aggregate principal amount of our secured debt was $1.4 billion, excluding unamortized debt premiums of $6.3 million. Of the $1.4 billion of secured debt, $1.0 billion is secured by properties in our joint ventures. The secured debt is generally non recourse and bears interest at rates varying from 2.9% to 10.4% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 6.2%) and final maturity dates ranging from February 2007 to January 2025. As of December 31, 2006, $1.0 billion of the secured debt obligations bear interest at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 6.1%, while the remaining $386.1 million bear interest at variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 4.7%). As of December 31, 2006, the operating partnership had outstanding an aggregate of $1.1 billion in unsecured senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 6.2% and had a weighted average term of 4.8 years. These unsecured senior debt securities include $300.0 million in notes issued in June 1998, $225.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2000 medium term note program, $275.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2002 medium term note program, $175.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2006 medium term note program and approximately $112.5 million of 5.094% Notes Due 2015, which were issued to Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America on July 11, 2005 in a private placement, in exchange for the cancellation of $100.0 million of notes that were issued in June 1998 resulting in a discount of approximately $12.5 million. The unsecured senior debt securities are subject to various covenants. Also included is a $25.0 million promissory note which matures in January 2007. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to its senior debt securities. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then our cash flow may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Credit Facilities. On June 1, 2006, the operating partnership entered into a third amended and restated $550.0 million unsecured revolving credit agreement that replaced its then existing $500.0 million credit facility, which was to mature on June 1, 2007. We are a guarantor of the operating partnerships obligations under the credit facility. The line, which matures on June 1, 2010, carries a one year extension option and can be increased to up to 56 $700.0 million upon certain conditions. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the operating partnerships long term debt rating, which was 42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2006, with an annual facility fee of 15 basis points. The four year credit facility includes a multi currency component, under which up to $550.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Euros, Yen or British Pounds Sterling. The operating partnership uses its unsecured credit facility principally for acquisitions, funding development activity and general working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on the credit facility was $303.7 million and the remaining amount available was $234.6 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $11.7 million. The outstanding balance included borrowings denominated in Euros, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately $303.7 million U.S. dollars. On June 23, 2006, AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating partnership and as the initial borrower, entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement for a 45.0 billion Yen unsecured revolving credit facility, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately $377.9 million U.S. dollars. This replaced the 35.0 billion Yen unsecured revolving credit facility executed on June 29, 2004, as previously amended, which using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately $293.9 million U.S. dollars. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K. under the credit facility, as well as the obligations of any other entity in which the operating partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the credit agreement. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and for other real estate purposes in Japan, China and South Korea. Generally, borrowers under the credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the credit facility with certain real estate assets or equity in entities holding such real estate assets. The credit facility matures in June 2010 and has a one year extension option. The credit facility can be increased to up to 55.0 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately $461.9 million U.S. dollars. The extension option is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding commitments under the facility at that time. The rate on the borrowings is generally TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt and was 42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2006. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, payable in quarterly amounts, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt, and was 15 basis points of the outstanding commitments under the facility as of December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, was $320.9 million in U.S. dollars. On June 13, 2006, the operating partnership and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries entered into a fourth amended and restated credit agreement for a $250.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which replaced the third amended and restated credit agreement for a $250.0 million unsecured credit facility. On February 16, 2006, the third amended and restated credit agreement replaced the then existing $100.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that was to mature in June 2008. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations for such subsidiaries and other entities controlled by us or the operating partnership that are selected by the operating partnership from time to time to be borrowers under and pursuant to the credit facility. The four year credit facility includes a multi currency component under which up to $250.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Singapore dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros. The line, which matures in February 2010 and carries a one year extension option, can be increased to up to $350.0 million upon certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding commitments. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships senior unsecured long term debt, which was 60 basis points as of December 31, 2006, with an annual facility fee based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships senior unsecured long term debt. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and general working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on this facility was approximately $227.4 million. The credit agreement contains affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios by the operating partnership, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. 57 Mortgages Receivable. Through a wholly owned subsidiary, we hold a mortgage loan receivable on AMB Pier One, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture. The note bears interest at 13.0% and matures in May 2026. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on the note was $12.7 million. We also hold a loan receivable on G. Accion, an unconsolidated joint venture totaling $6.1 million with an interest rate of 10.0%. The loan matures in March 2010.

In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of our debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their joint ventures. Our share of total debt is not intended to reflect our actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures.

For a reconciliation of our share of total debt to total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure, please see the table of debt maturities and capitalization above. 59 Liquidity As of December 31, 2006, we had $174.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $314.2 million of additional available borrowings under our credit facilities. As of December 31, 2006, we had $21.1 million in restricted cash. Our board of directors declared a regular cash dividend for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 of $0.46 per share of common stock, and the operating partnership announced its intention to pay a regular cash distribution for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 of $0.46 per common unit. The dividends and distributions were payable on January 5, 2007 to stockholders and unitholders of record on December 22, 2006. The series L, M, O and P preferred stock dividends were payable on January 16, 2007 to stockholders of record on January 5, 2007. The series J and K preferred unit quarterly distributions were payable on January 16, 2007. The series D and I preferred unit quarterly distributions were paid on December 25, 2006. The following table sets forth the dividends and distributions paid or payable per share or unit for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004: Paying Entity Security 2006 2005 2004 AMB Property Corporation Common stock $ 1.84 $ 1.76 $ 1.70 AMB Property Corporation Series L preferred stock $ 1.63 $ 1.63 $ 1.63 AMB Property Corporation Series M preferred stock $ 1.69 $ 1.69 $ 1.69 AMB Property Corporation Series O preferred stock $ 1.75 $ 0.09 n/a AMB Property Corporation Series P preferred stock $ 0.60 n/a n/a Operating Partnership Common limited partnership units $ 1.84 $ 1.76 $ 1.70 Operating Partnership Series J preferred units $ 3.98 $ 3.98 $ 3.98 Operating Partnership Series K preferred units $ 3.98 $ 3.98 $ 3.98 AMB Property II, L.P.

(2) In September 2006, AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased all of its outstanding series F preferred units. (3) In March 2006, AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased all of its outstanding series H preferred units. (4) The holder of the series N preferred units exercised its put option in January 2006 and sold all of its series N preferred units to the operating partnership and AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased all of such units from the operating partnership. The anticipated size of our distributions, using only cash from operations, will not allow us to retire all of our debt as it comes due. Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Commitments Development Starts. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we initiated 30 new industrial development projects in North America, Europe and Asia with a total expected investment of $914.3 million, aggregating approximately 10.4 million square feet. During 2005, we initiated 30 new industrial development projects in North America, Europe and Asia with a total expected investment of $522.4 million, aggregating approximately 7.0 million square feet. 60 Development Pipeline. As of December 31, 2006, we had 45 industrial projects in our development pipeline, which will total approximately 13.7 million square feet, and will have an aggregate estimated investment of $1.3 billion upon completion. We have an additional ten development projects available for sale or contribution totaling approximately 3.0 million square feet, with an aggregate estimated investment of $199.2 million. One of these ten projects totaling $13.0 million and approximately 0.2 million square feet is held in an unconsolidated joint venture. As of December 31, 2006, we and our joint venture partners had funded an aggregate of $814.5 million and needed to fund an estimated additional $481.0 million in order to complete our development pipeline which includes projects expected to be completed through the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we acquired 835 acres of land for industrial warehouse development in North America and Asia for approximately $293.2 million. Acquisitions. During 2006, we acquired 106 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 9.8 million square feet for a total expected investment of $834.2 million (includes acquisition costs of $814.1 million and estimated acquisition capital of $20.1 million), of which we acquired 70 buildings through one of our unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. We generally fund our acquisitions through private capital contributions, borrowings under our credit facilities, cash, debt issuances and net proceeds from property divestitures. Lease Commitments. We have entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily on tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms from one to 55 years. These buildings and improvements are amortized ratably over the lesser of the terms of the related leases or 40 years. Future minimum rental payments required under non cancelable operating leases in effect as of December 31, 2006 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2007 $ 21,636 2008 22,186 2009 21,506 2010 20,667 2011 20,668 Thereafter 272,483 Total $ 379,146 Co investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. As of December 31, 2006, we had investments in co investment joint ventures with a gross book value of $1.9 billion, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, and net equity investments in four unconsolidated co investment joint ventures of $236.0 million and a gross book value of $2.5 billion. As of December 31, 2006, we may make additional capital contributions to current and planned co investment joint ventures of up to $168.2 million (using the exchange rates at December 31, 2006) pursuant to the terms of the joint venture agreements. From time to time, we may raise additional equity commitments for AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open ended unconsolidated co investment joint venture formed in 2004 with institutional investors, which invests through a private real estate investment trust. This would increase our obligation to make additional capital commitments. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of this fund, we are obligated to contribute 20% of the total equity commitments to the fund until such time our total equity commitment is greater than $150.0 million, at which time, our obligation is reduced to 10% of the total equity commitments. We expect to fund these contributions with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances or net proceeds from property divestitures, which could adversely effect our cash flow. Captive Insurance Company. In December 2001, we formed a wholly owned captive insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., (Arcata), which provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the deductible under our third party policies. The captive insurance company is one element of our overall risk management program. We capitalized Arcata in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata established annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss experience of our properties. Annually, 61 we engage an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims, related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata may be adjusted based on this estimate. Like premiums paid to third party insurance companies, premiums paid to Arcata may be reimbursed by customers pursuant to specific lease terms. Through this structure, we believe that we have more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market. Potential Contingent and Unknown Liabilities. Contingent and unknown liabilities may include the following: liabilities for environmental conditions; claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to our formation or acquisition transactions that had not been asserted prior to our formation or acquisition transactions; accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; tax liabilities; and claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these entities. Overview of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our debt, interest and lease payments due by period as of December 31, 2006 (dollars in thousands): Less than More than Contractual Obligations 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Total Debt $ 213,869 $ 592,085 $ 1,593,035 $ 1,042,699 $ 3,441,688 Debt interest payments 13,861 38,126 74,416 58,775 185,178 Operating lease commitments 21,636 43,692 41,335 272,483 379,146 Construction commitments 31,713 57,042 88,755 Total $ 281,079 $ 730,945 $ 1,708,786 $ 1,373,957 $ 4,094,767 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Standby Letters of Credit. As of December 31, 2006, we had provided approximately $22.1 million in letters of credit, of which $11.7 million was provided under the operating partnerships $550.0 million unsecured credit facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other commitments. Guarantees. Other than parent guarantees associated with the unsecured debt, as of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding guarantees in the aggregate amount of $48.2 million in connection with certain acquisitions. As of December 31, 2006, we guaranteed $26.8 million and $83.2 million on outstanding loans on two of our consolidated joint ventures and two of our unconsolidated joint ventures, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2006, we guaranteed $87.3 million on outstanding property debt related to one of our unconsolidated joint ventures. Performance and Surety Bonds. As of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $11.4 million. These bonds were issued in connection with certain of our development projects and were posted to guarantee certain tax obligations and the construction of certain real property improvements and infrastructure, such as grading, sewers and streets. Performance and surety bonds are commonly required by public agencies from real estate developers. Performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the taxes due or the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. Promoted Interests and Other Contractual Obligations. Upon the achievement of certain return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, we may be obligated to make payments to certain of our joint venture partners 62 pursuant to the terms and provisions of their contractual agreements with us. From time to time in the normal course of our business, we enter into various contracts with third parties that may obligate us to make payments, pay promotes, or perform other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. SUPPLEMENTAL EARNINGS MEASURES FFO. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider funds from operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. FFO is defined as net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, less gains (or losses) from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estate related depreciation, and adjustments to derive our pro rata share of FFO of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. Further, we do not adjust FFO to eliminate the effects of non recurring charges. We believe that FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. We believe that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do.

(2) The information for 2005 includes accumulated depreciation re capture of approximately $1.1 million associated with the sale of the Interstate Crossdock redevelopment project. SS NOI. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider same store net operating income, or SS NOI, to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. For properties that are considered part of the same store pool, see Part I, Item 2: Properties Industrial Properties Owned and Managed Market Operating Statistics, Note 6, and Owned and Managed Operating and Leasing Statistics Owned and Managed Same Store Operating Statistics, Note 2. In deriving SS NOI, we define NOI as rental revenues (as calculated in accordance with GAAP), including reimbursements, less straight line rents, property operating expenses and real estate taxes. We exclude straight line rents in calculating SS NOI because we believe it provides a better measure of actual cash basis rental growth for a year over year comparison. In addition, we believe that SS NOI helps the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate as compared to other companies. While SS NOI is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. SS NOI also does not reflect general and administrative expense, interest expenses, depreciation and amortization costs, capital expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development and construction activities that could materially impact our results from operations. Further, our computation of SS NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating SS NOI. 64 The following table reconciles SS NOI from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Net income $ 224,072 $ 257,807 $ 125,471 Private capital income (46,102 ) (43,942 ) (12,895 ) Depreciation and amortization 177,824 161,732 136,610 Impairment losses 6,312 General and administrative 104,262 71,564 57,181 Other expenses 2,620 5,038 2,554 Fund costs 2,091 1,482 1,741 Total other income and expenses 26,178 57,044 119,727 Total minority interests share of income 62,855 74,777 52,863 Total discontinued operations (51,949 ) (127,498 ) (63,888 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (193 ) Net Operating Income (NOI) 507,970 458,004 419,364 Less non same store NOI (116,030 ) (70,782 ) (19,990 ) Less non cash adjustments(1) (8,426 ) (9,861 ) (8,249 ) Cash basis same store NOI $ 383,514 $ 377,361 $ 391,125 (1) Non cash adjustments include straight line rents and amortization of lease intangibles for the same store pool only. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices, interest rates and international exchange rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimize the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings and our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2006, we had three outstanding interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $38.1 million (in U.S. dollars). See Financial Instruments below. The table below summarizes the market risks associated with our fixed and variable rate debt outstanding before net unamortized debt discounts of $4.3 million as of December 31, 2006 (dollars in thousands): 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Fixed rate debt(1) $ 155,384 $ 368,141 $ 152,151 $ 430,676 $ 288,835 $ 768,320 $ 2,163,507 Average interest rate 6.7 % 7.1 % 4.7 % 6.4 % 6.8 % 5.9 % 6.3 % Variable rate debt(2) $ 58,485 $ 22,604 $ 49,189 $ 854,543 $ 18,981 $ 274,379 $ 1,278,181 Average interest rate 5.9 % 6.6 % 6.8 % 3.1 % 3.8 % 4.9 % 3.8 % Interest Payments $ 13,861 $ 27,630 $ 10,496 $ 54,054 $ 20,362 $ 58,775 $ 185,178 (1) Represents 62.9% of all outstanding debt. (2) Represents 37.1% of all outstanding debt. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased or decreased by 10%, then the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would be $4.9 million (net of swaps) annually. As of December 31, 65 2006, the book value and the estimated fair value of our total consolidated debt (both secured and unsecured) was $3.4 and $3.5 billion, respectively, based on our estimate of current market interest rates. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, variable rate debt comprised 37.1% and 24.5%, respectively, of all our outstanding debt. Variable rate debt was $1.3 billion and $831.7 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. The increase is primarily due to higher outstanding balances on our credit facilities. This increase in our outstanding variable rate debt increases our risk associated with unfavorable interest rate fluctuations. Financial Instruments. We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income or income. For revenues or expenses denominated in non functional currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments in effect at December 31, 2006 were three interest rate swaps hedging cash flows of our variable rate borrowings based on U.S. Libor (USD) and Euribor (Europe). The following table summarizes our financial instruments as of December 31, 2006 (in thousands): Maturity Dates Related Derivatives (in thousands) December 8, 2008 June 8, 2010 November 1, 2014 Notional Amount Fair Value Interest Rate Swaps: Plain Interest Rate Swap, Europe Notional Amount (U.S. dollars) $ 9,655 $ 9,655 Receive Floating(%) 3MEURIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 3.72 % Fair Market Value $ 54 Plain Interest Rate Swap, USD Notional Amount (U.S. dollars) $ 25,000 25,000 Receive Floating(%) 3MLIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 5.17 % Fair Market Value (130 ) Plain Interest Rate Swap, Europe Notional Amount (U.S. dollars) $ 3,471 3,471 Receive Floating(%) 3MEURIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 4.26 % Fair Market Value (45 ) Total $ 38,126 $ (121 ) International Operations. Our exposure to market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries operating in the United States and Mexico. The functional currency for our subsidiaries operating outside the United States is generally the local currency of the country in which the entity is located, mitigating the effect of foreign exchange gains and losses. Our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. We translate income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. The losses resulting from the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity and totaled $0.2 million for year ended December 31, 2006. Our international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. In these instances, non monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2006, losses from remeasurement and the sale of four foreign exchange agreements included in our results of operations totaled $0.8 million. We also record gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated. 66

(3) See Part II, Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Supplemental Earnings Measures FFO, for a discussion of why we believe FFO is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance, of ways in which investors might use FFO when assessing our financial performance, and of FFOs limitations as a measurement tool. (4) Our share of total debt is the pro rata portion of the total debt based on our percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated ventures holding the debt. We believe that our share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze our leverage and to compare our leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of our debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their joint ventures. Our share of total debt is not intended to reflect our actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures. For a reconciliation of our share of total debt to total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure, please see the table of debt maturities and capitalization in Part II, Item 7: Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources. (5) Effective October 1, 2006, we deconsolidated AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. on a prospective basis, due to the re evaluation of the accounting for our investment in the fund in light of changes to the partnership agreement regarding the general partners rights effective October 1, 2006. As a result, the financial measures for the years 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002, included in our operating data, other data and balance sheet data above are not comparable. 39 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations GENERAL You should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements. We commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company effective with the completion of our initial public offering on November 26, 1997, and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, with our initial tax return for the year ended December 31, 1997. AMB Property Corporation and AMB Property, L.P. were formed shortly before the consummation of our initial public offering. Managements Overview The primary source of our revenue and earnings is rent received from customers under long term (generally three to ten years) operating leases at our properties, including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs, and from partnership distributions and fees from our private capital business. We also produce earnings from the disposition of operating assets that no longer fit our strategy, from the disposition of projects in our development for sale program and from the contributions of properties to our co investment joint ventures. Our long term growth is driven by our ability to maintain and increase occupancy rates or increase rental rates at our properties, and by our ability to continue to acquire and develop new properties. National industrial markets continued to improve during 2006 when compared with market conditions in 2005. According to Torto Wheaton Research, availability dropped 10 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2006 to 9.4%, and availability for the year dropped 50 basis points. We believe the strongest industrial markets in the U.S. are the coastal gateway markets tied to global trade, including Los Angeles, our largest market, Miami, the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle, and to a lesser degree Northern New Jersey/New York (with the exception of the Exit 8A submarket). While we believe that the broader Chicago market is showing signs of stabilization, certain submarkets, like the OHare submarket, are relatively strong. We believe Dallas continues to recover, and Atlanta continues to suffer from a large increase in supply. We believe the operating environment in our U.S. on tarmac business remains good with improving cargo volumes and essentially no new supply. Investor demand for industrial property (as supported by our observation of strong national sales volumes and declining acquisition capitalization rates) has remained consistently strong over the past several years. We believe we capitalized on this demand for industrial property by accelerating the repositioning of our portfolio, through the disposition of non core properties, which was effectively completed in 2006 with our exit from the Charlotte and Memphis markets. We plan to continue selling selected assets on an opportunistic basis or that no longer fit our strategic investment objectives, but we believe we have substantially achieved our repositioning goals. Occupancy levels in our portfolio continue to outperform the national industrial market, as determined by Torto Wheaton Research, by pricing lease renewals and new leases with sensitivity to local market conditions. During the prior periods of decreasing or stabilizing rental rates, we strove to sign leases with shorter terms to prevent locking in lower rent levels for long periods and to be prepared to sign new, longer term leases during periods of growing rental rates. When we sign leases of shorter duration, we attempt to limit overall leasing costs and capital expenditures by offering different grades of tenant improvement packages, appropriate to the lease term. In our stronger markets, we are increasing rents as opposed to occupancy. 40 The table below summarizes key operating and leasing statistics for our owned and managed operating properties for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: U.S. Hub and Total Other Total/Weighted Owned and Managed Property Data(1) Gateway Markets(2) Markets(3) Average For the year ended December 31, 2006: % of total rentable square feet 72.0 % 28.0 % 100.0 % Occupancy percentage at year end 96.5 % 95.0 % 96.1 % Same space square footage leased 13,016,726 3,186,854 16,203,580 Rent (decreases) increases on renewals and rollovers(4) (0.4 )% 1.6 % (0.1 )% For the year ended December 31, 2005:(5) % of total rentable square feet 74.9 % 25.1 % 100.0 % Occupancy percentage at year end 96.2 % 94.6 % 95.8 % Same space square footage leased 11,032,482 2,574,944 13,607,426 Rent decreases on renewals and rollovers (10.8 )% (4.3 )% (9.7 )% (1) Schedule includes owned and managed operating properties which we define as properties in which we have at least a 10% ownership interest, for which we are the property or asset manager, and which we intend to hold for the long term. (2) Our U.S. hub and gateway markets include on tarmac and Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, Northern New Jersey/New York City, San Francisco Bay Area, and Seattle. (3) Our total markets include other U.S. target markets, other non target markets, and non U.S. target markets. (4) On a consolidated basis, rent increases on renewals and rollovers were 4.4% and 3.0%, respectively, for U.S. hub and gateway markets and total other markets. (5) The information for 2005 is presented on a consolidated basis while the information for 2006 is presented on an owned and managed basis. Management believes that the difference in comparability between the information for 2006 and 2005 is not significant. At December 31, 2006, our operating portfolios occupancy rate was 96.1%, on an owned and managed basis (97.0% on a consolidated basis), an increase from both the prior quarter and December 31, 2005. Rental rates on lease renewals and rollovers in our portfolio increased 4.1% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and decreased 0.1% for the full year. Cash basis same store net operating income (rental revenues less property operating expenses and real estate taxes for properties included in the same store pool, which is set annually and excludes properties purchased or developments stabilized after December 31, 2004) grew by 1.3% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and 2.6% for the full year 2006, on an owned and managed basis. Excluding lease termination fees, same store net operating income grew 3.0% and 3.2% in the quarter and for the full year (decreased 0.5% and increased 1.6%, respectively, on a consolidated basis), respectively, on an owned and managed basis. See Part II, Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Supplemental Earnings Measures for a discussion of same store net operating income and a reconciliation of same store net operating income and net income. We currently expect that same store growth in our operating portfolio, excluding lease termination fees, will be about 3% to 4% for 2007, on an owned and managed basis. Market rents continue to rebound from their lows and in many of our hub and gateway markets are back to or above their prior peak levels of 2001. We believe that industrial market rents in the San Francisco Bay Area are improving. While market rents in the San Francisco Bay Area were up 10% to 15% in 2006, rents still have not yet fully recovered to normal levels. Rents on lease renewals and rollovers in the San Francisco Bay Area declined 21.0% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and 13.2% for the full year 2006, on an owned and managed basis. Without the effect of the San Francisco Bay Area, rents on renewals and rollovers for the full year 2006 would have been 2.0%, on an owned and managed basis, which we believe reflects the generally positive trends in U.S. industrial space availability. We expect development to be a significant driver of our earnings growth as we expand our land and development pipeline, and contribute completed development projects into our co investment program and recognize development profits. We believe that development, renovation and expansion of well located, high 41 quality industrial properties should generally continue to provide us with attractive investment opportunities at a higher rate of return than we may obtain from the purchase of existing properties. We believe that our development opportunities in Mexico, Japan and China are particularly attractive given the current lack of supply of modern industrial distribution facilities in the major metropolitan markets of these countries. Prior to our global expansion, our development pipeline was $106.8 million at the end of 2002. As a result of our global expansion and increased development capabilities, we have increased our development pipeline to approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2006. In addition to our committed development pipeline, we hold a total of 1,735 acres for future development or sale, of which 92% is in North America. We believe these 1,735 acres of land could support approximately 30.5 million square feet of future development. Going forward, we believe that our co investment program with private capital investors will continue to serve as a significant source of revenues and capital for new investments. Through these co investment joint ventures, we typically earn acquisition fees, asset management fees and priority distributions, as well as promoted interests and incentive distributions based on the performance of the co investment joint ventures; however, we cannot assure you that we will continue to do so. Through contribution of development properties to our co investment joint ventures, we expect to recognize value creation from our development pipeline. As of December 31, 2006, we owned approximately 64.3 million square feet of our properties (51.6% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these co investment joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. By the end of 2010, we expect to have approximately 50% of our owned and managed operating portfolio invested in non U.S. markets (based on owned and managed annualized base rent). As of December 31, 2006, our non U.S. operating properties comprised 14.1% of our owned and managed operating portfolio (based on annualized base rent) and 7.4% of our consolidated operating portfolio (based on annualized base rent). Our North American target countries outside of the United States currently comprise Canada and Mexico. Our European target countries currently comprise Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. Our Asian target countries currently comprise China, India, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. We expect to add additional target countries outside the United States in the future. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust, we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income. As a result, we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our on going operations to the same extent that other corporations that are not real estate investment trusts can. We must continue to raise capital in both the debt and equity markets to fund our working capital needs, acquisitions and developments. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for a complete discussion of the sources of our capital. Summary of Key Transactions in 2006 During the year ended December 31, 2006, we completed the following significant capital deployment and other transactions: Acquired, on an owned and managed basis, 106 buildings in North America and Europe, aggregating approximately 9.8 million square feet, for $834.2 million; Committed to 30 development projects in North America, Asia and Europe totaling 10.4 million square feet with an estimated total investment of approximately $914.3 million; Acquired 835 acres of land for development in North America and Asia for approximately $293.2 million; Sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million; Contributed four completed development projects for $486.2 million to AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., two completed development projects for $56.4 million to AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, three completed development projects for $64.8 million to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. and one land parcel for $77.5 million to AMB DFS Fund I, LLC, all of which entities are unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. As a result of these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after tax gain of $94.1 million, 42 representing the portion of our interest in the contributed properties acquired by the third party co investors for cash; Divested ourselves of 73 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 6.4 million square feet, for an aggregate price of approximately $335.1 million, including 34 industrial buildings that were sold by two of our unconsolidated joint ventures; and Acquired the 50% interest in AMB BlackPine that we did not previously own; Received an incentive distribution of $19.8 million from AMB Partners II, L.P.; and Deconsolidated AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., on a prospective basis, as of October 1, 2006. See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our acquisition, development and disposition activity. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we completed the following significant capital markets and other financing transactions: Obtained long term secured debt financings for our co investment joint ventures of $141.6 million with a weighted average interest rate of 6.1%; Assumed $29.9 million of debt for our co investment joint ventures at a weighted average interest rate of 6.0%; Obtained $177.7 million of new debt (using exchange rates in effect at applicable quarter end dates) with a weighted average interest rate of 4.2% for international acquisitions; Obtained a $65.0 million floating rate unsecured revolving credit facility for one of our co investment joint ventures; Entered into a third amended and restated credit agreement for a $250.0 million unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility which replaced an existing $100.0 million unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility; Repurchased all of AMB Property II, L.P.s outstanding 7.75% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units for an aggregate cost of $10.9 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions; Repurchased all of AMB Property II, L.P.s outstanding 7.95% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units for an aggregate cost of $10.0 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions; Repurchased all of AMB Property II, L.P.s outstanding 8.125% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units for an aggregate cost of $42.8 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions; Purchased all of AMB Property II, L.P.s outstanding 5.00% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units for an aggregate cost of $36.6 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions; Completed the early renewal and increase of our senior unsecured revolving line of credit in the amount of $550.0 million, an increase of $50.0 million; Entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement for a 45.0 billion Yen (approximately $377.9 million U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at December 31, 2006) unsecured revolving credit facility that replaced an existing 35.0 billion Yen (approximately $293.9 million U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at December 31, 2006) unsecured revolving credit facility; Raised approximately $48.1 million in net proceeds from the issuance and sale of $50.0 million of our 6.85% Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock; Issued $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior unsecured notes under the operating partnerships 2006 medium term note program which mature on August 15, 2013 and bear interest at a rate of 5.90% per annum; and 43 Entered into a 228.0 million Euro (approximately $300.9 million U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at December 31, 2006) revolving credit facility agreement, which provides for loans on a secured and unsecured basis. See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 6, 9 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our capital markets transactions. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Investments in Real Estate. Investments in real estate and leasehold interests are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. We also regularly review the impact of above or below market leases, in place leases and lease origination costs for all new acquisitions, and record an intangible asset or liability accordingly. Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a property by property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable. Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying value of the property. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future economics and market conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying value of our long lived assets could occur in the future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings. As a result of leasing activity and the economic environment, we re evaluated the carrying value of our investments and recorded impairment charges of $6.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 on certain of our investments. Revenue Recognition. We record rental revenue from operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts, security deposits and letters of credit, then we may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our customers on an on going basis by reviewing their financial condition periodically as appropriate. Each period we review our outstanding accounts receivable, including straight line rents, for doubtful accounts and provide allowances as needed. We also record lease termination fees when a customer has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us. If a customer remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement, the applicable termination fees are deferred and recognized over the term of such customers occupancy. Property Dispositions. We report real estate dispositions in three separate categories on our consolidated statements of operations. First, when we divest a portion of our interests in real estate entities or properties, gains from the sale represent the interests acquired by third party investors for cash and are included in gains from disposition of real estate interests in the statement of operations. Second, we dispose of value added conversion projects and build to suit and speculative development projects for which we have not generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable, and are included in development profits, net of taxes, in the statement of operations. Lastly, 44 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, requires us to separately report as discontinued operations the historical operating results attributable to operating properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the properties, which is included in gains from dispositions of real estate, net of minority interests, in the statement of operations. The consolidated statements of operations for prior periods are also adjusted to conform with this classification. There is no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial position, net income or cash flows. In all cases, gains and losses are recognized using the full accrual method of accounting. Gains relating to transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met. Joint Ventures. We hold interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We determine consolidation based on standards set forth in EITF 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights or FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN 46. Based on the guidance set forth in EITF 04 5, we consolidate certain joint venture investments because we exercise significant control over major operating decisions, such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, asset management, investment activity and changes in financing. For joint ventures that are variable interest entities as defined under FIN 46 where we are not the primary beneficiaries, we do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. For joint ventures under EITF 04 5, where we do not exercise significant control over major operating and management decisions, but where we exercise significant influence, we use the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. Real Estate Investment Trust. As a real estate investment trust, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes in the U.S. if we meet minimum distribution, income, asset and shareholder tests. However, some of our subsidiaries may be subject to federal and state taxes. In addition, foreign entities may also be subject to the taxes of the host country. An income tax allocation is required to be estimated on our taxable income arising from our taxable real estate investment trust subsidiaries and international entities. A deferred tax component could arise based upon the differences in GAAP versus tax income for items such as depreciation and gain recognition. However, we believe deferred tax is an immaterial component of our consolidated balance sheet. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Effective October 1, 2006, we deconsolidated AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., on a prospective basis, due to the re evaluation of the accounting for our investment in the fund in light of changes to the partnership agreement regarding the general partners rights effective October 1, 2006. As a result, our results of operations presented below are not comparable between years presented. The analysis below includes changes attributable to same store growth, acquisitions, development activity and divestitures. Same store properties are those that we owned during both the current and prior year reporting periods, excluding development properties stabilized after December 31, 2004 (generally defined as properties that are 90% leased or properties for which we have held a certificate of occupancy or where building has been substantially complete for at least 12 months). As of December 31, 2006, same store industrial properties consisted of properties aggregating approximately 71.2 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2006 consisted of 73 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. During 2006, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 50 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.5 million square feet. In 2005, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 150 buildings, aggregating approximately 10.6 million square feet. Our future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition of additional properties and dispositions. Our future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical results. 45 For the Years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (dollars in millions) Revenues 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Rental revenues U.S. industrial: Same store $ 514.9 $ 501.5 $ 13.4 2.7 % 2006 acquisitions 4.4 4.4 % 2005 acquisitions 19.4 11.4 8.0 70.2 % Development 8.3 7.4 0.9 12.2 % Other industrial 74.3 63.6 10.7 16.8 % Non U.S. industrial 62.5 33.1 29.4 88.8 % Total rental revenues 683.8 617.0 66.8 10.8 % Private capital income 46.1 43.9 2.2 5.0 % Total revenues $ 729.9 $ 660.9 $ 69.0 10.4 % U.S. industrial same store revenues increased $13.4 million from the prior year despite the decrease of $12.8 million in same store revenues due to the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., effective October 1, 2006, attributable primarily to improved occupancy and increased rental rates in various markets. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2006 consisted of 73 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. Non U.S. industrial revenues increased approximately $29.4 million from the prior year due primarily to the stabilization of three properties in Japan and the continued acquisition of properties in France, Germany and Mexico. The increase in private capital income was primarily due to increased asset management and acquisition fees from additional assets held in co investment joint ventures, which were partially offset by a decrease in incentive distributions of approximately $3.9 million. During 2006, we received 46 incentive distributions of $22.5 million, of which $19.8 million was from AMB Partners II, L.P., as compared to incentive distribution of $26.4 million for the sale of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., during 2005.

The 2005 acquisitions consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. The 2006 acquisitions consisted of 73 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. Non U.S. industrial revenues increased approximately $6.0 million from the prior year due primarily to the stabilization of three properties in Japan and the continued acquisition of properties in France, Germany and Mexico. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The 2006 impairment loss was taken on several non core assets as a result of leasing activities and changes in the economic environment and the holding period of certain assets. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased stock based compensation expense as a result of higher values assigned to option and stock awards and executive departures, additional staffing and expenses for our international expansion, and the acquisition of AMB Blackpine. Other expenses decreased approximately $2.4 million from the prior year due primarily to a decrease in losses associated with our deferred compensation plan and a decrease in certain deal costs. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our co investment joint ventures. 47 Other Income and (Expenses) 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures, net $ 23.2 $ 10.8 $ 12.4 114.8 % Other income 9.4 5.6 3.8 67.9 % Gains from dispositions of real estate interests, net 19.1 (19.1 ) (100.0 )% Development profits, net of taxes 106.4 54.8 51.6 94.2 % Interest expense, including amortization (165.2 ) (147.3 ) 17.9 12.2 % Total other income and (expenses), net $ (26.2 ) $ (57.0 ) $ (30.8 ) (54.0 )% The $12.4 million increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was primarily due to gains of $17.5 million from the disposition of real estate by our unconsolidated co investment joint ventures during 2006 as opposed to $5.5 million of such gains during 2005 and, effective October 1, 2006, the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., which resulted in an increase of approximately $5.1 million. These increases were partially offset by an increase in expenses by our unconsolidated joint ventures. The increase in other income was primarily due to increased bank interest income and an increase in property management income due to the expansion of our property management business. The 2005 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted primarily from our contribution of $106.9 million (using the exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties to our then newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. Development profits represent gains from the sale of development projects and land as part of our development for sale program. The increase in development profits was due to increased disposition and contribution volume during 2006. During 2006, we sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $13.3 million. In addition, during 2006, we received approximately $0.4 million in connection with the condemnation of a parcel of land resulting in a loss of $1.0 million, $0.8 million of which was the joint venture partners share. During 2006, we also contributed a total of ten completed development projects into unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. Four projects totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Japan Fund I, L.P, two projects totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet were contributed into AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, three projects totaling approximately 0.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and one land parcel into AMB DFS Fund I, LLC. As a result of these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after tax gain of $94.1 million, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party investors for cash. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $1.9 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. The increase in interest expense, including amortization, was due primarily to increased borrowings on unsecured credit facilities and other debt.

During 2005, we divested ourselves of 142 industrial buildings and one retail center, aggregating approximately 9.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $926.6 million, with a resulting net gain of $113.6 million. Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., for $618.5 million. The multi investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. We 48 received cash and a distribution of an on tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund.

In August 2006, we issued 2,000,000 shares of 6.85% Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. The increase in preferred stock dividends is due to the newly issued shares. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2006, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, repurchased all 840,000 of its outstanding 8.125% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units, all 220,440 of its outstanding 7.75% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units, all 201,139 of its outstanding 7.95% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units and all 729,582 of its outstanding 5.00% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units. As a result, we recognized a decrease in income available to common stockholders of $1.1 million for the original issuance costs, net of discount on repurchase.

The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2004 and 2005, we continued to acquire properties in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial revenues. The increase in private capital income was primarily due to increased asset management fees from additional assets held in co investment joint ventures and incentive distributions for 2005 of $26.4 million for the sale of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, asset 49 management priority distributions from AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., and acquisition fees from AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P.

In 2004 and 2005, we continued to acquire properties in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial property operating costs. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate during the year. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international and development expansions and the expansion of satellite offices. Other expenses increased approximately $2.4 million from the prior year due primarily to greater losses on our non qualified deferred compensation plan in 2005 and an increase in certain deal costs.

The increase in other income was primarily due to increased bank interest income. The 2005 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted primarily from our contribution of $106.9 million (using exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties to our newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. The 2004 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted from our contribution of $71.5 million in operating properties to our unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC. Development profits represent gains from the sale of development projects and land as part of our development for sale program. The increase in development profits was due to increased volume in 2005. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $1.9 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. During 2004, we sold seven land parcels and six development projects as part of our development for sale program, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet for an aggregate price of $40.4 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $6.5 million. During 2004, we also contributed one completed development project into a newly formed unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $2.0 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash.

The increase in preferred stock dividends is due to the newly issued shares. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Balance Sheet Strategy. In general, we use unsecured lines of credit, unsecured notes, preferred stock and common equity (issued by us and or the operating partnership and its subsidiaries) to capitalize our 100% owned assets. Over time, we plan to retire non recourse, secured debt encumbering our 100% owned assets and replace that debt with unsecured notes. In managing our co investment joint ventures, in general, we use non recourse, secured debt to capitalize our co investment joint ventures. We currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for acquisitions, development, expansion and renovation of properties will include: retained earnings and cash flow from operations; 51 private capital from co investment partners; net proceeds from contribution of properties and completed development projects to our co investment joint ventures; borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities; other forms of secured or unsecured financing; proceeds from equity (common and preferred) or debt securities offerings; proceeds from limited partnership unit offerings (including issuances of limited partnership units by our subsidiaries); and net proceeds from divestitures of properties. We currently expect that our principal funding requirements will include: working capital; development, expansion and renovation of properties; acquisitions, including our global expansion; debt service; and dividends and distributions on outstanding common and preferred stock and limited partnership units. Cash flows. As of December 31, 2006, cash provided by operating activities was $335.9 million as compared to $295.8 million for the same period in 2005. This change is primarily due to increases in rental rates, partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses primarily due to additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international and development expansions and increased occupancy costs related to the expansion of regional offices. Cash used for investing activities was $880.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to cash used for investing activities of $60.4 million for the same period in 2005. This change is primarily due to an increase in funds used for property acquisitions and capital expenditures, and a decrease in proceeds from property divestitures (mainly due to the divesture of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., portfolio in 2005), offset by less funds used for additions to interests in unconsolidated joint ventures and an increase in capital distributions received from unconsolidated joint ventures. Cash provided by financing activities was $483.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to cash used in financing activities of $101.9 million for the same period in 2005. This change is due primarily to an increase in borrowings, net of repayments, issuance of common stock upon the exercise of options and issuances of preferred stock, offset by the cost of the repurchase of preferred units for the year ended December 31, 2006. We believe that our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow from operations, borrowings available under our unsecured credit facilities and our ability to access private and public debt and equity capital, are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Resources Property Divestitures. During 2006, we divested ourselves of 39 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 3.5 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $175.3 million, with a resulting net gain of $42.6 million. Development Sales. During 2006, we sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $13.3 million. In addition, during 2006, we received approximately $0.4 million in connection with the condemnation of a parcel of land resulting in a loss of $1.0 million, $0.8 million of which was the joint venture partners share. 52 Development Contributions. During 2006, we contributed a total of nine completed development projects and one land parcel into unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. Four projects totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Japan Fund I, L.P, two projects totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet were contributed into AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and three projects totaling approximately 0.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. In addition, one land parcel was contributed into AMB DFS Fund I, LLC. As a result of these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after tax gain of $94.1 million, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party investors for cash. These gains are included in development profits, net of taxes, in the statement of operations. Properties Held for Contribution. As of December 31, 2006, we held for contribution to co investment joint ventures, nine industrial projects with an aggregate net book value of $154.0 million, which, when contributed to a joint venture, will reduce our current ownership interest from approximately 100% to an expected range of 15 50%. Properties Held for Divestiture. As of December 31, 2006, we held for divestiture four industrial projects, which are not in our core markets, do not meet our current strategic objectives or which we have included as part of our development for sale program. The divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. As of December 31, 2006, the net carrying value of the properties held for divestiture was $20.9 million. Expected net sales proceeds exceed the net carrying value of the properties. Co investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund certain acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. We generally consolidate these joint ventures for financial reporting purposes because they are not variable interest entities and because we are the sole managing general partner and control all major operating decisions. However, in certain cases, our co investment joint ventures are unconsolidated because we do not control all major operating decisions and the general partners do not have significant rights under EITF 04 5. Third party equity interests in the joint ventures are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2006, we owned approximately 64.3 million square feet of our properties (51.6% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so.

(6) The planned gross capitalization and investment capacity of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. as an open end fund, is not limited. The planned gross capitalization represents the gross book value of real estate assets as of the most recent quarter end. (7) AMB DFS Fund I, LLC is a co investment partnership formed in 2006 with a subsidiary of GE Real Estate to build and sell properties. We also have a 0.1% unconsolidated equity interest (with an approximate 33% economic interest) in AMB Pier One, LLC, a joint venture related to the 2000 redevelopment of the pier which houses our office space in the San Francisco Bay Area. The investment is not consolidated because we do not exercise control over major operating decisions such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, investment activity and changes in financing. We have an option to purchase the remaining equity interest beginning January 1, 2007 and expiring December 31, 2009, based on the fair market value as stipulated in the joint venture agreement. As of December 31, 2006, we also had an approximate 39.0% unconsolidated equity interest in G.Accion, a Mexican real estate company. G.Accion provides management and development services for industrial, retail, residential and office properties in Mexico. In addition, as of December 31, 2006, one of our subsidiaries also had an approximate 5% interest in IAT Air Cargo Facilities Income Fund (IAT), a Canadian income trust specializing in aviation related real estate at Canadas leading international airports. This equity investment is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Common and Preferred Equity. We have authorized for issuance 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which the following series were designated as of December 31, 2006: 1,595,337 shares of series D preferred; 510,000 shares of series I cumulative redeemable preferred; 800,000 shares of series J cumulative redeemable preferred; 800,000 shares of series K cumulative redeemable preferred; 2,300,000 shares of series L cumulative redeemable preferred, of which 2,000,000 are outstanding; 2,300,000 shares of series M cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which are outstanding; 3,000,000 shares of series O cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which are outstanding; and 2,000,000 shares of series P cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which are outstanding.

The series N preferred units were issued to Robert Pattillo Properties, Inc. in exchange for the contribution to AMB Property II, L.P of certain parcels of land that are located in multiple markets.

We, in turn, used those proceeds to redeem all 3,995,800 of our 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for $100.2 million, including all accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, to the redemption date. In December 2005, our board of directors approved a new two year common stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of our common stock. We did not repurchase or retire any shares of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2006. Debt. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, we presently intend to operate with an our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio of approximately 45% or less. As of December 31, 2006, our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio was 34.2%. (See footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratios table below for our definitions of our share of total market capitalization, market equity and our share of total debt.) However, we typically finance our co investment joint ventures with secured debt at a loan to value ratio of 50 65% per our joint venture agreements. Additionally, we currently intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these policies, however, our organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our management could alter or eliminate these policies without stockholder approval or circumstances could arise that could render us unable to comply with these policies. As of December 31, 2006, the aggregate principal amount of our secured debt was $1.4 billion, excluding unamortized debt premiums of $6.3 million. Of the $1.4 billion of secured debt, $1.0 billion is secured by properties in our joint ventures. The secured debt is generally non recourse and bears interest at rates varying from 2.9% to 10.4% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 6.2%) and final maturity dates ranging from February 2007 to January 2025. As of December 31, 2006, $1.0 billion of the secured debt obligations bear interest at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 6.1%, while the remaining $386.1 million bear interest at variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 4.7%). As of December 31, 2006, the operating partnership had outstanding an aggregate of $1.1 billion in unsecured senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 6.2% and had a weighted average term of 4.8 years. These unsecured senior debt securities include $300.0 million in notes issued in June 1998, $225.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2000 medium term note program, $275.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2002 medium term note program, $175.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2006 medium term note program and approximately $112.5 million of 5.094% Notes Due 2015, which were issued to Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America on July 11, 2005 in a private placement, in exchange for the cancellation of $100.0 million of notes that were issued in June 1998 resulting in a discount of approximately $12.5 million. The unsecured senior debt securities are subject to various covenants. Also included is a $25.0 million promissory note which matures in January 2007. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to its senior debt securities. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then our cash flow may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Credit Facilities. On June 1, 2006, the operating partnership entered into a third amended and restated $550.0 million unsecured revolving credit agreement that replaced its then existing $500.0 million credit facility, which was to mature on June 1, 2007. We are a guarantor of the operating partnerships obligations under the credit facility. The line, which matures on June 1, 2010, carries a one year extension option and can be increased to up to 56 $700.0 million upon certain conditions. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the operating partnerships long term debt rating, which was 42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2006, with an annual facility fee of 15 basis points. The four year credit facility includes a multi currency component, under which up to $550.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Euros, Yen or British Pounds Sterling. The operating partnership uses its unsecured credit facility principally for acquisitions, funding development activity and general working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on the credit facility was $303.7 million and the remaining amount available was $234.6 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $11.7 million. The outstanding balance included borrowings denominated in Euros, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately $303.7 million U.S. dollars. On June 23, 2006, AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating partnership and as the initial borrower, entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement for a 45.0 billion Yen unsecured revolving credit facility, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately $377.9 million U.S. dollars. This replaced the 35.0 billion Yen unsecured revolving credit facility executed on June 29, 2004, as previously amended, which using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately $293.9 million U.S. dollars. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K. under the credit facility, as well as the obligations of any other entity in which the operating partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the credit agreement. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and for other real estate purposes in Japan, China and South Korea. Generally, borrowers under the credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the credit facility with certain real estate assets or equity in entities holding such real estate assets. The credit facility matures in June 2010 and has a one year extension option. The credit facility can be increased to up to 55.0 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately $461.9 million U.S. dollars. The extension option is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding commitments under the facility at that time. The rate on the borrowings is generally TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt and was 42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2006. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, payable in quarterly amounts, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt, and was 15 basis points of the outstanding commitments under the facility as of December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, was $320.9 million in U.S. dollars. On June 13, 2006, the operating partnership and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries entered into a fourth amended and restated credit agreement for a $250.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which replaced the third amended and restated credit agreement for a $250.0 million unsecured credit facility. On February 16, 2006, the third amended and restated credit agreement replaced the then existing $100.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that was to mature in June 2008. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations for such subsidiaries and other entities controlled by us or the operating partnership that are selected by the operating partnership from time to time to be borrowers under and pursuant to the credit facility. The four year credit facility includes a multi currency component under which up to $250.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Singapore dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros. The line, which matures in February 2010 and carries a one year extension option, can be increased to up to $350.0 million upon certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding commitments. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships senior unsecured long term debt, which was 60 basis points as of December 31, 2006, with an annual facility fee based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships senior unsecured long term debt. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and general working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on this facility was approximately $227.4 million. The credit agreement contains affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios by the operating partnership, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. 57 Mortgages Receivable. Through a wholly owned subsidiary, we hold a mortgage loan receivable on AMB Pier One, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture. The note bears interest at 13.0% and matures in May 2026. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on the note was $12.7 million. We also hold a loan receivable on G. Accion, an unconsolidated joint venture totaling $6.1 million with an interest rate of 10.0%. The loan matures in March 2010.

(4) Our share of total debt is the pro rata portion of the total debt based on our percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated or unconsolidated joint ventures holding the debt. We believe that our share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze our leverage and to compare our leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of our debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their joint ventures. Our share of total debt is not intended to reflect our actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures.

As of December 31, 2006, we had $21.1 million in restricted cash. Our board of directors declared a regular cash dividend for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 of $0.46 per share of common stock, and the operating partnership announced its intention to pay a regular cash distribution for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 of $0.46 per common unit. The dividends and distributions were payable on January 5, 2007 to stockholders and unitholders of record on December 22, 2006. The series L, M, O and P preferred stock dividends were payable on January 16, 2007 to stockholders of record on January 5, 2007. The series J and K preferred unit quarterly distributions were payable on January 16, 2007. The series D and I preferred unit quarterly distributions were paid on December 25, 2006. The following table sets forth the dividends and distributions paid or payable per share or unit for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004: Paying Entity Security 2006 2005 2004 AMB Property Corporation Common stock $ 1.84 $ 1.76 $ 1.70 AMB Property Corporation Series L preferred stock $ 1.63 $ 1.63 $ 1.63 AMB Property Corporation Series M preferred stock $ 1.69 $ 1.69 $ 1.69 AMB Property Corporation Series O preferred stock $ 1.75 $ 0.09 n/a AMB Property Corporation Series P preferred stock $ 0.60 n/a n/a Operating Partnership Common limited partnership units $ 1.84 $ 1.76 $ 1.70 Operating Partnership Series J preferred units $ 3.98 $ 3.98 $ 3.98 Operating Partnership Series K preferred units $ 3.98 $ 3.98 $ 3.98 AMB Property II, L.P.

(2) In September 2006, AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased all of its outstanding series F preferred units. (3) In March 2006, AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased all of its outstanding series H preferred units. (4) The holder of the series N preferred units exercised its put option in January 2006 and sold all of its series N preferred units to the operating partnership and AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased all of such units from the operating partnership. The anticipated size of our distributions, using only cash from operations, will not allow us to retire all of our debt as it comes due. Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Commitments Development Starts. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we initiated 30 new industrial development projects in North America, Europe and Asia with a total expected investment of $914.3 million, aggregating approximately 10.4 million square feet. During 2005, we initiated 30 new industrial development projects in North America, Europe and Asia with a total expected investment of $522.4 million, aggregating approximately 7.0 million square feet. 60 Development Pipeline. As of December 31, 2006, we had 45 industrial projects in our development pipeline, which will total approximately 13.7 million square feet, and will have an aggregate estimated investment of $1.3 billion upon completion. We have an additional ten development projects available for sale or contribution totaling approximately 3.0 million square feet, with an aggregate estimated investment of $199.2 million. One of these ten projects totaling $13.0 million and approximately 0.2 million square feet is held in an unconsolidated joint venture. As of December 31, 2006, we and our joint venture partners had funded an aggregate of $814.5 million and needed to fund an estimated additional $481.0 million in order to complete our development pipeline which includes projects expected to be completed through the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we acquired 835 acres of land for industrial warehouse development in North America and Asia for approximately $293.2 million. Acquisitions. During 2006, we acquired 106 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 9.8 million square feet for a total expected investment of $834.2 million (includes acquisition costs of $814.1 million and estimated acquisition capital of $20.1 million), of which we acquired 70 buildings through one of our unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. We generally fund our acquisitions through private capital contributions, borrowings under our credit facilities, cash, debt issuances and net proceeds from property divestitures. Lease Commitments. We have entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily on tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms from one to 55 years. These buildings and improvements are amortized ratably over the lesser of the terms of the related leases or 40 years. Future minimum rental payments required under non cancelable operating leases in effect as of December 31, 2006 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2007 $ 21,636 2008 22,186 2009 21,506 2010 20,667 2011 20,668 Thereafter 272,483 Total $ 379,146 Co investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. As of December 31, 2006, we had investments in co investment joint ventures with a gross book value of $1.9 billion, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, and net equity investments in four unconsolidated co investment joint ventures of $236.0 million and a gross book value of $2.5 billion. As of December 31, 2006, we may make additional capital contributions to current and planned co investment joint ventures of up to $168.2 million (using the exchange rates at December 31, 2006) pursuant to the terms of the joint venture agreements. From time to time, we may raise additional equity commitments for AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open ended unconsolidated co investment joint venture formed in 2004 with institutional investors, which invests through a private real estate investment trust. This would increase our obligation to make additional capital commitments. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of this fund, we are obligated to contribute 20% of the total equity commitments to the fund until such time our total equity commitment is greater than $150.0 million, at which time, our obligation is reduced to 10% of the total equity commitments. We expect to fund these contributions with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances or net proceeds from property divestitures, which could adversely effect our cash flow. Captive Insurance Company. In December 2001, we formed a wholly owned captive insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., (Arcata), which provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the deductible under our third party policies. The captive insurance company is one element of our overall risk management program. We capitalized Arcata in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata established annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss experience of our properties. Annually, 61 we engage an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims, related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata may be adjusted based on this estimate. Like premiums paid to third party insurance companies, premiums paid to Arcata may be reimbursed by customers pursuant to specific lease terms. Through this structure, we believe that we have more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market. Potential Contingent and Unknown Liabilities. Contingent and unknown liabilities may include the following: liabilities for environmental conditions; claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to our formation or acquisition transactions that had not been asserted prior to our formation or acquisition transactions; accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; tax liabilities; and claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these entities. Overview of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our debt, interest and lease payments due by period as of December 31, 2006 (dollars in thousands): Less than More than Contractual Obligations 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Total Debt $ 213,869 $ 592,085 $ 1,593,035 $ 1,042,699 $ 3,441,688 Debt interest payments 13,861 38,126 74,416 58,775 185,178 Operating lease commitments 21,636 43,692 41,335 272,483 379,146 Construction commitments 31,713 57,042 88,755 Total $ 281,079 $ 730,945 $ 1,708,786 $ 1,373,957 $ 4,094,767 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Standby Letters of Credit. As of December 31, 2006, we had provided approximately $22.1 million in letters of credit, of which $11.7 million was provided under the operating partnerships $550.0 million unsecured credit facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other commitments. Guarantees. Other than parent guarantees associated with the unsecured debt, as of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding guarantees in the aggregate amount of $48.2 million in connection with certain acquisitions. As of December 31, 2006, we guaranteed $26.8 million and $83.2 million on outstanding loans on two of our consolidated joint ventures and two of our unconsolidated joint ventures, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2006, we guaranteed $87.3 million on outstanding property debt related to one of our unconsolidated joint ventures. Performance and Surety Bonds. As of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $11.4 million. These bonds were issued in connection with certain of our development projects and were posted to guarantee certain tax obligations and the construction of certain real property improvements and infrastructure, such as grading, sewers and streets. Performance and surety bonds are commonly required by public agencies from real estate developers. Performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the taxes due or the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. Promoted Interests and Other Contractual Obligations. Upon the achievement of certain return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, we may be obligated to make payments to certain of our joint venture partners 62 pursuant to the terms and provisions of their contractual agreements with us. From time to time in the normal course of our business, we enter into various contracts with third parties that may obligate us to make payments, pay promotes, or perform other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. SUPPLEMENTAL EARNINGS MEASURES FFO. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider funds from operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. FFO is defined as net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, less gains (or losses) from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estate related depreciation, and adjustments to derive our pro rata share of FFO of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. Further, we do not adjust FFO to eliminate the effects of non recurring charges. We believe that FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. We believe that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. The following table reflects the calculation of FFO reconciled from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Net income(1) $ 224,072 $ 257,807 $ 125,471 $ 129,128 $ 121,119 Gains from dispositions of real estate, net of minority interests(2) (42,635 ) (132,652 ) (47,224 ) (50,325 ) (19,383 ) Real estate, related depreciation and amortization: Total depreciation and amortization 177,824 161,732 136,610 111,879 103,550 Discontinued operations depreciation 2,153 18,572 30,740 30,458 32,953 Non real estate depreciation (4,546 ) (3,388 ) (871 ) (720 ) (712 ) Ground lease amortization (2,301 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from consolidated joint ventures: Joint venture partners minority interests (Net income) 37,975 36,401 29,360 22,276 16,529 63 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Net income) 2,805 3,411 2,384 2,117 3,303 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Development profits) 4,948 2,262 435 344 57 Discontinued operations minority interests (Net income) 31 8,769 13,964 15,214 16,597 FFO attributable to minority interests (82,861 ) (100,275 ) (80,192 ) (65,603 ) (52,051 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures: Our share of net income (23,240 ) (10,770 ) (3,781 ) (5,445 ) (5,674 ) Our share of FFO 16,038 14,441 7,549 9,755 9,291 Our share of development profits, net of taxes 5,441 Preferred stock dividends (13,582 ) (7,388 ) (7,131 ) (6,999 ) (8,496 ) Preferred stock and unit redemption discount (issuance costs) (1,070 ) (5,413 ) 412 Funds from operations $ 297,912 $ 254,363 $ 207,314 $ 186,666 $ 215,194 Basic FFO per common share and unit $ 3.24 $ 2.87 $ 2.39 $ 2.17 $ 2.44 Diluted FFO per common share and unit $ 3.12 $ 2.75 $ 2.30 $ 2.13 $ 2.40 Weighted average common shares and units: Basic 92,047,678 88,684,262 86,885,250 85,859,899 88,204,208 Diluted 95,444,072 92,508,725 90,120,250 87,616,365 89,689,310 (1) Includes gains from undepreciated land sales of $5.6 million, $25.0 million, $3.7 million and $1.2 million for 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. (2) The information for 2005 includes accumulated depreciation re capture of approximately $1.1 million associated with the sale of the Interstate Crossdock redevelopment project. SS NOI. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider same store net operating income, or SS NOI, to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. For properties that are considered part of the same store pool, see Part I, Item 2: Properties Industrial Properties Owned and Managed Market Operating Statistics, Note 6, and Owned and Managed Operating and Leasing Statistics Owned and Managed Same Store Operating Statistics, Note 2. In deriving SS NOI, we define NOI as rental revenues (as calculated in accordance with GAAP), including reimbursements, less straight line rents, property operating expenses and real estate taxes. We exclude straight line rents in calculating SS NOI because we believe it provides a better measure of actual cash basis rental growth for a year over year comparison. In addition, we believe that SS NOI helps the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate as compared to other companies. While SS NOI is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. SS NOI also does not reflect general and administrative expense, interest expenses, depreciation and amortization costs, capital expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development and construction activities that could materially impact our results from operations. Further, our computation of SS NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating SS NOI. 64 The following table reconciles SS NOI from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Net income $ 224,072 $ 257,807 $ 125,471 Private capital income (46,102 ) (43,942 ) (12,895 ) Depreciation and amortization 177,824 161,732 136,610 Impairment losses 6,312 General and administrative 104,262 71,564 57,181 Other expenses 2,620 5,038 2,554 Fund costs 2,091 1,482 1,741 Total other income and expenses 26,178 57,044 119,727 Total minority interests share of income 62,855 74,777 52,863 Total discontinued operations (51,949 ) (127,498 ) (63,888 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (193 ) Net Operating Income (NOI) 507,970 458,004 419,364 Less non same store NOI (116,030 ) (70,782 ) (19,990 ) Less non cash adjustments(1) (8,426 ) (9,861 ) (8,249 ) Cash basis same store NOI $ 383,514 $ 377,361 $ 391,125 (1) Non cash adjustments include straight line rents and amortization of lease intangibles for the same store pool only. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices, interest rates and international exchange rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimize the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings and our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2006, we had three outstanding interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $38.1 million (in U.S. dollars). See Financial Instruments below. The table below summarizes the market risks associated with our fixed and variable rate debt outstanding before net unamortized debt discounts of $4.3 million as of December 31, 2006 (dollars in thousands): 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Fixed rate debt(1) $ 155,384 $ 368,141 $ 152,151 $ 430,676 $ 288,835 $ 768,320 $ 2,163,507 Average interest rate 6.7 % 7.1 % 4.7 % 6.4 % 6.8 % 5.9 % 6.3 % Variable rate debt(2) $ 58,485 $ 22,604 $ 49,189 $ 854,543 $ 18,981 $ 274,379 $ 1,278,181 Average interest rate 5.9 % 6.6 % 6.8 % 3.1 % 3.8 % 4.9 % 3.8 % Interest Payments $ 13,861 $ 27,630 $ 10,496 $ 54,054 $ 20,362 $ 58,775 $ 185,178 (1) Represents 62.9% of all outstanding debt. (2) Represents 37.1% of all outstanding debt. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased or decreased by 10%, then the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would be $4.9 million (net of swaps) annually. As of December 31, 65 2006, the book value and the estimated fair value of our total consolidated debt (both secured and unsecured) was $3.4 and $3.5 billion, respectively, based on our estimate of current market interest rates. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, variable rate debt comprised 37.1% and 24.5%, respectively, of all our outstanding debt. Variable rate debt was $1.3 billion and $831.7 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. The increase is primarily due to higher outstanding balances on our credit facilities. This increase in our outstanding variable rate debt increases our risk associated with unfavorable interest rate fluctuations. Financial Instruments. We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income or income. For revenues or expenses denominated in non functional currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments in effect at December 31, 2006 were three interest rate swaps hedging cash flows of our variable rate borrowings based on U.S. Libor (USD) and Euribor (Europe). The following table summarizes our financial instruments as of December 31, 2006 (in thousands): Maturity Dates Related Derivatives (in thousands) December 8, 2008 June 8, 2010 November 1, 2014 Notional Amount Fair Value Interest Rate Swaps: Plain Interest Rate Swap, Europe Notional Amount (U.S. dollars) $ 9,655 $ 9,655 Receive Floating(%) 3MEURIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 3.72 % Fair Market Value $ 54 Plain Interest Rate Swap, USD Notional Amount (U.S. dollars) $ 25,000 25,000 Receive Floating(%) 3MLIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 5.17 % Fair Market Value (130 ) Plain Interest Rate Swap, Europe Notional Amount (U.S. dollars) $ 3,471 3,471 Receive Floating(%) 3MEURIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 4.26 % Fair Market Value (45 ) Total $ 38,126 $ (121 ) International Operations. Our exposure to market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries operating in the United States and Mexico. The functional currency for our subsidiaries operating outside the United States is generally the local currency of the country in which the entity is located, mitigating the effect of foreign exchange gains and losses. Our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. We translate income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. The losses resulting from the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity and totaled $0.2 million for year ended December 31, 2006. Our international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. In these instances, non monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2006, losses from remeasurement and the sale of four foreign exchange agreements included in our results of operations totaled $0.8 million. We also record gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated. 66

Secured Debt As of December 31, 2006, we had $1.4 billion of secured indebtedness, net of unamortized premiums, secured by deeds of trust or mortgages. As of December 31, 2006, the total gross consolidated investment value of those properties securing the debt was $2.6 billion. Of the $1.4 billion of secured indebtedness, $1.0 billion was consolidated joint venture debt secured by properties with a gross investment value of $1.9 billion. For additional details, see Part II, Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources and Part IV, Item 15: Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. We believe that as of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the properties securing the respective obligations in each case exceeded the principal amount of the outstanding obligations. Item 3. Legal Proceedings As of December 31, 2006, there were no pending legal proceedings to which we were a party or of which any of our properties was the subject, the adverse determination of which we anticipate would have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

(3) See Part II, Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Supplemental Earnings Measures FFO, for a discussion of why we believe FFO is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance, of ways in which investors might use FFO when assessing our financial performance, and of FFOs limitations as a measurement tool. (4) Our share of total debt is the pro rata portion of the total debt based on our percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated ventures holding the debt. We believe that our share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze our leverage and to compare our leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of our debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their joint ventures. Our share of total debt is not intended to reflect our actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures. For a reconciliation of our share of total debt to total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure, please see the table of debt maturities and capitalization in Part II, Item 7: Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources. (5) Effective October 1, 2006, we deconsolidated AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. on a prospective basis, due to the re evaluation of the accounting for our investment in the fund in light of changes to the partnership agreement regarding the general partners rights effective October 1, 2006. As a result, the financial measures for the years 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002, included in our operating data, other data and balance sheet data above are not comparable. 39 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations GENERAL You should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements. We commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company effective with the completion of our initial public offering on November 26, 1997, and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, with our initial tax return for the year ended December 31, 1997. AMB Property Corporation and AMB Property, L.P. were formed shortly before the consummation of our initial public offering. Managements Overview The primary source of our revenue and earnings is rent received from customers under long term (generally three to ten years) operating leases at our properties, including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs, and from partnership distributions and fees from our private capital business. We also produce earnings from the disposition of operating assets that no longer fit our strategy, from the disposition of projects in our development for sale program and from the contributions of properties to our co investment joint ventures. Our long term growth is driven by our ability to maintain and increase occupancy rates or increase rental rates at our properties, and by our ability to continue to acquire and develop new properties. National industrial markets continued to improve during 2006 when compared with market conditions in 2005. According to Torto Wheaton Research, availability dropped 10 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2006 to 9.4%, and availability for the year dropped 50 basis points. We believe the strongest industrial markets in the U.S. are the coastal gateway markets tied to global trade, including Los Angeles, our largest market, Miami, the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle, and to a lesser degree Northern New Jersey/New York (with the exception of the Exit 8A submarket). While we believe that the broader Chicago market is showing signs of stabilization, certain submarkets, like the OHare submarket, are relatively strong. We believe Dallas continues to recover, and Atlanta continues to suffer from a large increase in supply. We believe the operating environment in our U.S. on tarmac business remains good with improving cargo volumes and essentially no new supply. Investor demand for industrial property (as supported by our observation of strong national sales volumes and declining acquisition capitalization rates) has remained consistently strong over the past several years. We believe we capitalized on this demand for industrial property by accelerating the repositioning of our portfolio, through the disposition of non core properties, which was effectively completed in 2006 with our exit from the Charlotte and Memphis markets. We plan to continue selling selected assets on an opportunistic basis or that no longer fit our strategic investment objectives, but we believe we have substantially achieved our repositioning goals. Occupancy levels in our portfolio continue to outperform the national industrial market, as determined by Torto Wheaton Research, by pricing lease renewals and new leases with sensitivity to local market conditions. During the prior periods of decreasing or stabilizing rental rates, we strove to sign leases with shorter terms to prevent locking in lower rent levels for long periods and to be prepared to sign new, longer term leases during periods of growing rental rates. When we sign leases of shorter duration, we attempt to limit overall leasing costs and capital expenditures by offering different grades of tenant improvement packages, appropriate to the lease term. In our stronger markets, we are increasing rents as opposed to occupancy. 40 The table below summarizes key operating and leasing statistics for our owned and managed operating properties for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: U.S. Hub and Total Other Total/Weighted Owned and Managed Property Data(1) Gateway Markets(2) Markets(3) Average For the year ended December 31, 2006: % of total rentable square feet 72.0 % 28.0 % 100.0 % Occupancy percentage at year end 96.5 % 95.0 % 96.1 % Same space square footage leased 13,016,726 3,186,854 16,203,580 Rent (decreases) increases on renewals and rollovers(4) (0.4 )% 1.6 % (0.1 )% For the year ended December 31, 2005:(5) % of total rentable square feet 74.9 % 25.1 % 100.0 % Occupancy percentage at year end 96.2 % 94.6 % 95.8 % Same space square footage leased 11,032,482 2,574,944 13,607,426 Rent decreases on renewals and rollovers (10.8 )% (4.3 )% (9.7 )% (1) Schedule includes owned and managed operating properties which we define as properties in which we have at least a 10% ownership interest, for which we are the property or asset manager, and which we intend to hold for the long term. (2) Our U.S. hub and gateway markets include on tarmac and Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, Northern New Jersey/New York City, San Francisco Bay Area, and Seattle. (3) Our total markets include other U.S. target markets, other non target markets, and non U.S. target markets. (4) On a consolidated basis, rent increases on renewals and rollovers were 4.4% and 3.0%, respectively, for U.S. hub and gateway markets and total other markets. (5) The information for 2005 is presented on a consolidated basis while the information for 2006 is presented on an owned and managed basis. Management believes that the difference in comparability between the information for 2006 and 2005 is not significant. At December 31, 2006, our operating portfolios occupancy rate was 96.1%, on an owned and managed basis (97.0% on a consolidated basis), an increase from both the prior quarter and December 31, 2005. Rental rates on lease renewals and rollovers in our portfolio increased 4.1% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and decreased 0.1% for the full year. Cash basis same store net operating income (rental revenues less property operating expenses and real estate taxes for properties included in the same store pool, which is set annually and excludes properties purchased or developments stabilized after December 31, 2004) grew by 1.3% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and 2.6% for the full year 2006, on an owned and managed basis. Excluding lease termination fees, same store net operating income grew 3.0% and 3.2% in the quarter and for the full year (decreased 0.5% and increased 1.6%, respectively, on a consolidated basis), respectively, on an owned and managed basis. See Part II, Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Supplemental Earnings Measures for a discussion of same store net operating income and a reconciliation of same store net operating income and net income. We currently expect that same store growth in our operating portfolio, excluding lease termination fees, will be about 3% to 4% for 2007, on an owned and managed basis. Market rents continue to rebound from their lows and in many of our hub and gateway markets are back to or above their prior peak levels of 2001. We believe that industrial market rents in the San Francisco Bay Area are improving. While market rents in the San Francisco Bay Area were up 10% to 15% in 2006, rents still have not yet fully recovered to normal levels. Rents on lease renewals and rollovers in the San Francisco Bay Area declined 21.0% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and 13.2% for the full year 2006, on an owned and managed basis. Without the effect of the San Francisco Bay Area, rents on renewals and rollovers for the full year 2006 would have been 2.0%, on an owned and managed basis, which we believe reflects the generally positive trends in U.S. industrial space availability. We expect development to be a significant driver of our earnings growth as we expand our land and development pipeline, and contribute completed development projects into our co investment program and recognize development profits. We believe that development, renovation and expansion of well located, high 41 quality industrial properties should generally continue to provide us with attractive investment opportunities at a higher rate of return than we may obtain from the purchase of existing properties. We believe that our development opportunities in Mexico, Japan and China are particularly attractive given the current lack of supply of modern industrial distribution facilities in the major metropolitan markets of these countries. Prior to our global expansion, our development pipeline was $106.8 million at the end of 2002. As a result of our global expansion and increased development capabilities, we have increased our development pipeline to approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2006. In addition to our committed development pipeline, we hold a total of 1,735 acres for future development or sale, of which 92% is in North America. We believe these 1,735 acres of land could support approximately 30.5 million square feet of future development. Going forward, we believe that our co investment program with private capital investors will continue to serve as a significant source of revenues and capital for new investments. Through these co investment joint ventures, we typically earn acquisition fees, asset management fees and priority distributions, as well as promoted interests and incentive distributions based on the performance of the co investment joint ventures; however, we cannot assure you that we will continue to do so. Through contribution of development properties to our co investment joint ventures, we expect to recognize value creation from our development pipeline. As of December 31, 2006, we owned approximately 64.3 million square feet of our properties (51.6% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these co investment joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. By the end of 2010, we expect to have approximately 50% of our owned and managed operating portfolio invested in non U.S. markets (based on owned and managed annualized base rent). As of December 31, 2006, our non U.S. operating properties comprised 14.1% of our owned and managed operating portfolio (based on annualized base rent) and 7.4% of our consolidated operating portfolio (based on annualized base rent). Our North American target countries outside of the United States currently comprise Canada and Mexico. Our European target countries currently comprise Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. Our Asian target countries currently comprise China, India, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. We expect to add additional target countries outside the United States in the future. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust, we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income. As a result, we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our on going operations to the same extent that other corporations that are not real estate investment trusts can. We must continue to raise capital in both the debt and equity markets to fund our working capital needs, acquisitions and developments. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for a complete discussion of the sources of our capital. Summary of Key Transactions in 2006 During the year ended December 31, 2006, we completed the following significant capital deployment and other transactions: Acquired, on an owned and managed basis, 106 buildings in North America and Europe, aggregating approximately 9.8 million square feet, for $834.2 million; Committed to 30 development projects in North America, Asia and Europe totaling 10.4 million square feet with an estimated total investment of approximately $914.3 million; Acquired 835 acres of land for development in North America and Asia for approximately $293.2 million; Sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million; Contributed four completed development projects for $486.2 million to AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., two completed development projects for $56.4 million to AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, three completed development projects for $64.8 million to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. and one land parcel for $77.5 million to AMB DFS Fund I, LLC, all of which entities are unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. As a result of these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after tax gain of $94.1 million, 42 representing the portion of our interest in the contributed properties acquired by the third party co investors for cash; Divested ourselves of 73 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 6.4 million square feet, for an aggregate price of approximately $335.1 million, including 34 industrial buildings that were sold by two of our unconsolidated joint ventures; and Acquired the 50% interest in AMB BlackPine that we did not previously own; Received an incentive distribution of $19.8 million from AMB Partners II, L.P.; and Deconsolidated AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., on a prospective basis, as of October 1, 2006. See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our acquisition, development and disposition activity. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we completed the following significant capital markets and other financing transactions: Obtained long term secured debt financings for our co investment joint ventures of $141.6 million with a weighted average interest rate of 6.1%; Assumed $29.9 million of debt for our co investment joint ventures at a weighted average interest rate of 6.0%; Obtained $177.7 million of new debt (using exchange rates in effect at applicable quarter end dates) with a weighted average interest rate of 4.2% for international acquisitions; Obtained a $65.0 million floating rate unsecured revolving credit facility for one of our co investment joint ventures; Entered into a third amended and restated credit agreement for a $250.0 million unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility which replaced an existing $100.0 million unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility; Repurchased all of AMB Property II, L.P.s outstanding 7.75% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units for an aggregate cost of $10.9 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions; Repurchased all of AMB Property II, L.P.s outstanding 7.95% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units for an aggregate cost of $10.0 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions; Repurchased all of AMB Property II, L.P.s outstanding 8.125% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units for an aggregate cost of $42.8 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions; Purchased all of AMB Property II, L.P.s outstanding 5.00% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units for an aggregate cost of $36.6 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions; Completed the early renewal and increase of our senior unsecured revolving line of credit in the amount of $550.0 million, an increase of $50.0 million; Entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement for a 45.0 billion Yen (approximately $377.9 million U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at December 31, 2006) unsecured revolving credit facility that replaced an existing 35.0 billion Yen (approximately $293.9 million U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at December 31, 2006) unsecured revolving credit facility; Raised approximately $48.1 million in net proceeds from the issuance and sale of $50.0 million of our 6.85% Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock; Issued $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior unsecured notes under the operating partnerships 2006 medium term note program which mature on August 15, 2013 and bear interest at a rate of 5.90% per annum; and 43 Entered into a 228.0 million Euro (approximately $300.9 million U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at December 31, 2006) revolving credit facility agreement, which provides for loans on a secured and unsecured basis. See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 6, 9 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our capital markets transactions. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Investments in Real Estate. Investments in real estate and leasehold interests are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. We also regularly review the impact of above or below market leases, in place leases and lease origination costs for all new acquisitions, and record an intangible asset or liability accordingly. Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a property by property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable. Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying value of the property. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future economics and market conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying value of our long lived assets could occur in the future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings. As a result of leasing activity and the economic environment, we re evaluated the carrying value of our investments and recorded impairment charges of $6.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 on certain of our investments. Revenue Recognition. We record rental revenue from operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts, security deposits and letters of credit, then we may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our customers on an on going basis by reviewing their financial condition periodically as appropriate. Each period we review our outstanding accounts receivable, including straight line rents, for doubtful accounts and provide allowances as needed. We also record lease termination fees when a customer has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us. If a customer remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement, the applicable termination fees are deferred and recognized over the term of such customers occupancy. Property Dispositions. We report real estate dispositions in three separate categories on our consolidated statements of operations. First, when we divest a portion of our interests in real estate entities or properties, gains from the sale represent the interests acquired by third party investors for cash and are included in gains from disposition of real estate interests in the statement of operations. Second, we dispose of value added conversion projects and build to suit and speculative development projects for which we have not generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable, and are included in development profits, net of taxes, in the statement of operations. Lastly, 44 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, requires us to separately report as discontinued operations the historical operating results attributable to operating properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the properties, which is included in gains from dispositions of real estate, net of minority interests, in the statement of operations. The consolidated statements of operations for prior periods are also adjusted to conform with this classification. There is no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial position, net income or cash flows. In all cases, gains and losses are recognized using the full accrual method of accounting. Gains relating to transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met. Joint Ventures. We hold interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We determine consolidation based on standards set forth in EITF 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights or FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN 46. Based on the guidance set forth in EITF 04 5, we consolidate certain joint venture investments because we exercise significant control over major operating decisions, such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, asset management, investment activity and changes in financing. For joint ventures that are variable interest entities as defined under FIN 46 where we are not the primary beneficiaries, we do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. For joint ventures under EITF 04 5, where we do not exercise significant control over major operating and management decisions, but where we exercise significant influence, we use the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. Real Estate Investment Trust. As a real estate investment trust, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes in the U.S. if we meet minimum distribution, income, asset and shareholder tests. However, some of our subsidiaries may be subject to federal and state taxes. In addition, foreign entities may also be subject to the taxes of the host country. An income tax allocation is required to be estimated on our taxable income arising from our taxable real estate investment trust subsidiaries and international entities. A deferred tax component could arise based upon the differences in GAAP versus tax income for items such as depreciation and gain recognition. However, we believe deferred tax is an immaterial component of our consolidated balance sheet. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Effective October 1, 2006, we deconsolidated AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., on a prospective basis, due to the re evaluation of the accounting for our investment in the fund in light of changes to the partnership agreement regarding the general partners rights effective October 1, 2006. As a result, our results of operations presented below are not comparable between years presented. The analysis below includes changes attributable to same store growth, acquisitions, development activity and divestitures. Same store properties are those that we owned during both the current and prior year reporting periods, excluding development properties stabilized after December 31, 2004 (generally defined as properties that are 90% leased or properties for which we have held a certificate of occupancy or where building has been substantially complete for at least 12 months). As of December 31, 2006, same store industrial properties consisted of properties aggregating approximately 71.2 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2006 consisted of 73 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. During 2006, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 50 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.5 million square feet. In 2005, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 150 buildings, aggregating approximately 10.6 million square feet. Our future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition of additional properties and dispositions. Our future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical results. 45 For the Years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (dollars in millions) Revenues 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Rental revenues U.S. industrial: Same store $ 514.9 $ 501.5 $ 13.4 2.7 % 2006 acquisitions 4.4 4.4 % 2005 acquisitions 19.4 11.4 8.0 70.2 % Development 8.3 7.4 0.9 12.2 % Other industrial 74.3 63.6 10.7 16.8 % Non U.S. industrial 62.5 33.1 29.4 88.8 % Total rental revenues 683.8 617.0 66.8 10.8 % Private capital income 46.1 43.9 2.2 5.0 % Total revenues $ 729.9 $ 660.9 $ 69.0 10.4 % U.S. industrial same store revenues increased $13.4 million from the prior year despite the decrease of $12.8 million in same store revenues due to the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., effective October 1, 2006, attributable primarily to improved occupancy and increased rental rates in various markets. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2006 consisted of 73 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. Non U.S. industrial revenues increased approximately $29.4 million from the prior year due primarily to the stabilization of three properties in Japan and the continued acquisition of properties in France, Germany and Mexico. The increase in private capital income was primarily due to increased asset management and acquisition fees from additional assets held in co investment joint ventures, which were partially offset by a decrease in incentive distributions of approximately $3.9 million. During 2006, we received 46 incentive distributions of $22.5 million, of which $19.8 million was from AMB Partners II, L.P., as compared to incentive distribution of $26.4 million for the sale of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., during 2005.

The 2005 acquisitions consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. The 2006 acquisitions consisted of 73 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. Non U.S. industrial revenues increased approximately $6.0 million from the prior year due primarily to the stabilization of three properties in Japan and the continued acquisition of properties in France, Germany and Mexico. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The 2006 impairment loss was taken on several non core assets as a result of leasing activities and changes in the economic environment and the holding period of certain assets. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased stock based compensation expense as a result of higher values assigned to option and stock awards and executive departures, additional staffing and expenses for our international expansion, and the acquisition of AMB Blackpine. Other expenses decreased approximately $2.4 million from the prior year due primarily to a decrease in losses associated with our deferred compensation plan and a decrease in certain deal costs. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our co investment joint ventures. 47 Other Income and (Expenses) 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures, net $ 23.2 $ 10.8 $ 12.4 114.8 % Other income 9.4 5.6 3.8 67.9 % Gains from dispositions of real estate interests, net 19.1 (19.1 ) (100.0 )% Development profits, net of taxes 106.4 54.8 51.6 94.2 % Interest expense, including amortization (165.2 ) (147.3 ) 17.9 12.2 % Total other income and (expenses), net $ (26.2 ) $ (57.0 ) $ (30.8 ) (54.0 )% The $12.4 million increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was primarily due to gains of $17.5 million from the disposition of real estate by our unconsolidated co investment joint ventures during 2006 as opposed to $5.5 million of such gains during 2005 and, effective October 1, 2006, the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., which resulted in an increase of approximately $5.1 million. These increases were partially offset by an increase in expenses by our unconsolidated joint ventures. The increase in other income was primarily due to increased bank interest income and an increase in property management income due to the expansion of our property management business. The 2005 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted primarily from our contribution of $106.9 million (using the exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties to our then newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. Development profits represent gains from the sale of development projects and land as part of our development for sale program. The increase in development profits was due to increased disposition and contribution volume during 2006. During 2006, we sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $13.3 million. In addition, during 2006, we received approximately $0.4 million in connection with the condemnation of a parcel of land resulting in a loss of $1.0 million, $0.8 million of which was the joint venture partners share. During 2006, we also contributed a total of ten completed development projects into unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. Four projects totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Japan Fund I, L.P, two projects totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet were contributed into AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, three projects totaling approximately 0.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and one land parcel into AMB DFS Fund I, LLC. As a result of these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after tax gain of $94.1 million, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party investors for cash. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $1.9 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. The increase in interest expense, including amortization, was due primarily to increased borrowings on unsecured credit facilities and other debt.

During 2005, we divested ourselves of 142 industrial buildings and one retail center, aggregating approximately 9.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $926.6 million, with a resulting net gain of $113.6 million. Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., for $618.5 million. The multi investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. We 48 received cash and a distribution of an on tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund.

In August 2006, we issued 2,000,000 shares of 6.85% Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. The increase in preferred stock dividends is due to the newly issued shares. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2006, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, repurchased all 840,000 of its outstanding 8.125% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units, all 220,440 of its outstanding 7.75% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units, all 201,139 of its outstanding 7.95% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units and all 729,582 of its outstanding 5.00% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units. As a result, we recognized a decrease in income available to common stockholders of $1.1 million for the original issuance costs, net of discount on repurchase.

The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2004 and 2005, we continued to acquire properties in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial revenues. The increase in private capital income was primarily due to increased asset management fees from additional assets held in co investment joint ventures and incentive distributions for 2005 of $26.4 million for the sale of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, asset 49 management priority distributions from AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., and acquisition fees from AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P.

In 2004 and 2005, we continued to acquire properties in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial property operating costs. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate during the year. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international and development expansions and the expansion of satellite offices. Other expenses increased approximately $2.4 million from the prior year due primarily to greater losses on our non qualified deferred compensation plan in 2005 and an increase in certain deal costs.

The increase in other income was primarily due to increased bank interest income. The 2005 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted primarily from our contribution of $106.9 million (using exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties to our newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. The 2004 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted from our contribution of $71.5 million in operating properties to our unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC. Development profits represent gains from the sale of development projects and land as part of our development for sale program. The increase in development profits was due to increased volume in 2005. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $1.9 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. During 2004, we sold seven land parcels and six development projects as part of our development for sale program, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet for an aggregate price of $40.4 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $6.5 million. During 2004, we also contributed one completed development project into a newly formed unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $2.0 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash.

The increase in preferred stock dividends is due to the newly issued shares. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Balance Sheet Strategy. In general, we use unsecured lines of credit, unsecured notes, preferred stock and common equity (issued by us and or the operating partnership and its subsidiaries) to capitalize our 100% owned assets. Over time, we plan to retire non recourse, secured debt encumbering our 100% owned assets and replace that debt with unsecured notes. In managing our co investment joint ventures, in general, we use non recourse, secured debt to capitalize our co investment joint ventures. We currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for acquisitions, development, expansion and renovation of properties will include: retained earnings and cash flow from operations; 51 private capital from co investment partners; net proceeds from contribution of properties and completed development projects to our co investment joint ventures; borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities; other forms of secured or unsecured financing; proceeds from equity (common and preferred) or debt securities offerings; proceeds from limited partnership unit offerings (including issuances of limited partnership units by our subsidiaries); and net proceeds from divestitures of properties. We currently expect that our principal funding requirements will include: working capital; development, expansion and renovation of properties; acquisitions, including our global expansion; debt service; and dividends and distributions on outstanding common and preferred stock and limited partnership units. Cash flows. As of December 31, 2006, cash provided by operating activities was $335.9 million as compared to $295.8 million for the same period in 2005. This change is primarily due to increases in rental rates, partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses primarily due to additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international and development expansions and increased occupancy costs related to the expansion of regional offices. Cash used for investing activities was $880.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to cash used for investing activities of $60.4 million for the same period in 2005. This change is primarily due to an increase in funds used for property acquisitions and capital expenditures, and a decrease in proceeds from property divestitures (mainly due to the divesture of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., portfolio in 2005), offset by less funds used for additions to interests in unconsolidated joint ventures and an increase in capital distributions received from unconsolidated joint ventures. Cash provided by financing activities was $483.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to cash used in financing activities of $101.9 million for the same period in 2005. This change is due primarily to an increase in borrowings, net of repayments, issuance of common stock upon the exercise of options and issuances of preferred stock, offset by the cost of the repurchase of preferred units for the year ended December 31, 2006. We believe that our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow from operations, borrowings available under our unsecured credit facilities and our ability to access private and public debt and equity capital, are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Resources Property Divestitures. During 2006, we divested ourselves of 39 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 3.5 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $175.3 million, with a resulting net gain of $42.6 million. Development Sales. During 2006, we sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $13.3 million. In addition, during 2006, we received approximately $0.4 million in connection with the condemnation of a parcel of land resulting in a loss of $1.0 million, $0.8 million of which was the joint venture partners share. 52 Development Contributions. During 2006, we contributed a total of nine completed development projects and one land parcel into unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. Four projects totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Japan Fund I, L.P, two projects totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet were contributed into AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and three projects totaling approximately 0.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. In addition, one land parcel was contributed into AMB DFS Fund I, LLC. As a result of these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after tax gain of $94.1 million, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party investors for cash. These gains are included in development profits, net of taxes, in the statement of operations. Properties Held for Contribution. As of December 31, 2006, we held for contribution to co investment joint ventures, nine industrial projects with an aggregate net book value of $154.0 million, which, when contributed to a joint venture, will reduce our current ownership interest from approximately 100% to an expected range of 15 50%. Properties Held for Divestiture. As of December 31, 2006, we held for divestiture four industrial projects, which are not in our core markets, do not meet our current strategic objectives or which we have included as part of our development for sale program. The divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. As of December 31, 2006, the net carrying value of the properties held for divestiture was $20.9 million. Expected net sales proceeds exceed the net carrying value of the properties. Co investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund certain acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. We generally consolidate these joint ventures for financial reporting purposes because they are not variable interest entities and because we are the sole managing general partner and control all major operating decisions. However, in certain cases, our co investment joint ventures are unconsolidated because we do not control all major operating decisions and the general partners do not have significant rights under EITF 04 5. Third party equity interests in the joint ventures are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2006, we owned approximately 64.3 million square feet of our properties (51.6% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so.

(6) The planned gross capitalization and investment capacity of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. as an open end fund, is not limited. The planned gross capitalization represents the gross book value of real estate assets as of the most recent quarter end. (7) AMB DFS Fund I, LLC is a co investment partnership formed in 2006 with a subsidiary of GE Real Estate to build and sell properties. We also have a 0.1% unconsolidated equity interest (with an approximate 33% economic interest) in AMB Pier One, LLC, a joint venture related to the 2000 redevelopment of the pier which houses our office space in the San Francisco Bay Area. The investment is not consolidated because we do not exercise control over major operating decisions such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, investment activity and changes in financing. We have an option to purchase the remaining equity interest beginning January 1, 2007 and expiring December 31, 2009, based on the fair market value as stipulated in the joint venture agreement. As of December 31, 2006, we also had an approximate 39.0% unconsolidated equity interest in G.Accion, a Mexican real estate company. G.Accion provides management and development services for industrial, retail, residential and office properties in Mexico. In addition, as of December 31, 2006, one of our subsidiaries also had an approximate 5% interest in IAT Air Cargo Facilities Income Fund (IAT), a Canadian income trust specializing in aviation related real estate at Canadas leading international airports. This equity investment is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Common and Preferred Equity. We have authorized for issuance 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which the following series were designated as of December 31, 2006: 1,595,337 shares of series D preferred; 510,000 shares of series I cumulative redeemable preferred; 800,000 shares of series J cumulative redeemable preferred; 800,000 shares of series K cumulative redeemable preferred; 2,300,000 shares of series L cumulative redeemable preferred, of which 2,000,000 are outstanding; 2,300,000 shares of series M cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which are outstanding; 3,000,000 shares of series O cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which are outstanding; and 2,000,000 shares of series P cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which are outstanding.

The series N preferred units were issued to Robert Pattillo Properties, Inc. in exchange for the contribution to AMB Property II, L.P of certain parcels of land that are located in multiple markets.

We, in turn, used those proceeds to redeem all 3,995,800 of our 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for $100.2 million, including all accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, to the redemption date. In December 2005, our board of directors approved a new two year common stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of our common stock. We did not repurchase or retire any shares of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2006. Debt. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, we presently intend to operate with an our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio of approximately 45% or less. As of December 31, 2006, our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio was 34.2%. (See footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratios table below for our definitions of our share of total market capitalization, market equity and our share of total debt.) However, we typically finance our co investment joint ventures with secured debt at a loan to value ratio of 50 65% per our joint venture agreements. Additionally, we currently intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these policies, however, our organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our management could alter or eliminate these policies without stockholder approval or circumstances could arise that could render us unable to comply with these policies. As of December 31, 2006, the aggregate principal amount of our secured debt was $1.4 billion, excluding unamortized debt premiums of $6.3 million. Of the $1.4 billion of secured debt, $1.0 billion is secured by properties in our joint ventures. The secured debt is generally non recourse and bears interest at rates varying from 2.9% to 10.4% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 6.2%) and final maturity dates ranging from February 2007 to January 2025. As of December 31, 2006, $1.0 billion of the secured debt obligations bear interest at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 6.1%, while the remaining $386.1 million bear interest at variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 4.7%). As of December 31, 2006, the operating partnership had outstanding an aggregate of $1.1 billion in unsecured senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 6.2% and had a weighted average term of 4.8 years. These unsecured senior debt securities include $300.0 million in notes issued in June 1998, $225.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2000 medium term note program, $275.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2002 medium term note program, $175.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2006 medium term note program and approximately $112.5 million of 5.094% Notes Due 2015, which were issued to Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America on July 11, 2005 in a private placement, in exchange for the cancellation of $100.0 million of notes that were issued in June 1998 resulting in a discount of approximately $12.5 million. The unsecured senior debt securities are subject to various covenants. Also included is a $25.0 million promissory note which matures in January 2007. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to its senior debt securities. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then our cash flow may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Credit Facilities. On June 1, 2006, the operating partnership entered into a third amended and restated $550.0 million unsecured revolving credit agreement that replaced its then existing $500.0 million credit facility, which was to mature on June 1, 2007. We are a guarantor of the operating partnerships obligations under the credit facility. The line, which matures on June 1, 2010, carries a one year extension option and can be increased to up to 56 $700.0 million upon certain conditions. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the operating partnerships long term debt rating, which was 42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2006, with an annual facility fee of 15 basis points. The four year credit facility includes a multi currency component, under which up to $550.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Euros, Yen or British Pounds Sterling. The operating partnership uses its unsecured credit facility principally for acquisitions, funding development activity and general working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on the credit facility was $303.7 million and the remaining amount available was $234.6 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $11.7 million. The outstanding balance included borrowings denominated in Euros, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately $303.7 million U.S. dollars. On June 23, 2006, AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating partnership and as the initial borrower, entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement for a 45.0 billion Yen unsecured revolving credit facility, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately $377.9 million U.S. dollars. This replaced the 35.0 billion Yen unsecured revolving credit facility executed on June 29, 2004, as previously amended, which using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately $293.9 million U.S. dollars. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K. under the credit facility, as well as the obligations of any other entity in which the operating partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the credit agreement. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and for other real estate purposes in Japan, China and South Korea. Generally, borrowers under the credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the credit facility with certain real estate assets or equity in entities holding such real estate assets. The credit facility matures in June 2010 and has a one year extension option. The credit facility can be increased to up to 55.0 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately $461.9 million U.S. dollars. The extension option is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding commitments under the facility at that time. The rate on the borrowings is generally TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt and was 42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2006. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, payable in quarterly amounts, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt, and was 15 basis points of the outstanding commitments under the facility as of December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, was $320.9 million in U.S. dollars. On June 13, 2006, the operating partnership and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries entered into a fourth amended and restated credit agreement for a $250.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which replaced the third amended and restated credit agreement for a $250.0 million unsecured credit facility. On February 16, 2006, the third amended and restated credit agreement replaced the then existing $100.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that was to mature in June 2008. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations for such subsidiaries and other entities controlled by us or the operating partnership that are selected by the operating partnership from time to time to be borrowers under and pursuant to the credit facility. The four year credit facility includes a multi currency component under which up to $250.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Singapore dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros. The line, which matures in February 2010 and carries a one year extension option, can be increased to up to $350.0 million upon certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding commitments. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships senior unsecured long term debt, which was 60 basis points as of December 31, 2006, with an annual facility fee based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships senior unsecured long term debt. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and general working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on this facility was approximately $227.4 million. The credit agreement contains affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios by the operating partnership, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. 57 Mortgages Receivable. Through a wholly owned subsidiary, we hold a mortgage loan receivable on AMB Pier One, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture. The note bears interest at 13.0% and matures in May 2026. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on the note was $12.7 million. We also hold a loan receivable on G. Accion, an unconsolidated joint venture totaling $6.1 million with an interest rate of 10.0%. The loan matures in March 2010.

(4) Our share of total debt is the pro rata portion of the total debt based on our percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated or unconsolidated joint ventures holding the debt. We believe that our share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze our leverage and to compare our leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of our debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their joint ventures. Our share of total debt is not intended to reflect our actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures.

As of December 31, 2006, we had $21.1 million in restricted cash. Our board of directors declared a regular cash dividend for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 of $0.46 per share of common stock, and the operating partnership announced its intention to pay a regular cash distribution for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 of $0.46 per common unit. The dividends and distributions were payable on January 5, 2007 to stockholders and unitholders of record on December 22, 2006. The series L, M, O and P preferred stock dividends were payable on January 16, 2007 to stockholders of record on January 5, 2007. The series J and K preferred unit quarterly distributions were payable on January 16, 2007. The series D and I preferred unit quarterly distributions were paid on December 25, 2006. The following table sets forth the dividends and distributions paid or payable per share or unit for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004: Paying Entity Security 2006 2005 2004 AMB Property Corporation Common stock $ 1.84 $ 1.76 $ 1.70 AMB Property Corporation Series L preferred stock $ 1.63 $ 1.63 $ 1.63 AMB Property Corporation Series M preferred stock $ 1.69 $ 1.69 $ 1.69 AMB Property Corporation Series O preferred stock $ 1.75 $ 0.09 n/a AMB Property Corporation Series P preferred stock $ 0.60 n/a n/a Operating Partnership Common limited partnership units $ 1.84 $ 1.76 $ 1.70 Operating Partnership Series J preferred units $ 3.98 $ 3.98 $ 3.98 Operating Partnership Series K preferred units $ 3.98 $ 3.98 $ 3.98 AMB Property II, L.P.

(2) In September 2006, AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased all of its outstanding series F preferred units. (3) In March 2006, AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased all of its outstanding series H preferred units. (4) The holder of the series N preferred units exercised its put option in January 2006 and sold all of its series N preferred units to the operating partnership and AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased all of such units from the operating partnership. The anticipated size of our distributions, using only cash from operations, will not allow us to retire all of our debt as it comes due. Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Commitments Development Starts. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we initiated 30 new industrial development projects in North America, Europe and Asia with a total expected investment of $914.3 million, aggregating approximately 10.4 million square feet. During 2005, we initiated 30 new industrial development projects in North America, Europe and Asia with a total expected investment of $522.4 million, aggregating approximately 7.0 million square feet. 60 Development Pipeline. As of December 31, 2006, we had 45 industrial projects in our development pipeline, which will total approximately 13.7 million square feet, and will have an aggregate estimated investment of $1.3 billion upon completion. We have an additional ten development projects available for sale or contribution totaling approximately 3.0 million square feet, with an aggregate estimated investment of $199.2 million. One of these ten projects totaling $13.0 million and approximately 0.2 million square feet is held in an unconsolidated joint venture. As of December 31, 2006, we and our joint venture partners had funded an aggregate of $814.5 million and needed to fund an estimated additional $481.0 million in order to complete our development pipeline which includes projects expected to be completed through the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we acquired 835 acres of land for industrial warehouse development in North America and Asia for approximately $293.2 million. Acquisitions. During 2006, we acquired 106 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 9.8 million square feet for a total expected investment of $834.2 million (includes acquisition costs of $814.1 million and estimated acquisition capital of $20.1 million), of which we acquired 70 buildings through one of our unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. We generally fund our acquisitions through private capital contributions, borrowings under our credit facilities, cash, debt issuances and net proceeds from property divestitures. Lease Commitments. We have entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily on tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms from one to 55 years. These buildings and improvements are amortized ratably over the lesser of the terms of the related leases or 40 years. Future minimum rental payments required under non cancelable operating leases in effect as of December 31, 2006 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2007 $ 21,636 2008 22,186 2009 21,506 2010 20,667 2011 20,668 Thereafter 272,483 Total $ 379,146 Co investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. As of December 31, 2006, we had investments in co investment joint ventures with a gross book value of $1.9 billion, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, and net equity investments in four unconsolidated co investment joint ventures of $236.0 million and a gross book value of $2.5 billion. As of December 31, 2006, we may make additional capital contributions to current and planned co investment joint ventures of up to $168.2 million (using the exchange rates at December 31, 2006) pursuant to the terms of the joint venture agreements. From time to time, we may raise additional equity commitments for AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open ended unconsolidated co investment joint venture formed in 2004 with institutional investors, which invests through a private real estate investment trust. This would increase our obligation to make additional capital commitments. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of this fund, we are obligated to contribute 20% of the total equity commitments to the fund until such time our total equity commitment is greater than $150.0 million, at which time, our obligation is reduced to 10% of the total equity commitments. We expect to fund these contributions with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances or net proceeds from property divestitures, which could adversely effect our cash flow. Captive Insurance Company. In December 2001, we formed a wholly owned captive insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., (Arcata), which provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the deductible under our third party policies. The captive insurance company is one element of our overall risk management program. We capitalized Arcata in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata established annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss experience of our properties. Annually, 61 we engage an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims, related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata may be adjusted based on this estimate. Like premiums paid to third party insurance companies, premiums paid to Arcata may be reimbursed by customers pursuant to specific lease terms. Through this structure, we believe that we have more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market. Potential Contingent and Unknown Liabilities. Contingent and unknown liabilities may include the following: liabilities for environmental conditions; claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to our formation or acquisition transactions that had not been asserted prior to our formation or acquisition transactions; accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; tax liabilities; and claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these entities. Overview of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our debt, interest and lease payments due by period as of December 31, 2006 (dollars in thousands): Less than More than Contractual Obligations 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Total Debt $ 213,869 $ 592,085 $ 1,593,035 $ 1,042,699 $ 3,441,688 Debt interest payments 13,861 38,126 74,416 58,775 185,178 Operating lease commitments 21,636 43,692 41,335 272,483 379,146 Construction commitments 31,713 57,042 88,755 Total $ 281,079 $ 730,945 $ 1,708,786 $ 1,373,957 $ 4,094,767 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Standby Letters of Credit. As of December 31, 2006, we had provided approximately $22.1 million in letters of credit, of which $11.7 million was provided under the operating partnerships $550.0 million unsecured credit facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other commitments. Guarantees. Other than parent guarantees associated with the unsecured debt, as of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding guarantees in the aggregate amount of $48.2 million in connection with certain acquisitions. As of December 31, 2006, we guaranteed $26.8 million and $83.2 million on outstanding loans on two of our consolidated joint ventures and two of our unconsolidated joint ventures, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2006, we guaranteed $87.3 million on outstanding property debt related to one of our unconsolidated joint ventures. Performance and Surety Bonds. As of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $11.4 million. These bonds were issued in connection with certain of our development projects and were posted to guarantee certain tax obligations and the construction of certain real property improvements and infrastructure, such as grading, sewers and streets. Performance and surety bonds are commonly required by public agencies from real estate developers. Performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the taxes due or the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. Promoted Interests and Other Contractual Obligations. Upon the achievement of certain return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, we may be obligated to make payments to certain of our joint venture partners 62 pursuant to the terms and provisions of their contractual agreements with us. From time to time in the normal course of our business, we enter into various contracts with third parties that may obligate us to make payments, pay promotes, or perform other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. SUPPLEMENTAL EARNINGS MEASURES FFO. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider funds from operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. FFO is defined as net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, less gains (or losses) from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estate related depreciation, and adjustments to derive our pro rata share of FFO of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. Further, we do not adjust FFO to eliminate the effects of non recurring charges. We believe that FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. We believe that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. The following table reflects the calculation of FFO reconciled from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Net income(1) $ 224,072 $ 257,807 $ 125,471 $ 129,128 $ 121,119 Gains from dispositions of real estate, net of minority interests(2) (42,635 ) (132,652 ) (47,224 ) (50,325 ) (19,383 ) Real estate, related depreciation and amortization: Total depreciation and amortization 177,824 161,732 136,610 111,879 103,550 Discontinued operations depreciation 2,153 18,572 30,740 30,458 32,953 Non real estate depreciation (4,546 ) (3,388 ) (871 ) (720 ) (712 ) Ground lease amortization (2,301 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from consolidated joint ventures: Joint venture partners minority interests (Net income) 37,975 36,401 29,360 22,276 16,529 63 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Net income) 2,805 3,411 2,384 2,117 3,303 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Development profits) 4,948 2,262 435 344 57 Discontinued operations minority interests (Net income) 31 8,769 13,964 15,214 16,597 FFO attributable to minority interests (82,861 ) (100,275 ) (80,192 ) (65,603 ) (52,051 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures: Our share of net income (23,240 ) (10,770 ) (3,781 ) (5,445 ) (5,674 ) Our share of FFO 16,038 14,441 7,549 9,755 9,291 Our share of development profits, net of taxes 5,441 Preferred stock dividends (13,582 ) (7,388 ) (7,131 ) (6,999 ) (8,496 ) Preferred stock and unit redemption discount (issuance costs) (1,070 ) (5,413 ) 412 Funds from operations $ 297,912 $ 254,363 $ 207,314 $ 186,666 $ 215,194 Basic FFO per common share and unit $ 3.24 $ 2.87 $ 2.39 $ 2.17 $ 2.44 Diluted FFO per common share and unit $ 3.12 $ 2.75 $ 2.30 $ 2.13 $ 2.40 Weighted average common shares and units: Basic 92,047,678 88,684,262 86,885,250 85,859,899 88,204,208 Diluted 95,444,072 92,508,725 90,120,250 87,616,365 89,689,310 (1) Includes gains from undepreciated land sales of $5.6 million, $25.0 million, $3.7 million and $1.2 million for 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. (2) The information for 2005 includes accumulated depreciation re capture of approximately $1.1 million associated with the sale of the Interstate Crossdock redevelopment project. SS NOI. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider same store net operating income, or SS NOI, to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. For properties that are considered part of the same store pool, see Part I, Item 2: Properties Industrial Properties Owned and Managed Market Operating Statistics, Note 6, and Owned and Managed Operating and Leasing Statistics Owned and Managed Same Store Operating Statistics, Note 2. In deriving SS NOI, we define NOI as rental revenues (as calculated in accordance with GAAP), including reimbursements, less straight line rents, property operating expenses and real estate taxes. We exclude straight line rents in calculating SS NOI because we believe it provides a better measure of actual cash basis rental growth for a year over year comparison. In addition, we believe that SS NOI helps the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate as compared to other companies. While SS NOI is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. SS NOI also does not reflect general and administrative expense, interest expenses, depreciation and amortization costs, capital expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development and construction activities that could materially impact our results from operations. Further, our computation of SS NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating SS NOI. 64 The following table reconciles SS NOI from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Net income $ 224,072 $ 257,807 $ 125,471 Private capital income (46,102 ) (43,942 ) (12,895 ) Depreciation and amortization 177,824 161,732 136,610 Impairment losses 6,312 General and administrative 104,262 71,564 57,181 Other expenses 2,620 5,038 2,554 Fund costs 2,091 1,482 1,741 Total other income and expenses 26,178 57,044 119,727 Total minority interests share of income 62,855 74,777 52,863 Total discontinued operations (51,949 ) (127,498 ) (63,888 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (193 ) Net Operating Income (NOI) 507,970 458,004 419,364 Less non same store NOI (116,030 ) (70,782 ) (19,990 ) Less non cash adjustments(1) (8,426 ) (9,861 ) (8,249 ) Cash basis same store NOI $ 383,514 $ 377,361 $ 391,125 (1) Non cash adjustments include straight line rents and amortization of lease intangibles for the same store pool only. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices, interest rates and international exchange rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimize the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings and our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2006, we had three outstanding interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $38.1 million (in U.S. dollars). See Financial Instruments below. The table below summarizes the market risks associated with our fixed and variable rate debt outstanding before net unamortized debt discounts of $4.3 million as of December 31, 2006 (dollars in thousands): 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Fixed rate debt(1) $ 155,384 $ 368,141 $ 152,151 $ 430,676 $ 288,835 $ 768,320 $ 2,163,507 Average interest rate 6.7 % 7.1 % 4.7 % 6.4 % 6.8 % 5.9 % 6.3 % Variable rate debt(2) $ 58,485 $ 22,604 $ 49,189 $ 854,543 $ 18,981 $ 274,379 $ 1,278,181 Average interest rate 5.9 % 6.6 % 6.8 % 3.1 % 3.8 % 4.9 % 3.8 % Interest Payments $ 13,861 $ 27,630 $ 10,496 $ 54,054 $ 20,362 $ 58,775 $ 185,178 (1) Represents 62.9% of all outstanding debt. (2) Represents 37.1% of all outstanding debt. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased or decreased by 10%, then the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would be $4.9 million (net of swaps) annually. As of December 31, 65 2006, the book value and the estimated fair value of our total consolidated debt (both secured and unsecured) was $3.4 and $3.5 billion, respectively, based on our estimate of current market interest rates. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, variable rate debt comprised 37.1% and 24.5%, respectively, of all our outstanding debt. Variable rate debt was $1.3 billion and $831.7 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. The increase is primarily due to higher outstanding balances on our credit facilities. This increase in our outstanding variable rate debt increases our risk associated with unfavorable interest rate fluctuations. Financial Instruments. We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income or income. For revenues or expenses denominated in non functional currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments in effect at December 31, 2006 were three interest rate swaps hedging cash flows of our variable rate borrowings based on U.S. Libor (USD) and Euribor (Europe). The following table summarizes our financial instruments as of December 31, 2006 (in thousands): Maturity Dates Related Derivatives (in thousands) December 8, 2008 June 8, 2010 November 1, 2014 Notional Amount Fair Value Interest Rate Swaps: Plain Interest Rate Swap, Europe Notional Amount (U.S. dollars) $ 9,655 $ 9,655 Receive Floating(%) 3MEURIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 3.72 % Fair Market Value $ 54 Plain Interest Rate Swap, USD Notional Amount (U.S. dollars) $ 25,000 25,000 Receive Floating(%) 3MLIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 5.17 % Fair Market Value (130 ) Plain Interest Rate Swap, Europe Notional Amount (U.S. dollars) $ 3,471 3,471 Receive Floating(%) 3MEURIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 4.26 % Fair Market Value (45 ) Total $ 38,126 $ (121 ) International Operations. Our exposure to market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries operating in the United States and Mexico. The functional currency for our subsidiaries operating outside the United States is generally the local currency of the country in which the entity is located, mitigating the effect of foreign exchange gains and losses. Our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. We translate income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. The losses resulting from the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity and totaled $0.2 million for year ended December 31, 2006. Our international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. In these instances, non monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2006, losses from remeasurement and the sale of four foreign exchange agreements included in our results of operations totaled $0.8 million. We also record gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated. 66

Secured Debt As of December 31, 2006, we had $1.4 billion of secured indebtedness, net of unamortized premiums, secured by deeds of trust or mortgages. As of December 31, 2006, the total gross consolidated investment value of those properties securing the debt was $2.6 billion. Of the $1.4 billion of secured indebtedness, $1.0 billion was consolidated joint venture debt secured by properties with a gross investment value of $1.9 billion. For additional details, see Part II, Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources and Part IV, Item 15: Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. We believe that as of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the properties securing the respective obligations in each case exceeded the principal amount of the outstanding obligations. Item 3. Legal Proceedings As of December 31, 2006, there were no pending legal proceedings to which we were a party or of which any of our properties was the subject, the adverse determination of which we anticipate would have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

(3) See Part II, Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Supplemental Earnings Measures FFO, for a discussion of why we believe FFO is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance, of ways in which investors might use FFO when assessing our financial performance, and of FFOs limitations as a measurement tool. (4) Our share of total debt is the pro rata portion of the total debt based on our percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated ventures holding the debt. We believe that our share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze our leverage and to compare our leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of our debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their joint ventures. Our share of total debt is not intended to reflect our actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures. For a reconciliation of our share of total debt to total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure, please see the table of debt maturities and capitalization in Part II, Item 7: Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources. (5) Effective October 1, 2006, we deconsolidated AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. on a prospective basis, due to the re evaluation of the accounting for our investment in the fund in light of changes to the partnership agreement regarding the general partners rights effective October 1, 2006. As a result, the financial measures for the years 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002, included in our operating data, other data and balance sheet data above are not comparable. 39 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations GENERAL You should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements. We commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company effective with the completion of our initial public offering on November 26, 1997, and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, with our initial tax return for the year ended December 31, 1997. AMB Property Corporation and AMB Property, L.P. were formed shortly before the consummation of our initial public offering. Managements Overview The primary source of our revenue and earnings is rent received from customers under long term (generally three to ten years) operating leases at our properties, including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs, and from partnership distributions and fees from our private capital business. We also produce earnings from the disposition of operating assets that no longer fit our strategy, from the disposition of projects in our development for sale program and from the contributions of properties to our co investment joint ventures. Our long term growth is driven by our ability to maintain and increase occupancy rates or increase rental rates at our properties, and by our ability to continue to acquire and develop new properties. National industrial markets continued to improve during 2006 when compared with market conditions in 2005. According to Torto Wheaton Research, availability dropped 10 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2006 to 9.4%, and availability for the year dropped 50 basis points. We believe the strongest industrial markets in the U.S. are the coastal gateway markets tied to global trade, including Los Angeles, our largest market, Miami, the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle, and to a lesser degree Northern New Jersey/New York (with the exception of the Exit 8A submarket). While we believe that the broader Chicago market is showing signs of stabilization, certain submarkets, like the OHare submarket, are relatively strong. We believe Dallas continues to recover, and Atlanta continues to suffer from a large increase in supply. We believe the operating environment in our U.S. on tarmac business remains good with improving cargo volumes and essentially no new supply. Investor demand for industrial property (as supported by our observation of strong national sales volumes and declining acquisition capitalization rates) has remained consistently strong over the past several years. We believe we capitalized on this demand for industrial property by accelerating the repositioning of our portfolio, through the disposition of non core properties, which was effectively completed in 2006 with our exit from the Charlotte and Memphis markets. We plan to continue selling selected assets on an opportunistic basis or that no longer fit our strategic investment objectives, but we believe we have substantially achieved our repositioning goals. Occupancy levels in our portfolio continue to outperform the national industrial market, as determined by Torto Wheaton Research, by pricing lease renewals and new leases with sensitivity to local market conditions. During the prior periods of decreasing or stabilizing rental rates, we strove to sign leases with shorter terms to prevent locking in lower rent levels for long periods and to be prepared to sign new, longer term leases during periods of growing rental rates. When we sign leases of shorter duration, we attempt to limit overall leasing costs and capital expenditures by offering different grades of tenant improvement packages, appropriate to the lease term. In our stronger markets, we are increasing rents as opposed to occupancy. 40 The table below summarizes key operating and leasing statistics for our owned and managed operating properties for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: U.S. Hub and Total Other Total/Weighted Owned and Managed Property Data(1) Gateway Markets(2) Markets(3) Average For the year ended December 31, 2006: % of total rentable square feet 72.0 % 28.0 % 100.0 % Occupancy percentage at year end 96.5 % 95.0 % 96.1 % Same space square footage leased 13,016,726 3,186,854 16,203,580 Rent (decreases) increases on renewals and rollovers(4) (0.4 )% 1.6 % (0.1 )% For the year ended December 31, 2005:(5) % of total rentable square feet 74.9 % 25.1 % 100.0 % Occupancy percentage at year end 96.2 % 94.6 % 95.8 % Same space square footage leased 11,032,482 2,574,944 13,607,426 Rent decreases on renewals and rollovers (10.8 )% (4.3 )% (9.7 )% (1) Schedule includes owned and managed operating properties which we define as properties in which we have at least a 10% ownership interest, for which we are the property or asset manager, and which we intend to hold for the long term. (2) Our U.S. hub and gateway markets include on tarmac and Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, Northern New Jersey/New York City, San Francisco Bay Area, and Seattle. (3) Our total markets include other U.S. target markets, other non target markets, and non U.S. target markets. (4) On a consolidated basis, rent increases on renewals and rollovers were 4.4% and 3.0%, respectively, for U.S. hub and gateway markets and total other markets. (5) The information for 2005 is presented on a consolidated basis while the information for 2006 is presented on an owned and managed basis. Management believes that the difference in comparability between the information for 2006 and 2005 is not significant. At December 31, 2006, our operating portfolios occupancy rate was 96.1%, on an owned and managed basis (97.0% on a consolidated basis), an increase from both the prior quarter and December 31, 2005. Rental rates on lease renewals and rollovers in our portfolio increased 4.1% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and decreased 0.1% for the full year. Cash basis same store net operating income (rental revenues less property operating expenses and real estate taxes for properties included in the same store pool, which is set annually and excludes properties purchased or developments stabilized after December 31, 2004) grew by 1.3% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and 2.6% for the full year 2006, on an owned and managed basis. Excluding lease termination fees, same store net operating income grew 3.0% and 3.2% in the quarter and for the full year (decreased 0.5% and increased 1.6%, respectively, on a consolidated basis), respectively, on an owned and managed basis. See Part II, Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Supplemental Earnings Measures for a discussion of same store net operating income and a reconciliation of same store net operating income and net income. We currently expect that same store growth in our operating portfolio, excluding lease termination fees, will be about 3% to 4% for 2007, on an owned and managed basis. Market rents continue to rebound from their lows and in many of our hub and gateway markets are back to or above their prior peak levels of 2001. We believe that industrial market rents in the San Francisco Bay Area are improving. While market rents in the San Francisco Bay Area were up 10% to 15% in 2006, rents still have not yet fully recovered to normal levels. Rents on lease renewals and rollovers in the San Francisco Bay Area declined 21.0% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and 13.2% for the full year 2006, on an owned and managed basis. Without the effect of the San Francisco Bay Area, rents on renewals and rollovers for the full year 2006 would have been 2.0%, on an owned and managed basis, which we believe reflects the generally positive trends in U.S. industrial space availability. We expect development to be a significant driver of our earnings growth as we expand our land and development pipeline, and contribute completed development projects into our co investment program and recognize development profits. We believe that development, renovation and expansion of well located, high 41 quality industrial properties should generally continue to provide us with attractive investment opportunities at a higher rate of return than we may obtain from the purchase of existing properties. We believe that our development opportunities in Mexico, Japan and China are particularly attractive given the current lack of supply of modern industrial distribution facilities in the major metropolitan markets of these countries. Prior to our global expansion, our development pipeline was $106.8 million at the end of 2002. As a result of our global expansion and increased development capabilities, we have increased our development pipeline to approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2006. In addition to our committed development pipeline, we hold a total of 1,735 acres for future development or sale, of which 92% is in North America. We believe these 1,735 acres of land could support approximately 30.5 million square feet of future development. Going forward, we believe that our co investment program with private capital investors will continue to serve as a significant source of revenues and capital for new investments. Through these co investment joint ventures, we typically earn acquisition fees, asset management fees and priority distributions, as well as promoted interests and incentive distributions based on the performance of the co investment joint ventures; however, we cannot assure you that we will continue to do so. Through contribution of development properties to our co investment joint ventures, we expect to recognize value creation from our development pipeline. As of December 31, 2006, we owned approximately 64.3 million square feet of our properties (51.6% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these co investment joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. By the end of 2010, we expect to have approximately 50% of our owned and managed operating portfolio invested in non U.S. markets (based on owned and managed annualized base rent). As of December 31, 2006, our non U.S. operating properties comprised 14.1% of our owned and managed operating portfolio (based on annualized base rent) and 7.4% of our consolidated operating portfolio (based on annualized base rent). Our North American target countries outside of the United States currently comprise Canada and Mexico. Our European target countries currently comprise Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. Our Asian target countries currently comprise China, India, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. We expect to add additional target countries outside the United States in the future. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust, we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income. As a result, we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our on going operations to the same extent that other corporations that are not real estate investment trusts can. We must continue to raise capital in both the debt and equity markets to fund our working capital needs, acquisitions and developments. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for a complete discussion of the sources of our capital. Summary of Key Transactions in 2006 During the year ended December 31, 2006, we completed the following significant capital deployment and other transactions: Acquired, on an owned and managed basis, 106 buildings in North America and Europe, aggregating approximately 9.8 million square feet, for $834.2 million; Committed to 30 development projects in North America, Asia and Europe totaling 10.4 million square feet with an estimated total investment of approximately $914.3 million; Acquired 835 acres of land for development in North America and Asia for approximately $293.2 million; Sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million; Contributed four completed development projects for $486.2 million to AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., two completed development projects for $56.4 million to AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, three completed development projects for $64.8 million to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. and one land parcel for $77.5 million to AMB DFS Fund I, LLC, all of which entities are unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. As a result of these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after tax gain of $94.1 million, 42 representing the portion of our interest in the contributed properties acquired by the third party co investors for cash; Divested ourselves of 73 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 6.4 million square feet, for an aggregate price of approximately $335.1 million, including 34 industrial buildings that were sold by two of our unconsolidated joint ventures; and Acquired the 50% interest in AMB BlackPine that we did not previously own; Received an incentive distribution of $19.8 million from AMB Partners II, L.P.; and Deconsolidated AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., on a prospective basis, as of October 1, 2006. See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our acquisition, development and disposition activity. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we completed the following significant capital markets and other financing transactions: Obtained long term secured debt financings for our co investment joint ventures of $141.6 million with a weighted average interest rate of 6.1%; Assumed $29.9 million of debt for our co investment joint ventures at a weighted average interest rate of 6.0%; Obtained $177.7 million of new debt (using exchange rates in effect at applicable quarter end dates) with a weighted average interest rate of 4.2% for international acquisitions; Obtained a $65.0 million floating rate unsecured revolving credit facility for one of our co investment joint ventures; Entered into a third amended and restated credit agreement for a $250.0 million unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility which replaced an existing $100.0 million unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility; Repurchased all of AMB Property II, L.P.s outstanding 7.75% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units for an aggregate cost of $10.9 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions; Repurchased all of AMB Property II, L.P.s outstanding 7.95% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units for an aggregate cost of $10.0 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions; Repurchased all of AMB Property II, L.P.s outstanding 8.125% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units for an aggregate cost of $42.8 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions; Purchased all of AMB Property II, L.P.s outstanding 5.00% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units for an aggregate cost of $36.6 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions; Completed the early renewal and increase of our senior unsecured revolving line of credit in the amount of $550.0 million, an increase of $50.0 million; Entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement for a 45.0 billion Yen (approximately $377.9 million U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at December 31, 2006) unsecured revolving credit facility that replaced an existing 35.0 billion Yen (approximately $293.9 million U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at December 31, 2006) unsecured revolving credit facility; Raised approximately $48.1 million in net proceeds from the issuance and sale of $50.0 million of our 6.85% Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock; Issued $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior unsecured notes under the operating partnerships 2006 medium term note program which mature on August 15, 2013 and bear interest at a rate of 5.90% per annum; and 43 Entered into a 228.0 million Euro (approximately $300.9 million U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at December 31, 2006) revolving credit facility agreement, which provides for loans on a secured and unsecured basis. See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 6, 9 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our capital markets transactions. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Investments in Real Estate. Investments in real estate and leasehold interests are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. We also regularly review the impact of above or below market leases, in place leases and lease origination costs for all new acquisitions, and record an intangible asset or liability accordingly. Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a property by property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable. Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying value of the property. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future economics and market conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying value of our long lived assets could occur in the future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings. As a result of leasing activity and the economic environment, we re evaluated the carrying value of our investments and recorded impairment charges of $6.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 on certain of our investments. Revenue Recognition. We record rental revenue from operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts, security deposits and letters of credit, then we may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our customers on an on going basis by reviewing their financial condition periodically as appropriate. Each period we review our outstanding accounts receivable, including straight line rents, for doubtful accounts and provide allowances as needed. We also record lease termination fees when a customer has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us. If a customer remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement, the applicable termination fees are deferred and recognized over the term of such customers occupancy. Property Dispositions. We report real estate dispositions in three separate categories on our consolidated statements of operations. First, when we divest a portion of our interests in real estate entities or properties, gains from the sale represent the interests acquired by third party investors for cash and are included in gains from disposition of real estate interests in the statement of operations. Second, we dispose of value added conversion projects and build to suit and speculative development projects for which we have not generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable, and are included in development profits, net of taxes, in the statement of operations. Lastly, 44 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, requires us to separately report as discontinued operations the historical operating results attributable to operating properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the properties, which is included in gains from dispositions of real estate, net of minority interests, in the statement of operations. The consolidated statements of operations for prior periods are also adjusted to conform with this classification. There is no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial position, net income or cash flows. In all cases, gains and losses are recognized using the full accrual method of accounting. Gains relating to transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met. Joint Ventures. We hold interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We determine consolidation based on standards set forth in EITF 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights or FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN 46. Based on the guidance set forth in EITF 04 5, we consolidate certain joint venture investments because we exercise significant control over major operating decisions, such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, asset management, investment activity and changes in financing. For joint ventures that are variable interest entities as defined under FIN 46 where we are not the primary beneficiaries, we do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. For joint ventures under EITF 04 5, where we do not exercise significant control over major operating and management decisions, but where we exercise significant influence, we use the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. Real Estate Investment Trust. As a real estate investment trust, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes in the U.S. if we meet minimum distribution, income, asset and shareholder tests. However, some of our subsidiaries may be subject to federal and state taxes. In addition, foreign entities may also be subject to the taxes of the host country. An income tax allocation is required to be estimated on our taxable income arising from our taxable real estate investment trust subsidiaries and international entities. A deferred tax component could arise based upon the differences in GAAP versus tax income for items such as depreciation and gain recognition. However, we believe deferred tax is an immaterial component of our consolidated balance sheet. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Effective October 1, 2006, we deconsolidated AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., on a prospective basis, due to the re evaluation of the accounting for our investment in the fund in light of changes to the partnership agreement regarding the general partners rights effective October 1, 2006. As a result, our results of operations presented below are not comparable between years presented. The analysis below includes changes attributable to same store growth, acquisitions, development activity and divestitures. Same store properties are those that we owned during both the current and prior year reporting periods, excluding development properties stabilized after December 31, 2004 (generally defined as properties that are 90% leased or properties for which we have held a certificate of occupancy or where building has been substantially complete for at least 12 months). As of December 31, 2006, same store industrial properties consisted of properties aggregating approximately 71.2 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2006 consisted of 73 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. During 2006, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 50 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.5 million square feet. In 2005, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 150 buildings, aggregating approximately 10.6 million square feet. Our future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition of additional properties and dispositions. Our future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical results. 45 For the Years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (dollars in millions) Revenues 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Rental revenues U.S. industrial: Same store $ 514.9 $ 501.5 $ 13.4 2.7 % 2006 acquisitions 4.4 4.4 % 2005 acquisitions 19.4 11.4 8.0 70.2 % Development 8.3 7.4 0.9 12.2 % Other industrial 74.3 63.6 10.7 16.8 % Non U.S. industrial 62.5 33.1 29.4 88.8 % Total rental revenues 683.8 617.0 66.8 10.8 % Private capital income 46.1 43.9 2.2 5.0 % Total revenues $ 729.9 $ 660.9 $ 69.0 10.4 % U.S. industrial same store revenues increased $13.4 million from the prior year despite the decrease of $12.8 million in same store revenues due to the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., effective October 1, 2006, attributable primarily to improved occupancy and increased rental rates in various markets. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2006 consisted of 73 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. Non U.S. industrial revenues increased approximately $29.4 million from the prior year due primarily to the stabilization of three properties in Japan and the continued acquisition of properties in France, Germany and Mexico. The increase in private capital income was primarily due to increased asset management and acquisition fees from additional assets held in co investment joint ventures, which were partially offset by a decrease in incentive distributions of approximately $3.9 million. During 2006, we received 46 incentive distributions of $22.5 million, of which $19.8 million was from AMB Partners II, L.P., as compared to incentive distribution of $26.4 million for the sale of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., during 2005.

The 2005 acquisitions consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. The 2006 acquisitions consisted of 73 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. Non U.S. industrial revenues increased approximately $6.0 million from the prior year due primarily to the stabilization of three properties in Japan and the continued acquisition of properties in France, Germany and Mexico. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The 2006 impairment loss was taken on several non core assets as a result of leasing activities and changes in the economic environment and the holding period of certain assets. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased stock based compensation expense as a result of higher values assigned to option and stock awards and executive departures, additional staffing and expenses for our international expansion, and the acquisition of AMB Blackpine. Other expenses decreased approximately $2.4 million from the prior year due primarily to a decrease in losses associated with our deferred compensation plan and a decrease in certain deal costs. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our co investment joint ventures. 47 Other Income and (Expenses) 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures, net $ 23.2 $ 10.8 $ 12.4 114.8 % Other income 9.4 5.6 3.8 67.9 % Gains from dispositions of real estate interests, net 19.1 (19.1 ) (100.0 )% Development profits, net of taxes 106.4 54.8 51.6 94.2 % Interest expense, including amortization (165.2 ) (147.3 ) 17.9 12.2 % Total other income and (expenses), net $ (26.2 ) $ (57.0 ) $ (30.8 ) (54.0 )% The $12.4 million increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was primarily due to gains of $17.5 million from the disposition of real estate by our unconsolidated co investment joint ventures during 2006 as opposed to $5.5 million of such gains during 2005 and, effective October 1, 2006, the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., which resulted in an increase of approximately $5.1 million. These increases were partially offset by an increase in expenses by our unconsolidated joint ventures. The increase in other income was primarily due to increased bank interest income and an increase in property management income due to the expansion of our property management business. The 2005 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted primarily from our contribution of $106.9 million (using the exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties to our then newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. Development profits represent gains from the sale of development projects and land as part of our development for sale program. The increase in development profits was due to increased disposition and contribution volume during 2006. During 2006, we sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $13.3 million. In addition, during 2006, we received approximately $0.4 million in connection with the condemnation of a parcel of land resulting in a loss of $1.0 million, $0.8 million of which was the joint venture partners share. During 2006, we also contributed a total of ten completed development projects into unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. Four projects totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Japan Fund I, L.P, two projects totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet were contributed into AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, three projects totaling approximately 0.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and one land parcel into AMB DFS Fund I, LLC. As a result of these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after tax gain of $94.1 million, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party investors for cash. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $1.9 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. The increase in interest expense, including amortization, was due primarily to increased borrowings on unsecured credit facilities and other debt.

During 2005, we divested ourselves of 142 industrial buildings and one retail center, aggregating approximately 9.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $926.6 million, with a resulting net gain of $113.6 million. Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., for $618.5 million. The multi investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. We 48 received cash and a distribution of an on tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund.

In August 2006, we issued 2,000,000 shares of 6.85% Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. The increase in preferred stock dividends is due to the newly issued shares. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2006, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, repurchased all 840,000 of its outstanding 8.125% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units, all 220,440 of its outstanding 7.75% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units, all 201,139 of its outstanding 7.95% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units and all 729,582 of its outstanding 5.00% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units. As a result, we recognized a decrease in income available to common stockholders of $1.1 million for the original issuance costs, net of discount on repurchase.

The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2004 and 2005, we continued to acquire properties in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial revenues. The increase in private capital income was primarily due to increased asset management fees from additional assets held in co investment joint ventures and incentive distributions for 2005 of $26.4 million for the sale of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, asset 49 management priority distributions from AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., and acquisition fees from AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P.

In 2004 and 2005, we continued to acquire properties in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial property operating costs. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate during the year. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international and development expansions and the expansion of satellite offices. Other expenses increased approximately $2.4 million from the prior year due primarily to greater losses on our non qualified deferred compensation plan in 2005 and an increase in certain deal costs.

The increase in other income was primarily due to increased bank interest income. The 2005 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted primarily from our contribution of $106.9 million (using exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties to our newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. The 2004 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted from our contribution of $71.5 million in operating properties to our unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC. Development profits represent gains from the sale of development projects and land as part of our development for sale program. The increase in development profits was due to increased volume in 2005. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $1.9 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. During 2004, we sold seven land parcels and six development projects as part of our development for sale program, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet for an aggregate price of $40.4 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $6.5 million. During 2004, we also contributed one completed development project into a newly formed unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $2.0 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash.

The increase in preferred stock dividends is due to the newly issued shares. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Balance Sheet Strategy. In general, we use unsecured lines of credit, unsecured notes, preferred stock and common equity (issued by us and or the operating partnership and its subsidiaries) to capitalize our 100% owned assets. Over time, we plan to retire non recourse, secured debt encumbering our 100% owned assets and replace that debt with unsecured notes. In managing our co investment joint ventures, in general, we use non recourse, secured debt to capitalize our co investment joint ventures. We currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for acquisitions, development, expansion and renovation of properties will include: retained earnings and cash flow from operations; 51 private capital from co investment partners; net proceeds from contribution of properties and completed development projects to our co investment joint ventures; borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities; other forms of secured or unsecured financing; proceeds from equity (common and preferred) or debt securities offerings; proceeds from limited partnership unit offerings (including issuances of limited partnership units by our subsidiaries); and net proceeds from divestitures of properties. We currently expect that our principal funding requirements will include: working capital; development, expansion and renovation of properties; acquisitions, including our global expansion; debt service; and dividends and distributions on outstanding common and preferred stock and limited partnership units. Cash flows. As of December 31, 2006, cash provided by operating activities was $335.9 million as compared to $295.8 million for the same period in 2005. This change is primarily due to increases in rental rates, partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses primarily due to additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international and development expansions and increased occupancy costs related to the expansion of regional offices. Cash used for investing activities was $880.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to cash used for investing activities of $60.4 million for the same period in 2005. This change is primarily due to an increase in funds used for property acquisitions and capital expenditures, and a decrease in proceeds from property divestitures (mainly due to the divesture of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., portfolio in 2005), offset by less funds used for additions to interests in unconsolidated joint ventures and an increase in capital distributions received from unconsolidated joint ventures. Cash provided by financing activities was $483.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to cash used in financing activities of $101.9 million for the same period in 2005. This change is due primarily to an increase in borrowings, net of repayments, issuance of common stock upon the exercise of options and issuances of preferred stock, offset by the cost of the repurchase of preferred units for the year ended December 31, 2006. We believe that our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow from operations, borrowings available under our unsecured credit facilities and our ability to access private and public debt and equity capital, are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Resources Property Divestitures. During 2006, we divested ourselves of 39 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 3.5 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $175.3 million, with a resulting net gain of $42.6 million. Development Sales. During 2006, we sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $13.3 million. In addition, during 2006, we received approximately $0.4 million in connection with the condemnation of a parcel of land resulting in a loss of $1.0 million, $0.8 million of which was the joint venture partners share. 52 Development Contributions. During 2006, we contributed a total of nine completed development projects and one land parcel into unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. Four projects totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Japan Fund I, L.P, two projects totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet were contributed into AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and three projects totaling approximately 0.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. In addition, one land parcel was contributed into AMB DFS Fund I, LLC. As a result of these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after tax gain of $94.1 million, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party investors for cash. These gains are included in development profits, net of taxes, in the statement of operations. Properties Held for Contribution. As of December 31, 2006, we held for contribution to co investment joint ventures, nine industrial projects with an aggregate net book value of $154.0 million, which, when contributed to a joint venture, will reduce our current ownership interest from approximately 100% to an expected range of 15 50%. Properties Held for Divestiture. As of December 31, 2006, we held for divestiture four industrial projects, which are not in our core markets, do not meet our current strategic objectives or which we have included as part of our development for sale program. The divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. As of December 31, 2006, the net carrying value of the properties held for divestiture was $20.9 million. Expected net sales proceeds exceed the net carrying value of the properties. Co investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund certain acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. We generally consolidate these joint ventures for financial reporting purposes because they are not variable interest entities and because we are the sole managing general partner and control all major operating decisions. However, in certain cases, our co investment joint ventures are unconsolidated because we do not control all major operating decisions and the general partners do not have significant rights under EITF 04 5. Third party equity interests in the joint ventures are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2006, we owned approximately 64.3 million square feet of our properties (51.6% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so.

(6) The planned gross capitalization and investment capacity of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. as an open end fund, is not limited. The planned gross capitalization represents the gross book value of real estate assets as of the most recent quarter end. (7) AMB DFS Fund I, LLC is a co investment partnership formed in 2006 with a subsidiary of GE Real Estate to build and sell properties. We also have a 0.1% unconsolidated equity interest (with an approximate 33% economic interest) in AMB Pier One, LLC, a joint venture related to the 2000 redevelopment of the pier which houses our office space in the San Francisco Bay Area. The investment is not consolidated because we do not exercise control over major operating decisions such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, investment activity and changes in financing. We have an option to purchase the remaining equity interest beginning January 1, 2007 and expiring December 31, 2009, based on the fair market value as stipulated in the joint venture agreement. As of December 31, 2006, we also had an approximate 39.0% unconsolidated equity interest in G.Accion, a Mexican real estate company. G.Accion provides management and development services for industrial, retail, residential and office properties in Mexico. In addition, as of December 31, 2006, one of our subsidiaries also had an approximate 5% interest in IAT Air Cargo Facilities Income Fund (IAT), a Canadian income trust specializing in aviation related real estate at Canadas leading international airports. This equity investment is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Common and Preferred Equity. We have authorized for issuance 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which the following series were designated as of December 31, 2006: 1,595,337 shares of series D preferred; 510,000 shares of series I cumulative redeemable preferred; 800,000 shares of series J cumulative redeemable preferred; 800,000 shares of series K cumulative redeemable preferred; 2,300,000 shares of series L cumulative redeemable preferred, of which 2,000,000 are outstanding; 2,300,000 shares of series M cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which are outstanding; 3,000,000 shares of series O cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which are outstanding; and 2,000,000 shares of series P cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which are outstanding.

The series N preferred units were issued to Robert Pattillo Properties, Inc. in exchange for the contribution to AMB Property II, L.P of certain parcels of land that are located in multiple markets.

We, in turn, used those proceeds to redeem all 3,995,800 of our 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for $100.2 million, including all accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, to the redemption date. In December 2005, our board of directors approved a new two year common stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of our common stock. We did not repurchase or retire any shares of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2006. Debt. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, we presently intend to operate with an our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio of approximately 45% or less. As of December 31, 2006, our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio was 34.2%. (See footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratios table below for our definitions of our share of total market capitalization, market equity and our share of total debt.) However, we typically finance our co investment joint ventures with secured debt at a loan to value ratio of 50 65% per our joint venture agreements. Additionally, we currently intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these policies, however, our organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our management could alter or eliminate these policies without stockholder approval or circumstances could arise that could render us unable to comply with these policies. As of December 31, 2006, the aggregate principal amount of our secured debt was $1.4 billion, excluding unamortized debt premiums of $6.3 million. Of the $1.4 billion of secured debt, $1.0 billion is secured by properties in our joint ventures. The secured debt is generally non recourse and bears interest at rates varying from 2.9% to 10.4% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 6.2%) and final maturity dates ranging from February 2007 to January 2025. As of December 31, 2006, $1.0 billion of the secured debt obligations bear interest at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 6.1%, while the remaining $386.1 million bear interest at variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 4.7%). As of December 31, 2006, the operating partnership had outstanding an aggregate of $1.1 billion in unsecured senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 6.2% and had a weighted average term of 4.8 years. These unsecured senior debt securities include $300.0 million in notes issued in June 1998, $225.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2000 medium term note program, $275.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2002 medium term note program, $175.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2006 medium term note program and approximately $112.5 million of 5.094% Notes Due 2015, which were issued to Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America on July 11, 2005 in a private placement, in exchange for the cancellation of $100.0 million of notes that were issued in June 1998 resulting in a discount of approximately $12.5 million. The unsecured senior debt securities are subject to various covenants. Also included is a $25.0 million promissory note which matures in January 2007. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to its senior debt securities. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then our cash flow may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Credit Facilities. On June 1, 2006, the operating partnership entered into a third amended and restated $550.0 million unsecured revolving credit agreement that replaced its then existing $500.0 million credit facility, which was to mature on June 1, 2007. We are a guarantor of the operating partnerships obligations under the credit facility. The line, which matures on June 1, 2010, carries a one year extension option and can be increased to up to 56 $700.0 million upon certain conditions. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the operating partnerships long term debt rating, which was 42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2006, with an annual facility fee of 15 basis points. The four year credit facility includes a multi currency component, under which up to $550.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Euros, Yen or British Pounds Sterling. The operating partnership uses its unsecured credit facility principally for acquisitions, funding development activity and general working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on the credit facility was $303.7 million and the remaining amount available was $234.6 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $11.7 million. The outstanding balance included borrowings denominated in Euros, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately $303.7 million U.S. dollars. On June 23, 2006, AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating partnership and as the initial borrower, entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement for a 45.0 billion Yen unsecured revolving credit facility, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately $377.9 million U.S. dollars. This replaced the 35.0 billion Yen unsecured revolving credit facility executed on June 29, 2004, as previously amended, which using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately $293.9 million U.S. dollars. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K. under the credit facility, as well as the obligations of any other entity in which the operating partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the credit agreement. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and for other real estate purposes in Japan, China and South Korea. Generally, borrowers under the credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the credit facility with certain real estate assets or equity in entities holding such real estate assets. The credit facility matures in June 2010 and has a one year extension option. The credit facility can be increased to up to 55.0 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately $461.9 million U.S. dollars. The extension option is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding commitments under the facility at that time. The rate on the borrowings is generally TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt and was 42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2006. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, payable in quarterly amounts, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt, and was 15 basis points of the outstanding commitments under the facility as of December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, was $320.9 million in U.S. dollars. On June 13, 2006, the operating partnership and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries entered into a fourth amended and restated credit agreement for a $250.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which replaced the third amended and restated credit agreement for a $250.0 million unsecured credit facility. On February 16, 2006, the third amended and restated credit agreement replaced the then existing $100.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that was to mature in June 2008. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations for such subsidiaries and other entities controlled by us or the operating partnership that are selected by the operating partnership from time to time to be borrowers under and pursuant to the credit facility. The four year credit facility includes a multi currency component under which up to $250.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Singapore dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros. The line, which matures in February 2010 and carries a one year extension option, can be increased to up to $350.0 million upon certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding commitments. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships senior unsecured long term debt, which was 60 basis points as of December 31, 2006, with an annual facility fee based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships senior unsecured long term debt. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and general working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on this facility was approximately $227.4 million. The credit agreement contains affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios by the operating partnership, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. 57 Mortgages Receivable. Through a wholly owned subsidiary, we hold a mortgage loan receivable on AMB Pier One, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture. The note bears interest at 13.0% and matures in May 2026. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on the note was $12.7 million. We also hold a loan receivable on G. Accion, an unconsolidated joint venture totaling $6.1 million with an interest rate of 10.0%. The loan matures in March 2010.

(4) Our share of total debt is the pro rata portion of the total debt based on our percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated or unconsolidated joint ventures holding the debt. We believe that our share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze our leverage and to compare our leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of our debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their joint ventures. Our share of total debt is not intended to reflect our actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures.

As of December 31, 2006, we had $21.1 million in restricted cash. Our board of directors declared a regular cash dividend for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 of $0.46 per share of common stock, and the operating partnership announced its intention to pay a regular cash distribution for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 of $0.46 per common unit. The dividends and distributions were payable on January 5, 2007 to stockholders and unitholders of record on December 22, 2006. The series L, M, O and P preferred stock dividends were payable on January 16, 2007 to stockholders of record on January 5, 2007. The series J and K preferred unit quarterly distributions were payable on January 16, 2007. The series D and I preferred unit quarterly distributions were paid on December 25, 2006. The following table sets forth the dividends and distributions paid or payable per share or unit for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004: Paying Entity Security 2006 2005 2004 AMB Property Corporation Common stock $ 1.84 $ 1.76 $ 1.70 AMB Property Corporation Series L preferred stock $ 1.63 $ 1.63 $ 1.63 AMB Property Corporation Series M preferred stock $ 1.69 $ 1.69 $ 1.69 AMB Property Corporation Series O preferred stock $ 1.75 $ 0.09 n/a AMB Property Corporation Series P preferred stock $ 0.60 n/a n/a Operating Partnership Common limited partnership units $ 1.84 $ 1.76 $ 1.70 Operating Partnership Series J preferred units $ 3.98 $ 3.98 $ 3.98 Operating Partnership Series K preferred units $ 3.98 $ 3.98 $ 3.98 AMB Property II, L.P.

(2) In September 2006, AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased all of its outstanding series F preferred units. (3) In March 2006, AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased all of its outstanding series H preferred units. (4) The holder of the series N preferred units exercised its put option in January 2006 and sold all of its series N preferred units to the operating partnership and AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased all of such units from the operating partnership. The anticipated size of our distributions, using only cash from operations, will not allow us to retire all of our debt as it comes due. Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Commitments Development Starts. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we initiated 30 new industrial development projects in North America, Europe and Asia with a total expected investment of $914.3 million, aggregating approximately 10.4 million square feet. During 2005, we initiated 30 new industrial development projects in North America, Europe and Asia with a total expected investment of $522.4 million, aggregating approximately 7.0 million square feet. 60 Development Pipeline. As of December 31, 2006, we had 45 industrial projects in our development pipeline, which will total approximately 13.7 million square feet, and will have an aggregate estimated investment of $1.3 billion upon completion. We have an additional ten development projects available for sale or contribution totaling approximately 3.0 million square feet, with an aggregate estimated investment of $199.2 million. One of these ten projects totaling $13.0 million and approximately 0.2 million square feet is held in an unconsolidated joint venture. As of December 31, 2006, we and our joint venture partners had funded an aggregate of $814.5 million and needed to fund an estimated additional $481.0 million in order to complete our development pipeline which includes projects expected to be completed through the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we acquired 835 acres of land for industrial warehouse development in North America and Asia for approximately $293.2 million. Acquisitions. During 2006, we acquired 106 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 9.8 million square feet for a total expected investment of $834.2 million (includes acquisition costs of $814.1 million and estimated acquisition capital of $20.1 million), of which we acquired 70 buildings through one of our unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. We generally fund our acquisitions through private capital contributions, borrowings under our credit facilities, cash, debt issuances and net proceeds from property divestitures. Lease Commitments. We have entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily on tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms from one to 55 years. These buildings and improvements are amortized ratably over the lesser of the terms of the related leases or 40 years. Future minimum rental payments required under non cancelable operating leases in effect as of December 31, 2006 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2007 $ 21,636 2008 22,186 2009 21,506 2010 20,667 2011 20,668 Thereafter 272,483 Total $ 379,146 Co investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. As of December 31, 2006, we had investments in co investment joint ventures with a gross book value of $1.9 billion, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, and net equity investments in four unconsolidated co investment joint ventures of $236.0 million and a gross book value of $2.5 billion. As of December 31, 2006, we may make additional capital contributions to current and planned co investment joint ventures of up to $168.2 million (using the exchange rates at December 31, 2006) pursuant to the terms of the joint venture agreements. From time to time, we may raise additional equity commitments for AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open ended unconsolidated co investment joint venture formed in 2004 with institutional investors, which invests through a private real estate investment trust. This would increase our obligation to make additional capital commitments. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of this fund, we are obligated to contribute 20% of the total equity commitments to the fund until such time our total equity commitment is greater than $150.0 million, at which time, our obligation is reduced to 10% of the total equity commitments. We expect to fund these contributions with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances or net proceeds from property divestitures, which could adversely effect our cash flow. Captive Insurance Company. In December 2001, we formed a wholly owned captive insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., (Arcata), which provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the deductible under our third party policies. The captive insurance company is one element of our overall risk management program. We capitalized Arcata in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata established annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss experience of our properties. Annually, 61 we engage an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims, related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata may be adjusted based on this estimate. Like premiums paid to third party insurance companies, premiums paid to Arcata may be reimbursed by customers pursuant to specific lease terms. Through this structure, we believe that we have more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market. Potential Contingent and Unknown Liabilities. Contingent and unknown liabilities may include the following: liabilities for environmental conditions; claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to our formation or acquisition transactions that had not been asserted prior to our formation or acquisition transactions; accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; tax liabilities; and claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these entities. Overview of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our debt, interest and lease payments due by period as of December 31, 2006 (dollars in thousands): Less than More than Contractual Obligations 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Total Debt $ 213,869 $ 592,085 $ 1,593,035 $ 1,042,699 $ 3,441,688 Debt interest payments 13,861 38,126 74,416 58,775 185,178 Operating lease commitments 21,636 43,692 41,335 272,483 379,146 Construction commitments 31,713 57,042 88,755 Total $ 281,079 $ 730,945 $ 1,708,786 $ 1,373,957 $ 4,094,767 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Standby Letters of Credit. As of December 31, 2006, we had provided approximately $22.1 million in letters of credit, of which $11.7 million was provided under the operating partnerships $550.0 million unsecured credit facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other commitments. Guarantees. Other than parent guarantees associated with the unsecured debt, as of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding guarantees in the aggregate amount of $48.2 million in connection with certain acquisitions. As of December 31, 2006, we guaranteed $26.8 million and $83.2 million on outstanding loans on two of our consolidated joint ventures and two of our unconsolidated joint ventures, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2006, we guaranteed $87.3 million on outstanding property debt related to one of our unconsolidated joint ventures. Performance and Surety Bonds. As of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $11.4 million. These bonds were issued in connection with certain of our development projects and were posted to guarantee certain tax obligations and the construction of certain real property improvements and infrastructure, such as grading, sewers and streets. Performance and surety bonds are commonly required by public agencies from real estate developers. Performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the taxes due or the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. Promoted Interests and Other Contractual Obligations. Upon the achievement of certain return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, we may be obligated to make payments to certain of our joint venture partners 62 pursuant to the terms and provisions of their contractual agreements with us. From time to time in the normal course of our business, we enter into various contracts with third parties that may obligate us to make payments, pay promotes, or perform other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. SUPPLEMENTAL EARNINGS MEASURES FFO. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider funds from operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. FFO is defined as net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, less gains (or losses) from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estate related depreciation, and adjustments to derive our pro rata share of FFO of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. Further, we do not adjust FFO to eliminate the effects of non recurring charges. We believe that FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. We believe that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. The following table reflects the calculation of FFO reconciled from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Net income(1) $ 224,072 $ 257,807 $ 125,471 $ 129,128 $ 121,119 Gains from dispositions of real estate, net of minority interests(2) (42,635 ) (132,652 ) (47,224 ) (50,325 ) (19,383 ) Real estate, related depreciation and amortization: Total depreciation and amortization 177,824 161,732 136,610 111,879 103,550 Discontinued operations depreciation 2,153 18,572 30,740 30,458 32,953 Non real estate depreciation (4,546 ) (3,388 ) (871 ) (720 ) (712 ) Ground lease amortization (2,301 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from consolidated joint ventures: Joint venture partners minority interests (Net income) 37,975 36,401 29,360 22,276 16,529 63 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Net income) 2,805 3,411 2,384 2,117 3,303 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Development profits) 4,948 2,262 435 344 57 Discontinued operations minority interests (Net income) 31 8,769 13,964 15,214 16,597 FFO attributable to minority interests (82,861 ) (100,275 ) (80,192 ) (65,603 ) (52,051 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures: Our share of net income (23,240 ) (10,770 ) (3,781 ) (5,445 ) (5,674 ) Our share of FFO 16,038 14,441 7,549 9,755 9,291 Our share of development profits, net of taxes 5,441 Preferred stock dividends (13,582 ) (7,388 ) (7,131 ) (6,999 ) (8,496 ) Preferred stock and unit redemption discount (issuance costs) (1,070 ) (5,413 ) 412 Funds from operations $ 297,912 $ 254,363 $ 207,314 $ 186,666 $ 215,194 Basic FFO per common share and unit $ 3.24 $ 2.87 $ 2.39 $ 2.17 $ 2.44 Diluted FFO per common share and unit $ 3.12 $ 2.75 $ 2.30 $ 2.13 $ 2.40 Weighted average common shares and units: Basic 92,047,678 88,684,262 86,885,250 85,859,899 88,204,208 Diluted 95,444,072 92,508,725 90,120,250 87,616,365 89,689,310 (1) Includes gains from undepreciated land sales of $5.6 million, $25.0 million, $3.7 million and $1.2 million for 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. (2) The information for 2005 includes accumulated depreciation re capture of approximately $1.1 million associated with the sale of the Interstate Crossdock redevelopment project. SS NOI. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider same store net operating income, or SS NOI, to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. For properties that are considered part of the same store pool, see Part I, Item 2: Properties Industrial Properties Owned and Managed Market Operating Statistics, Note 6, and Owned and Managed Operating and Leasing Statistics Owned and Managed Same Store Operating Statistics, Note 2. In deriving SS NOI, we define NOI as rental revenues (as calculated in accordance with GAAP), including reimbursements, less straight line rents, property operating expenses and real estate taxes. We exclude straight line rents in calculating SS NOI because we believe it provides a better measure of actual cash basis rental growth for a year over year comparison. In addition, we believe that SS NOI helps the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate as compared to other companies. While SS NOI is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. SS NOI also does not reflect general and administrative expense, interest expenses, depreciation and amortization costs, capital expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development and construction activities that could materially impact our results from operations. Further, our computation of SS NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating SS NOI. 64 The following table reconciles SS NOI from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Net income $ 224,072 $ 257,807 $ 125,471 Private capital income (46,102 ) (43,942 ) (12,895 ) Depreciation and amortization 177,824 161,732 136,610 Impairment losses 6,312 General and administrative 104,262 71,564 57,181 Other expenses 2,620 5,038 2,554 Fund costs 2,091 1,482 1,741 Total other income and expenses 26,178 57,044 119,727 Total minority interests share of income 62,855 74,777 52,863 Total discontinued operations (51,949 ) (127,498 ) (63,888 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (193 ) Net Operating Income (NOI) 507,970 458,004 419,364 Less non same store NOI (116,030 ) (70,782 ) (19,990 ) Less non cash adjustments(1) (8,426 ) (9,861 ) (8,249 ) Cash basis same store NOI $ 383,514 $ 377,361 $ 391,125 (1) Non cash adjustments include straight line rents and amortization of lease intangibles for the same store pool only. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices, interest rates and international exchange rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimize the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings and our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2006, we had three outstanding interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $38.1 million (in U.S. dollars). See Financial Instruments below. The table below summarizes the market risks associated with our fixed and variable rate debt outstanding before net unamortized debt discounts of $4.3 million as of December 31, 2006 (dollars in thousands): 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Fixed rate debt(1) $ 155,384 $ 368,141 $ 152,151 $ 430,676 $ 288,835 $ 768,320 $ 2,163,507 Average interest rate 6.7 % 7.1 % 4.7 % 6.4 % 6.8 % 5.9 % 6.3 % Variable rate debt(2) $ 58,485 $ 22,604 $ 49,189 $ 854,543 $ 18,981 $ 274,379 $ 1,278,181 Average interest rate 5.9 % 6.6 % 6.8 % 3.1 % 3.8 % 4.9 % 3.8 % Interest Payments $ 13,861 $ 27,630 $ 10,496 $ 54,054 $ 20,362 $ 58,775 $ 185,178 (1) Represents 62.9% of all outstanding debt. (2) Represents 37.1% of all outstanding debt. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased or decreased by 10%, then the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would be $4.9 million (net of swaps) annually. As of December 31, 65 2006, the book value and the estimated fair value of our total consolidated debt (both secured and unsecured) was $3.4 and $3.5 billion, respectively, based on our estimate of current market interest rates. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, variable rate debt comprised 37.1% and 24.5%, respectively, of all our outstanding debt. Variable rate debt was $1.3 billion and $831.7 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. The increase is primarily due to higher outstanding balances on our credit facilities. This increase in our outstanding variable rate debt increases our risk associated with unfavorable interest rate fluctuations. Financial Instruments. We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income or income. For revenues or expenses denominated in non functional currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments in effect at December 31, 2006 were three interest rate swaps hedging cash flows of our variable rate borrowings based on U.S. Libor (USD) and Euribor (Europe). The following table summarizes our financial instruments as of December 31, 2006 (in thousands): Maturity Dates Related Derivatives (in thousands) December 8, 2008 June 8, 2010 November 1, 2014 Notional Amount Fair Value Interest Rate Swaps: Plain Interest Rate Swap, Europe Notional Amount (U.S. dollars) $ 9,655 $ 9,655 Receive Floating(%) 3MEURIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 3.72 % Fair Market Value $ 54 Plain Interest Rate Swap, USD Notional Amount (U.S. dollars) $ 25,000 25,000 Receive Floating(%) 3MLIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 5.17 % Fair Market Value (130 ) Plain Interest Rate Swap, Europe Notional Amount (U.S. dollars) $ 3,471 3,471 Receive Floating(%) 3MEURIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 4.26 % Fair Market Value (45 ) Total $ 38,126 $ (121 ) International Operations. Our exposure to market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries operating in the United States and Mexico. The functional currency for our subsidiaries operating outside the United States is generally the local currency of the country in which the entity is located, mitigating the effect of foreign exchange gains and losses. Our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. We translate income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. The losses resulting from the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity and totaled $0.2 million for year ended December 31, 2006. Our international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. In these instances, non monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2006, losses from remeasurement and the sale of four foreign exchange agreements included in our results of operations totaled $0.8 million. We also record gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated. 66 
 
Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Liquidity and Capital Resources for a discussion of why we believe our share of total debt is a useful supplemental measure for our management and investors, of ways to use this measure when assessing our financial performance, the limitations of the measure as a measurement tool, and for a reconciliation of our share of total debt to total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure. Secured Debt As of December 31, 2006, we had $1.4 billion of secured indebtedness, net of unamortized premiums, secured by deeds of trust or mortgages. As of December 31, 2006, the total gross consolidated investment value of those properties securing the debt was $2.6 billion. Of the $1.4 billion of secured indebtedness, $1.0 billion was consolidated joint venture debt secured by properties with a gross investment value of $1.9 billion. For additional details, see Part II, Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources and Part IV, Item 15: Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. We believe that as of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the properties securing the respective obligations in each case exceeded the principal amount of the outstanding obligations. Item 3. Legal Proceedings As of December 31, 2006, there were no pending legal proceedings to which we were a party or of which any of our properties was the subject, the adverse determination of which we anticipate would have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders None. 35 PART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Our common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on November 21, 1997 under the symbol AMB. As of February 20, 2007, there were approximately 471 holders of record of our common stock (excluding shares held through The Depository Trust Company, as nominee). Set forth below are the high and low sales prices per share of our common stock, as reported on the NYSE composite tape, and the distribution per share paid or payable by us during the period from January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2006: Year High Low Dividend 2005 1st Quarter $ 41.45 $ 36.52 $ 0.440 2nd Quarter 44.00 36.38 0.440 3rd Quarter 46.46 41.85 0.440 4th Quarter 50.25 40.92 0.440 2006 1st Quarter $ 56.53 $ 48.89 $ 0.460 2nd Quarter 54.25 46.26 0.460 3rd Quarter 58.65 50.05 0.460 4th Quarter 63.02 54.49 0.460 The payment of dividends and other distributions by us is at the discretion of our board of directors and depends on numerous factors, including our cash flow, financial condition and capital requirements, real estate investment trust provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and other factors. 36 Stock Performance Graph The following line graph compares the change in our cumulative total stockholder return on shares of our common stock from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2006, to the cumulative total return of the Standard & Poors 500 Stock Index and the NAREIT Equity REIT Total Return Index from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2006.

(4) Our share of total debt is the pro rata portion of the total debt based on our percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated ventures holding the debt. We believe that our share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze our leverage and to compare our leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of our debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their joint ventures. Our share of total debt is not intended to reflect our actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures. For a reconciliation of our share of total debt to total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure, please see the table of debt maturities and capitalization in Part II, Item 7: Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources. (5) Effective October 1, 2006, we deconsolidated AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. on a prospective basis, due to the re evaluation of the accounting for our investment in the fund in light of changes to the partnership agreement regarding the general partners rights effective October 1, 2006. As a result, the financial measures for the years 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002, included in our operating data, other data and balance sheet data above are not comparable. 39 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations GENERAL You should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements. We commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company effective with the completion of our initial public offering on November 26, 1997, and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, with our initial tax return for the year ended December 31, 1997. AMB Property Corporation and AMB Property, L.P. were formed shortly before the consummation of our initial public offering. Managements Overview The primary source of our revenue and earnings is rent received from customers under long term (generally three to ten years) operating leases at our properties, including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs, and from partnership distributions and fees from our private capital business. We also produce earnings from the disposition of operating assets that no longer fit our strategy, from the disposition of projects in our development for sale program and from the contributions of properties to our co investment joint ventures. Our long term growth is driven by our ability to maintain and increase occupancy rates or increase rental rates at our properties, and by our ability to continue to acquire and develop new properties. National industrial markets continued to improve during 2006 when compared with market conditions in 2005. According to Torto Wheaton Research, availability dropped 10 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2006 to 9.4%, and availability for the year dropped 50 basis points. We believe the strongest industrial markets in the U.S. are the coastal gateway markets tied to global trade, including Los Angeles, our largest market, Miami, the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle, and to a lesser degree Northern New Jersey/New York (with the exception of the Exit 8A submarket). While we believe that the broader Chicago market is showing signs of stabilization, certain submarkets, like the OHare submarket, are relatively strong. We believe Dallas continues to recover, and Atlanta continues to suffer from a large increase in supply. We believe the operating environment in our U.S. on tarmac business remains good with improving cargo volumes and essentially no new supply. Investor demand for industrial property (as supported by our observation of strong national sales volumes and declining acquisition capitalization rates) has remained consistently strong over the past several years. We believe we capitalized on this demand for industrial property by accelerating the repositioning of our portfolio, through the disposition of non core properties, which was effectively completed in 2006 with our exit from the Charlotte and Memphis markets. We plan to continue selling selected assets on an opportunistic basis or that no longer fit our strategic investment objectives, but we believe we have substantially achieved our repositioning goals. Occupancy levels in our portfolio continue to outperform the national industrial market, as determined by Torto Wheaton Research, by pricing lease renewals and new leases with sensitivity to local market conditions. During the prior periods of decreasing or stabilizing rental rates, we strove to sign leases with shorter terms to prevent locking in lower rent levels for long periods and to be prepared to sign new, longer term leases during periods of growing rental rates. When we sign leases of shorter duration, we attempt to limit overall leasing costs and capital expenditures by offering different grades of tenant improvement packages, appropriate to the lease term. In our stronger markets, we are increasing rents as opposed to occupancy. 40 The table below summarizes key operating and leasing statistics for our owned and managed operating properties for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: U.S. Hub and Total Other Total/Weighted Owned and Managed Property Data(1) Gateway Markets(2) Markets(3) Average For the year ended December 31, 2006: % of total rentable square feet 72.0 % 28.0 % 100.0 % Occupancy percentage at year end 96.5 % 95.0 % 96.1 % Same space square footage leased 13,016,726 3,186,854 16,203,580 Rent (decreases) increases on renewals and rollovers(4) (0.4 )% 1.6 % (0.1 )% For the year ended December 31, 2005:(5) % of total rentable square feet 74.9 % 25.1 % 100.0 % Occupancy percentage at year end 96.2 % 94.6 % 95.8 % Same space square footage leased 11,032,482 2,574,944 13,607,426 Rent decreases on renewals and rollovers (10.8 )% (4.3 )% (9.7 )% (1) Schedule includes owned and managed operating properties which we define as properties in which we have at least a 10% ownership interest, for which we are the property or asset manager, and which we intend to hold for the long term. (2) Our U.S. hub and gateway markets include on tarmac and Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, Northern New Jersey/New York City, San Francisco Bay Area, and Seattle. (3) Our total markets include other U.S. target markets, other non target markets, and non U.S. target markets. (4) On a consolidated basis, rent increases on renewals and rollovers were 4.4% and 3.0%, respectively, for U.S. hub and gateway markets and total other markets. (5) The information for 2005 is presented on a consolidated basis while the information for 2006 is presented on an owned and managed basis. Management believes that the difference in comparability between the information for 2006 and 2005 is not significant. At December 31, 2006, our operating portfolios occupancy rate was 96.1%, on an owned and managed basis (97.0% on a consolidated basis), an increase from both the prior quarter and December 31, 2005. Rental rates on lease renewals and rollovers in our portfolio increased 4.1% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and decreased 0.1% for the full year. Cash basis same store net operating income (rental revenues less property operating expenses and real estate taxes for properties included in the same store pool, which is set annually and excludes properties purchased or developments stabilized after December 31, 2004) grew by 1.3% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and 2.6% for the full year 2006, on an owned and managed basis. Excluding lease termination fees, same store net operating income grew 3.0% and 3.2% in the quarter and for the full year (decreased 0.5% and increased 1.6%, respectively, on a consolidated basis), respectively, on an owned and managed basis. See Part II, Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Supplemental Earnings Measures for a discussion of same store net operating income and a reconciliation of same store net operating income and net income. We currently expect that same store growth in our operating portfolio, excluding lease termination fees, will be about 3% to 4% for 2007, on an owned and managed basis. Market rents continue to rebound from their lows and in many of our hub and gateway markets are back to or above their prior peak levels of 2001. We believe that industrial market rents in the San Francisco Bay Area are improving. While market rents in the San Francisco Bay Area were up 10% to 15% in 2006, rents still have not yet fully recovered to normal levels. Rents on lease renewals and rollovers in the San Francisco Bay Area declined 21.0% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and 13.2% for the full year 2006, on an owned and managed basis. Without the effect of the San Francisco Bay Area, rents on renewals and rollovers for the full year 2006 would have been 2.0%, on an owned and managed basis, which we believe reflects the generally positive trends in U.S. industrial space availability. We expect development to be a significant driver of our earnings growth as we expand our land and development pipeline, and contribute completed development projects into our co investment program and recognize development profits. We believe that development, renovation and expansion of well located, high 41 quality industrial properties should generally continue to provide us with attractive investment opportunities at a higher rate of return than we may obtain from the purchase of existing properties. We believe that our development opportunities in Mexico, Japan and China are particularly attractive given the current lack of supply of modern industrial distribution facilities in the major metropolitan markets of these countries. Prior to our global expansion, our development pipeline was $106.8 million at the end of 2002. As a result of our global expansion and increased development capabilities, we have increased our development pipeline to approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2006. In addition to our committed development pipeline, we hold a total of 1,735 acres for future development or sale, of which 92% is in North America. We believe these 1,735 acres of land could support approximately 30.5 million square feet of future development. Going forward, we believe that our co investment program with private capital investors will continue to serve as a significant source of revenues and capital for new investments. Through these co investment joint ventures, we typically earn acquisition fees, asset management fees and priority distributions, as well as promoted interests and incentive distributions based on the performance of the co investment joint ventures; however, we cannot assure you that we will continue to do so. Through contribution of development properties to our co investment joint ventures, we expect to recognize value creation from our development pipeline. As of December 31, 2006, we owned approximately 64.3 million square feet of our properties (51.6% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these co investment joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. By the end of 2010, we expect to have approximately 50% of our owned and managed operating portfolio invested in non U.S. markets (based on owned and managed annualized base rent). As of December 31, 2006, our non U.S. operating properties comprised 14.1% of our owned and managed operating portfolio (based on annualized base rent) and 7.4% of our consolidated operating portfolio (based on annualized base rent). Our North American target countries outside of the United States currently comprise Canada and Mexico. Our European target countries currently comprise Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. Our Asian target countries currently comprise China, India, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. We expect to add additional target countries outside the United States in the future. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust, we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income. As a result, we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our on going operations to the same extent that other corporations that are not real estate investment trusts can. We must continue to raise capital in both the debt and equity markets to fund our working capital needs, acquisitions and developments. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for a complete discussion of the sources of our capital. Summary of Key Transactions in 2006 During the year ended December 31, 2006, we completed the following significant capital deployment and other transactions: Acquired, on an owned and managed basis, 106 buildings in North America and Europe, aggregating approximately 9.8 million square feet, for $834.2 million; Committed to 30 development projects in North America, Asia and Europe totaling 10.4 million square feet with an estimated total investment of approximately $914.3 million; Acquired 835 acres of land for development in North America and Asia for approximately $293.2 million; Sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million; Contributed four completed development projects for $486.2 million to AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., two completed development projects for $56.4 million to AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, three completed development projects for $64.8 million to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. and one land parcel for $77.5 million to AMB DFS Fund I, LLC, all of which entities are unconsolidated co investment joint ventures.

See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our acquisition, development and disposition activity. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we completed the following significant capital markets and other financing transactions: Obtained long term secured debt financings for our co investment joint ventures of $141.6 million with a weighted average interest rate of 6.1%; Assumed $29.9 million of debt for our co investment joint ventures at a weighted average interest rate of 6.0%; Obtained $177.7 million of new debt (using exchange rates in effect at applicable quarter end dates) with a weighted average interest rate of 4.2% for international acquisitions; Obtained a $65.0 million floating rate unsecured revolving credit facility for one of our co investment joint ventures; Entered into a third amended and restated credit agreement for a $250.0 million unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility which replaced an existing $100.0 million unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility; Repurchased all of AMB Property II, L.P.s outstanding 7.75% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units for an aggregate cost of $10.9 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions; Repurchased all of AMB Property II, L.P.s outstanding 7.95% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units for an aggregate cost of $10.0 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions; Repurchased all of AMB Property II, L.P.s outstanding 8.125% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units for an aggregate cost of $42.8 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions; Purchased all of AMB Property II, L.P.s outstanding 5.00% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units for an aggregate cost of $36.6 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions; Completed the early renewal and increase of our senior unsecured revolving line of credit in the amount of $550.0 million, an increase of $50.0 million; Entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement for a 45.0 billion Yen (approximately $377.9 million U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at December 31, 2006) unsecured revolving credit facility that replaced an existing 35.0 billion Yen (approximately $293.9 million U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at December 31, 2006) unsecured revolving credit facility; Raised approximately $48.1 million in net proceeds from the issuance and sale of $50.0 million of our 6.85% Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock; Issued $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior unsecured notes under the operating partnerships 2006 medium term note program which mature on August 15, 2013 and bear interest at a rate of 5.90% per annum; and 43 Entered into a 228.0 million Euro (approximately $300.9 million U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at December 31, 2006) revolving credit facility agreement, which provides for loans on a secured and unsecured basis. See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 6, 9 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our capital markets transactions. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Investments in Real Estate. Investments in real estate and leasehold interests are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. We also regularly review the impact of above or below market leases, in place leases and lease origination costs for all new acquisitions, and record an intangible asset or liability accordingly. Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a property by property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable. Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying value of the property. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future economics and market conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying value of our long lived assets could occur in the future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings. As a result of leasing activity and the economic environment, we re evaluated the carrying value of our investments and recorded impairment charges of $6.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 on certain of our investments. Revenue Recognition. We record rental revenue from operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts, security deposits and letters of credit, then we may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our customers on an on going basis by reviewing their financial condition periodically as appropriate. Each period we review our outstanding accounts receivable, including straight line rents, for doubtful accounts and provide allowances as needed. We also record lease termination fees when a customer has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us. If a customer remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement, the applicable termination fees are deferred and recognized over the term of such customers occupancy. Property Dispositions. We report real estate dispositions in three separate categories on our consolidated statements of operations. First, when we divest a portion of our interests in real estate entities or properties, gains from the sale represent the interests acquired by third party investors for cash and are included in gains from disposition of real estate interests in the statement of operations. Second, we dispose of value added conversion projects and build to suit and speculative development projects for which we have not generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable, and are included in development profits, net of taxes, in the statement of operations. Lastly, 44 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, requires us to separately report as discontinued operations the historical operating results attributable to operating properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the properties, which is included in gains from dispositions of real estate, net of minority interests, in the statement of operations. The consolidated statements of operations for prior periods are also adjusted to conform with this classification. There is no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial position, net income or cash flows. In all cases, gains and losses are recognized using the full accrual method of accounting. Gains relating to transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met. Joint Ventures. We hold interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We determine consolidation based on standards set forth in EITF 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights or FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN 46. Based on the guidance set forth in EITF 04 5, we consolidate certain joint venture investments because we exercise significant control over major operating decisions, such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, asset management, investment activity and changes in financing. For joint ventures that are variable interest entities as defined under FIN 46 where we are not the primary beneficiaries, we do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. For joint ventures under EITF 04 5, where we do not exercise significant control over major operating and management decisions, but where we exercise significant influence, we use the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. Real Estate Investment Trust. As a real estate investment trust, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes in the U.S. if we meet minimum distribution, income, asset and shareholder tests. However, some of our subsidiaries may be subject to federal and state taxes. In addition, foreign entities may also be subject to the taxes of the host country. An income tax allocation is required to be estimated on our taxable income arising from our taxable real estate investment trust subsidiaries and international entities. A deferred tax component could arise based upon the differences in GAAP versus tax income for items such as depreciation and gain recognition. However, we believe deferred tax is an immaterial component of our consolidated balance sheet. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Effective October 1, 2006, we deconsolidated AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., on a prospective basis, due to the re evaluation of the accounting for our investment in the fund in light of changes to the partnership agreement regarding the general partners rights effective October 1, 2006. As a result, our results of operations presented below are not comparable between years presented. The analysis below includes changes attributable to same store growth, acquisitions, development activity and divestitures. Same store properties are those that we owned during both the current and prior year reporting periods, excluding development properties stabilized after December 31, 2004 (generally defined as properties that are 90% leased or properties for which we have held a certificate of occupancy or where building has been substantially complete for at least 12 months). As of December 31, 2006, same store industrial properties consisted of properties aggregating approximately 71.2 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2006 consisted of 73 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. During 2006, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 50 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.5 million square feet. In 2005, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 150 buildings, aggregating approximately 10.6 million square feet. Our future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition of additional properties and dispositions. Our future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical results. 45 For the Years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (dollars in millions) Revenues 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Rental revenues U.S. industrial: Same store $ 514.9 $ 501.5 $ 13.4 2.7 % 2006 acquisitions 4.4 4.4 % 2005 acquisitions 19.4 11.4 8.0 70.2 % Development 8.3 7.4 0.9 12.2 % Other industrial 74.3 63.6 10.7 16.8 % Non U.S. industrial 62.5 33.1 29.4 88.8 % Total rental revenues 683.8 617.0 66.8 10.8 % Private capital income 46.1 43.9 2.2 5.0 % Total revenues $ 729.9 $ 660.9 $ 69.0 10.4 % U.S. industrial same store revenues increased $13.4 million from the prior year despite the decrease of $12.8 million in same store revenues due to the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., effective October 1, 2006, attributable primarily to improved occupancy and increased rental rates in various markets. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2006 consisted of 73 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. Non U.S. industrial revenues increased approximately $29.4 million from the prior year due primarily to the stabilization of three properties in Japan and the continued acquisition of properties in France, Germany and Mexico. The increase in private capital income was primarily due to increased asset management and acquisition fees from additional assets held in co investment joint ventures, which were partially offset by a decrease in incentive distributions of approximately $3.9 million. During 2006, we received 46 incentive distributions of $22.5 million, of which $19.8 million was from AMB Partners II, L.P., as compared to incentive distribution of $26.4 million for the sale of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., during 2005.

The 2005 acquisitions consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. The 2006 acquisitions consisted of 73 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. Non U.S. industrial revenues increased approximately $6.0 million from the prior year due primarily to the stabilization of three properties in Japan and the continued acquisition of properties in France, Germany and Mexico. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The 2006 impairment loss was taken on several non core assets as a result of leasing activities and changes in the economic environment and the holding period of certain assets. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased stock based compensation expense as a result of higher values assigned to option and stock awards and executive departures, additional staffing and expenses for our international expansion, and the acquisition of AMB Blackpine. Other expenses decreased approximately $2.4 million from the prior year due primarily to a decrease in losses associated with our deferred compensation plan and a decrease in certain deal costs. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our co investment joint ventures. 47 Other Income and (Expenses) 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures, net $ 23.2 $ 10.8 $ 12.4 114.8 % Other income 9.4 5.6 3.8 67.9 % Gains from dispositions of real estate interests, net 19.1 (19.1 ) (100.0 )% Development profits, net of taxes 106.4 54.8 51.6 94.2 % Interest expense, including amortization (165.2 ) (147.3 ) 17.9 12.2 % Total other income and (expenses), net $ (26.2 ) $ (57.0 ) $ (30.8 ) (54.0 )% The $12.4 million increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was primarily due to gains of $17.5 million from the disposition of real estate by our unconsolidated co investment joint ventures during 2006 as opposed to $5.5 million of such gains during 2005 and, effective October 1, 2006, the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., which resulted in an increase of approximately $5.1 million. These increases were partially offset by an increase in expenses by our unconsolidated joint ventures. The increase in other income was primarily due to increased bank interest income and an increase in property management income due to the expansion of our property management business. The 2005 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted primarily from our contribution of $106.9 million (using the exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties to our then newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. Development profits represent gains from the sale of development projects and land as part of our development for sale program. The increase in development profits was due to increased disposition and contribution volume during 2006. During 2006, we sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $13.3 million. In addition, during 2006, we received approximately $0.4 million in connection with the condemnation of a parcel of land resulting in a loss of $1.0 million, $0.8 million of which was the joint venture partners share. During 2006, we also contributed a total of ten completed development projects into unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. Four projects totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Japan Fund I, L.P, two projects totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet were contributed into AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, three projects totaling approximately 0.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and one land parcel into AMB DFS Fund I, LLC. As a result of these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after tax gain of $94.1 million, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party investors for cash. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $1.9 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. The increase in interest expense, including amortization, was due primarily to increased borrowings on unsecured credit facilities and other debt.

During 2005, we divested ourselves of 142 industrial buildings and one retail center, aggregating approximately 9.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $926.6 million, with a resulting net gain of $113.6 million. Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., for $618.5 million. The multi investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. We 48 received cash and a distribution of an on tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund.

In August 2006, we issued 2,000,000 shares of 6.85% Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. The increase in preferred stock dividends is due to the newly issued shares. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2006, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, repurchased all 840,000 of its outstanding 8.125% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units, all 220,440 of its outstanding 7.75% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units, all 201,139 of its outstanding 7.95% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units and all 729,582 of its outstanding 5.00% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units. As a result, we recognized a decrease in income available to common stockholders of $1.1 million for the original issuance costs, net of discount on repurchase.

The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2004 and 2005, we continued to acquire properties in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial revenues. The increase in private capital income was primarily due to increased asset management fees from additional assets held in co investment joint ventures and incentive distributions for 2005 of $26.4 million for the sale of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, asset 49 management priority distributions from AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., and acquisition fees from AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P.

The 2004 acquisitions consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. The 2005 acquisitions consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2004 and 2005, we continued to acquire properties in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial property operating costs. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate during the year. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international and development expansions and the expansion of satellite offices. Other expenses increased approximately $2.4 million from the prior year due primarily to greater losses on our non qualified deferred compensation plan in 2005 and an increase in certain deal costs. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our co investment joint ventures.

The increase in other income was primarily due to increased bank interest income. The 2005 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted primarily from our contribution of $106.9 million (using exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties to our newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. The 2004 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted from our contribution of $71.5 million in operating properties to our unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC. Development profits represent gains from the sale of development projects and land as part of our development for sale program. The increase in development profits was due to increased volume in 2005. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $1.9 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. During 2004, we sold seven land parcels and six development projects as part of our development for sale program, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet for an aggregate price of $40.4 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $6.5 million. During 2004, we also contributed one completed development project into a newly formed unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $2.0 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash.

Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Alliance Fund I for $618.5 million. The multi investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. We received cash and a distribution of an on tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund. During 2004, we divested ourselves of 21 industrial buildings, two retail centers and one office building, aggregating approximately 3.1 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $200.3 million, with a resulting net gain of $42.0 million.

The increase in preferred stock dividends is due to the newly issued shares. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Balance Sheet Strategy. In general, we use unsecured lines of credit, unsecured notes, preferred stock and common equity (issued by us and or the operating partnership and its subsidiaries) to capitalize our 100% owned assets. Over time, we plan to retire non recourse, secured debt encumbering our 100% owned assets and replace that debt with unsecured notes. In managing our co investment joint ventures, in general, we use non recourse, secured debt to capitalize our co investment joint ventures. We currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for acquisitions, development, expansion and renovation of properties will include: retained earnings and cash flow from operations; 51 private capital from co investment partners; net proceeds from contribution of properties and completed development projects to our co investment joint ventures; borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities; other forms of secured or unsecured financing; proceeds from equity (common and preferred) or debt securities offerings; proceeds from limited partnership unit offerings (including issuances of limited partnership units by our subsidiaries); and net proceeds from divestitures of properties. We currently expect that our principal funding requirements will include: working capital; development, expansion and renovation of properties; acquisitions, including our global expansion; debt service; and dividends and distributions on outstanding common and preferred stock and limited partnership units. Cash flows. As of December 31, 2006, cash provided by operating activities was $335.9 million as compared to $295.8 million for the same period in 2005. This change is primarily due to increases in rental rates, partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses primarily due to additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international and development expansions and increased occupancy costs related to the expansion of regional offices. Cash used for investing activities was $880.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to cash used for investing activities of $60.4 million for the same period in 2005. This change is primarily due to an increase in funds used for property acquisitions and capital expenditures, and a decrease in proceeds from property divestitures (mainly due to the divesture of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., portfolio in 2005), offset by less funds used for additions to interests in unconsolidated joint ventures and an increase in capital distributions received from unconsolidated joint ventures. Cash provided by financing activities was $483.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to cash used in financing activities of $101.9 million for the same period in 2005. This change is due primarily to an increase in borrowings, net of repayments, issuance of common stock upon the exercise of options and issuances of preferred stock, offset by the cost of the repurchase of preferred units for the year ended December 31, 2006. We believe that our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow from operations, borrowings available under our unsecured credit facilities and our ability to access private and public debt and equity capital, are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Resources Property Divestitures. During 2006, we divested ourselves of 39 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 3.5 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $175.3 million, with a resulting net gain of $42.6 million. Development Sales. During 2006, we sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $13.3 million. In addition, during 2006, we received approximately $0.4 million in connection with the condemnation of a parcel of land resulting in a loss of $1.0 million, $0.8 million of which was the joint venture partners share. 52 Development Contributions. During 2006, we contributed a total of nine completed development projects and one land parcel into unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. Four projects totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Japan Fund I, L.P, two projects totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet were contributed into AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and three projects totaling approximately 0.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. In addition, one land parcel was contributed into AMB DFS Fund I, LLC. As a result of these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after tax gain of $94.1 million, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party investors for cash. These gains are included in development profits, net of taxes, in the statement of operations. Properties Held for Contribution. As of December 31, 2006, we held for contribution to co investment joint ventures, nine industrial projects with an aggregate net book value of $154.0 million, which, when contributed to a joint venture, will reduce our current ownership interest from approximately 100% to an expected range of 15 50%. Properties Held for Divestiture. As of December 31, 2006, we held for divestiture four industrial projects, which are not in our core markets, do not meet our current strategic objectives or which we have included as part of our development for sale program. The divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. As of December 31, 2006, the net carrying value of the properties held for divestiture was $20.9 million. Expected net sales proceeds exceed the net carrying value of the properties. Co investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund certain acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. We generally consolidate these joint ventures for financial reporting purposes because they are not variable interest entities and because we are the sole managing general partner and control all major operating decisions. However, in certain cases, our co investment joint ventures are unconsolidated because we do not control all major operating decisions and the general partners do not have significant rights under EITF 04 5. Third party equity interests in the joint ventures are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2006, we owned approximately 64.3 million square feet of our properties (51.6% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so.

(6) The planned gross capitalization and investment capacity of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. as an open end fund, is not limited. The planned gross capitalization represents the gross book value of real estate assets as of the most recent quarter end. (7) AMB DFS Fund I, LLC is a co investment partnership formed in 2006 with a subsidiary of GE Real Estate to build and sell properties. We also have a 0.1% unconsolidated equity interest (with an approximate 33% economic interest) in AMB Pier One, LLC, a joint venture related to the 2000 redevelopment of the pier which houses our office space in the San Francisco Bay Area. The investment is not consolidated because we do not exercise control over major operating decisions such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, investment activity and changes in financing. We have an option to purchase the remaining equity interest beginning January 1, 2007 and expiring December 31, 2009, based on the fair market value as stipulated in the joint venture agreement. As of December 31, 2006, we also had an approximate 39.0% unconsolidated equity interest in G.Accion, a Mexican real estate company. G.Accion provides management and development services for industrial, retail, residential and office properties in Mexico. In addition, as of December 31, 2006, one of our subsidiaries also had an approximate 5% interest in IAT Air Cargo Facilities Income Fund (IAT), a Canadian income trust specializing in aviation related real estate at Canadas leading international airports. This equity investment is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Common and Preferred Equity.

On September 24, 2004, AMB Property II, L.P., a partnership in which Texas AMB I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and our indirect subsidiary, owns an approximate 8.0% general partnership interest and the operating partnership owns an approximate 92% common limited partnership interest, issued 729,582 5.00% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units at a price of $50.00 per unit. The series N preferred units were issued to Robert Pattillo Properties, Inc. in exchange for the contribution to AMB Property II, L.P of certain parcels of land that are located in multiple markets.

We, in turn, used those proceeds to redeem all 3,995,800 of our 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for $100.2 million, including all accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, to the redemption date. In December 2005, our board of directors approved a new two year common stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of our common stock. We did not repurchase or retire any shares of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2006. Debt. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, we presently intend to operate with an our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio of approximately 45% or less. As of December 31, 2006, our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio was 34.2%. (See footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratios table below for our definitions of our share of total market capitalization, market equity and our share of total debt.) However, we typically finance our co investment joint ventures with secured debt at a loan to value ratio of 50 65% per our joint venture agreements. Additionally, we currently intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these policies, however, our organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our management could alter or eliminate these policies without stockholder approval or circumstances could arise that could render us unable to comply with these policies. As of December 31, 2006, the aggregate principal amount of our secured debt was $1.4 billion, excluding unamortized debt premiums of $6.3 million. Of the $1.4 billion of secured debt, $1.0 billion is secured by properties in our joint ventures. The secured debt is generally non recourse and bears interest at rates varying from 2.9% to 10.4% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 6.2%) and final maturity dates ranging from February 2007 to January 2025. As of December 31, 2006, $1.0 billion of the secured debt obligations bear interest at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 6.1%, while the remaining $386.1 million bear interest at variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 4.7%). As of December 31, 2006, the operating partnership had outstanding an aggregate of $1.1 billion in unsecured senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 6.2% and had a weighted average term of 4.8 years. These unsecured senior debt securities include $300.0 million in notes issued in June 1998, $225.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2000 medium term note program, $275.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2002 medium term note program, $175.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2006 medium term note program and approximately $112.5 million of 5.094% Notes Due 2015, which were issued to Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America on July 11, 2005 in a private placement, in exchange for the cancellation of $100.0 million of notes that were issued in June 1998 resulting in a discount of approximately $12.5 million. The unsecured senior debt securities are subject to various covenants. Also included is a $25.0 million promissory note which matures in January 2007. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to its senior debt securities. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then our cash flow may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Credit Facilities. On June 1, 2006, the operating partnership entered into a third amended and restated $550.0 million unsecured revolving credit agreement that replaced its then existing $500.0 million credit facility, which was to mature on June 1, 2007. We are a guarantor of the operating partnerships obligations under the credit facility. The line, which matures on June 1, 2010, carries a one year extension option and can be increased to up to 56 $700.0 million upon certain conditions. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the operating partnerships long term debt rating, which was 42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2006, with an annual facility fee of 15 basis points. The four year credit facility includes a multi currency component, under which up to $550.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Euros, Yen or British Pounds Sterling. The operating partnership uses its unsecured credit facility principally for acquisitions, funding development activity and general working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on the credit facility was $303.7 million and the remaining amount available was $234.6 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $11.7 million. The outstanding balance included borrowings denominated in Euros, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately $303.7 million U.S. dollars. On June 23, 2006, AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating partnership and as the initial borrower, entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement for a 45.0 billion Yen unsecured revolving credit facility, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately $377.9 million U.S. dollars. This replaced the 35.0 billion Yen unsecured revolving credit facility executed on June 29, 2004, as previously amended, which using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately $293.9 million U.S. dollars. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K. under the credit facility, as well as the obligations of any other entity in which the operating partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the credit agreement. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and for other real estate purposes in Japan, China and South Korea. Generally, borrowers under the credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the credit facility with certain real estate assets or equity in entities holding such real estate assets. The credit facility matures in June 2010 and has a one year extension option. The credit facility can be increased to up to 55.0 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately $461.9 million U.S. dollars. The extension option is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding commitments under the facility at that time. The rate on the borrowings is generally TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt and was 42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2006. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, payable in quarterly amounts, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt, and was 15 basis points of the outstanding commitments under the facility as of December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, was $320.9 million in U.S. dollars. On June 13, 2006, the operating partnership and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries entered into a fourth amended and restated credit agreement for a $250.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which replaced the third amended and restated credit agreement for a $250.0 million unsecured credit facility. On February 16, 2006, the third amended and restated credit agreement replaced the then existing $100.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that was to mature in June 2008. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations for such subsidiaries and other entities controlled by us or the operating partnership that are selected by the operating partnership from time to time to be borrowers under and pursuant to the credit facility. The four year credit facility includes a multi currency component under which up to $250.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Singapore dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros. The line, which matures in February 2010 and carries a one year extension option, can be increased to up to $350.0 million upon certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding commitments. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships senior unsecured long term debt, which was 60 basis points as of December 31, 2006, with an annual facility fee based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships senior unsecured long term debt. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and general working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on this facility was approximately $227.4 million. The credit agreement contains affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios by the operating partnership, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. 57 Mortgages Receivable. Through a wholly owned subsidiary, we hold a mortgage loan receivable on AMB Pier One, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture. The note bears interest at 13.0% and matures in May 2026. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on the note was $12.7 million. We also hold a loan receivable on G. Accion, an unconsolidated joint venture totaling $6.1 million with an interest rate of 10.0%. The loan matures in March 2010.

In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of our debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their joint ventures. Our share of total debt is not intended to reflect our actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures.

As of December 31, 2006, we had $21.1 million in restricted cash. Our board of directors declared a regular cash dividend for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 of $0.46 per share of common stock, and the operating partnership announced its intention to pay a regular cash distribution for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 of $0.46 per common unit. The dividends and distributions were payable on January 5, 2007 to stockholders and unitholders of record on December 22, 2006. The series L, M, O and P preferred stock dividends were payable on January 16, 2007 to stockholders of record on January 5, 2007. The series J and K preferred unit quarterly distributions were payable on January 16, 2007. The series D and I preferred unit quarterly distributions were paid on December 25, 2006. The following table sets forth the dividends and distributions paid or payable per share or unit for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004: Paying Entity Security 2006 2005 2004 AMB Property Corporation Common stock $ 1.84 $ 1.76 $ 1.70 AMB Property Corporation Series L preferred stock $ 1.63 $ 1.63 $ 1.63 AMB Property Corporation Series M preferred stock $ 1.69 $ 1.69 $ 1.69 AMB Property Corporation Series O preferred stock $ 1.75 $ 0.09 n/a AMB Property Corporation Series P preferred stock $ 0.60 n/a n/a Operating Partnership Common limited partnership units $ 1.84 $ 1.76 $ 1.70 Operating Partnership Series J preferred units $ 3.98 $ 3.98 $ 3.98 Operating Partnership Series K preferred units $ 3.98 $ 3.98 $ 3.98 AMB Property II, L.P.

(3) In March 2006, AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased all of its outstanding series H preferred units. (4) The holder of the series N preferred units exercised its put option in January 2006 and sold all of its series N preferred units to the operating partnership and AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased all of such units from the operating partnership. The anticipated size of our distributions, using only cash from operations, will not allow us to retire all of our debt as it comes due. Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Commitments Development Starts. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we initiated 30 new industrial development projects in North America, Europe and Asia with a total expected investment of $914.3 million, aggregating approximately 10.4 million square feet. During 2005, we initiated 30 new industrial development projects in North America, Europe and Asia with a total expected investment of $522.4 million, aggregating approximately 7.0 million square feet. 60 Development Pipeline. As of December 31, 2006, we had 45 industrial projects in our development pipeline, which will total approximately 13.7 million square feet, and will have an aggregate estimated investment of $1.3 billion upon completion. We have an additional ten development projects available for sale or contribution totaling approximately 3.0 million square feet, with an aggregate estimated investment of $199.2 million. One of these ten projects totaling $13.0 million and approximately 0.2 million square feet is held in an unconsolidated joint venture. As of December 31, 2006, we and our joint venture partners had funded an aggregate of $814.5 million and needed to fund an estimated additional $481.0 million in order to complete our development pipeline which includes projects expected to be completed through the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we acquired 835 acres of land for industrial warehouse development in North America and Asia for approximately $293.2 million. Acquisitions. During 2006, we acquired 106 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 9.8 million square feet for a total expected investment of $834.2 million (includes acquisition costs of $814.1 million and estimated acquisition capital of $20.1 million), of which we acquired 70 buildings through one of our unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. We generally fund our acquisitions through private capital contributions, borrowings under our credit facilities, cash, debt issuances and net proceeds from property divestitures. Lease Commitments. We have entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily on tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms from one to 55 years. These buildings and improvements are amortized ratably over the lesser of the terms of the related leases or 40 years. Future minimum rental payments required under non cancelable operating leases in effect as of December 31, 2006 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2007 $ 21,636 2008 22,186 2009 21,506 2010 20,667 2011 20,668 Thereafter 272,483 Total $ 379,146 Co investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. As of December 31, 2006, we had investments in co investment joint ventures with a gross book value of $1.9 billion, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, and net equity investments in four unconsolidated co investment joint ventures of $236.0 million and a gross book value of $2.5 billion. As of December 31, 2006, we may make additional capital contributions to current and planned co investment joint ventures of up to $168.2 million (using the exchange rates at December 31, 2006) pursuant to the terms of the joint venture agreements. From time to time, we may raise additional equity commitments for AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open ended unconsolidated co investment joint venture formed in 2004 with institutional investors, which invests through a private real estate investment trust. This would increase our obligation to make additional capital commitments. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of this fund, we are obligated to contribute 20% of the total equity commitments to the fund until such time our total equity commitment is greater than $150.0 million, at which time, our obligation is reduced to 10% of the total equity commitments. We expect to fund these contributions with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances or net proceeds from property divestitures, which could adversely effect our cash flow. Captive Insurance Company. In December 2001, we formed a wholly owned captive insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., (Arcata), which provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the deductible under our third party policies. The captive insurance company is one element of our overall risk management program. We capitalized Arcata in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata established annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss experience of our properties. Annually, 61 we engage an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims, related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata may be adjusted based on this estimate. Like premiums paid to third party insurance companies, premiums paid to Arcata may be reimbursed by customers pursuant to specific lease terms. Through this structure, we believe that we have more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market. Potential Contingent and Unknown Liabilities. Contingent and unknown liabilities may include the following: liabilities for environmental conditions; claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to our formation or acquisition transactions that had not been asserted prior to our formation or acquisition transactions; accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; tax liabilities; and claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these entities. Overview of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our debt, interest and lease payments due by period as of December 31, 2006 (dollars in thousands): Less than More than Contractual Obligations 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Total Debt $ 213,869 $ 592,085 $ 1,593,035 $ 1,042,699 $ 3,441,688 Debt interest payments 13,861 38,126 74,416 58,775 185,178 Operating lease commitments 21,636 43,692 41,335 272,483 379,146 Construction commitments 31,713 57,042 88,755 Total $ 281,079 $ 730,945 $ 1,708,786 $ 1,373,957 $ 4,094,767 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Standby Letters of Credit. As of December 31, 2006, we had provided approximately $22.1 million in letters of credit, of which $11.7 million was provided under the operating partnerships $550.0 million unsecured credit facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other commitments. Guarantees. Other than parent guarantees associated with the unsecured debt, as of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding guarantees in the aggregate amount of $48.2 million in connection with certain acquisitions. As of December 31, 2006, we guaranteed $26.8 million and $83.2 million on outstanding loans on two of our consolidated joint ventures and two of our unconsolidated joint ventures, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2006, we guaranteed $87.3 million on outstanding property debt related to one of our unconsolidated joint ventures. Performance and Surety Bonds. As of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $11.4 million. These bonds were issued in connection with certain of our development projects and were posted to guarantee certain tax obligations and the construction of certain real property improvements and infrastructure, such as grading, sewers and streets. Performance and surety bonds are commonly required by public agencies from real estate developers. Performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the taxes due or the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. Promoted Interests and Other Contractual Obligations. Upon the achievement of certain return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, we may be obligated to make payments to certain of our joint venture partners 62 pursuant to the terms and provisions of their contractual agreements with us. From time to time in the normal course of our business, we enter into various contracts with third parties that may obligate us to make payments, pay promotes, or perform other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. SUPPLEMENTAL EARNINGS MEASURES FFO. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider funds from operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. FFO is defined as net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, less gains (or losses) from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estate related depreciation, and adjustments to derive our pro rata share of FFO of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. Further, we do not adjust FFO to eliminate the effects of non recurring charges. We believe that FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. We believe that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. The following table reflects the calculation of FFO reconciled from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Net income(1) $ 224,072 $ 257,807 $ 125,471 $ 129,128 $ 121,119 Gains from dispositions of real estate, net of minority interests(2) (42,635 ) (132,652 ) (47,224 ) (50,325 ) (19,383 ) Real estate, related depreciation and amortization: Total depreciation and amortization 177,824 161,732 136,610 111,879 103,550 Discontinued operations depreciation 2,153 18,572 30,740 30,458 32,953 Non real estate depreciation (4,546 ) (3,388 ) (871 ) (720 ) (712 ) Ground lease amortization (2,301 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from consolidated joint ventures: Joint venture partners minority interests (Net income) 37,975 36,401 29,360 22,276 16,529 63 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Net income) 2,805 3,411 2,384 2,117 3,303 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Development profits) 4,948 2,262 435 344 57 Discontinued operations minority interests (Net income) 31 8,769 13,964 15,214 16,597 FFO attributable to minority interests (82,861 ) (100,275 ) (80,192 ) (65,603 ) (52,051 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures: Our share of net income (23,240 ) (10,770 ) (3,781 ) (5,445 ) (5,674 ) Our share of FFO 16,038 14,441 7,549 9,755 9,291 Our share of development profits, net of taxes 5,441 Preferred stock dividends (13,582 ) (7,388 ) (7,131 ) (6,999 ) (8,496 ) Preferred stock and unit redemption discount (issuance costs) (1,070 ) (5,413 ) 412 Funds from operations $ 297,912 $ 254,363 $ 207,314 $ 186,666 $ 215,194 Basic FFO per common share and unit $ 3.24 $ 2.87 $ 2.39 $ 2.17 $ 2.44 Diluted FFO per common share and unit $ 3.12 $ 2.75 $ 2.30 $ 2.13 $ 2.40 Weighted average common shares and units: Basic 92,047,678 88,684,262 86,885,250 85,859,899 88,204,208 Diluted 95,444,072 92,508,725 90,120,250 87,616,365 89,689,310 (1) Includes gains from undepreciated land sales of $5.6 million, $25.0 million, $3.7 million and $1.2 million for 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. (2) The information for 2005 includes accumulated depreciation re capture of approximately $1.1 million associated with the sale of the Interstate Crossdock redevelopment project. SS NOI. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider same store net operating income, or SS NOI, to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. For properties that are considered part of the same store pool, see Part I, Item 2: Properties Industrial Properties Owned and Managed Market Operating Statistics, Note 6, and Owned and Managed Operating and Leasing Statistics Owned and Managed Same Store Operating Statistics, Note 2. In deriving SS NOI, we define NOI as rental revenues (as calculated in accordance with GAAP), including reimbursements, less straight line rents, property operating expenses and real estate taxes. We exclude straight line rents in calculating SS NOI because we believe it provides a better measure of actual cash basis rental growth for a year over year comparison. In addition, we believe that SS NOI helps the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate as compared to other companies. While SS NOI is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. SS NOI also does not reflect general and administrative expense, interest expenses, depreciation and amortization costs, capital expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development and construction activities that could materially impact our results from operations. Further, our computation of SS NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating SS NOI. 64 The following table reconciles SS NOI from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Net income $ 224,072 $ 257,807 $ 125,471 Private capital income (46,102 ) (43,942 ) (12,895 ) Depreciation and amortization 177,824 161,732 136,610 Impairment losses 6,312 General and administrative 104,262 71,564 57,181 Other expenses 2,620 5,038 2,554 Fund costs 2,091 1,482 1,741 Total other income and expenses 26,178 57,044 119,727 Total minority interests share of income 62,855 74,777 52,863 Total discontinued operations (51,949 ) (127,498 ) (63,888 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (193 ) Net Operating Income (NOI) 507,970 458,004 419,364 Less non same store NOI (116,030 ) (70,782 ) (19,990 ) Less non cash adjustments(1) (8,426 ) (9,861 ) (8,249 ) Cash basis same store NOI $ 383,514 $ 377,361 $ 391,125 (1) Non cash adjustments include straight line rents and amortization of lease intangibles for the same store pool only. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices, interest rates and international exchange rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimize the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings and our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2006, we had three outstanding interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $38.1 million (in U.S. dollars). See Financial Instruments below. The table below summarizes the market risks associated with our fixed and variable rate debt outstanding before net unamortized debt discounts of $4.3 million as of December 31, 2006 (dollars in thousands): 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Fixed rate debt(1) $ 155,384 $ 368,141 $ 152,151 $ 430,676 $ 288,835 $ 768,320 $ 2,163,507 Average interest rate 6.7 % 7.1 % 4.7 % 6.4 % 6.8 % 5.9 % 6.3 % Variable rate debt(2) $ 58,485 $ 22,604 $ 49,189 $ 854,543 $ 18,981 $ 274,379 $ 1,278,181 Average interest rate 5.9 % 6.6 % 6.8 % 3.1 % 3.8 % 4.9 % 3.8 % Interest Payments $ 13,861 $ 27,630 $ 10,496 $ 54,054 $ 20,362 $ 58,775 $ 185,178 (1) Represents 62.9% of all outstanding debt. (2) Represents 37.1% of all outstanding debt. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased or decreased by 10%, then the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would be $4.9 million (net of swaps) annually. As of December 31, 65 2006, the book value and the estimated fair value of our total consolidated debt (both secured and unsecured) was $3.4 and $3.5 billion, respectively, based on our estimate of current market interest rates. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, variable rate debt comprised 37.1% and 24.5%, respectively, of all our outstanding debt. Variable rate debt was $1.3 billion and $831.7 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. The increase is primarily due to higher outstanding balances on our credit facilities. This increase in our outstanding variable rate debt increases our risk associated with unfavorable interest rate fluctuations. Financial Instruments. We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income or income. For revenues or expenses denominated in non functional currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments in effect at December 31, 2006 were three interest rate swaps hedging cash flows of our variable rate borrowings based on U.S. Libor (USD) and Euribor (Europe). The following table summarizes our financial instruments as of December 31, 2006 (in thousands): Maturity Dates Related Derivatives (in thousands) December 8, 2008 June 8, 2010 November 1, 2014 Notional Amount Fair Value Interest Rate Swaps: Plain Interest Rate Swap, Europe Notional Amount (U.S. dollars) $ 9,655 $ 9,655 Receive Floating(%) 3MEURIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 3.72 % Fair Market Value $ 54 Plain Interest Rate Swap, USD Notional Amount (U.S. dollars) $ 25,000 25,000 Receive Floating(%) 3MLIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 5.17 % Fair Market Value (130 ) Plain Interest Rate Swap, Europe Notional Amount (U.S. dollars) $ 3,471 3,471 Receive Floating(%) 3MEURIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 4.26 % Fair Market Value (45 ) Total $ 38,126 $ (121 ) International Operations. Our exposure to market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries operating in the United States and Mexico. The functional currency for our subsidiaries operating outside the United States is generally the local currency of the country in which the entity is located, mitigating the effect of foreign exchange gains and losses. Our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. We translate income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. The losses resulting from the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity and totaled $0.2 million for year ended December 31, 2006. Our international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. In these instances, non monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2006, losses from remeasurement and the sale of four foreign exchange agreements included in our results of operations totaled $0.8 million. We also record gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated. 66 
 
Item 7: Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources. (5) Effective October 1, 2006, we deconsolidated AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. on a prospective basis, due to the re evaluation of the accounting for our investment in the fund in light of changes to the partnership agreement regarding the general partners rights effective October 1, 2006. As a result, the financial measures for the years 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002, included in our operating data, other data and balance sheet data above are not comparable. 39 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations GENERAL You should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements. We commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company effective with the completion of our initial public offering on November 26, 1997, and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, with our initial tax return for the year ended December 31, 1997. AMB Property Corporation and AMB Property, L.P. were formed shortly before the consummation of our initial public offering. Managements Overview The primary source of our revenue and earnings is rent received from customers under long term (generally three to ten years) operating leases at our properties, including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs, and from partnership distributions and fees from our private capital business. We also produce earnings from the disposition of operating assets that no longer fit our strategy, from the disposition of projects in our development for sale program and from the contributions of properties to our co investment joint ventures. Our long term growth is driven by our ability to maintain and increase occupancy rates or increase rental rates at our properties, and by our ability to continue to acquire and develop new properties. National industrial markets continued to improve during 2006 when compared with market conditions in 2005. According to Torto Wheaton Research, availability dropped 10 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2006 to 9.4%, and availability for the year dropped 50 basis points. We believe the strongest industrial markets in the U.S. are the coastal gateway markets tied to global trade, including Los Angeles, our largest market, Miami, the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle, and to a lesser degree Northern New Jersey/New York (with the exception of the Exit 8A submarket). While we believe that the broader Chicago market is showing signs of stabilization, certain submarkets, like the OHare submarket, are relatively strong. We believe Dallas continues to recover, and Atlanta continues to suffer from a large increase in supply. We believe the operating environment in our U.S. on tarmac business remains good with improving cargo volumes and essentially no new supply. Investor demand for industrial property (as supported by our observation of strong national sales volumes and declining acquisition capitalization rates) has remained consistently strong over the past several years. We believe we capitalized on this demand for industrial property by accelerating the repositioning of our portfolio, through the disposition of non core properties, which was effectively completed in 2006 with our exit from the Charlotte and Memphis markets. We plan to continue selling selected assets on an opportunistic basis or that no longer fit our strategic investment objectives, but we believe we have substantially achieved our repositioning goals. Occupancy levels in our portfolio continue to outperform the national industrial market, as determined by Torto Wheaton Research, by pricing lease renewals and new leases with sensitivity to local market conditions. During the prior periods of decreasing or stabilizing rental rates, we strove to sign leases with shorter terms to prevent locking in lower rent levels for long periods and to be prepared to sign new, longer term leases during periods of growing rental rates. When we sign leases of shorter duration, we attempt to limit overall leasing costs and capital expenditures by offering different grades of tenant improvement packages, appropriate to the lease term. In our stronger markets, we are increasing rents as opposed to occupancy. 40 The table below summarizes key operating and leasing statistics for our owned and managed operating properties for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: U.S. Hub and Total Other Total/Weighted Owned and Managed Property Data(1) Gateway Markets(2) Markets(3) Average For the year ended December 31, 2006: % of total rentable square feet 72.0 % 28.0 % 100.0 % Occupancy percentage at year end 96.5 % 95.0 % 96.1 % Same space square footage leased 13,016,726 3,186,854 16,203,580 Rent (decreases) increases on renewals and rollovers(4) (0.4 )% 1.6 % (0.1 )% For the year ended December 31, 2005:(5) % of total rentable square feet 74.9 % 25.1 % 100.0 % Occupancy percentage at year end 96.2 % 94.6 % 95.8 % Same space square footage leased 11,032,482 2,574,944 13,607,426 Rent decreases on renewals and rollovers (10.8 )% (4.3 )% (9.7 )% (1) Schedule includes owned and managed operating properties which we define as properties in which we have at least a 10% ownership interest, for which we are the property or asset manager, and which we intend to hold for the long term. (2) Our U.S. hub and gateway markets include on tarmac and Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, Northern New Jersey/New York City, San Francisco Bay Area, and Seattle. (3) Our total markets include other U.S. target markets, other non target markets, and non U.S. target markets. (4) On a consolidated basis, rent increases on renewals and rollovers were 4.4% and 3.0%, respectively, for U.S. hub and gateway markets and total other markets. (5) The information for 2005 is presented on a consolidated basis while the information for 2006 is presented on an owned and managed basis. Management believes that the difference in comparability between the information for 2006 and 2005 is not significant. At December 31, 2006, our operating portfolios occupancy rate was 96.1%, on an owned and managed basis (97.0% on a consolidated basis), an increase from both the prior quarter and December 31, 2005. Rental rates on lease renewals and rollovers in our portfolio increased 4.1% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and decreased 0.1% for the full year. Cash basis same store net operating income (rental revenues less property operating expenses and real estate taxes for properties included in the same store pool, which is set annually and excludes properties purchased or developments stabilized after December 31, 2004) grew by 1.3% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and 2.6% for the full year 2006, on an owned and managed basis. Excluding lease termination fees, same store net operating income grew 3.0% and 3.2% in the quarter and for the full year (decreased 0.5% and increased 1.6%, respectively, on a consolidated basis), respectively, on an owned and managed basis. See Part II, Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Supplemental Earnings Measures for a discussion of same store net operating income and a reconciliation of same store net operating income and net income. We currently expect that same store growth in our operating portfolio, excluding lease termination fees, will be about 3% to 4% for 2007, on an owned and managed basis. Market rents continue to rebound from their lows and in many of our hub and gateway markets are back to or above their prior peak levels of 2001. We believe that industrial market rents in the San Francisco Bay Area are improving. While market rents in the San Francisco Bay Area were up 10% to 15% in 2006, rents still have not yet fully recovered to normal levels. Rents on lease renewals and rollovers in the San Francisco Bay Area declined 21.0% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and 13.2% for the full year 2006, on an owned and managed basis. Without the effect of the San Francisco Bay Area, rents on renewals and rollovers for the full year 2006 would have been 2.0%, on an owned and managed basis, which we believe reflects the generally positive trends in U.S. industrial space availability. We expect development to be a significant driver of our earnings growth as we expand our land and development pipeline, and contribute completed development projects into our co investment program and recognize development profits. We believe that development, renovation and expansion of well located, high 41 quality industrial properties should generally continue to provide us with attractive investment opportunities at a higher rate of return than we may obtain from the purchase of existing properties. We believe that our development opportunities in Mexico, Japan and China are particularly attractive given the current lack of supply of modern industrial distribution facilities in the major metropolitan markets of these countries. Prior to our global expansion, our development pipeline was $106.8 million at the end of 2002. As a result of our global expansion and increased development capabilities, we have increased our development pipeline to approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2006. In addition to our committed development pipeline, we hold a total of 1,735 acres for future development or sale, of which 92% is in North America. We believe these 1,735 acres of land could support approximately 30.5 million square feet of future development. Going forward, we believe that our co investment program with private capital investors will continue to serve as a significant source of revenues and capital for new investments. Through these co investment joint ventures, we typically earn acquisition fees, asset management fees and priority distributions, as well as promoted interests and incentive distributions based on the performance of the co investment joint ventures; however, we cannot assure you that we will continue to do so. Through contribution of development properties to our co investment joint ventures, we expect to recognize value creation from our development pipeline. As of December 31, 2006, we owned approximately 64.3 million square feet of our properties (51.6% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these co investment joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. By the end of 2010, we expect to have approximately 50% of our owned and managed operating portfolio invested in non U.S. markets (based on owned and managed annualized base rent). As of December 31, 2006, our non U.S. operating properties comprised 14.1% of our owned and managed operating portfolio (based on annualized base rent) and 7.4% of our consolidated operating portfolio (based on annualized base rent). Our North American target countries outside of the United States currently comprise Canada and Mexico. Our European target countries currently comprise Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. Our Asian target countries currently comprise China, India, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. We expect to add additional target countries outside the United States in the future. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust, we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income. As a result, we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our on going operations to the same extent that other corporations that are not real estate investment trusts can. We must continue to raise capital in both the debt and equity markets to fund our working capital needs, acquisitions and developments. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for a complete discussion of the sources of our capital. Summary of Key Transactions in 2006 During the year ended December 31, 2006, we completed the following significant capital deployment and other transactions: Acquired, on an owned and managed basis, 106 buildings in North America and Europe, aggregating approximately 9.8 million square feet, for $834.2 million; Committed to 30 development projects in North America, Asia and Europe totaling 10.4 million square feet with an estimated total investment of approximately $914.3 million; Acquired 835 acres of land for development in North America and Asia for approximately $293.2 million; Sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million; Contributed four completed development projects for $486.2 million to AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., two completed development projects for $56.4 million to AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, three completed development projects for $64.8 million to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. and one land parcel for $77.5 million to AMB DFS Fund I, LLC, all of which entities are unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. As a result of these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after tax gain of $94.1 million, 42 representing the portion of our interest in the contributed properties acquired by the third party co investors for cash; Divested ourselves of 73 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 6.4 million square feet, for an aggregate price of approximately $335.1 million, including 34 industrial buildings that were sold by two of our unconsolidated joint ventures; and Acquired the 50% interest in AMB BlackPine that we did not previously own; Received an incentive distribution of $19.8 million from AMB Partners II, L.P.; and Deconsolidated AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., on a prospective basis, as of October 1, 2006. See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our acquisition, development and disposition activity. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we completed the following significant capital markets and other financing transactions: Obtained long term secured debt financings for our co investment joint ventures of $141.6 million with a weighted average interest rate of 6.1%; Assumed $29.9 million of debt for our co investment joint ventures at a weighted average interest rate of 6.0%; Obtained $177.7 million of new debt (using exchange rates in effect at applicable quarter end dates) with a weighted average interest rate of 4.2% for international acquisitions; Obtained a $65.0 million floating rate unsecured revolving credit facility for one of our co investment joint ventures; Entered into a third amended and restated credit agreement for a $250.0 million unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility which replaced an existing $100.0 million unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility; Repurchased all of AMB Property II, L.P.s outstanding 7.75% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units for an aggregate cost of $10.9 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions; Repurchased all of AMB Property II, L.P.s outstanding 7.95% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units for an aggregate cost of $10.0 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions; Repurchased all of AMB Property II, L.P.s outstanding 8.125% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units for an aggregate cost of $42.8 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions; Purchased all of AMB Property II, L.P.s outstanding 5.00% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units for an aggregate cost of $36.6 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions; Completed the early renewal and increase of our senior unsecured revolving line of credit in the amount of $550.0 million, an increase of $50.0 million; Entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement for a 45.0 billion Yen (approximately $377.9 million U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at December 31, 2006) unsecured revolving credit facility that replaced an existing 35.0 billion Yen (approximately $293.9 million U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at December 31, 2006) unsecured revolving credit facility; Raised approximately $48.1 million in net proceeds from the issuance and sale of $50.0 million of our 6.85% Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock; Issued $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior unsecured notes under the operating partnerships 2006 medium term note program which mature on August 15, 2013 and bear interest at a rate of 5.90% per annum; and 43 Entered into a 228.0 million Euro (approximately $300.9 million U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at December 31, 2006) revolving credit facility agreement, which provides for loans on a secured and unsecured basis. See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 6, 9 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our capital markets transactions. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Investments in Real Estate. Investments in real estate and leasehold interests are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. We also regularly review the impact of above or below market leases, in place leases and lease origination costs for all new acquisitions, and record an intangible asset or liability accordingly. Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a property by property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable. Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying value of the property. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future economics and market conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying value of our long lived assets could occur in the future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings. As a result of leasing activity and the economic environment, we re evaluated the carrying value of our investments and recorded impairment charges of $6.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 on certain of our investments. Revenue Recognition. We record rental revenue from operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts, security deposits and letters of credit, then we may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our customers on an on going basis by reviewing their financial condition periodically as appropriate. Each period we review our outstanding accounts receivable, including straight line rents, for doubtful accounts and provide allowances as needed. We also record lease termination fees when a customer has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us. If a customer remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement, the applicable termination fees are deferred and recognized over the term of such customers occupancy. Property Dispositions. We report real estate dispositions in three separate categories on our consolidated statements of operations. First, when we divest a portion of our interests in real estate entities or properties, gains from the sale represent the interests acquired by third party investors for cash and are included in gains from disposition of real estate interests in the statement of operations. Second, we dispose of value added conversion projects and build to suit and speculative development projects for which we have not generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable, and are included in development profits, net of taxes, in the statement of operations. Lastly, 44 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, requires us to separately report as discontinued operations the historical operating results attributable to operating properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the properties, which is included in gains from dispositions of real estate, net of minority interests, in the statement of operations. The consolidated statements of operations for prior periods are also adjusted to conform with this classification. There is no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial position, net income or cash flows. In all cases, gains and losses are recognized using the full accrual method of accounting. Gains relating to transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met. Joint Ventures. We hold interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We determine consolidation based on standards set forth in EITF 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights or FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN 46. Based on the guidance set forth in EITF 04 5, we consolidate certain joint venture investments because we exercise significant control over major operating decisions, such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, asset management, investment activity and changes in financing. For joint ventures that are variable interest entities as defined under FIN 46 where we are not the primary beneficiaries, we do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. For joint ventures under EITF 04 5, where we do not exercise significant control over major operating and management decisions, but where we exercise significant influence, we use the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. Real Estate Investment Trust. As a real estate investment trust, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes in the U.S. if we meet minimum distribution, income, asset and shareholder tests. However, some of our subsidiaries may be subject to federal and state taxes. In addition, foreign entities may also be subject to the taxes of the host country. An income tax allocation is required to be estimated on our taxable income arising from our taxable real estate investment trust subsidiaries and international entities. A deferred tax component could arise based upon the differences in GAAP versus tax income for items such as depreciation and gain recognition. However, we believe deferred tax is an immaterial component of our consolidated balance sheet. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Effective October 1, 2006, we deconsolidated AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., on a prospective basis, due to the re evaluation of the accounting for our investment in the fund in light of changes to the partnership agreement regarding the general partners rights effective October 1, 2006. As a result, our results of operations presented below are not comparable between years presented. The analysis below includes changes attributable to same store growth, acquisitions, development activity and divestitures. Same store properties are those that we owned during both the current and prior year reporting periods, excluding development properties stabilized after December 31, 2004 (generally defined as properties that are 90% leased or properties for which we have held a certificate of occupancy or where building has been substantially complete for at least 12 months). As of December 31, 2006, same store industrial properties consisted of properties aggregating approximately 71.2 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2006 consisted of 73 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. During 2006, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 50 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.5 million square feet. In 2005, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 150 buildings, aggregating approximately 10.6 million square feet. Our future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition of additional properties and dispositions. Our future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical results. 45 For the Years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (dollars in millions) Revenues 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Rental revenues U.S. industrial: Same store $ 514.9 $ 501.5 $ 13.4 2.7 % 2006 acquisitions 4.4 4.4 % 2005 acquisitions 19.4 11.4 8.0 70.2 % Development 8.3 7.4 0.9 12.2 % Other industrial 74.3 63.6 10.7 16.8 % Non U.S. industrial 62.5 33.1 29.4 88.8 % Total rental revenues 683.8 617.0 66.8 10.8 % Private capital income 46.1 43.9 2.2 5.0 % Total revenues $ 729.9 $ 660.9 $ 69.0 10.4 % U.S. industrial same store revenues increased $13.4 million from the prior year despite the decrease of $12.8 million in same store revenues due to the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., effective October 1, 2006, attributable primarily to improved occupancy and increased rental rates in various markets. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2006 consisted of 73 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. Non U.S. industrial revenues increased approximately $29.4 million from the prior year due primarily to the stabilization of three properties in Japan and the continued acquisition of properties in France, Germany and Mexico. The increase in private capital income was primarily due to increased asset management and acquisition fees from additional assets held in co investment joint ventures, which were partially offset by a decrease in incentive distributions of approximately $3.9 million. During 2006, we received 46 incentive distributions of $22.5 million, of which $19.8 million was from AMB Partners II, L.P., as compared to incentive distribution of $26.4 million for the sale of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., during 2005.

The 2005 acquisitions consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. The 2006 acquisitions consisted of 73 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. Non U.S. industrial revenues increased approximately $6.0 million from the prior year due primarily to the stabilization of three properties in Japan and the continued acquisition of properties in France, Germany and Mexico. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The 2006 impairment loss was taken on several non core assets as a result of leasing activities and changes in the economic environment and the holding period of certain assets. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased stock based compensation expense as a result of higher values assigned to option and stock awards and executive departures, additional staffing and expenses for our international expansion, and the acquisition of AMB Blackpine. Other expenses decreased approximately $2.4 million from the prior year due primarily to a decrease in losses associated with our deferred compensation plan and a decrease in certain deal costs. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our co investment joint ventures. 47 Other Income and (Expenses) 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures, net $ 23.2 $ 10.8 $ 12.4 114.8 % Other income 9.4 5.6 3.8 67.9 % Gains from dispositions of real estate interests, net 19.1 (19.1 ) (100.0 )% Development profits, net of taxes 106.4 54.8 51.6 94.2 % Interest expense, including amortization (165.2 ) (147.3 ) 17.9 12.2 % Total other income and (expenses), net $ (26.2 ) $ (57.0 ) $ (30.8 ) (54.0 )% The $12.4 million increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was primarily due to gains of $17.5 million from the disposition of real estate by our unconsolidated co investment joint ventures during 2006 as opposed to $5.5 million of such gains during 2005 and, effective October 1, 2006, the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., which resulted in an increase of approximately $5.1 million. These increases were partially offset by an increase in expenses by our unconsolidated joint ventures. The increase in other income was primarily due to increased bank interest income and an increase in property management income due to the expansion of our property management business. The 2005 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted primarily from our contribution of $106.9 million (using the exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties to our then newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. Development profits represent gains from the sale of development projects and land as part of our development for sale program. The increase in development profits was due to increased disposition and contribution volume during 2006. During 2006, we sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $13.3 million. In addition, during 2006, we received approximately $0.4 million in connection with the condemnation of a parcel of land resulting in a loss of $1.0 million, $0.8 million of which was the joint venture partners share. During 2006, we also contributed a total of ten completed development projects into unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. Four projects totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Japan Fund I, L.P, two projects totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet were contributed into AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, three projects totaling approximately 0.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and one land parcel into AMB DFS Fund I, LLC. As a result of these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after tax gain of $94.1 million, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party investors for cash. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $1.9 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. The increase in interest expense, including amortization, was due primarily to increased borrowings on unsecured credit facilities and other debt.

During 2005, we divested ourselves of 142 industrial buildings and one retail center, aggregating approximately 9.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $926.6 million, with a resulting net gain of $113.6 million. Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., for $618.5 million. The multi investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. We 48 received cash and a distribution of an on tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund.

In August 2006, we issued 2,000,000 shares of 6.85% Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. The increase in preferred stock dividends is due to the newly issued shares. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2006, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, repurchased all 840,000 of its outstanding 8.125% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units, all 220,440 of its outstanding 7.75% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units, all 201,139 of its outstanding 7.95% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units and all 729,582 of its outstanding 5.00% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units. As a result, we recognized a decrease in income available to common stockholders of $1.1 million for the original issuance costs, net of discount on repurchase.

The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2004 and 2005, we continued to acquire properties in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial revenues. The increase in private capital income was primarily due to increased asset management fees from additional assets held in co investment joint ventures and incentive distributions for 2005 of $26.4 million for the sale of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, asset 49 management priority distributions from AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., and acquisition fees from AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P.

In 2004 and 2005, we continued to acquire properties in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial property operating costs. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate during the year. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international and development expansions and the expansion of satellite offices. Other expenses increased approximately $2.4 million from the prior year due primarily to greater losses on our non qualified deferred compensation plan in 2005 and an increase in certain deal costs.

The increase in other income was primarily due to increased bank interest income. The 2005 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted primarily from our contribution of $106.9 million (using exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties to our newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. The 2004 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted from our contribution of $71.5 million in operating properties to our unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC. Development profits represent gains from the sale of development projects and land as part of our development for sale program. The increase in development profits was due to increased volume in 2005. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $1.9 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. During 2004, we sold seven land parcels and six development projects as part of our development for sale program, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet for an aggregate price of $40.4 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $6.5 million. During 2004, we also contributed one completed development project into a newly formed unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $2.0 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash.

Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Alliance Fund I for $618.5 million. The multi investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. We received cash and a distribution of an on tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund. During 2004, we divested ourselves of 21 industrial buildings, two retail centers and one office building, aggregating approximately 3.1 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $200.3 million, with a resulting net gain of $42.0 million.

The increase in preferred stock dividends is due to the newly issued shares. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Balance Sheet Strategy. In general, we use unsecured lines of credit, unsecured notes, preferred stock and common equity (issued by us and or the operating partnership and its subsidiaries) to capitalize our 100% owned assets. Over time, we plan to retire non recourse, secured debt encumbering our 100% owned assets and replace that debt with unsecured notes. In managing our co investment joint ventures, in general, we use non recourse, secured debt to capitalize our co investment joint ventures. We currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for acquisitions, development, expansion and renovation of properties will include: retained earnings and cash flow from operations; 51 private capital from co investment partners; net proceeds from contribution of properties and completed development projects to our co investment joint ventures; borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities; other forms of secured or unsecured financing; proceeds from equity (common and preferred) or debt securities offerings; proceeds from limited partnership unit offerings (including issuances of limited partnership units by our subsidiaries); and net proceeds from divestitures of properties. We currently expect that our principal funding requirements will include: working capital; development, expansion and renovation of properties; acquisitions, including our global expansion; debt service; and dividends and distributions on outstanding common and preferred stock and limited partnership units. Cash flows. As of December 31, 2006, cash provided by operating activities was $335.9 million as compared to $295.8 million for the same period in 2005. This change is primarily due to increases in rental rates, partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses primarily due to additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international and development expansions and increased occupancy costs related to the expansion of regional offices. Cash used for investing activities was $880.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to cash used for investing activities of $60.4 million for the same period in 2005. This change is primarily due to an increase in funds used for property acquisitions and capital expenditures, and a decrease in proceeds from property divestitures (mainly due to the divesture of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., portfolio in 2005), offset by less funds used for additions to interests in unconsolidated joint ventures and an increase in capital distributions received from unconsolidated joint ventures. Cash provided by financing activities was $483.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to cash used in financing activities of $101.9 million for the same period in 2005. This change is due primarily to an increase in borrowings, net of repayments, issuance of common stock upon the exercise of options and issuances of preferred stock, offset by the cost of the repurchase of preferred units for the year ended December 31, 2006. We believe that our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow from operations, borrowings available under our unsecured credit facilities and our ability to access private and public debt and equity capital, are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Resources Property Divestitures. During 2006, we divested ourselves of 39 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 3.5 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $175.3 million, with a resulting net gain of $42.6 million. Development Sales. During 2006, we sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $13.3 million. In addition, during 2006, we received approximately $0.4 million in connection with the condemnation of a parcel of land resulting in a loss of $1.0 million, $0.8 million of which was the joint venture partners share. 52 Development Contributions. During 2006, we contributed a total of nine completed development projects and one land parcel into unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. Four projects totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Japan Fund I, L.P, two projects totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet were contributed into AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and three projects totaling approximately 0.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. In addition, one land parcel was contributed into AMB DFS Fund I, LLC. As a result of these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after tax gain of $94.1 million, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party investors for cash. These gains are included in development profits, net of taxes, in the statement of operations. Properties Held for Contribution. As of December 31, 2006, we held for contribution to co investment joint ventures, nine industrial projects with an aggregate net book value of $154.0 million, which, when contributed to a joint venture, will reduce our current ownership interest from approximately 100% to an expected range of 15 50%. Properties Held for Divestiture. As of December 31, 2006, we held for divestiture four industrial projects, which are not in our core markets, do not meet our current strategic objectives or which we have included as part of our development for sale program. The divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. As of December 31, 2006, the net carrying value of the properties held for divestiture was $20.9 million. Expected net sales proceeds exceed the net carrying value of the properties. Co investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund certain acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. We generally consolidate these joint ventures for financial reporting purposes because they are not variable interest entities and because we are the sole managing general partner and control all major operating decisions. However, in certain cases, our co investment joint ventures are unconsolidated because we do not control all major operating decisions and the general partners do not have significant rights under EITF 04 5. Third party equity interests in the joint ventures are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements.

We have an option to purchase the remaining equity interest beginning January 1, 2007 and expiring December 31, 2009, based on the fair market value as stipulated in the joint venture agreement.

In December 2005, our board of directors approved a new two year common stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of our common stock. We did not repurchase or retire any shares of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2006. Debt. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, we presently intend to operate with an our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio of approximately 45% or less. As of December 31, 2006, our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio was 34.2%. (See footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratios table below for our definitions of our share of total market capitalization, market equity and our share of total debt.) However, we typically finance our co investment joint ventures with secured debt at a loan to value ratio of 50 65% per our joint venture agreements. Additionally, we currently intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these policies, however, our organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our management could alter or eliminate these policies without stockholder approval or circumstances could arise that could render us unable to comply with these policies. As of December 31, 2006, the aggregate principal amount of our secured debt was $1.4 billion, excluding unamortized debt premiums of $6.3 million. Of the $1.4 billion of secured debt, $1.0 billion is secured by properties in our joint ventures. The secured debt is generally non recourse and bears interest at rates varying from 2.9% to 10.4% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 6.2%) and final maturity dates ranging from February 2007 to January 2025. As of December 31, 2006, $1.0 billion of the secured debt obligations bear interest at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 6.1%, while the remaining $386.1 million bear interest at variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 4.7%). As of December 31, 2006, the operating partnership had outstanding an aggregate of $1.1 billion in unsecured senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 6.2% and had a weighted average term of 4.8 years. These unsecured senior debt securities include $300.0 million in notes issued in June 1998, $225.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2000 medium term note program, $275.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2002 medium term note program, $175.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2006 medium term note program and approximately $112.5 million of 5.094% Notes Due 2015, which were issued to Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America on July 11, 2005 in a private placement, in exchange for the cancellation of $100.0 million of notes that were issued in June 1998 resulting in a discount of approximately $12.5 million. The unsecured senior debt securities are subject to various covenants. Also included is a $25.0 million promissory note which matures in January 2007. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to its senior debt securities. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then our cash flow may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Credit Facilities. On June 1, 2006, the operating partnership entered into a third amended and restated $550.0 million unsecured revolving credit agreement that replaced its then existing $500.0 million credit facility, which was to mature on June 1, 2007. We are a guarantor of the operating partnerships obligations under the credit facility. The line, which matures on June 1, 2010, carries a one year extension option and can be increased to up to 56 $700.0 million upon certain conditions. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the operating partnerships long term debt rating, which was 42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2006, with an annual facility fee of 15 basis points. The four year credit facility includes a multi currency component, under which up to $550.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Euros, Yen or British Pounds Sterling. The operating partnership uses its unsecured credit facility principally for acquisitions, funding development activity and general working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on the credit facility was $303.7 million and the remaining amount available was $234.6 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $11.7 million. The outstanding balance included borrowings denominated in Euros, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately $303.7 million U.S. dollars. On June 23, 2006, AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating partnership and as the initial borrower, entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement for a 45.0 billion Yen unsecured revolving credit facility, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately $377.9 million U.S. dollars. This replaced the 35.0 billion Yen unsecured revolving credit facility executed on June 29, 2004, as previously amended, which using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately $293.9 million U.S. dollars. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K. under the credit facility, as well as the obligations of any other entity in which the operating partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the credit agreement. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and for other real estate purposes in Japan, China and South Korea. Generally, borrowers under the credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the credit facility with certain real estate assets or equity in entities holding such real estate assets. The credit facility matures in June 2010 and has a one year extension option. The credit facility can be increased to up to 55.0 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately $461.9 million U.S. dollars. The extension option is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding commitments under the facility at that time. The rate on the borrowings is generally TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt and was 42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2006. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, payable in quarterly amounts, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt, and was 15 basis points of the outstanding commitments under the facility as of December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, was $320.9 million in U.S. dollars. On June 13, 2006, the operating partnership and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries entered into a fourth amended and restated credit agreement for a $250.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which replaced the third amended and restated credit agreement for a $250.0 million unsecured credit facility. On February 16, 2006, the third amended and restated credit agreement replaced the then existing $100.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that was to mature in June 2008. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations for such subsidiaries and other entities controlled by us or the operating partnership that are selected by the operating partnership from time to time to be borrowers under and pursuant to the credit facility. The four year credit facility includes a multi currency component under which up to $250.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Singapore dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros. The line, which matures in February 2010 and carries a one year extension option, can be increased to up to $350.0 million upon certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding commitments. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships senior unsecured long term debt, which was 60 basis points as of December 31, 2006, with an annual facility fee based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships senior unsecured long term debt. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and general working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on this facility was approximately $227.4 million. The credit agreement contains affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios by the operating partnership, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. 57 Mortgages Receivable. Through a wholly owned subsidiary, we hold a mortgage loan receivable on AMB Pier One, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture. The note bears interest at 13.0% and matures in May 2026. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on the note was $12.7 million. We also hold a loan receivable on G. Accion, an unconsolidated joint venture totaling $6.1 million with an interest rate of 10.0%. The loan matures in March 2010.

(4) Our share of total debt is the pro rata portion of the total debt based on our percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated or unconsolidated joint ventures holding the debt. We believe that our share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze our leverage and to compare our leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of our debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their joint ventures. Our share of total debt is not intended to reflect our actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures.

(3) In March 2006, AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased all of its outstanding series H preferred units. (4) The holder of the series N preferred units exercised its put option in January 2006 and sold all of its series N preferred units to the operating partnership and AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased all of such units from the operating partnership. The anticipated size of our distributions, using only cash from operations, will not allow us to retire all of our debt as it comes due. Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Commitments Development Starts. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we initiated 30 new industrial development projects in North America, Europe and Asia with a total expected investment of $914.3 million, aggregating approximately 10.4 million square feet. During 2005, we initiated 30 new industrial development projects in North America, Europe and Asia with a total expected investment of $522.4 million, aggregating approximately 7.0 million square feet. 60 Development Pipeline. As of December 31, 2006, we had 45 industrial projects in our development pipeline, which will total approximately 13.7 million square feet, and will have an aggregate estimated investment of $1.3 billion upon completion. We have an additional ten development projects available for sale or contribution totaling approximately 3.0 million square feet, with an aggregate estimated investment of $199.2 million. One of these ten projects totaling $13.0 million and approximately 0.2 million square feet is held in an unconsolidated joint venture. As of December 31, 2006, we and our joint venture partners had funded an aggregate of $814.5 million and needed to fund an estimated additional $481.0 million in order to complete our development pipeline which includes projects expected to be completed through the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we acquired 835 acres of land for industrial warehouse development in North America and Asia for approximately $293.2 million. Acquisitions. During 2006, we acquired 106 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 9.8 million square feet for a total expected investment of $834.2 million (includes acquisition costs of $814.1 million and estimated acquisition capital of $20.1 million), of which we acquired 70 buildings through one of our unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. We generally fund our acquisitions through private capital contributions, borrowings under our credit facilities, cash, debt issuances and net proceeds from property divestitures. Lease Commitments. We have entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily on tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms from one to 55 years. These buildings and improvements are amortized ratably over the lesser of the terms of the related leases or 40 years. Future minimum rental payments required under non cancelable operating leases in effect as of December 31, 2006 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2007 $ 21,636 2008 22,186 2009 21,506 2010 20,667 2011 20,668 Thereafter 272,483 Total $ 379,146 Co investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. As of December 31, 2006, we had investments in co investment joint ventures with a gross book value of $1.9 billion, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, and net equity investments in four unconsolidated co investment joint ventures of $236.0 million and a gross book value of $2.5 billion. As of December 31, 2006, we may make additional capital contributions to current and planned co investment joint ventures of up to $168.2 million (using the exchange rates at December 31, 2006) pursuant to the terms of the joint venture agreements. From time to time, we may raise additional equity commitments for AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open ended unconsolidated co investment joint venture formed in 2004 with institutional investors, which invests through a private real estate investment trust. This would increase our obligation to make additional capital commitments. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of this fund, we are obligated to contribute 20% of the total equity commitments to the fund until such time our total equity commitment is greater than $150.0 million, at which time, our obligation is reduced to 10% of the total equity commitments. We expect to fund these contributions with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances or net proceeds from property divestitures, which could adversely effect our cash flow. Captive Insurance Company. In December 2001, we formed a wholly owned captive insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., (Arcata), which provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the deductible under our third party policies. The captive insurance company is one element of our overall risk management program. We capitalized Arcata in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata established annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss experience of our properties. Annually, 61 we engage an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims, related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata may be adjusted based on this estimate. Like premiums paid to third party insurance companies, premiums paid to Arcata may be reimbursed by customers pursuant to specific lease terms. Through this structure, we believe that we have more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market. Potential Contingent and Unknown Liabilities. Contingent and unknown liabilities may include the following: liabilities for environmental conditions; claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to our formation or acquisition transactions that had not been asserted prior to our formation or acquisition transactions; accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; tax liabilities; and claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these entities. Overview of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our debt, interest and lease payments due by period as of December 31, 2006 (dollars in thousands): Less than More than Contractual Obligations 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Total Debt $ 213,869 $ 592,085 $ 1,593,035 $ 1,042,699 $ 3,441,688 Debt interest payments 13,861 38,126 74,416 58,775 185,178 Operating lease commitments 21,636 43,692 41,335 272,483 379,146 Construction commitments 31,713 57,042 88,755 Total $ 281,079 $ 730,945 $ 1,708,786 $ 1,373,957 $ 4,094,767 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Standby Letters of Credit. As of December 31, 2006, we had provided approximately $22.1 million in letters of credit, of which $11.7 million was provided under the operating partnerships $550.0 million unsecured credit facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other commitments. Guarantees. Other than parent guarantees associated with the unsecured debt, as of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding guarantees in the aggregate amount of $48.2 million in connection with certain acquisitions. As of December 31, 2006, we guaranteed $26.8 million and $83.2 million on outstanding loans on two of our consolidated joint ventures and two of our unconsolidated joint ventures, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2006, we guaranteed $87.3 million on outstanding property debt related to one of our unconsolidated joint ventures. Performance and Surety Bonds. As of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $11.4 million. These bonds were issued in connection with certain of our development projects and were posted to guarantee certain tax obligations and the construction of certain real property improvements and infrastructure, such as grading, sewers and streets. Performance and surety bonds are commonly required by public agencies from real estate developers. Performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the taxes due or the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. Promoted Interests and Other Contractual Obligations. Upon the achievement of certain return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, we may be obligated to make payments to certain of our joint venture partners 62 pursuant to the terms and provisions of their contractual agreements with us. From time to time in the normal course of our business, we enter into various contracts with third parties that may obligate us to make payments, pay promotes, or perform other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. SUPPLEMENTAL EARNINGS MEASURES FFO. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider funds from operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. FFO is defined as net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, less gains (or losses) from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estate related depreciation, and adjustments to derive our pro rata share of FFO of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. Further, we do not adjust FFO to eliminate the effects of non recurring charges. We believe that FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. We believe that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. The following table reflects the calculation of FFO reconciled from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Net income(1) $ 224,072 $ 257,807 $ 125,471 $ 129,128 $ 121,119 Gains from dispositions of real estate, net of minority interests(2) (42,635 ) (132,652 ) (47,224 ) (50,325 ) (19,383 ) Real estate, related depreciation and amortization: Total depreciation and amortization 177,824 161,732 136,610 111,879 103,550 Discontinued operations depreciation 2,153 18,572 30,740 30,458 32,953 Non real estate depreciation (4,546 ) (3,388 ) (871 ) (720 ) (712 ) Ground lease amortization (2,301 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from consolidated joint ventures: Joint venture partners minority interests (Net income) 37,975 36,401 29,360 22,276 16,529 63 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Net income) 2,805 3,411 2,384 2,117 3,303 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Development profits) 4,948 2,262 435 344 57 Discontinued operations minority interests (Net income) 31 8,769 13,964 15,214 16,597 FFO attributable to minority interests (82,861 ) (100,275 ) (80,192 ) (65,603 ) (52,051 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures: Our share of net income (23,240 ) (10,770 ) (3,781 ) (5,445 ) (5,674 ) Our share of FFO 16,038 14,441 7,549 9,755 9,291 Our share of development profits, net of taxes 5,441 Preferred stock dividends (13,582 ) (7,388 ) (7,131 ) (6,999 ) (8,496 ) Preferred stock and unit redemption discount (issuance costs) (1,070 ) (5,413 ) 412 Funds from operations $ 297,912 $ 254,363 $ 207,314 $ 186,666 $ 215,194 Basic FFO per common share and unit $ 3.24 $ 2.87 $ 2.39 $ 2.17 $ 2.44 Diluted FFO per common share and unit $ 3.12 $ 2.75 $ 2.30 $ 2.13 $ 2.40 Weighted average common shares and units: Basic 92,047,678 88,684,262 86,885,250 85,859,899 88,204,208 Diluted 95,444,072 92,508,725 90,120,250 87,616,365 89,689,310 (1) Includes gains from undepreciated land sales of $5.6 million, $25.0 million, $3.7 million and $1.2 million for 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. (2) The information for 2005 includes accumulated depreciation re capture of approximately $1.1 million associated with the sale of the Interstate Crossdock redevelopment project. SS NOI. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider same store net operating income, or SS NOI, to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. For properties that are considered part of the same store pool, see Part I, Item 2: Properties Industrial Properties Owned and Managed Market Operating Statistics, Note 6, and Owned and Managed Operating and Leasing Statistics Owned and Managed Same Store Operating Statistics, Note 2. In deriving SS NOI, we define NOI as rental revenues (as calculated in accordance with GAAP), including reimbursements, less straight line rents, property operating expenses and real estate taxes. We exclude straight line rents in calculating SS NOI because we believe it provides a better measure of actual cash basis rental growth for a year over year comparison. In addition, we believe that SS NOI helps the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate as compared to other companies. While SS NOI is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. SS NOI also does not reflect general and administrative expense, interest expenses, depreciation and amortization costs, capital expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development and construction activities that could materially impact our results from operations. Further, our computation of SS NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating SS NOI. 64 The following table reconciles SS NOI from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Net income $ 224,072 $ 257,807 $ 125,471 Private capital income (46,102 ) (43,942 ) (12,895 ) Depreciation and amortization 177,824 161,732 136,610 Impairment losses 6,312 General and administrative 104,262 71,564 57,181 Other expenses 2,620 5,038 2,554 Fund costs 2,091 1,482 1,741 Total other income and expenses 26,178 57,044 119,727 Total minority interests share of income 62,855 74,777 52,863 Total discontinued operations (51,949 ) (127,498 ) (63,888 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (193 ) Net Operating Income (NOI) 507,970 458,004 419,364 Less non same store NOI (116,030 ) (70,782 ) (19,990 ) Less non cash adjustments(1) (8,426 ) (9,861 ) (8,249 ) Cash basis same store NOI $ 383,514 $ 377,361 $ 391,125 (1) Non cash adjustments include straight line rents and amortization of lease intangibles for the same store pool only. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices, interest rates and international exchange rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimize the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings and our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2006, we had three outstanding interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $38.1 million (in U.S. dollars). See Financial Instruments below. The table below summarizes the market risks associated with our fixed and variable rate debt outstanding before net unamortized debt discounts of $4.3 million as of December 31, 2006 (dollars in thousands): 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Fixed rate debt(1) $ 155,384 $ 368,141 $ 152,151 $ 430,676 $ 288,835 $ 768,320 $ 2,163,507 Average interest rate 6.7 % 7.1 % 4.7 % 6.4 % 6.8 % 5.9 % 6.3 % Variable rate debt(2) $ 58,485 $ 22,604 $ 49,189 $ 854,543 $ 18,981 $ 274,379 $ 1,278,181 Average interest rate 5.9 % 6.6 % 6.8 % 3.1 % 3.8 % 4.9 % 3.8 % Interest Payments $ 13,861 $ 27,630 $ 10,496 $ 54,054 $ 20,362 $ 58,775 $ 185,178 (1) Represents 62.9% of all outstanding debt. (2) Represents 37.1% of all outstanding debt. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased or decreased by 10%, then the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would be $4.9 million (net of swaps) annually. As of December 31, 65 2006, the book value and the estimated fair value of our total consolidated debt (both secured and unsecured) was $3.4 and $3.5 billion, respectively, based on our estimate of current market interest rates. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, variable rate debt comprised 37.1% and 24.5%, respectively, of all our outstanding debt. Variable rate debt was $1.3 billion and $831.7 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. The increase is primarily due to higher outstanding balances on our credit facilities. This increase in our outstanding variable rate debt increases our risk associated with unfavorable interest rate fluctuations. Financial Instruments. We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income or income. For revenues or expenses denominated in non functional currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments in effect at December 31, 2006 were three interest rate swaps hedging cash flows of our variable rate borrowings based on U.S. Libor (USD) and Euribor (Europe). The following table summarizes our financial instruments as of December 31, 2006 (in thousands): Maturity Dates Related Derivatives (in thousands) December 8, 2008 June 8, 2010 November 1, 2014 Notional Amount Fair Value Interest Rate Swaps: Plain Interest Rate Swap, Europe Notional Amount (U.S. dollars) $ 9,655 $ 9,655 Receive Floating(%) 3MEURIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 3.72 % Fair Market Value $ 54 Plain Interest Rate Swap, USD Notional Amount (U.S. dollars) $ 25,000 25,000 Receive Floating(%) 3MLIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 5.17 % Fair Market Value (130 ) Plain Interest Rate Swap, Europe Notional Amount (U.S. dollars) $ 3,471 3,471 Receive Floating(%) 3MEURIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 4.26 % Fair Market Value (45 ) Total $ 38,126 $ (121 ) International Operations. Our exposure to market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries operating in the United States and Mexico. The functional currency for our subsidiaries operating outside the United States is generally the local currency of the country in which the entity is located, mitigating the effect of foreign exchange gains and losses. Our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. We translate income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. The losses resulting from the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity and totaled $0.2 million for year ended December 31, 2006. Our international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. In these instances, non monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2006, losses from remeasurement and the sale of four foreign exchange agreements included in our results of operations totaled $0.8 million. We also record gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated. 66 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations GENERAL You should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements. We commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company effective with the completion of our initial public offering on November 26, 1997, and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, with our initial tax return for the year ended December 31, 1997. AMB Property Corporation and AMB Property, L.P. were formed shortly before the consummation of our initial public offering. Managements Overview The primary source of our revenue and earnings is rent received from customers under long term (generally three to ten years) operating leases at our properties, including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs, and from partnership distributions and fees from our private capital business. We also produce earnings from the disposition of operating assets that no longer fit our strategy, from the disposition of projects in our development for sale program and from the contributions of properties to our co investment joint ventures. Our long term growth is driven by our ability to maintain and increase occupancy rates or increase rental rates at our properties, and by our ability to continue to acquire and develop new properties. National industrial markets continued to improve during 2006 when compared with market conditions in 2005. According to Torto Wheaton Research, availability dropped 10 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2006 to 9.4%, and availability for the year dropped 50 basis points. We believe the strongest industrial markets in the U.S. are the coastal gateway markets tied to global trade, including Los Angeles, our largest market, Miami, the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle, and to a lesser degree Northern New Jersey/New York (with the exception of the Exit 8A submarket). While we believe that the broader Chicago market is showing signs of stabilization, certain submarkets, like the OHare submarket, are relatively strong. We believe Dallas continues to recover, and Atlanta continues to suffer from a large increase in supply. We believe the operating environment in our U.S. on tarmac business remains good with improving cargo volumes and essentially no new supply. Investor demand for industrial property (as supported by our observation of strong national sales volumes and declining acquisition capitalization rates) has remained consistently strong over the past several years. We believe we capitalized on this demand for industrial property by accelerating the repositioning of our portfolio, through the disposition of non core properties, which was effectively completed in 2006 with our exit from the Charlotte and Memphis markets. We plan to continue selling selected assets on an opportunistic basis or that no longer fit our strategic investment objectives, but we believe we have substantially achieved our repositioning goals. Occupancy levels in our portfolio continue to outperform the national industrial market, as determined by Torto Wheaton Research, by pricing lease renewals and new leases with sensitivity to local market conditions. During the prior periods of decreasing or stabilizing rental rates, we strove to sign leases with shorter terms to prevent locking in lower rent levels for long periods and to be prepared to sign new, longer term leases during periods of growing rental rates. When we sign leases of shorter duration, we attempt to limit overall leasing costs and capital expenditures by offering different grades of tenant improvement packages, appropriate to the lease term. In our stronger markets, we are increasing rents as opposed to occupancy. 40 The table below summarizes key operating and leasing statistics for our owned and managed operating properties for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: U.S. Hub and Total Other Total/Weighted Owned and Managed Property Data(1) Gateway Markets(2) Markets(3) Average For the year ended December 31, 2006: % of total rentable square feet 72.0 % 28.0 % 100.0 % Occupancy percentage at year end 96.5 % 95.0 % 96.1 % Same space square footage leased 13,016,726 3,186,854 16,203,580 Rent (decreases) increases on renewals and rollovers(4) (0.4 )% 1.6 % (0.1 )% For the year ended December 31, 2005:(5) % of total rentable square feet 74.9 % 25.1 % 100.0 % Occupancy percentage at year end 96.2 % 94.6 % 95.8 % Same space square footage leased 11,032,482 2,574,944 13,607,426 Rent decreases on renewals and rollovers (10.8 )% (4.3 )% (9.7 )% (1) Schedule includes owned and managed operating properties which we define as properties in which we have at least a 10% ownership interest, for which we are the property or asset manager, and which we intend to hold for the long term.

(3) Our total markets include other U.S. target markets, other non target markets, and non U.S. target markets. (4) On a consolidated basis, rent increases on renewals and rollovers were 4.4% and 3.0%, respectively, for U.S. hub and gateway markets and total other markets. (5) The information for 2005 is presented on a consolidated basis while the information for 2006 is presented on an owned and managed basis. Management believes that the difference in comparability between the information for 2006 and 2005 is not significant. At December 31, 2006, our operating portfolios occupancy rate was 96.1%, on an owned and managed basis (97.0% on a consolidated basis), an increase from both the prior quarter and December 31, 2005. Rental rates on lease renewals and rollovers in our portfolio increased 4.1% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and decreased 0.1% for the full year. Cash basis same store net operating income (rental revenues less property operating expenses and real estate taxes for properties included in the same store pool, which is set annually and excludes properties purchased or developments stabilized after December 31, 2004) grew by 1.3% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and 2.6% for the full year 2006, on an owned and managed basis. Excluding lease termination fees, same store net operating income grew 3.0% and 3.2% in the quarter and for the full year (decreased 0.5% and increased 1.6%, respectively, on a consolidated basis), respectively, on an owned and managed basis. See Part II, Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Supplemental Earnings Measures for a discussion of same store net operating income and a reconciliation of same store net operating income and net income. We currently expect that same store growth in our operating portfolio, excluding lease termination fees, will be about 3% to 4% for 2007, on an owned and managed basis. Market rents continue to rebound from their lows and in many of our hub and gateway markets are back to or above their prior peak levels of 2001. We believe that industrial market rents in the San Francisco Bay Area are improving. While market rents in the San Francisco Bay Area were up 10% to 15% in 2006, rents still have not yet fully recovered to normal levels. Rents on lease renewals and rollovers in the San Francisco Bay Area declined 21.0% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and 13.2% for the full year 2006, on an owned and managed basis. Without the effect of the San Francisco Bay Area, rents on renewals and rollovers for the full year 2006 would have been 2.0%, on an owned and managed basis, which we believe reflects the generally positive trends in U.S. industrial space availability. We expect development to be a significant driver of our earnings growth as we expand our land and development pipeline, and contribute completed development projects into our co investment program and recognize development profits. We believe that development, renovation and expansion of well located, high 41 quality industrial properties should generally continue to provide us with attractive investment opportunities at a higher rate of return than we may obtain from the purchase of existing properties. We believe that our development opportunities in Mexico, Japan and China are particularly attractive given the current lack of supply of modern industrial distribution facilities in the major metropolitan markets of these countries. Prior to our global expansion, our development pipeline was $106.8 million at the end of 2002. As a result of our global expansion and increased development capabilities, we have increased our development pipeline to approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2006. In addition to our committed development pipeline, we hold a total of 1,735 acres for future development or sale, of which 92% is in North America. We believe these 1,735 acres of land could support approximately 30.5 million square feet of future development. Going forward, we believe that our co investment program with private capital investors will continue to serve as a significant source of revenues and capital for new investments. Through these co investment joint ventures, we typically earn acquisition fees, asset management fees and priority distributions, as well as promoted interests and incentive distributions based on the performance of the co investment joint ventures; however, we cannot assure you that we will continue to do so. Through contribution of development properties to our co investment joint ventures, we expect to recognize value creation from our development pipeline. As of December 31, 2006, we owned approximately 64.3 million square feet of our properties (51.6% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these co investment joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. By the end of 2010, we expect to have approximately 50% of our owned and managed operating portfolio invested in non U.S. markets (based on owned and managed annualized base rent). As of December 31, 2006, our non U.S. operating properties comprised 14.1% of our owned and managed operating portfolio (based on annualized base rent) and 7.4% of our consolidated operating portfolio (based on annualized base rent). Our North American target countries outside of the United States currently comprise Canada and Mexico. Our European target countries currently comprise Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. Our Asian target countries currently comprise China, India, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. We expect to add additional target countries outside the United States in the future. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust, we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income. As a result, we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our on going operations to the same extent that other corporations that are not real estate investment trusts can. We must continue to raise capital in both the debt and equity markets to fund our working capital needs, acquisitions and developments. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for a complete discussion of the sources of our capital. Summary of Key Transactions in 2006 During the year ended December 31, 2006, we completed the following significant capital deployment and other transactions: Acquired, on an owned and managed basis, 106 buildings in North America and Europe, aggregating approximately 9.8 million square feet, for $834.2 million; Committed to 30 development projects in North America, Asia and Europe totaling 10.4 million square feet with an estimated total investment of approximately $914.3 million; Acquired 835 acres of land for development in North America and Asia for approximately $293.2 million; Sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million; Contributed four completed development projects for $486.2 million to AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., two completed development projects for $56.4 million to AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, three completed development projects for $64.8 million to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. and one land parcel for $77.5 million to AMB DFS Fund I, LLC, all of which entities are unconsolidated co investment joint ventures.

See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 6, 9 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our capital markets transactions. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Investments in Real Estate. Investments in real estate and leasehold interests are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. We also regularly review the impact of above or below market leases, in place leases and lease origination costs for all new acquisitions, and record an intangible asset or liability accordingly. Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a property by property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable. Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying value of the property. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future economics and market conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying value of our long lived assets could occur in the future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings. As a result of leasing activity and the economic environment, we re evaluated the carrying value of our investments and recorded impairment charges of $6.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 on certain of our investments. Revenue Recognition. We record rental revenue from operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts, security deposits and letters of credit, then we may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our customers on an on going basis by reviewing their financial condition periodically as appropriate. Each period we review our outstanding accounts receivable, including straight line rents, for doubtful accounts and provide allowances as needed. We also record lease termination fees when a customer has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us. If a customer remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement, the applicable termination fees are deferred and recognized over the term of such customers occupancy. Property Dispositions. We report real estate dispositions in three separate categories on our consolidated statements of operations. First, when we divest a portion of our interests in real estate entities or properties, gains from the sale represent the interests acquired by third party investors for cash and are included in gains from disposition of real estate interests in the statement of operations. Second, we dispose of value added conversion projects and build to suit and speculative development projects for which we have not generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable, and are included in development profits, net of taxes, in the statement of operations. Lastly, 44 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, requires us to separately report as discontinued operations the historical operating results attributable to operating properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the properties, which is included in gains from dispositions of real estate, net of minority interests, in the statement of operations. The consolidated statements of operations for prior periods are also adjusted to conform with this classification. There is no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial position, net income or cash flows. In all cases, gains and losses are recognized using the full accrual method of accounting. Gains relating to transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met. Joint Ventures. We hold interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We determine consolidation based on standards set forth in EITF 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights or FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN 46. Based on the guidance set forth in EITF 04 5, we consolidate certain joint venture investments because we exercise significant control over major operating decisions, such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, asset management, investment activity and changes in financing. For joint ventures that are variable interest entities as defined under FIN 46 where we are not the primary beneficiaries, we do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. For joint ventures under EITF 04 5, where we do not exercise significant control over major operating and management decisions, but where we exercise significant influence, we use the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. Real Estate Investment Trust. As a real estate investment trust, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes in the U.S. if we meet minimum distribution, income, asset and shareholder tests. However, some of our subsidiaries may be subject to federal and state taxes. In addition, foreign entities may also be subject to the taxes of the host country. An income tax allocation is required to be estimated on our taxable income arising from our taxable real estate investment trust subsidiaries and international entities. A deferred tax component could arise based upon the differences in GAAP versus tax income for items such as depreciation and gain recognition. However, we believe deferred tax is an immaterial component of our consolidated balance sheet. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Effective October 1, 2006, we deconsolidated AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., on a prospective basis, due to the re evaluation of the accounting for our investment in the fund in light of changes to the partnership agreement regarding the general partners rights effective October 1, 2006. As a result, our results of operations presented below are not comparable between years presented. The analysis below includes changes attributable to same store growth, acquisitions, development activity and divestitures. Same store properties are those that we owned during both the current and prior year reporting periods, excluding development properties stabilized after December 31, 2004 (generally defined as properties that are 90% leased or properties for which we have held a certificate of occupancy or where building has been substantially complete for at least 12 months). As of December 31, 2006, same store industrial properties consisted of properties aggregating approximately 71.2 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2006 consisted of 73 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. During 2006, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 50 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.5 million square feet. In 2005, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 150 buildings, aggregating approximately 10.6 million square feet. Our future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition of additional properties and dispositions. Our future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical results. 45 For the Years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (dollars in millions) Revenues 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Rental revenues U.S. industrial: Same store $ 514.9 $ 501.5 $ 13.4 2.7 % 2006 acquisitions 4.4 4.4 % 2005 acquisitions 19.4 11.4 8.0 70.2 % Development 8.3 7.4 0.9 12.2 % Other industrial 74.3 63.6 10.7 16.8 % Non U.S. industrial 62.5 33.1 29.4 88.8 % Total rental revenues 683.8 617.0 66.8 10.8 % Private capital income 46.1 43.9 2.2 5.0 % Total revenues $ 729.9 $ 660.9 $ 69.0 10.4 % U.S. industrial same store revenues increased $13.4 million from the prior year despite the decrease of $12.8 million in same store revenues due to the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., effective October 1, 2006, attributable primarily to improved occupancy and increased rental rates in various markets. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2006 consisted of 73 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. Non U.S. industrial revenues increased approximately $29.4 million from the prior year due primarily to the stabilization of three properties in Japan and the continued acquisition of properties in France, Germany and Mexico. The increase in private capital income was primarily due to increased asset management and acquisition fees from additional assets held in co investment joint ventures, which were partially offset by a decrease in incentive distributions of approximately $3.9 million. During 2006, we received 46 incentive distributions of $22.5 million, of which $19.8 million was from AMB Partners II, L.P., as compared to incentive distribution of $26.4 million for the sale of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., during 2005.

The 2005 acquisitions consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. The 2006 acquisitions consisted of 73 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. Non U.S. industrial revenues increased approximately $6.0 million from the prior year due primarily to the stabilization of three properties in Japan and the continued acquisition of properties in France, Germany and Mexico. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The 2006 impairment loss was taken on several non core assets as a result of leasing activities and changes in the economic environment and the holding period of certain assets. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased stock based compensation expense as a result of higher values assigned to option and stock awards and executive departures, additional staffing and expenses for our international expansion, and the acquisition of AMB Blackpine. Other expenses decreased approximately $2.4 million from the prior year due primarily to a decrease in losses associated with our deferred compensation plan and a decrease in certain deal costs. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our co investment joint ventures. 47 Other Income and (Expenses) 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures, net $ 23.2 $ 10.8 $ 12.4 114.8 % Other income 9.4 5.6 3.8 67.9 % Gains from dispositions of real estate interests, net 19.1 (19.1 ) (100.0 )% Development profits, net of taxes 106.4 54.8 51.6 94.2 % Interest expense, including amortization (165.2 ) (147.3 ) 17.9 12.2 % Total other income and (expenses), net $ (26.2 ) $ (57.0 ) $ (30.8 ) (54.0 )% The $12.4 million increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was primarily due to gains of $17.5 million from the disposition of real estate by our unconsolidated co investment joint ventures during 2006 as opposed to $5.5 million of such gains during 2005 and, effective October 1, 2006, the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., which resulted in an increase of approximately $5.1 million. These increases were partially offset by an increase in expenses by our unconsolidated joint ventures. The increase in other income was primarily due to increased bank interest income and an increase in property management income due to the expansion of our property management business. The 2005 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted primarily from our contribution of $106.9 million (using the exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties to our then newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. Development profits represent gains from the sale of development projects and land as part of our development for sale program. The increase in development profits was due to increased disposition and contribution volume during 2006. During 2006, we sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $13.3 million. In addition, during 2006, we received approximately $0.4 million in connection with the condemnation of a parcel of land resulting in a loss of $1.0 million, $0.8 million of which was the joint venture partners share. During 2006, we also contributed a total of ten completed development projects into unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. Four projects totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Japan Fund I, L.P, two projects totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet were contributed into AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, three projects totaling approximately 0.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and one land parcel into AMB DFS Fund I, LLC. As a result of these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after tax gain of $94.1 million, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party investors for cash. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $1.9 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. The increase in interest expense, including amortization, was due primarily to increased borrowings on unsecured credit facilities and other debt. Discontinued Operations 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Income attributable to discontinued operations, net of minority interests $ 9.3 $ 13.9 $ (4.6 ) (33.1 )% Gains from dispositions of real estate, net of minority interests 42.6 113.6 (71.0 ) (62.5 )% Total discontinued operations $ 51.9 $ 127.5 $ (75.6 ) (59.3 )% During 2006, we divested ourselves of 39 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 3.5 million square feet, for an aggregate price of approximately $175.3 million, with a resulting net gain of approximately $42.6 million. During 2005, we divested ourselves of 142 industrial buildings and one retail center, aggregating approximately 9.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $926.6 million, with a resulting net gain of $113.6 million. Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., for $618.5 million. The multi investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. We 48 received cash and a distribution of an on tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund. Preferred Stock 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Preferred stock dividends $ (13.6 ) $ (7.4 ) $ 6.2 83.8 % Preferred unit redemption issuance costs (1.1 ) 1.1 % Total preferred stock dividends $ (14.7 ) $ (7.4 ) $ 7.3 98.6 % In December 2005, we issued 3,000,000 shares of 7.0% Series O Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. In August 2006, we issued 2,000,000 shares of 6.85% Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. The increase in preferred stock dividends is due to the newly issued shares. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2006, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, repurchased all 840,000 of its outstanding 8.125% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units, all 220,440 of its outstanding 7.75% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units, all 201,139 of its outstanding 7.95% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units and all 729,582 of its outstanding 5.00% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units. As a result, we recognized a decrease in income available to common stockholders of $1.1 million for the original issuance costs, net of discount on repurchase. For the Years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 (dollars in millions) Revenues 2005 2004 $ Change % Change Rental revenues U.S. industrial: Same store $ 501.5 $ 489.9 $ 11.6 2.4 % 2005 acquisitions 11.4 3.2 8.2 256.3 % Development 7.4 8.6 (1.2 ) (14.0 )% Other industrial 63.6 34.6 29.0 83.8 % Non U.S. industrial 33.1 27.2 5.9 21.7 % Total rental revenues 617.0 563.5 53.5 9.5 % Private capital income 43.9 12.9 31.0 240.3 % Total revenues $ 660.9 $ 576.4 $ 84.5 14.7 % U.S. industrial same store revenues increased $11.6 million from 2004 to 2005 on a year to date basis attributable primarily to improved occupancy and increased rental rates in various markets. The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2004 and 2005, we continued to acquire properties in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial revenues. The increase in private capital income was primarily due to increased asset management fees from additional assets held in co investment joint ventures and incentive distributions for 2005 of $26.4 million for the sale of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, asset 49 management priority distributions from AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., and acquisition fees from AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P.

The 2004 acquisitions consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. The 2005 acquisitions consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2004 and 2005, we continued to acquire properties in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial property operating costs. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate during the year. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international and development expansions and the expansion of satellite offices. Other expenses increased approximately $2.4 million from the prior year due primarily to greater losses on our non qualified deferred compensation plan in 2005 and an increase in certain deal costs. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our co investment joint ventures.

The increase in other income was primarily due to increased bank interest income. The 2005 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted primarily from our contribution of $106.9 million (using exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties to our newly formed unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. The 2004 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted from our contribution of $71.5 million in operating properties to our unconsolidated co investment joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC. Development profits represent gains from the sale of development projects and land as part of our development for sale program. The increase in development profits was due to increased volume in 2005. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $1.9 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. During 2004, we sold seven land parcels and six development projects as part of our development for sale program, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet for an aggregate price of $40.4 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $6.5 million. During 2004, we also contributed one completed development project into a newly formed unconsolidated joint venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $2.0 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash.

Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Alliance Fund I for $618.5 million. The multi investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. We received cash and a distribution of an on tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund. During 2004, we divested ourselves of 21 industrial buildings, two retail centers and one office building, aggregating approximately 3.1 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $200.3 million, with a resulting net gain of $42.0 million.

The increase in preferred stock dividends is due to the newly issued shares. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Balance Sheet Strategy. In general, we use unsecured lines of credit, unsecured notes, preferred stock and common equity (issued by us and or the operating partnership and its subsidiaries) to capitalize our 100% owned assets. Over time, we plan to retire non recourse, secured debt encumbering our 100% owned assets and replace that debt with unsecured notes. In managing our co investment joint ventures, in general, we use non recourse, secured debt to capitalize our co investment joint ventures. We currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for acquisitions, development, expansion and renovation of properties will include: retained earnings and cash flow from operations; 51 private capital from co investment partners; net proceeds from contribution of properties and completed development projects to our co investment joint ventures; borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities; other forms of secured or unsecured financing; proceeds from equity (common and preferred) or debt securities offerings; proceeds from limited partnership unit offerings (including issuances of limited partnership units by our subsidiaries); and net proceeds from divestitures of properties. We currently expect that our principal funding requirements will include: working capital; development, expansion and renovation of properties; acquisitions, including our global expansion; debt service; and dividends and distributions on outstanding common and preferred stock and limited partnership units. Cash flows. As of December 31, 2006, cash provided by operating activities was $335.9 million as compared to $295.8 million for the same period in 2005. This change is primarily due to increases in rental rates, partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses primarily due to additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international and development expansions and increased occupancy costs related to the expansion of regional offices. Cash used for investing activities was $880.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to cash used for investing activities of $60.4 million for the same period in 2005. This change is primarily due to an increase in funds used for property acquisitions and capital expenditures, and a decrease in proceeds from property divestitures (mainly due to the divesture of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., portfolio in 2005), offset by less funds used for additions to interests in unconsolidated joint ventures and an increase in capital distributions received from unconsolidated joint ventures. Cash provided by financing activities was $483.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to cash used in financing activities of $101.9 million for the same period in 2005. This change is due primarily to an increase in borrowings, net of repayments, issuance of common stock upon the exercise of options and issuances of preferred stock, offset by the cost of the repurchase of preferred units for the year ended December 31, 2006. We believe that our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow from operations, borrowings available under our unsecured credit facilities and our ability to access private and public debt and equity capital, are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Resources Property Divestitures. During 2006, we divested ourselves of 39 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 3.5 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $175.3 million, with a resulting net gain of $42.6 million. Development Sales. During 2006, we sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $13.3 million. In addition, during 2006, we received approximately $0.4 million in connection with the condemnation of a parcel of land resulting in a loss of $1.0 million, $0.8 million of which was the joint venture partners share. 52 Development Contributions. During 2006, we contributed a total of nine completed development projects and one land parcel into unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. Four projects totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Japan Fund I, L.P, two projects totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet were contributed into AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and three projects totaling approximately 0.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. In addition, one land parcel was contributed into AMB DFS Fund I, LLC. As a result of these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after tax gain of $94.1 million, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party investors for cash. These gains are included in development profits, net of taxes, in the statement of operations. Properties Held for Contribution. As of December 31, 2006, we held for contribution to co investment joint ventures, nine industrial projects with an aggregate net book value of $154.0 million, which, when contributed to a joint venture, will reduce our current ownership interest from approximately 100% to an expected range of 15 50%. Properties Held for Divestiture. As of December 31, 2006, we held for divestiture four industrial projects, which are not in our core markets, do not meet our current strategic objectives or which we have included as part of our development for sale program. The divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. As of December 31, 2006, the net carrying value of the properties held for divestiture was $20.9 million. Expected net sales proceeds exceed the net carrying value of the properties. Co investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund certain acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. We generally consolidate these joint ventures for financial reporting purposes because they are not variable interest entities and because we are the sole managing general partner and control all major operating decisions. However, in certain cases, our co investment joint ventures are unconsolidated because we do not control all major operating decisions and the general partners do not have significant rights under EITF 04 5. Third party equity interests in the joint ventures are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2006, we owned approximately 64.3 million square feet of our properties (51.6% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so.

(7) AMB DFS Fund I, LLC is a co investment partnership formed in 2006 with a subsidiary of GE Real Estate to build and sell properties. We also have a 0.1% unconsolidated equity interest (with an approximate 33% economic interest) in AMB Pier One, LLC, a joint venture related to the 2000 redevelopment of the pier which houses our office space in the San Francisco Bay Area. The investment is not consolidated because we do not exercise control over major operating decisions such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, investment activity and changes in financing. We have an option to purchase the remaining equity interest beginning January 1, 2007 and expiring December 31, 2009, based on the fair market value as stipulated in the joint venture agreement. As of December 31, 2006, we also had an approximate 39.0% unconsolidated equity interest in G.Accion, a Mexican real estate company. G.Accion provides management and development services for industrial, retail, residential and office properties in Mexico. In addition, as of December 31, 2006, one of our subsidiaries also had an approximate 5% interest in IAT Air Cargo Facilities Income Fund (IAT), a Canadian income trust specializing in aviation related real estate at Canadas leading international airports. This equity investment is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Common and Preferred Equity. We have authorized for issuance 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which the following series were designated as of December 31, 2006: 1,595,337 shares of series D preferred; 510,000 shares of series I cumulative redeemable preferred; 800,000 shares of series J cumulative redeemable preferred; 800,000 shares of series K cumulative redeemable preferred; 2,300,000 shares of series L cumulative redeemable preferred, of which 2,000,000 are outstanding; 2,300,000 shares of series M cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which are outstanding; 3,000,000 shares of series O cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which are outstanding; and 2,000,000 shares of series P cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which are outstanding.

On September 24, 2004, AMB Property II, L.P., a partnership in which Texas AMB I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and our indirect subsidiary, owns an approximate 8.0% general partnership interest and the operating partnership owns an approximate 92% common limited partnership interest, issued 729,582 5.00% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units at a price of $50.00 per unit. The series N preferred units were issued to Robert Pattillo Properties, Inc. in exchange for the contribution to AMB Property II, L.P of certain parcels of land that are located in multiple markets. Effective January 27, 2006, Robert Pattillo Properties, Inc. exercised its rights under its Put Agreement, dated September 24, 2004, with the operating partnership, and sold all of the series N preferred units to the operating partnership for an aggregate price of $36.6 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions. Also on January 27, 2006, AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased all of the series N preferred units from the operating partnership at an aggregate price of $36.6 million and cancelled all of the outstanding series N preferred units as of such date.

The operating partnership used the proceeds, in addition to proceeds previously contributed to the operating partnership from other equity issuances, to redeem all 3,995,800 of its 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units from us on July 28, 2003. We, in turn, used those proceeds to redeem all 3,995,800 of our 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for $100.2 million, including all accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, to the redemption date. In December 2005, our board of directors approved a new two year common stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of our common stock. We did not repurchase or retire any shares of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2006. Debt. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, we presently intend to operate with an our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio of approximately 45% or less. As of December 31, 2006, our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio was 34.2%. (See footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratios table below for our definitions of our share of total market capitalization, market equity and our share of total debt.) However, we typically finance our co investment joint ventures with secured debt at a loan to value ratio of 50 65% per our joint venture agreements. Additionally, we currently intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these policies, however, our organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our management could alter or eliminate these policies without stockholder approval or circumstances could arise that could render us unable to comply with these policies. As of December 31, 2006, the aggregate principal amount of our secured debt was $1.4 billion, excluding unamortized debt premiums of $6.3 million. Of the $1.4 billion of secured debt, $1.0 billion is secured by properties in our joint ventures. The secured debt is generally non recourse and bears interest at rates varying from 2.9% to 10.4% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 6.2%) and final maturity dates ranging from February 2007 to January 2025. As of December 31, 2006, $1.0 billion of the secured debt obligations bear interest at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 6.1%, while the remaining $386.1 million bear interest at variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 4.7%). As of December 31, 2006, the operating partnership had outstanding an aggregate of $1.1 billion in unsecured senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 6.2% and had a weighted average term of 4.8 years. These unsecured senior debt securities include $300.0 million in notes issued in June 1998, $225.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2000 medium term note program, $275.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2002 medium term note program, $175.0 million of medium term notes, which were issued under the operating partnerships 2006 medium term note program and approximately $112.5 million of 5.094% Notes Due 2015, which were issued to Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America on July 11, 2005 in a private placement, in exchange for the cancellation of $100.0 million of notes that were issued in June 1998 resulting in a discount of approximately $12.5 million. The unsecured senior debt securities are subject to various covenants. Also included is a $25.0 million promissory note which matures in January 2007. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to its senior debt securities. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then our cash flow may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Credit Facilities. On June 1, 2006, the operating partnership entered into a third amended and restated $550.0 million unsecured revolving credit agreement that replaced its then existing $500.0 million credit facility, which was to mature on June 1, 2007. We are a guarantor of the operating partnerships obligations under the credit facility. The line, which matures on June 1, 2010, carries a one year extension option and can be increased to up to 56 $700.0 million upon certain conditions. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the operating partnerships long term debt rating, which was 42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2006, with an annual facility fee of 15 basis points. The four year credit facility includes a multi currency component, under which up to $550.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Euros, Yen or British Pounds Sterling. The operating partnership uses its unsecured credit facility principally for acquisitions, funding development activity and general working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on the credit facility was $303.7 million and the remaining amount available was $234.6 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $11.7 million. The outstanding balance included borrowings denominated in Euros, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately $303.7 million U.S. dollars. On June 23, 2006, AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating partnership and as the initial borrower, entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement for a 45.0 billion Yen unsecured revolving credit facility, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately $377.9 million U.S. dollars. This replaced the 35.0 billion Yen unsecured revolving credit facility executed on June 29, 2004, as previously amended, which using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately $293.9 million U.S. dollars. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K. under the credit facility, as well as the obligations of any other entity in which the operating partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the credit agreement. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and for other real estate purposes in Japan, China and South Korea. Generally, borrowers under the credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the credit facility with certain real estate assets or equity in entities holding such real estate assets. The credit facility matures in June 2010 and has a one year extension option. The credit facility can be increased to up to 55.0 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately $461.9 million U.S. dollars. The extension option is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding commitments under the facility at that time. The rate on the borrowings is generally TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt and was 42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2006. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, payable in quarterly amounts, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt, and was 15 basis points of the outstanding commitments under the facility as of December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, was $320.9 million in U.S. dollars. On June 13, 2006, the operating partnership and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries entered into a fourth amended and restated credit agreement for a $250.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which replaced the third amended and restated credit agreement for a $250.0 million unsecured credit facility. On February 16, 2006, the third amended and restated credit agreement replaced the then existing $100.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that was to mature in June 2008. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations for such subsidiaries and other entities controlled by us or the operating partnership that are selected by the operating partnership from time to time to be borrowers under and pursuant to the credit facility. The four year credit facility includes a multi currency component under which up to $250.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Singapore dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros. The line, which matures in February 2010 and carries a one year extension option, can be increased to up to $350.0 million upon certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding commitments. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships senior unsecured long term debt, which was 60 basis points as of December 31, 2006, with an annual facility fee based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships senior unsecured long term debt. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and general working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on this facility was approximately $227.4 million. The credit agreement contains affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios by the operating partnership, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. 57 Mortgages Receivable. Through a wholly owned subsidiary, we hold a mortgage loan receivable on AMB Pier One, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture. The note bears interest at 13.0% and matures in May 2026. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on the note was $12.7 million. We also hold a loan receivable on G. Accion, an unconsolidated joint venture totaling $6.1 million with an interest rate of 10.0%. The loan matures in March 2010.

As of December 31, 2006, we had $21.1 million in restricted cash. Our board of directors declared a regular cash dividend for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 of $0.46 per share of common stock, and the operating partnership announced its intention to pay a regular cash distribution for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 of $0.46 per common unit. The dividends and distributions were payable on January 5, 2007 to stockholders and unitholders of record on December 22, 2006. The series L, M, O and P preferred stock dividends were payable on January 16, 2007 to stockholders of record on January 5, 2007. The series J and K preferred unit quarterly distributions were payable on January 16, 2007. The series D and I preferred unit quarterly distributions were paid on December 25, 2006. The following table sets forth the dividends and distributions paid or payable per share or unit for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004: Paying Entity Security 2006 2005 2004 AMB Property Corporation Common stock $ 1.84 $ 1.76 $ 1.70 AMB Property Corporation Series L preferred stock $ 1.63 $ 1.63 $ 1.63 AMB Property Corporation Series M preferred stock $ 1.69 $ 1.69 $ 1.69 AMB Property Corporation Series O preferred stock $ 1.75 $ 0.09 n/a AMB Property Corporation Series P preferred stock $ 0.60 n/a n/a Operating Partnership Common limited partnership units $ 1.84 $ 1.76 $ 1.70 Operating Partnership Series J preferred units $ 3.98 $ 3.98 $ 3.98 Operating Partnership Series K preferred units $ 3.98 $ 3.98 $ 3.98 AMB Property II, L.P.

(2) In September 2006, AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased all of its outstanding series F preferred units. (3) In March 2006, AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased all of its outstanding series H preferred units. (4) The holder of the series N preferred units exercised its put option in January 2006 and sold all of its series N preferred units to the operating partnership and AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased all of such units from the operating partnership. The anticipated size of our distributions, using only cash from operations, will not allow us to retire all of our debt as it comes due. Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Commitments Development Starts. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we initiated 30 new industrial development projects in North America, Europe and Asia with a total expected investment of $914.3 million, aggregating approximately 10.4 million square feet. During 2005, we initiated 30 new industrial development projects in North America, Europe and Asia with a total expected investment of $522.4 million, aggregating approximately 7.0 million square feet. 60 Development Pipeline. As of December 31, 2006, we had 45 industrial projects in our development pipeline, which will total approximately 13.7 million square feet, and will have an aggregate estimated investment of $1.3 billion upon completion. We have an additional ten development projects available for sale or contribution totaling approximately 3.0 million square feet, with an aggregate estimated investment of $199.2 million. One of these ten projects totaling $13.0 million and approximately 0.2 million square feet is held in an unconsolidated joint venture. As of December 31, 2006, we and our joint venture partners had funded an aggregate of $814.5 million and needed to fund an estimated additional $481.0 million in order to complete our development pipeline which includes projects expected to be completed through the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we acquired 835 acres of land for industrial warehouse development in North America and Asia for approximately $293.2 million. Acquisitions. During 2006, we acquired 106 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 9.8 million square feet for a total expected investment of $834.2 million (includes acquisition costs of $814.1 million and estimated acquisition capital of $20.1 million), of which we acquired 70 buildings through one of our unconsolidated co investment joint ventures. We generally fund our acquisitions through private capital contributions, borrowings under our credit facilities, cash, debt issuances and net proceeds from property divestitures. Lease Commitments. We have entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily on tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms from one to 55 years. These buildings and improvements are amortized ratably over the lesser of the terms of the related leases or 40 years. Future minimum rental payments required under non cancelable operating leases in effect as of December 31, 2006 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2007 $ 21,636 2008 22,186 2009 21,506 2010 20,667 2011 20,668 Thereafter 272,483 Total $ 379,146 Co investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. As of December 31, 2006, we had investments in co investment joint ventures with a gross book value of $1.9 billion, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, and net equity investments in four unconsolidated co investment joint ventures of $236.0 million and a gross book value of $2.5 billion. As of December 31, 2006, we may make additional capital contributions to current and planned co investment joint ventures of up to $168.2 million (using the exchange rates at December 31, 2006) pursuant to the terms of the joint venture agreements. From time to time, we may raise additional equity commitments for AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open ended unconsolidated co investment joint venture formed in 2004 with institutional investors, which invests through a private real estate investment trust. This would increase our obligation to make additional capital commitments. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of this fund, we are obligated to contribute 20% of the total equity commitments to the fund until such time our total equity commitment is greater than $150.0 million, at which time, our obligation is reduced to 10% of the total equity commitments. We expect to fund these contributions with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances or net proceeds from property divestitures, which could adversely effect our cash flow. Captive Insurance Company. In December 2001, we formed a wholly owned captive insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., (Arcata), which provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the deductible under our third party policies. The captive insurance company is one element of our overall risk management program. We capitalized Arcata in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata established annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss experience of our properties. Annually, 61 we engage an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims, related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata may be adjusted based on this estimate. Like premiums paid to third party insurance companies, premiums paid to Arcata may be reimbursed by customers pursuant to specific lease terms. Through this structure, we believe that we have more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market. Potential Contingent and Unknown Liabilities. Contingent and unknown liabilities may include the following: liabilities for environmental conditions; claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to our formation or acquisition transactions that had not been asserted prior to our formation or acquisition transactions; accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; tax liabilities; and claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these entities. Overview of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our debt, interest and lease payments due by period as of December 31, 2006 (dollars in thousands): Less than More than Contractual Obligations 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Total Debt $ 213,869 $ 592,085 $ 1,593,035 $ 1,042,699 $ 3,441,688 Debt interest payments 13,861 38,126 74,416 58,775 185,178 Operating lease commitments 21,636 43,692 41,335 272,483 379,146 Construction commitments 31,713 57,042 88,755 Total $ 281,079 $ 730,945 $ 1,708,786 $ 1,373,957 $ 4,094,767 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Standby Letters of Credit. As of December 31, 2006, we had provided approximately $22.1 million in letters of credit, of which $11.7 million was provided under the operating partnerships $550.0 million unsecured credit facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other commitments. Guarantees. Other than parent guarantees associated with the unsecured debt, as of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding guarantees in the aggregate amount of $48.2 million in connection with certain acquisitions. As of December 31, 2006, we guaranteed $26.8 million and $83.2 million on outstanding loans on two of our consolidated joint ventures and two of our unconsolidated joint ventures, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2006, we guaranteed $87.3 million on outstanding property debt related to one of our unconsolidated joint ventures. Performance and Surety Bonds. As of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $11.4 million. These bonds were issued in connection with certain of our development projects and were posted to guarantee certain tax obligations and the construction of certain real property improvements and infrastructure, such as grading, sewers and streets. Performance and surety bonds are commonly required by public agencies from real estate developers. Performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the taxes due or the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. Promoted Interests and Other Contractual Obligations. Upon the achievement of certain return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, we may be obligated to make payments to certain of our joint venture partners 62 pursuant to the terms and provisions of their contractual agreements with us. From time to time in the normal course of our business, we enter into various contracts with third parties that may obligate us to make payments, pay promotes, or perform other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. SUPPLEMENTAL EARNINGS MEASURES FFO. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider funds from operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. FFO is defined as net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, less gains (or losses) from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estate related depreciation, and adjustments to derive our pro rata share of FFO of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. Further, we do not adjust FFO to eliminate the effects of non recurring charges. We believe that FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. We believe that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. The following table reflects the calculation of FFO reconciled from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Net income(1) $ 224,072 $ 257,807 $ 125,471 $ 129,128 $ 121,119 Gains from dispositions of real estate, net of minority interests(2) (42,635 ) (132,652 ) (47,224 ) (50,325 ) (19,383 ) Real estate, related depreciation and amortization: Total depreciation and amortization 177,824 161,732 136,610 111,879 103,550 Discontinued operations depreciation 2,153 18,572 30,740 30,458 32,953 Non real estate depreciation (4,546 ) (3,388 ) (871 ) (720 ) (712 ) Ground lease amortization (2,301 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from consolidated joint ventures: Joint venture partners minority interests (Net income) 37,975 36,401 29,360 22,276 16,529 63 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Net income) 2,805 3,411 2,384 2,117 3,303 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Development profits) 4,948 2,262 435 344 57 Discontinued operations minority interests (Net income) 31 8,769 13,964 15,214 16,597 FFO attributable to minority interests (82,861 ) (100,275 ) (80,192 ) (65,603 ) (52,051 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures: Our share of net income (23,240 ) (10,770 ) (3,781 ) (5,445 ) (5,674 ) Our share of FFO 16,038 14,441 7,549 9,755 9,291 Our share of development profits, net of taxes 5,441 Preferred stock dividends (13,582 ) (7,388 ) (7,131 ) (6,999 ) (8,496 ) Preferred stock and unit redemption discount (issuance costs) (1,070 ) (5,413 ) 412 Funds from operations $ 297,912 $ 254,363 $ 207,314 $ 186,666 $ 215,194 Basic FFO per common share and unit $ 3.24 $ 2.87 $ 2.39 $ 2.17 $ 2.44 Diluted FFO per common share and unit $ 3.12 $ 2.75 $ 2.30 $ 2.13 $ 2.40 Weighted average common shares and units: Basic 92,047,678 88,684,262 86,885,250 85,859,899 88,204,208 Diluted 95,444,072 92,508,725 90,120,250 87,616,365 89,689,310 (1) Includes gains from undepreciated land sales of $5.6 million, $25.0 million, $3.7 million and $1.2 million for 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. (2) The information for 2005 includes accumulated depreciation re capture of approximately $1.1 million associated with the sale of the Interstate Crossdock redevelopment project. SS NOI. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider same store net operating income, or SS NOI, to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. For properties that are considered part of the same store pool, see Part I, Item 2: Properties Industrial Properties Owned and Managed Market Operating Statistics, Note 6, and Owned and Managed Operating and Leasing Statistics Owned and Managed Same Store Operating Statistics, Note 2. In deriving SS NOI, we define NOI as rental revenues (as calculated in accordance with GAAP), including reimbursements, less straight line rents, property operating expenses and real estate taxes. We exclude straight line rents in calculating SS NOI because we believe it provides a better measure of actual cash basis rental growth for a year over year comparison. In addition, we believe that SS NOI helps the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate as compared to other companies. While SS NOI is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. SS NOI also does not reflect general and administrative expense, interest expenses, depreciation and amortization costs, capital expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development and construction activities that could materially impact our results from operations. Further, our computation of SS NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating SS NOI. 64 The following table reconciles SS NOI from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Net income $ 224,072 $ 257,807 $ 125,471 Private capital income (46,102 ) (43,942 ) (12,895 ) Depreciation and amortization 177,824 161,732 136,610 Impairment losses 6,312 General and administrative 104,262 71,564 57,181 Other expenses 2,620 5,038 2,554 Fund costs 2,091 1,482 1,741 Total other income and expenses 26,178 57,044 119,727 Total minority interests share of income 62,855 74,777 52,863 Total discontinued operations (51,949 ) (127,498 ) (63,888 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (193 ) Net Operating Income (NOI) 507,970 458,004 419,364 Less non same store NOI (116,030 ) (70,782 ) (19,990 ) Less non cash adjustments(1) (8,426 ) (9,861 ) (8,249 ) Cash basis same store NOI $ 383,514 $ 377,361 $ 391,125 (1) Non cash adjustments include straight line rents and amortization of lease intangibles for the same store pool only. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices, interest rates and international exchange rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimize the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings and our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2006, we had three outstanding interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $38.1 million (in U.S. dollars). See Financial Instruments below. The table below summarizes the market risks associated with our fixed and variable rate debt outstanding before net unamortized debt discounts of $4.3 million as of December 31, 2006 (dollars in thousands): 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Fixed rate debt(1) $ 155,384 $ 368,141 $ 152,151 $ 430,676 $ 288,835 $ 768,320 $ 2,163,507 Average interest rate 6.7 % 7.1 % 4.7 % 6.4 % 6.8 % 5.9 % 6.3 % Variable rate debt(2) $ 58,485 $ 22,604 $ 49,189 $ 854,543 $ 18,981 $ 274,379 $ 1,278,181 Average interest rate 5.9 % 6.6 % 6.8 % 3.1 % 3.8 % 4.9 % 3.8 % Interest Payments $ 13,861 $ 27,630 $ 10,496 $ 54,054 $ 20,362 $ 58,775 $ 185,178 (1) Represents 62.9% of all outstanding debt. (2) Represents 37.1% of all outstanding debt. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased or decreased by 10%, then the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would be $4.9 million (net of swaps) annually. As of December 31, 65 2006, the book value and the estimated fair value of our total consolidated debt (both secured and unsecured) was $3.4 and $3.5 billion, respectively, based on our estimate of current market interest rates. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, variable rate debt comprised 37.1% and 24.5%, respectively, of all our outstanding debt. Variable rate debt was $1.3 billion and $831.7 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. The increase is primarily due to higher outstanding balances on our credit facilities. This increase in our outstanding variable rate debt increases our risk associated with unfavorable interest rate fluctuations. Financial Instruments. We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income or income. For revenues or expenses denominated in non functional currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments in effect at December 31, 2006 were three interest rate swaps hedging cash flows of our variable rate borrowings based on U.S. Libor (USD) and Euribor (Europe). The following table summarizes our financial instruments as of December 31, 2006 (in thousands): Maturity Dates Related Derivatives (in thousands) December 8, 2008 June 8, 2010 November 1, 2014 Notional Amount Fair Value Interest Rate Swaps: Plain Interest Rate Swap, Europe Notional Amount (U.S. dollars) $ 9,655 $ 9,655 Receive Floating(%) 3MEURIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 3.72 % Fair Market Value $ 54 Plain Interest Rate Swap, USD Notional Amount (U.S. dollars) $ 25,000 25,000 Receive Floating(%) 3MLIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 5.17 % Fair Market Value (130 ) Plain Interest Rate Swap, Europe Notional Amount (U.S. dollars) $ 3,471 3,471 Receive Floating(%) 3MEURIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 4.26 % Fair Market Value (45 ) Total $ 38,126 $ (121 ) International Operations. Our exposure to market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries operating in the United States and Mexico. The functional currency for our subsidiaries operating outside the United States is generally the local currency of the country in which the entity is located, mitigating the effect of foreign exchange gains and losses. Our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. We translate income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. The losses resulting from the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity and totaled $0.2 million for year ended December 31, 2006. Our international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. In these instances, non monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2006, losses from remeasurement and the sale of four foreign exchange agreements included in our results of operations totaled $0.8 million. We also record gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated. 66
