Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Liquidity and Capital Resources for our definitions of market equity and our share of total debt. The aggregate amount of indebtedness that we may incur under our policy increases directly with an increase in the market price per share of our capital stock. Further, our management could alter or eliminate this policy without stockholder approval. If we change this policy, then we could become more highly leveraged, resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect the cash available for distribution to our stockholders. 14 Table of Contents We face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing and interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2007, we had total debt outstanding of $3.5 billion. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to the senior debt securities referenced in our financial statements. We are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest. We anticipate that we will repay only a small portion of the principal of our debt prior to maturity. Accordingly, we will likely need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds of other capital transactions, then we expect that our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all such maturing debt and to pay dividends to our stockholders. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. Higher interest rates on newly incurred debt may negatively impact us as well. If interest rates increase, our interest costs and overall costs of capital will increase, which could adversely affect our transaction and development activity, financial condition, results of operation, cash flow, the market price of our stock, our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. In addition, if we mortgage one or more of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments, then the property could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income and asset value. A foreclosure on one or more of our properties could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. As of December 31, 2007, we had outstanding guarantees in the amount of $95.9 million in connection with certain acquisitions. As of December 31, 2007, we also guaranteed $41.2 million and $107.9 million on outstanding loans on five of our consolidated co investment ventures and two of our unconsolidated co investment ventures, respectively. Also, we have entered into contribution agreements with certain of our unconsolidated co investment venture funds. These contribution agreements require us to make additional capital contributions to the applicable co investment venture fund upon certain defaults by the co investment venture of its debt obligations to the lenders. Such additional capital contributions will cover all or part of the applicable co investment ventures debt obligation and may be greater than our share of the co investment ventures debt obligation or the value of our share of any property securing such debt. Our contribution obligations under these agreements will be reduced by the amounts recovered by the lender and the fair market value of the property, if any, used to secure the debt and obtained by the lender upon default. Our potential obligations under these contribution agreements were $160.2 million as of December 31, 2007. We intend to continue to guarantee debt of our unconsolidated co investment venture funds and make additional contributions to our unconsolidated co investment venture funds in connection with property contributions to the funds. Such payment obligations under such guarantees and contribution obligations under such contribution agreements, if required to be paid, could be of a magnitude that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively affect our financing activity. The credit ratings of our senior unsecured long term debt and preferred stock are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us. Our credit ratings can affect the amount of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financings we may obtain. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings, and in the event our current credit ratings are downgraded, we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and may encounter difficulty in obtaining additional financing. Also, a downgrade in our credit ratings may trigger additional payments or other negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments. Since we depend on debt financing to fund our acquisition and development activity, adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our development and acquisition activity, future growth, financial condition, and the market price of our stock. 15 Table of Contents Covenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our financial condition. The terms of our credit agreements and other indebtedness require that we comply with a number of financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage. These covenants may limit flexibility in our operations, and our failure to comply with these covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt agreement even if we have satisfied our payment obligations. As of December 31, 2007, we had certain non recourse, secured loans, which are cross collateralized by multiple properties. If we default on any of these loans, we may then be required to repay such indebtedness, together with applicable prepayment charges, to avoid foreclosure on all the cross collateralized properties within the applicable pool. Foreclosure on our properties, or our inability to refinance our loans on favorable terms, could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. In addition, our credit facilities and senior debt securities contain certain cross default provisions, which are triggered in the event that our other material indebtedness is in default. These cross default provisions may require us to repay or restructure the credit facilities and the senior debt securities in addition to any mortgage or other debt that is in default, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rates may adversely affect results of operations. We seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements, such as interest rate cap agreements and interest rate swap agreements. These agreements involve risks, such as the risk that the counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes and that a court could rule that such agreements are not legally enforceable. Hedging may reduce overall returns on our investments. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may materially adversely affect our results of operations. Conflicts of Interest Risks Some of our directors and executive officers are involved in other real estate activities and investments and, therefore, may have conflicts of interest with us. From time to time, certain of our executive officers and directors may own interests in other real estate related businesses and investments, including de minimis holdings of the equity securities of public and private real estate companies. Our executive officers involvement in other real estate related activities could divert their attention from our day to day operations. Our executive officers have entered into non competition agreements with us pursuant to which they have agreed not to engage in any activities, directly or indirectly, in respect of commercial real estate, and not to make any investment in respect of any industrial or retail real estate, other than through ownership of not more than 5% of the outstanding shares of a public company engaged in such activities or through certain specified investments. State law may limit our ability to enforce these agreements. We will not acquire any properties from our executive officers, directors or their affiliates unless the transaction is approved by a majority of the disinterested and independent (as defined by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange) members of our board of directors with respect to that transaction. Our role as general partner of the operating partnership may conflict with the interests of our stockholders. As the general partner of the operating partnership, we have fiduciary obligations to the operating partnerships limited partners, the discharge of which may conflict with the interests of our stockholders. In addition, those persons holding limited partnership units will have the right to vote as a class on certain amendments to the operating partnerships partnership agreement and individually to approve certain amendments that would adversely affect their rights. The limited partners may exercise these voting rights in a manner that conflicts with the interests of our stockholders. In addition, under the terms of the operating partnerships partnership agreement, holders of limited partnership units will have certain approval rights with respect to certain transactions that affect all stockholders but which they may not exercise in a manner that reflects the interests of all stockholders. 16 Table of Contents Risks Associated with Government Regulations The costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations and any related potential liability could exceed our budgets for these items. Under various environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at, on, under or in its property. The costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial. These laws typically impose liability and clean up responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean up costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury, property damage or other costs, including investigation and clean up costs, resulting from the environmental contamination. Environmental laws in some countries, including the United States, also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos. Some of our properties may contain asbestos containing building materials. In addition, some of our properties are leased or have been leased, in part, to owners and operators of businesses that use, store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances. Further, certain of our properties are on, adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, or upon which others have engaged, are engaged or may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances. From time to time, we may acquire properties, or interests in properties, with known adverse environmental conditions where we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior risk adjusted return. In such an instance, we underwrite the costs of environmental investigation, clean up and monitoring into the acquisition cost and obtain appropriate environmental insurance for the property. Further, in connection with certain divested properties, we have agreed to remain responsible for, and to bear the cost of, remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties. At the time of acquisition, we subject all of our properties to a Phase I or similar environmental assessments by independent environmental consultants and we may have additional Phase II testing performed upon the consultants recommendation. These environmental assessments have not revealed, and we are not aware of, any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. Nonetheless, it is possible that the assessments did not reveal all environmental liabilities and that there are material environmental liabilities unknown to us, or that known environmental conditions may give rise to liabilities that are greater than we anticipated. Further, our properties current environmental condition may be affected by customers, the condition of land, operations in the vicinity of the properties (such as releases from underground storage tanks) or by unrelated third parties. If the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations exceed our budgets for these items, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar regulations could result in substantial costs. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, places of public accommodation must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. If we are required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, including removing access barriers, then our cash 17 Table of Contents flow and the amounts available for dividends to our stockholders may be adversely affected. Our properties are also subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. We could incur fines or private damage awards if we fail to comply with these requirements. While we believe that our properties are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements, the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us that will affect our cash flow and results of operations. Federal Income Tax Risks Our failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust would have serious adverse consequences to our stockholders. We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Internal Revenue Code) commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1997. We currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code and believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify. Qualification as a real estate investment trust requires us to satisfy numerous requirements (some on an annual and others on a quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex sections of the Internal Revenue Code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. For example, in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we must derive at least 95% of our gross income in any year from qualifying sources. In addition, we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis. These provisions and the applicable Treasury regulations are more complicated in our case because we hold our assets through the operating partnership. Legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a real estate investment trust or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. However, we are not aware of any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect our ability to qualify as a real estate investment trust. If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable year, we will be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment trust for the four taxable years following the year in which we lost our qualification. If we lost our real estate investment trust status, our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved. In addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. Certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction. From time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties, including by contributing properties to our co investment venture funds. Under the Internal Revenue Code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100% penalty tax. We do not believe that our transfers or disposals of property or our contributions of properties into our co investment venture funds are properly treated as prohibited transactions. However, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Service may contend that certain transfers or dispositions of properties by us or contributions of properties into our co investment venture funds are prohibited transactions. While we believe that the Internal Revenue Service would not prevail in any such dispute, if the Internal Revenue Service were to argue successfully that a transfer, disposition, or contribution of property constituted a prohibited transaction, we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable 18 Table of Contents to us from the prohibited transaction. In addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a real estate investment trust. Risks Associated With Our Dependence on Key Personnel We depend on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. From time to time, our personnel and their roles may change. While we believe that we could find suitable employees to meet our personnel needs, the loss of key personnel, any change in their roles, or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers. Because our compensation packages include equity based incentives, pressure on our stock price or limitations on our ability to award such incentives could affect our ability to offer competitive compensation packages to our executives and key employees. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain our executive officers, or if compensation costs required to attract and retain key employees become more expensive, our performance and competitive position could be materially adversely affected. Risks Associated with Our Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting. The design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. While management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Deficiencies, including any material weakness, in our internal control over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, a decline in our stock price, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Risks Associated with Ownership of Our Stock Limitations in our charter and bylaws could prevent a change in control. Certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay, defer or prevent a change in control or other transaction that could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for the common stock. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock may be owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code to include certain entities) during the last half of a taxable year after the first taxable year for which a real estate investment trust election is made. Furthermore, our common stock must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a 12 month taxable year (or a proportionate part of a short tax year). In addition, if we, or an owner of 10% or more of our stock, actually or constructively owns 10% or more of one of our customers (or a customer of any partnership in which we are a partner), then the rent received by us (either directly or through any such partnership) from that customer will not be qualifying income for purposes of the real estate investment trust gross income tests of the Internal Revenue Code. To help us maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, we prohibit the ownership, actually or by virtue of the constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, by any single person, of more than 9.8% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the issued and outstanding shares of each of our common stock, series L preferred stock, series M preferred stock, series O preferred stock, and series P preferred stock (unless such limitations are waived by our board of directors). We also prohibit the ownership, actually or constructively, of any shares of our series D preferred stock by any single person so that no such person, taking into account all of our stock so owned by such person, including any common stock or other series of preferred stock, may own in excess of 9.8% of our issued and outstanding capital stock (unless such limitations are waived by our board of directors). We refer to this limitation as 19 Table of Contents the ownership limit. The charter provides that shares acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary. The charter further provides that any person who acquires shares in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any dividends on the shares or be entitled to vote the shares or receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the shares in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the shares or the amount realized from the sale. A transfer of shares in violation of the above limits may be void under certain circumstances. The ownership limit may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control and, therefore, could adversely affect our stockholders ability to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for the shares of our common stock in connection with such transaction. Our charter authorizes us to issue additional shares of common and preferred stock and to establish the preferences, rights and other terms of any series or class of preferred stock that we issue. Although our board of directors has no intention to do so at the present time, it could establish a series or class of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction, including a change in control, that might involve a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. Our charter and bylaws and Maryland law also contain other provisions that may impede various actions by stockholders without approval of our board of directors, which in turn may delay, defer or prevent a transaction, including a change in control. Those provisions in our charter and bylaws include: directors may be removed only for cause and only upon a two thirds vote of stockholders; our board can fix the number of directors within set limits (which limits are subject to change by our board), and fill vacant directorships upon the vote of a majority of the remaining directors, even though less than a quorum, or in the case of a vacancy resulting from an increase in the size of the board, a majority of the entire board; stockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or propose business for consideration at a stockholders meeting; and the request of the holders of 50% or more of our common stock is necessary for stockholders to call a special meeting. Those provisions provided for under Maryland law include: a two thirds vote of stockholders is required to amend our charter; and stockholders may only act by written consent with the unanimous approval of all stockholders entitled to vote on the matter in question. In addition, our board could elect to adopt, without stockholder approval, certain other provisions under Maryland law that may impede a change in control. The price per share of our stock may fluctuate significantly. The market price per share of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, including: actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results or dividends; changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates; publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry; the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate based companies); general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of our stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends; a change in analyst ratings or our credit ratings; changes in market valuations of similar companies; 20 Table of Contents adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future; additions or departures of key management personnel; actions by institutional stockholders; speculation in the press or investment community; terrorist activity may adversely affect the markets in which our securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending; governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws; the realization of any of the other risk factors included or incorporated by reference in this report; and general market and economic conditions. Many of the factors listed above are beyond our control. These factors may cause the market price of shares of our common stock to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or our prospects. If we issue additional securities, then the investment of existing stockholders will be diluted. As a real estate investment trust, we are dependent on external sources of capital and may issue common or preferred stock or debt securities to fund our future capital needs. We have authority to issue shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities, and to cause the operating partnership or AMB Property II, L.P., to issue limited partnership units, in exchange for property or otherwise. Existing stockholders have no preemptive right to acquire any additional securities issued by the operating partnership, AMB Property II, L.P., or us and any issuance of additional equity securities may adversely effect the market price of our stock and could result in dilution of an existing stockholders investment. Earnings, cash dividends, asset value and market interest rates affect the price of our stock. As a real estate investment trust, the market value of our equity securities, in general, is based primarily upon the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash dividends. Our equity securities market value is based secondarily upon the market value of our underlying real estate assets. For this reason, shares of our stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than our net asset value per share. To the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working capital reserves, or other purposes, these retained funds, while increasing the value of our underlying assets, may not correspondingly increase the market price of our stock. Our failure to meet the markets expectations with regard to future earnings and cash dividends likely would adversely affect the market price of our stock. Further, the distribution yield on the stock (as a percentage of the price of the stock) relative to market interest rates may also influence the price of our stock. An increase in market interest rates might lead prospective purchasers of our stock to expect a higher distribution yield, which would adversely affect our stocks market price. Additionally, if the market price of our stock declines significantly, then we might breach certain covenants with respect to our debt obligations, which could adversely affect our liquidity and ability to make future acquisitions and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. We could change our investment and financing policies without a vote of stockholders. Subject to our current investment policy to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust (unless a change is approved by our board of directors under certain circumstances), our board of directors determines our investment and financing policies, our growth strategy and our debt, capitalization, distribution and operating policies. Our board of directors may revise or amend these strategies and policies at any time without a vote of stockholders. Any such changes may not serve the interests of all stockholders and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations, including our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. Shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The operating partnership and AMB Property II, L.P. had 3,992,607 common limited partnership units issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2007, which may be exchanged generally one year after their issuance on a 21 Table of Contents one for one basis into shares of our common stock. In the future, the operating partnership or AMB Property II, L.P. may issue additional limited partnership units, and we may issue shares of common stock, in connection with the acquisition of properties or in private placements. These shares of common stock and the shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of limited partnership units may be sold in the public securities markets over time, pursuant to registration rights that we have granted, or may grant in connection with future issuances, or pursuant to Rule 144. In addition, common stock issued under our stock option and incentive plans may also be sold in the market pursuant to registration statements that we have filed or pursuant to Rule 144. As of December 31, 2007, under our stock option and incentive plans, we had 9,443,727 shares of common stock reserved and available for future issuance, had outstanding options to purchase 5,855,777 shares of common stock (of which 4,660,584 are vested and exercisable) and had 652,838 unvested restricted shares of common stock outstanding. Future sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Further, the existence of the operating partnerships limited partnership units and the shares of our common stock reserved for issuance upon exchange of limited partnership units and the exercise of options, and registration rights referred to above, may adversely affect the terms upon which we are able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES As of December 31, 2007, we owned and managed 1,060 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 118.2 million rentable square feet (on a consolidated basis, we had 788 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 78.0 million rentable square feet), excluding development and renovation projects and recently completed development projects available for sale or contribution, located in 45 markets throughout the United States and in Canada, China, Belgium, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United Kingdom. Our industrial properties were 96.0% leased to 2,591 customers, the largest of which accounted for no more than 3.5% of our annualized base rent from our industrial properties. See Part IV, Item 15: Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for segment information related to our operations. Property Characteristics. Our industrial properties, which consist primarily of warehouse distribution facilities suitable for single or multiple customers, are typically comprised of multiple buildings. The following table identifies types and characteristics of our industrial buildings and each types percentage, based on square footage, of our total owned and managed operating portfolio, which we define as properties in which we have at least a 10% ownership interest, for which we are the property or asset manager, and which we intend to hold for the long term. December 31, Building Type Description 2007 2006 Warehouse Customers typically 15,000 75,000 square feet, single or multi customer 51.6 % 48.4 % Bulk Warehouse Customers typically over 75,000 square feet, single or multi customer 37.1 % 38.3 % Flex Industrial Includes assembly or research development, single or multi customer 3.6 % 4.5 % Light Industrial Smaller customers, 15,000 square feet or less, higher office finish 3.0 % 3.5 % Trans Shipment Unique configurations for truck terminals and cross docking 1.3 % 1.5 % Air Cargo On tarmac or airport land for transfer of air cargo goods 2.8 % 3.2 % Office Single or multi customer, used strictly for office 0.6 % 0.6 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 22 Table of Contents Lease Terms. Our industrial properties are typically subject to leases on a triple net basis, in which customers pay their proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance and operating costs, or are subject to leases on a modified gross basis, in which customers pay expenses over certain threshold levels. In addition, most of our leases include fixed rental increases or Consumer Price Index based rental increases. Lease terms typically range from three to ten years, with a weighted average of six years, excluding renewal options. However, the majority of our industrial leases do not include renewal options. Overview of Principal Global Markets. Our industrial properties are typically located near key international passenger and cargo airports, seaports and major highway systems in major metropolitan areas, which include Chicago, Northern New Jersey/New York City, Paris, the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, South Florida, Southern California, Tokyo and U.S. On Tarmac. Our other markets in the Americas are Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Boston, Dallas, Guadalajara, Houston, Mexico City, Minneapolis, Monterrey, New Orleans, Orlando, Quertaro, Savannah, Tijuana and Toronto. In Europe, our other markets are Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt, Hamburg, London, Lyon, Madrid, Milan and Rotterdam. In Asia, our markets are Osaka, Seoul, Shanghai and Singapore. Within these metropolitan areas, our industrial properties are generally concentrated in locations with limited new construction opportunities within established, relatively large submarkets, which we believe should provide a higher rate of occupancy and rent growth than properties located elsewhere. These infill locations are typically near major airports, seaports or convenient to major highway systems and rail lines, and are proximate to large and diverse labor pools. There is typically broad demand for industrial space in these centrally located submarkets due to a diverse mix of industries and types of industrial uses, including warehouse distribution, light assembly and manufacturing. We generally avoid locations at the periphery of metropolitan areas where there are fewer constraints to the supply of additional industrial properties. 23 Table of Contents Portfolio Overview The following includes our owned and managed operating portfolio and development properties, investments in operating properties through non managed unconsolidated co investment ventures, and recently completed developments that have not yet been placed in operations but are being held for sale or contribution: Year to Date Trailing AMB Annualized Same Store Four Quarter share of Base NOI Growth Rent Square Square Year to Date Rent(1) Without Lease Change on Feet as of Feet as of Average psf as of Termination Renewals and 12/31/2007 12/31/2007 Occupancy 12/31/2007 Fees(2) Rollovers(3) Southern California 17,514,557 57.1 % 96.5 % $ 6.53 4.9 % 10.2 % Chicago 12,939,948 53.3 % 91.0 % 5.30 4.9 % 0.8 % No. New Jersey/New York 11,115,945 50.1 % 98.6 % 7.21 7.9 % 3.1 % San Francisco Bay Area 10,262,443 72.6 % 96.2 % 6.42 3.8 % (5.5 )% Seattle 7,891,551 49.7 % 96.3 % 5.17 6.0 % 18.6 % South Florida 6,276,291 70.5 % 97.5 % 7.49 10.6 % 12.0 % U.S. On Tarmac(4) 2,629,113 92.6 % 94.2 % 18.69 0.9 % 1.4 % Other U.S. Markets 27,790,006 64.8 % 94.4 % 5.49 3.9 % 1.8 % U.S. Subtotal/Wtd Avg 96,419,854 60.9 % 95.3 % $ 6.42 5.0 % 4.1 % Canada 304,353 100.0 % 87.0 % $ 7.89 0.0 % n/a Mexico City 2,134,089 20.0 % 95.9 % 6.34 (6.9 )% 0.0 % Other Mexico Markets 2,769,507 20.0 % 93.2 % 4.83 (0.2 )% 0.1 % Mexico Subtotal/Wtd Avg 4,903,596 20.0 % 94.4 % $ 5.51 (3.8 )% 0.1 % The Americas Total/Wtd Avg 101,627,803 59.0 % 95.2 % $ 6.38 4.9 % 4.1 % France 3,371,164 20.0 % 94.4 % $ 8.61 16.5 % 10.6 % Germany 2,116,303 19.8 % 99.8 % 9.36 10.4 % (1.2 )% Benelux 2,835,213 21.2 % 99.5 % 10.35 10.1 % n/a Other Europe Markets 178,282 100.0 % 100.0 % 14.39 0.0 % n/a Europe Subtotal/Wtd Avg(5) 8,500,962 22.0 % 97.6 % $ 9.53 13.4 % 7.6 % Tokyo 4,916,517 28.9 % 94.2 % $ 12.24 24.0 % 1.0 % Osaka 1,018,875 20.0 % 92.1 % 9.32 0.0 % n/a Other Japan Markets 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % n/a Japan Subtotal/Wtd Avg(5) 5,935,392 27.4 % 93.8 % $ 11.77 24.0 % 1.0 % Shanghai 1,382,817 69.9 % 99.9 % $ 4.03 38.6 % 48.7 % Singapore 733,321 82.9 % 95.5 % 9.86 0.0 % 2.7 % Other Asia Markets 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % n/a Asia Total/Wtd Avg(5) 8,051,530 39.7 % 95.0 % $ 10.21 24.7 % 19.5 % Owned and Managed Total/Wtd Avg (6) 118,180,295 55.0 % 95.1 % $ 6.87 5.5 % 4.9 % Other Real Estate Investments(7) 7,495,659 54.3 % 95.0 % Total Operating Portfolio 125,675,954 55.0 % 95.1 % Development Pipeline 17,822,820 87.6 % Available for Sale or Contribution(8) 4,190,504 98.3 % Development Subtotal 22,013,324 89.7 % Total Global Portfolio 147,689,278 60.2 % 24 Table of Contents (1) Annualized base rent (ABR) is calculated as monthly base rent (cash basis) per the terms of the lease, as of December 31, 2007, multiplied by 12.

Such investments are consolidated because we own a majority interest or, as general partner, exercise significant control over major operating decisions such as acquisition or disposition decisions, approval of budgets, selection of property managers and changes in financing. Under the agreements governing the co investment ventures, we and the other party to the co investment venture may be required to make additional capital contributions and, subject to certain limitations, the co investment ventures may incur additional debt. Such agreements also impose certain restrictions on the transfer of co investment venture interests by us or the other party to the co investment venture and typically provide certain rights to us or the other party to the co investment venture to sell our or their interest in the co investment venture to the co investment venture or to the other co investment venture partner on terms specified in the agreement. In addition, under certain circumstances, many of the co investment ventures include buy/sell provisions.

(4) Our share of total debt is the pro rata portion of the total debt based on our percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated and unconsolidated co investment ventures holding the debt. We believe that our share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze our leverage and to compare our leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of our debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their co investment ventures. Our share of total debt is not intended to reflect our actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the co investment ventures.

(5) Effective October 1, 2006, we deconsolidated AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. on a prospective basis, due to the re evaluation of the accounting for our investment in the fund because of changes to the partnership agreement regarding the general partners rights effective October 1, 2006. As a result, the financial measures for the years 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003, included in our operating data, other data and balance sheet data above are not comparable. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations GENERAL You should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial statements. We are a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust and expect that we have qualified, and will continue to qualify, as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes beginning with the year ended December 31, 1997. As a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust, our own employees perform our corporate administrative and management functions, rather than our relying on an outside manager for these services. We manage our portfolio of properties generally through direct property management performed by our own employees. Additionally, within our flexible operating model, we may from time to time establish relationships with third party real estate management firms, brokers and developers that provide some property level administrative and management services under our direction. Managements Overview The primary source of our revenue and earnings is rent received from customers under long term (generally three to ten years) operating leases at our properties, including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs. We also generate earnings from our private capital business, which consists of acquisition and development fees, asset management fees and priority distributions, and promoted interests and incentive distributions from our co investment ventures. Additionally, we generate earnings from the disposition of projects in our development for sale and value 37 Table of Contents added conversion programs, from the contributions of development properties to our co investment ventures and from land sales. Our long term growth is driven by our ability to: maintain and increase occupancy rates and or increase rental rates at our properties; continue to develop properties profitably and sell to third parties or contribute to our co investment ventures; and continue to grow our earnings from our private capital business through the contribution of properties or from the acquisition of new properties. Real Estate Operations Real estate fundamentals in the United States industrial markets held steady during 2007 due to balanced supply and demand. According to data provided by Torto Wheaton Research, availability was 9.4% for the quarter ended December 31, 2007, up 20 basis points from the prior quarter and unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2006. Activity levels were lower than the prior year. According to Torto Wheaton Research, absorption was 21.4 million square feet for the fourth quarter and 120.2 million square feet for the full year, down from 209.3 million square feet in 2006, whereas construction completions were 40.3 million square feet in the quarter and 126.8 million square feet for the full year, down from 175.1 million square feet in 2006. While absorption in 2007 was 17.5% below the 19 year quarter average, construction completions were 22.6% below the average for the same period, which we believe indicates a market in equilibrium with a moderating supply of new industrial space entering the market. Reflecting the slowdown in the U.S. economy, we believe that net absorption for the first quarter of 2008 will be at or slightly below the fourth quarter 2007 level and similar in the second quarter of 2008. We presently expect pick up in the second half of 2008 to a full year absorption level approximating that of 2007. With a similar moderation in deliveries, we believe that year end vacancy will also approximate that of 2007. We think the strongest industrial markets in the United States are the major coastal markets tied to global trade, including Southern California which is our largest market Seattle, the San Francisco Bay Area, Northern New Jersey/New York and Miami. While we expect demand to moderate in the first half of 2008, due primarily to the slower growth rate in import volumes and the uncertainty in the economy, we believe our coastal markets will outperform other U.S. industrial markets. These markets have some of the highest occupancy rates in the country and we, therefore, expect to see some further rate growth in 2008, even as the national economic picture plays out. The table below summarizes key operating and leasing statistics for our owned and managed operating properties for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Total/Weighted Owned and Managed Property Data(1) The Americas Europe Asia Average For the year ended December 31, 2007: Rentable square feet 101,627,803 8,500,962 8,051,530 118,180,295 Occupancy percentage at period end(3) 96.0 % 96.1 % 96.6 % 96.0 % Same space square footage leased 18,144,411 405,912 690,569 19,240,892 Trailing four quarter rent change on renewals and rollovers(2)(3) 4.1 % 7.6 % 19.5 % 4.9 % For the year ended December 31, 2006: Rentable square feet 92,498,200 4,238,193 3,966,522 100,702,915 Occupancy percentage at period end(3) 96.3 % 98.1 % 89.6 % 96.3 % Same space square footage leased 15,968,855 42,334 192,391 16,203,580 Trailing four quarter rent change on renewals and rollovers(2)(3) (0.1 )% (0.1 )% 1.0 % (0.1 )% (1) Schedule includes owned and managed operating properties which we define as properties in which we have at least a 10% ownership interest, for which we are the property or asset manager, and which we intend to hold for the long term. This excludes development and renovation projects and recently completed development projects available for sale or contribution. 38 Table of Contents (2) Rent changes on renewals and rollovers are calculated as the difference, weighted by square feet, of the net ABR due the first month of a term commencement and the net ABR due the last month of the former tenants term. If free rent is granted, then the first positive full rent value is used as a point of comparison. The rental amounts exclude base stop amounts, holdover rent and premium rent charges. If either the previous or current lease terms are under 12 months, then they are excluded from this calculation. If the lease is first generation or there is no prior lease for comparison, then it is excluded from this calculation. (3) On a consolidated basis for the Americas, Europe and Asia, occupancy percentage at period end for 2007 was 96.6%, 100.0% and 100.0%, and rent change on renewals and rollovers at period end for 2007 was 4.2%, 0.0% and 48.7%, respectively. On a consolidated basis, for the Americas, Europe and Asia, occupancy percentage at period end for 2006 was 97.0%, 98.1% and 100.0%, and rent change on renewals and rollovers at period end for 2006 was 4.2%, 0.0% and 0.0%, respectively. We believe that higher occupancy levels in our portfolio, driven in part by strengthening fundamentals in our markets tied to global trade, are contributing to rental rate growth in our portfolio. Our operating portfolios average occupancy rate in the fourth quarter of 2007 was 95.6%, on an owned and managed basis, an increase of 20 basis points from the prior quarter and 30 basis points from December 31, 2006. Rental rates on lease renewals and rollovers in our portfolio increased 4.9% in the fourth quarter of 2007, which we think reflect the generally positive trends in real estate fundamentals in our markets. During the quarter, cash basis same store net operating income, with and without the effect of lease termination fees, grew by 3.3% and 4.8%, respectively, on an owned and managed basis. See Supplemental Earnings Measures below for a discussion of cash basis same store net operating income and a reconciliation of cash basis same store net operating income and net income. We believe that market rents have generally recovered from their lows and, in many of our markets, are back to or above their prior peak levels of 2001. Private Capital Business In June 2007, we announced the formation of AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS, our eleventh co investment fund since our initial public offering in 1997. This Euro denominated, open end commingled fund is our tenth active fund. The funds investment strategy focuses on acquiring stabilized industrial distribution properties, including those developed by us, near high volume airports, seaports and transportation networks, and in the major metropolitan areas of Europe, with initial target markets in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom and Central/Eastern Europe. The gross asset value of AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS was approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2007. Going forward, we believe that our co investment program with private capital investors will continue to serve as a significant source of revenues and capital for new investments. Through these co investment ventures, we typically earn acquisition fees, asset management fees and priority distributions, as well as promoted interests and incentive distributions based on the performance of the co investment ventures; however, we cannot assure you that we will continue to do so. Through contribution of development properties to our co investment ventures, we expect to recognize value creation from our development pipeline. In anticipation of the formation of future co investment ventures, we may also hold acquired and newly developed properties for later contribution to future funds. As of December 31, 2007, we owned approximately 83.4 million square feet of our properties (56.5% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated co investment ventures. We may make additional investments through these co investment ventures or new co investment ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. Development Business Our development business consists of ground up development, redevelopment, renovations, land sales, and value added conversions. We generate earnings from our development business through the disposition or contribution of projects from these activities. We expect our development business to be a significant driver of our earnings growth as we expand the pipeline across each category. We believe that customer demand for new industrial space in strategic markets tied to global trade will continue to outpace supply. To capitalize on this demand, we intend to continue to expand our development business 39 Table of Contents in our existing markets and into new markets around the world that are essential to global trade. We also will continue to redevelop existing industrial buildings opportunistically by investing significant amounts of capital to enhance the functionality of the properties to meet current industrial market demands. In addition to our committed development pipeline, we hold a total of 2,535 acres of land for future development or sale, 91% of which is located in the Americas. We currently estimate that these 2,535 acres of land could support approximately 44.0 million square feet of future development. We believe that our historical investment focus on industrial real estate in some of the worlds most strategic infill markets positions us to create value through the select conversion of industrial properties to higher and better uses (value added conversions). Generally, we expect to sell to third parties our value added conversion projects at some point in the re entitlement/conversion process, thus recognizing the enhanced value of the underlying land that supports the propertys repurposed use. Value added conversions involve the repurposing of industrial properties to a higher and better use, including office, residential, retail, research development or manufacturing. Activities required to prepare the property for conversion to a higher and better use may include such activities as rezoning, redesigning, reconstructing and retenanting. The sales price of the value added conversion project is generally based on the underlying land value based on its ultimate use and as such, little to no residual value is ascribed to the industrial building. Our long term capital allocation goal is to have approximately 50% of our owned and managed operating portfolio invested in non U.S. markets based on owned and managed annualized base rent. As of December 31, 2007, our non U.S. operating properties comprised 23.8% of our owned and managed operating portfolio and 4.5% of our consolidated operating portfolio based on annualized base rent. In addition to the United States, we include Canada and Mexico as target countries in the Americas. In Europe, our target countries currently are Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. In Asia, our target countries currently are China, India, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. We expect to add additional target countries outside the United States in the future, including countries in Central/Eastern Europe. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust, we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income. As a result, we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our on going operations to the same extent that other corporations that are not real estate investment trusts can. We must continue to raise capital in both the debt and equity markets to fund our working capital needs, acquisitions and developments. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for a complete discussion of the sources of our capital.

See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 5, 8 and 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our capital markets transactions. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Investments in Real Estate. Investments in real estate and leasehold interests are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. We also regularly review the impact of above or below market leases, in place leases and lease origination costs for acquisitions, and record an intangible asset or liability accordingly. Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a property by property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable. Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying value of the property. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future economics and market conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying value of our long lived assets could occur in the future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings. For properties held for sale, impairment is recognized when the carrying value of the property is less than its estimated fair value net of cost to sell. As a result of leasing activity and the economic environment, we re evaluated the carrying value of our investments and recorded impairment charges of $1.2 million, $6.3 million and $0.0, during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, on certain of our investments. Revenue Recognition. We record rental revenue from operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts, security deposits and letters of credit, then we may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our customers on an on going basis by reviewing their financial condition periodically as appropriate. Each period we review our outstanding accounts receivable, including straight line rents, for doubtful accounts and provide allowances as needed. We also record lease termination fees when a customer has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us. If a customer remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement, the applicable termination fees are deferred and recognized over the term of such customers occupancy. Property Dispositions. We report real estate dispositions in three separate categories on our consolidated statements of operations. First, when we divest a portion of our interests in real estate entities or properties, gains from the sale represent the interests acquired by third party investors for cash and are included in gains from disposition of real estate interests in the statement of operations. Second, we dispose of value added conversion projects and build to suit and speculative development projects for which we have not generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is reported net of estimated 42 Table of Contents taxes, when applicable, and are included in development profits, net of taxes, within continuing operations of the statement of operations. Third, we dispose of value added conversion and other redevelopment projects for which we may have generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized is reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable, in the development gains line within discontinued operations. Lastly, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, requires us to separately report as discontinued operations the historical operating results attributable to operating properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the properties, which is included in development gains and gains from dispositions of real estate, net of taxes and minority interests, in the statement of operations. The consolidated statements of operations for prior periods are also adjusted to conform with this classification. There is no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial position, net income or cash flows. In all cases, gains and losses are recognized using the full accrual method of accounting. Gains relating to transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met. Co investment Ventures. We hold interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated co investment ventures. We determine consolidation based on standards set forth in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, or FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46). For co investment ventures that are variable interest entities as defined under FIN 46 where we are not the primary beneficiary, we do not consolidate the co investment venture for financial reporting purposes. Based on the guidance set forth in EITF 04 5, we consolidate certain co investment venture investments because we exercise significant control over major operating decisions, such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, asset management, investment activity and changes in financing. For co investment ventures under EITF 04 5, where we do not exercise significant control over major operating and management decisions, but where we exercise significant influence, we use the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the co investment venture for financial reporting purposes. Capitalized General and Administrative Expenses. We capitalize general and administrative expenses, related to development projects based on time spent on development activities. Real Estate Investment Trust. As a real estate investment trust, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes in the United States if we meet minimum distribution, income, asset and shareholder tests. However, some of our subsidiaries may be subject to federal and state taxes. In addition, foreign entities may also be subject to the taxes of the host country. An income tax allocation is required to be estimated on our taxable income arising from our taxable real estate investment trust subsidiaries and international entities. A deferred tax component could arise based upon the differences in GAAP versus tax income for items such as depreciation and gain recognition. However, we believe deferred tax is an immaterial component of our consolidated balance sheet. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Effective October 1, 2006, we deconsolidated AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., on a prospective basis, due to the re evaluation of the accounting for our investment in the fund because of changes to the partnership agreement regarding the general partners rights effective October 1, 2006. As a result, our results of operations presented below are not comparable between years presented. The analysis below includes changes attributable to same store growth, acquisitions, development activity and divestitures. Same store pool includes all properties that are owned as of the end of both the current and prior year reporting periods and excludes development properties stabilized after December 31, 2005 (generally defined as properties that are 90% leased or properties that have been substantially complete for at least 12 months). As of December 31, 2007, same store industrial pool consisted of properties aggregating approximately 72.9 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2007 consisted of seven properties, aggregating approximately 0.7 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2006 consisted of 31 properties, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. During 2007, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 32 43 Table of Contents properties, aggregating approximately 8.6 million square feet. In 2006, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 50 properties, aggregating approximately 7.5 million square feet. Our future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition of additional properties and dispositions. Our future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical results. For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 (dollars in millions): For the Years Ended December 31, Revenues 2007 2006 $ Change % Change Rental revenues U.S. industrial: Same store $ 553.3 $ 580.0 $ (26.7 ) (4.6 )% 2007 acquisitions 0.5 0.5 100.0 % 2006 acquisitions 10.0 10.4 (0.4 ) (3.8 )% Development 10.7 4.7 6.0 127.7 % Other industrial 11.2 7.6 3.6 47.4 % Non U.S. industrial 52.3 62.5 (10.2 ) (16.3 )% Total rental revenues 638.0 665.2 (27.2 ) (4.1 )% Private capital revenues 31.7 46.1 (14.4 ) (31.2 )% Total revenues $ 669.7 $ 711.3 $ (41.6 ) (5.8 )% U.S. industrial same store rental revenues decreased $26.7 million from the prior year due primarily to the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., on October 1, 2006 partially offset by rent increases on renewals and rollovers. Same store rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been $513.4 million if AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. had been deconsolidated as of January 1, 2006. The 2006 acquisitions consisted of 31 properties, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. The 2007 acquisitions consisted of seven properties, aggregating approximately 0.7 million square feet. The increase in rental revenues from development was primarily due to increased occupancy at several of our development projects where development activities have been substantially completed as well as an increase in the number of development projects. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated co investment venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. The increase in other industrial revenues was primarily due to an increase in base rents. The decrease in revenues from non U.S. industrial properties was primarily due to the contribution of 4.2 million square feet of operating properties and approximately 1.8 million square feet of completed development projects into AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS. The decrease in private capital income of 44 Table of Contents $14.4 million was primarily due to a decrease in incentive fees, acquisition fees, and disposition fees offset by an increase in asset management fees as a result of an increase in total assets under management.

Same store operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been $140.3 million if AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. had been deconsolidated as of January 1, 2006. The increase of approximately $12.5 million, had AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. been deconsolidated as of January 1, 2006, was primarily due to increased insurance costs, real estate taxes, roads and grounds expense, and management fees. The 2006 acquisitions consisted of 31 properties, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. The 2007 acquisitions consisted of seven properties, aggregating approximately 0.7 million square feet. The increase in development operating costs was primarily due to increased operations in certain development projects which have been substantially completed. This increase was primarily due to increases in real estate taxes and utilities. The increase in other industrial property operating costs was primarily due to insurance, cleaning and non reimbursable expenses. The decrease in property operating costs from non U.S. industrial properties is primarily due to the contribution of 4.2 million square feet of operating properties and approximately 1.8 million square feet of completed development projects into AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to additional staffing and the opening of new offices both domestically and internationally. The decrease of fund costs from the prior year is due primarily to the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. The impairment losses during the year ended December 31, 2007 were taken on non core assets as a result of leasing activities and changes in the economic environment. The impairment losses during the year ended December 31, 2006 were taken on several non core assets as a result of leasing activities and changes in the economic environment 45 Table of Contents and the holding period of certain assets. Other expenses increased approximately $2.5 million from the prior year due primarily to an increase in dead deal expenditures. For the Years Ended December 31, Other Income and (Expenses) 2007 2006 $ Change % Change Development gains, net of taxes $ 124.3 $ 106.4 $ 17.9 16.8 % Gains from dispositions of real estate interests, net 73.4 73.4 100.0 % Equity in earnings of unconsolidated co investment ventures, net 7.5 23.2 (15.7 ) (67.7 )% Other income 22.3 11.9 10.4 87.4 % Interest expense, including amortization (126.9 ) (165.1 ) (38.2 ) (23.1 )% Total other income and (expenses), net $ 100.6 $ (23.6 ) $ (124.2 ) (526.3 )% Development gains represent gains from the sale or contribution of development projects including land. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we sold seven completed development projects totaling 0.5 million square feet and three land parcels for approximately $115.1 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $28.6 million. In addition, we contributed 15 completed development projects totaling 3.6 million square feet and two land parcels into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS, AMB DFS Fund I, LLC, and AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., five of our unconsolidated co investment ventures. As a result of these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after tax gain of $95.7 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed assets acquired by the third party co investors for cash. During 2006, we sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $13.3 million. In addition, during 2006, we received approximately $0.4 million in connection with the condemnation of a parcel of land resulting in a loss of $1.0 million, $0.8 million of which was the co investment venture partners share. During 2006, we also contributed a total of ten completed development projects into unconsolidated co investment ventures. Four projects totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Japan Fund I, L.P, two projects totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet were contributed into AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, three projects totaling approximately 0.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and one land parcel was contributed into AMB DFS Fund I, LLC. As a result of these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after tax gain of $94.1 million, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party investors for cash. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we contributed 4.2 million square feet in operating properties into AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS, contributed a 0.2 million square foot operating property into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and contributed an operating property aggregating approximately 0.1 million square feet into AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, for a total of approximately $524.9 million. As a result of these contributions, we recognized gains from contribution of real estate interests of approximately $73.4 million, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed properties acquired by the third party investors for cash. The decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated co investment ventures of approximately $15.7 million was primarily due to a decrease in gains from the disposition of real estate by our unconsolidated co investment ventures partially offset by the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. Other income increased approximately $10.4 million from the prior year due primarily to an increase in the gain on currency remeasurement of approximately $3.9 million, an increase in insurance proceeds of approximately $2.9 million related to losses from Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma and an increase in interest income of $2.3 million. The decrease in interest expense, including amortization, was due primarily to decreased borrowings on unsecured credit facilities and the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P.

The increase in preferred stock dividends is due to the then newly issued shares. On April 17, 2007, the operating partnership redeemed all 800,000 of its outstanding 7.95% Series J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units and all 800,000 of its outstanding 7.95% Series K Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units. In addition, on April 17, 2007, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, repurchased all 510,000 of its outstanding 8.00% Series I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units. As a result of the redemptions and repurchase, we recognized a reduction of income available to common stockholders of $2.9 million for the original issuance costs during the year ended December 31, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2006, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, repurchased all 840,000 of its outstanding 8.125% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units, all 220,440 of its outstanding 7.75% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units, all 201,139 of its outstanding 7.95% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units and all 729,582 of its outstanding 5.00% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units. As a result, we recognized a decrease in income available to common stockholders of $1.1 million for the original issuance costs, net of discount on repurchase. For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (dollars in millions): For the Years Ended December 31, Revenues 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Rental revenues U.S. industrial: Same store $ 580.0 $ 556.4 $ 23.6 4.2 % 2006 acquisitions 10.4 10.4 100.0 % Development 4.7 2.0 2.7 135.0 % Other industrial 7.6 3.2 4.4 137.5 % Non U.S. industrial 62.5 41.4 21.1 51.0 % Total rental revenues 665.2 603.0 62.2 10.3 % Private capital revenues 46.1 43.9 2.2 5.0 % Total revenues $ 711.3 $ 646.9 $ 64.4 10.0 % U.S. industrial same store revenues increased $23.6 million from the prior year despite the decrease of $66.6 million in same store revenues due to the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., effective October 1, 2006, attributable primarily to improved occupancy and increased rental rates in various markets. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 29 properties, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2006 consisted of 31 properties, aggregating approximately 7.3 million square feet. The increase in rental revenues from development was primarily due to increased occupancy at several of our development projects where development activities have been substantially completed as well as an increase in the number of development projects. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have 47 Table of Contents been contributed to unconsolidated co investment ventures, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. Non U.S. industrial revenues increased approximately $21.1 million from the prior year due primarily to the stabilization of properties in Japan and the continued acquisition of properties in France, Germany, and Mexico. The increase in private capital income was primarily due to increased asset management and acquisition fees from additional assets held in co investment ventures, which were partially offset by a decrease in incentive distributions of approximately $3.9 million. During 2006, we received incentive distributions of $22.5 million, of which $19.8 million was from AMB Partners II, L.P., as compared to incentive distribution of $26.4 million for the sale of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., during 2005.

The 2005 acquisitions consisted of 29 properties, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. The 2006 acquisitions consisted of 31 properties, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to unconsolidated co investment ventures, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. Non U.S. industrial property operating costs increased approximately $5.7 million from the prior year due primarily to the stabilization of properties in Japan and the continued acquisition of properties in France, Germany, and Mexico. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate during the year. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased stock based compensation expense as a result of higher values assigned to option and stock awards and executive departures, additional staffing and expenses for our international expansion, and the acquisition of AMB Blackpine. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our co investment ventures. The 2006 impairment loss was taken on several non core assets as a result of leasing activities and changes in the economic environment and the holding 48 Table of Contents period of certain assets. Other expenses decreased approximately $2.4 million from the prior year due primarily to a decrease in losses associated with our deferred compensation plan and a decrease in certain deal costs. For the Years Ended December 31, Other Income and (Expenses) 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Development profits, net of taxes $ 106.4 $ 54.8 $ 51.6 94.2 % Gains from dispositions of real estate interests, net 19.1 (19.1 ) 100.0 % Equity in earnings of unconsolidated co investment ventures, net 23.2 10.8 12.4 114.8 % Other income 11.9 7.5 4.4 58.7 % Interest expense, including amortization (165.1 ) (147.5 ) 17.6 11.9 % Total other income and (expenses), net $ (23.6 ) $ (55.3 ) $ (31.7 ) (57.3 )% Development profits represent gains from the sale of development projects and land as part of our development for sale program. The increase in development profits was due to increased disposition and contribution volume during 2006. During 2006, we sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $13.3 million. In addition, during 2006, we received approximately $0.4 million in connection with the condemnation of a parcel of land resulting in a loss of $1.0 million, $0.8 million of which was the co investment venture partners share. During 2006, we also contributed a total of ten completed development projects into unconsolidated co investment ventures. Four projects totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Japan Fund I, L.P, two projects totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet were contributed into AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, three projects totaling approximately 0.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and one land parcel was contributed into AMB DFS Fund I, LLC. As a result of these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after tax gain of $94.1 million, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party investors for cash. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated co investment venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $1.9 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. The 2005 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted primarily from our contribution of $106.9 million (using the exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties to our then newly formed unconsolidated co investment venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. The $12.4 million increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated co investment ventures was primarily due to gains of $17.5 million from the disposition of real estate by our unconsolidated co investment ventures during 2006. During 2005, such gains were $5.5 million. In addition, effective October 1, 2006, the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., resulted in an increase of approximately $5.1 million in equity in earnings of unconsolidated co investment ventures. The increases in 2006 were partially offset by an increase in expenses by our unconsolidated co investment ventures. The increase in other income was primarily due to increased bank interest income and an increase in property management income due to the expansion of our property management activities. The increase in interest expense, including amortization, was due primarily to increased borrowings on unsecured credit facilities and other debt. For the Years Ended December 31, Discontinued Operations 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Income attributable to discontinued operations, net of minority interests $ 18.2 $ 20.6 $ (2.4 ) (11.7 )% Development gains and gains from dispositions of real estate, net of taxes and minority interests 42.6 113.6 (71.0 ) (62.5 )% Total discontinued operations $ 60.8 $ 134.2 $ (73.4 ) (54.7 )% 49 Table of Contents During 2006, we divested ourselves of 17 industrial properties, aggregating approximately 3.5 million square feet, for an aggregate price of approximately $175.3 million, with a resulting net gain of approximately $42.6 million. During 2005, we divested ourselves of 18 industrial properties and one retail center, aggregating approximately 9.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $926.6 million, with a resulting net gain of $113.6 million. Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., for $618.5 million. The multi investor fund owned approximately 5.8 million square feet. We received cash and a distribution of an on tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund.

In August 2006, we issued 2,000,000 shares of 6.85% Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. The increase in preferred stock dividends is due to the newly issued shares. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2006, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, repurchased all 840,000 of its outstanding 8.125% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units, all 220,440 of its outstanding 7.75% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units, all 201,139 of its outstanding 7.95% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units and all 729,582 of its outstanding 5.00% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units. As a result, we recognized a decrease in income available to common stockholders of $1.1 million for the original issuance costs, net of discount on repurchase. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Balance Sheet Strategy. In general, we use unsecured lines of credit, unsecured notes, preferred stock and common equity (issued by us and or the operating partnership and its subsidiaries) to capitalize our wholly owned assets. Over time, we plan to retire non recourse, secured debt encumbering our wholly owned assets and replace that debt with unsecured notes where practicable. In managing the co investment ventures, in general, we use non recourse, secured debt to capitalize our co investment ventures. We currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for acquisitions, development, expansion and renovation of properties will include: retained earnings and cash flow from operations; private capital from co investment partners; net proceeds from contributions of properties and completed development projects to our co investment ventures; net proceeds from the sales of development projects, value added conversion projects and land to third parties; net proceeds from divestitures of properties; proceeds from equity (common and preferred) or debt securities offerings; borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities; other forms of secured or unsecured financing; and proceeds from limited partnership unit offerings (including issuances of limited partnership units by our subsidiaries). 50 Table of Contents We currently expect that our principal funding requirements will include: working capital; development, expansion and renovation of properties; acquisitions; debt service; and dividends and distributions on outstanding common and preferred stock and limited partnership units. Cash flows. As of December 31, 2007, cash provided by operating activities was $240.5 million as compared to $335.9 million for the same period in 2006. This change is primarily due to changes in our assets and liabilities offset by gains from sales and contributions of real estate interests, net, and an increase in operating distributions received by unconsolidated co investment ventures. Cash used in investing activities was $632.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to cash used for investing activities of $880.6 million for the same period in 2006. This change is primarily due to a decrease in cash used for property acquisitions, offset by additions to interests in unconsolidated co investment ventures and additions to land and buildings. Cash provided by financing activities was $420.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to cash provided by financing activities of $483.6 million for the same period in 2006. This change is due primarily to an increase in payments on other debt, credit facilities, senior debt, the cost of repurchase of preferred units, and a decrease in proceeds from issuances of senior debt, and contributions from co investment partners. This activity was partially offset by the issuance of common stock and increased borrowings on secured debt and credit facilities. We believe our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow from operations, borrowings available under our unsecured credit facilities and our ability to access private and public debt and equity capital, are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Resources Development sales activity to third parties during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was as follows (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Number of completed development projects 7 6 5 Number of land parcels 3 5 5 Square feet 498,017 1,323,748 921,740 Gross sales price $ 130,419 $ 86,629 $ 155,206 Development gains, net of taxes $ 28,575 $ 12,440 $ 52,925 51 Table of Contents Development contribution activity during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was as follows (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Number of projects contributed to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. 4 3 Square feet 1,006,164 554,279 Number of projects contributed to AMB SGP Mexico, LLC 2 2 1 Square feet 329,114 843,439 391,457 Number of land parcels contributed to AMB DFS Fund I, LLC 2 1 Square feet Number of projects contributed to AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS 8 Square feet 1,838,011 Number of projects contributed to AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. 1 4 Square feet 469,627 2,644,258 Total number of contributed development assets 17 10 1 Total square feet 3,642,916 4,041,976 391,457 Development gains, net of taxes $ 95,713 $ 93,949 $ 1,886 Property Divestitures. During 2007, we divested ourselves of three industrial properties, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $120.0 million, with a resulting net gain of approximately $2.0 million and a gain of approximately $60.0 million associated with the sale of two value added conversion projects. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized development profits of approximately $95.7 million, as a result of the contribution of 15 completed development projects and approximately 82 acres of land to AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., AMB DFS Fund I, LLC, and AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. In addition, we recognized development profits of approximately $28.6 million as a result of the sale of seven development projects and 76 acres of land during the year ended December 31, 2007. Gains from Sale or Contribution of Real Estate Interests. During 2007, we contributed operating properties for approximately $524.9 million, aggregating approximately 4.5 million square feet, into AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS, AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. and AMB SGP Mexico, LLC. We recognized a gain of $73.4 million on the contributions, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed properties acquired by the third party investors for cash. During 2006, there were no comparable events. Properties Held for Contribution. As of December 31, 2007, we held for contribution to co investment ventures 17 properties with an aggregate net book value of $488.3 million, which, when contributed, will reduce our average ownership interest in these projects from approximately 90% currently to an expected range of 15 20%. Properties Held for Divestiture. As of December 31, 2007, we held for divestiture five properties with an aggregate net book value of $40.5 million. These properties either are not in our core markets or do not meet our current investment objectives, or are included as part of our development for sale or value added conversion programs. The divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. Properties held for divestiture are stated at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less costs to sell. Co investment Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment ventures with institutional investors. These co investment ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund certain acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. We consolidate these co investment ventures for financial reporting purposes when they are 52 Table of Contents not variable interest entities and when we are the sole managing general partner and control all major operating decisions. However, in certain cases, our co investment ventures are unconsolidated because we do not control all major operating decisions and the general partners do not have significant rights under the EITF Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights. Third party equity interests in the co investment ventures are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2007, we owned approximately 83.4 million square feet of our properties (56.5% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated co investment ventures. We may make additional investments through these co investment ventures or new co investment ventures in the future and presently plan to do so.

AMB Pier One, LLC, is a co investment venture related to the 2000 redevelopment of the pier that houses our global headquarters in San Francisco, California. As a result, the investment was consolidated as of June 30, 2007. As of December 31, 2007, we also had an approximate 39.0% unconsolidated equity interest in G.Accion, a Mexican real estate company. G.Accion provides management and development services for industrial, retail, residential and office properties in Mexico. In addition, as of December 31, 2007, one of our subsidiaries also had an approximate 5% interest in IAT Air Cargo Facilities Income Fund (IAT), a Canadian income trust specializing in aviation related real estate at Canadas leading international airports. These equity investments of approximately $2.1 million and $2.7 million, respectively, are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006. Common and Preferred Equity. We have authorized for issuance 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which the following series were designated as of December 31, 2007: 1,595,337 shares of series D cumulative redeemable preferred, of which none are outstanding; 2,300,000 shares of series L cumulative redeemable preferred, of which 2,000,000 are outstanding; 2,300,000 shares of series M cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which are outstanding; 3,000,000 shares of series O cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which are outstanding; and 2,000,000 shares of series P cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which are outstanding. 54 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2007, $107.5 million in preferred units with a weighted average rate of 6.63% become callable in 2008. On April 17, 2007, AMB Property II, L.P., a partnership in which, as of January 1, 2008, AMB Property Holding Corporation, a Maryland corporation and our direct subsidiary, owns an approximate 1.0% general partnership interest and the operating partnership owns an approximate 92% common limited partnership interest, repurchased all 510,000 of its outstanding 8.00% Series I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units from a single institutional investor for an aggregate price of $25.6 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions. In connection with this repurchase, we reclassified all 510,000 shares of our 8.00% Series I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock as preferred stock. On April 17, 2007, the operating partnership redeemed all 800,000 of its outstanding 7.95% Series J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units from a single institutional investor for an aggregate price of $40.0 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions.

On November 1, 2006, AMB Property II, L.P., issued 1,130,835 of its class B common limited partnership units in connection with a property acquisition. In March 2007, we issued approximately 8.4 million shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately $472.1 million, which were contributed to the operating partnership in exchange for the issuance of approximately 8.4 million general partnership units. As a result of the common stock issuance, there was a significant reallocation of partnership interests due to the difference in our stock price at issuance as compared to the book value per share at the time of issuance. We intend to use the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes and, over the long term, to expand our global development business. On September 21, 2006, AMB Property II, L.P., repurchased all 201,139 of its outstanding 7.95% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units from a single institutional investor for an aggregate price of $10.0 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions.

Dividends are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable quarterly in arrears at a rate per share equal to $1.6875 per annum. The series M preferred stock is redeemable by us on or after November 25, 2008, subject to certain conditions, for cash at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, if any, to the redemption date. We contributed the net proceeds of approximately $55.4 million to the operating partnership, and in exchange, the operating partnership issued to us 2,300,000 63/4% Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units. On June 23, 2003, we issued and sold 2,000,000 shares of 61/2% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at a price of $25.00 per share. Dividends are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable quarterly in arrears at a rate per share equal to $1.625 per annum.

The operating partnership used the proceeds, in addition to proceeds previously contributed to the operating partnership from other equity issuances, to redeem all 3,995,800 of its 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units from us on July 28, 2003. We, in turn, used those proceeds to redeem all 3,995,800 of our 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for $100.2 million, including all accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, to the redemption date. In December 2005, our board of directors approved a two year common stock repurchase program for the discretionary repurchase of up to $200.0 million of our common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate price of $53.4 million at a weighted average price of $49.87 per share. We have the authorization to repurchase up to an additional $146.6 million of our common stock under this program. On December 18, 2007, we extended this program through December 31, 2009. Debt. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, we presently intend over the long term to operate with an our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio of approximately 45% or less. As of December 31, 2007, our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio was 34.4%. (See footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratios table below for our definitions of our share of total market capitalization, market equity and our share of total debt.) However, we typically finance our co investment ventures with secured debt at a loan to value ratio of 50 65% per our co investment venture agreements. Additionally, we currently intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these policies, however, our organizational 56 Table of Contents documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our management could alter or eliminate these policies without stockholder approval or circumstances could arise that could render us unable to comply with these policies. As of December 31, 2007, the aggregate principal amount of our secured debt was $1.5 billion, excluding unamortized debt premiums of $4.2 million. Of the $1.5 billion of secured debt, $1.1 billion is secured by properties in our co investment ventures. The secured debt is generally non recourse and bears interest at rates varying from 1.1% to 9.4% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 5.6%) and final maturity dates ranging from January 2008 to February 2024. As of December 31, 2007, $1.0 billion of the secured debt obligations bear interest at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%, while the remaining $426.0 million bear interest at variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 3.8%). On February 14, 2007, seven subsidiaries of AMB SGP, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, which is one of our subsidiaries, entered into a loan agreement for a $305 million secured financing. On the same day, pursuant to the loan agreement, the same seven subsidiaries delivered four promissory notes to the two lenders, each of which matures on March 5, 2012. One note has a principal of $160 million and an interest rate that is fixed at 5.29%. The second is a $40 million note with an interest rate of 81 basis points above the one month LIBOR rate. The third note has a principal of $84 million and a fixed interest rate of 5.90%. The fourth note has a principal of $21 million and bears interest at a rate of 135 basis points above the one month LIBOR rate. As of December 31, 2007, the operating partnership had outstanding an aggregate of $1.0 billion in unsecured senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 6.1% and had an average term of 4.2 years. The unsecured senior debt securities are subject to various covenants. The covenants contain affirmative covenants, including compliance with financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to its senior debt securities. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then our cash flow may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Credit Facilities. The operating partnership has a $550.0 million (includes Euros, Yen, British pounds sterling or U.S. dollar denominated borrowings) unsecured revolving credit facility, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% at December 31, 2007. This facility matures on June 1, 2010. We are a guarantor of the operating partnerships obligations under the credit facility. The line carries a one year extension option and can be increased to up to $700.0 million upon certain conditions. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the operating partnerships long term debt rating, which was 42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2007, with an annual facility fee of 15 basis points. The four year credit facility includes a multi currency component, under which up to $550.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Euros, Yen or British pounds sterling. The operating partnership uses the credit facility principally for acquisitions, funding development activity and general working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2007, the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2007, was $259.4 million and the remaining amount available was $273.8 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $16.8 million. AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating partnership, has a Yen denominated unsecured revolving credit facility with an initial borrowing limit of 55.0 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2007, equaled approximately $492.4 million U.S. dollars and bore a weighted average interest rate of 1.2%. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K. under the credit facility, as well as the obligations of any other entity in which the operating partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the credit agreement. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and for other real estate purposes in Japan, China and South Korea. Generally, borrowers under the credit 57 Table of Contents facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the credit facility with certain real estate assets or equity in entities holding such real estate assets. The credit facility matures in June 2010 and has a one year extension option. The extension option is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding commitments under the facility at that time. The rate on the borrowings is generally TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt and was 42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2007. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, payable in quarterly amounts, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt, and was 15 basis points of the outstanding commitments under the facility as of December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2007, the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2007, was $399.5 million in U.S. dollars. The credit agreement contains affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. On July 16, 2007, certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries and the operating partnership, each acting as a borrower, with us and the operating partnership as guarantors, entered into a fifth amended and restated revolving credit agreement for a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility that replaced the existing $250 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The fifth amended and restated credit facility amends the fourth amended and restated credit facility to, among other things, increase the facility amount to $500 million with an option to further increase the facility to $750 million, to extend the maturity date to July 2011 and to allow for future borrowing in Indian rupees. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations for such subsidiaries and other entities controlled by the operating partnership that are selected by the operating partnership from time to time to be borrowers under and pursuant to our credit facility. Generally, borrowers under the credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the credit facility. The credit facility includes a multi currency component under which up to $500.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Singapore dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds sterling, and Euros with the ability to add Indian rupees. The line, which matures in July 2011 and carries a one year extension option, can be increased to up to $750.0 million upon certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding commitments. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships senior unsecured long term debt, which was 60 basis points as of December 31, 2007, with an annual facility fee based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships senior unsecured long term debt. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and general working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2007, the outstanding balance on this credit facility was approximately $217.2 million and bore a weighted average interest rate of 5.3%. The credit agreement contains affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios by the operating partnership, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. On December 8, 2006, we executed a 228.0 million Euros facility agreement (approximately $303.3 million in U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at June 12, 2007, the date the facility was assumed by AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS, as discussed below), which provides that certain of our affiliates may borrow either acquisition loans, up to a 100.0 million Euros sub limit (approximately $133.0 million in U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at June 12, 2007), or secured term loans, in connection with properties located in France, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Italy or Spain. On March 21, 2007, we increased the facility amount limit from 228.0 million Euros to 328.0 million Euros. Drawings under the term facility bear interest at a rate of 65 basis points over EURIBOR and may occur until, and mature on, April 30, 2014. Drawings under the acquisition loan facility bear interest at a rate of 75 basis points over EURIBOR and are repayable within six months of the date of advance, unless extended. We initially guaranteed the acquisition loan facility and were the carve out indemnitor in respect of the term loans. In accordance with the terms of the facility agreement, on June 12, 2007, AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS, assumed, and the operating partnership was released from, all of the operating partnerships obligations and liabilities under the facility agreement. On June 12, 2007, there were 267.0 million Euros (approximately $355.2 million in U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at June 12, 2007) of term loans and no acquisition loans outstanding under the facility agreement. 58 Table of Contents The tables below summarize our debt maturities and capitalization and reconcile our share of total debt to total consolidated debt as of December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands): Our Co investment Unsecured Secured Venture Senior Credit Other Total Debt(1) Debt(1) Debt Facilities(2) Debt Debt 2008 $ 199,970 $ 98,989 $ 175,000 $ $ 13,408 $ 487,367 2009 25,799 122,671 100,000 873 249,343 2010 65,905 102,661 250,000 658,928 941 1,078,435 2011 115 189,420 75,000 217,177 1,014 482,726 2012 3,753 459,111 61,093 523,957 2013 3,053 46,195 175,000 65,920 290,168 2014 3,216 4,102 616 7,934 2015 3,387 18,806 112,491 664 135,348 2016 3,567 54,795 58,362 Thereafter 42,267 19,091 125,000 186,358 Subtotal $ 351,032 $ 1,115,841 $ 1,012,491 $ 876,105 $ 144,529 $ 3,499,998 Unamortized premiums/(discount) 1,027 3,187 (9,368 ) (5,154 ) Total consolidated debt $ 352,059 $ 1,119,028 $ 1,003,123 $ 876,105 $ 144,529 $ 3,494,844 AMBs share of unconsolidated co investment venture debt(3) 556,710 36,368 593,078 Total debt(4) $ 352,059 $ 1,675,738 $ 1,003,123 $ 876,105 $ 180,897 $ 4,087,922 Co investment venture partners share of consolidated debt(4) (715,409 ) (100,000 ) (815,409 ) Our share of total debt(4) $ 352,059 $ 960,329 $ 1,003,123 $ 876,105 $ 80,897 $ 3,272,513 Weighted average interest rate 4.0 % 6.1 % 6.1 % 3.4 % 6.0 % 5.2 % Weighted average maturity (years) 2.4 4.1 4.2 2.7 4.6 3.6 (1) Our secured debt and co investment venture debt include debt related to European and Asian assets in the amount of $62.0 million and $192.1 million, respectively, translated to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2007.

As of December 31, 2007, we had $30.2 million in restricted cash. Our board of directors declared a regular cash dividend for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 of $0.50 per share of common stock, and the operating partnership announced its intention to pay a regular cash distribution for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 of $0.50 per common unit.

The anticipated size of our distributions, using only cash from operations, will not allow us to pay all of our debt as it comes due. Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. 61 Table of Contents Capital Commitments Development starts, generally defined as projects where we have obtained building permits and have begun physical construction, during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 The Americas: Number of new development projects 26 16 Number of value added conversion projects(1) 1 2 Square feet 7,427,914 5,428,642 Estimated total investment(2) $ 559,276 $ 356,843 Europe: Number of new development projects 6 4 Square feet 1,687,601 711,956 Estimated total investment(2) $ 220,200 $ 72,104 Asia: Number of new development projects 6 8 Square feet 3,060,335 4,283,572 Estimated total investment(2) $ 305,872 $ 485,344 Total: Number of new development projects 38 28 Number of value added conversion projects 1 2 Square feet 12,175,850 10,424,170 Estimated total investment(2) $ 1,085,348 $ 914,291 Land acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 The Americas: Acres 1,231 774 Estimated build out potential (square feet) 21,083,750 11,974,941 Investment(3) $ 221,645 $ 199,785 Europe: Acres 182 Estimated build out potential (square feet) 3,328,267 Investment(3) $ 38,544 Asia: Acres 28 61 Estimated build out potential (square feet) 997,537 3,506,843 Investment(3) $ 20,977 $ 93,429 Total: Acres 1,441 835 Estimated build out potential (square feet) 25,409,554 15,481,784 Investment(3) $ 281,166 $ 293,214 62 Table of Contents (1) Value added conversion projects represent the repurposing of industrial properties to a higher and better use, including office, residential, retail, research and development or manufacturing.

As of December 31, 2007, we had 56 industrial projects in our development pipeline, which are expected to total approximately 17.8 million square feet and have an aggregate estimated investment of $1.7 billion upon completion. We have an additional 12 development projects available for sale or contribution totaling approximately 4.2 million square feet, with an aggregate estimated investment of $304.7 million. As of December 31, 2007, we and our co investment venture partners have funded an aggregate of $1.2 billion and needed to fund an estimated additional $500 million in order to complete our development pipeline. The development pipeline, at December 31, 2007, included projects expected to be completed through the fourth quarter of 2009. In addition to our committed development pipeline, we hold a total of 2,535 acres of land for future development or 63 Table of Contents sale, approximately 91% of which is located in the Americas. We currently estimate that these 2,535 acres of land could support approximately 44.0 million square feet of future development. Lease Commitments. We have entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily on tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms from one to 55 years. These buildings and improvements subject to ground leases are amortized ratably over the lesser of the terms of the related leases or 40 years. Future minimum rental payments required under non cancelable operating leases in effect as of December 31, 2007 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2008 $ 23,208 2009 22,632 2010 21,932 2011 21,577 2012 20,501 Thereafter 284,158 Total $ 394,008 Co investment Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment ventures with institutional investors. These co investment ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. As of December 31, 2007, we had investments in co investment ventures with a gross book value of $2.5 billion, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, and net equity investments in five significant unconsolidated co investment ventures of $274.9 million and a gross book value of $4.4 billion. As of December 31, 2007, we may make additional capital contributions to current and planned co investment ventures of up to $151.0 million (using the exchange rates at December 31, 2007) pursuant to the terms of the co investment venture agreements. From time to time, we may raise additional equity commitments for AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open ended unconsolidated co investment venture formed in 2004 with institutional investors, which invests through a private real estate investment partnership, and for AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS, an open ended unconsolidated co investment venture formed in 2007 with institutional investors. This would increase our obligation to make additional capital commitments to these funds. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and the management regulations of AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS, we are obligated to contribute 20% of the total equity commitments to each fund until such time when our total equity commitment is greater than $150.0 million or 150.0 million Euros, respectively, at which time, our obligation is reduced to 10% of the total equity commitments. We expect to fund these contributions with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances or net proceeds from property divestitures, which could adversely affect our cash flow. Captive Insurance Company. In December 2001, we formed a wholly owned captive insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd. (Arcata), which provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the deductible under our third party policies. The captive insurance company is one element of our overall risk management program. We capitalized Arcata in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata established annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss experience of our properties. Annually, we engage an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims, related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata may be adjusted based on this estimate. Like premiums paid to third party insurance companies, premiums paid to Arcata may be reimbursed by customers pursuant to specific lease terms. Through this structure, we think that we have more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market. Potential Contingent and Unknown Liabilities. Contingent and unknown liabilities may include the following: liabilities for environmental conditions; claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with our acquisition transactions that had not been asserted prior to our formation or acquisition transactions; 64 Table of Contents accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; and tax liabilities. Overview of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our debt, interest and lease payments due by period as of December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands): Less than 1 3 3 5 More than Contractual Obligations 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Total Debt $ 487,367 $ 1,327,778 $ 1,006,683 $ 678,170 $ 3,499,998 Debt interest payments 22,582 62,781 55,806 72,238 213,407 Operating lease commitments 23,208 44,564 42,078 284,158 394,008 Construction commitments 77,194 77,194 Total $ 610,351 $ 1,435,123 $ 1,104,567 $ 1,034,566 $ 4,184,607 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Standby Letters of Credit. As of December 31, 2007, we had provided approximately $24.2 million in letters of credit, of which $16.8 million were provided under the operating partnerships $550.0 million unsecured credit facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other commitments. Guarantees and Contribution Obligations. Excluding parent guarantees associated with unsecured debt or contribution obligations as discussed in Notes 5 and 9, we had outstanding guarantees and contribution obligations in the aggregate amount of $405.2 million as described below. As of December 31, 2007, we had outstanding guarantees in the amount of $95.9 million in connection with certain acquisitions. As of December 31, 2007, we also guaranteed $41.2 million and $107.9 million on outstanding loans on five of our consolidated co investment ventures and two of our unconsolidated co investment ventures, respectively. Also, we have entered into contribution agreements with certain of our unconsolidated co investment venture funds. These contribution agreements require us to make additional capital contributions to the applicable co investment venture fund upon certain defaults by the co investment venture of certain of its debt obligations to the lenders. Such additional capital contributions will cover all or part of the applicable co investment ventures debt obligation and may be greater than our share of the co investment ventures debt obligation or the value of our share of any property securing such debt. Our contribution obligations under these agreements will be reduced by the amounts recovered by the lender and the fair market value of the property, if any, used to secure the debt and obtained by the lender upon default. Our potential obligations under these contribution agreements are $160.2 million as of December 31, 2007. Performance and Surety Bonds. As of December 31, 2007, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $15.2 million. These bonds were issued in connection with certain of our development projects and were posted to guarantee certain tax obligations and the construction of certain real property improvements and infrastructure. Performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the taxes due or the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. Promoted Interests and Other Contractual Obligations. Upon the achievement of certain return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, we may be obligated to make payments to certain of our co investment venture partners pursuant to the terms and provisions of their contractual agreements with us. From time to time in the normal course of our business, we enter into various contracts with third parties that may obligate us to make payments, pay promotes, or perform other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. 65 Table of Contents SUPPLEMENTAL EARNINGS MEASURES Funds From Operations (FFO) and Funds From Operations Per Share and Unit (FFOPS). We believe that net income, as defined by U.S. GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider funds from operations, or FFO, and FFO per share and unit, or FFOPS, to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. We define FFOPS as FFO per fully diluted weighted average share of our common stock and operating partnership units. We calculate FFO as net income, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, less gains (or losses) from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estate related depreciation, and adjustments to derive our pro rata share of FFO of consolidated and unconsolidated co investment ventures. We do not adjust FFO to eliminate the effects of non recurring charges. We include the gains from development, including those from value added conversion projects, before depreciation recapture, as a component of FFO. We believe that value added conversion dispositions are in substance land sales and as such should be included in FFO, consistent with the real estate investment trust industrys long standing practice to include gains on the sale of land in FFO. However, our interpretation of FFO or FFOPS may not be consistent with the views of others in the real estate investment trust industry, who may consider it to be a divergence from the NAREIT definition, and may not be comparable to FFO or FFOPS reported by other real estate investment trusts that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. In connection with the formation of a co investment venture, we may warehouse assets that are acquired with the intent to contribute these assets to the newly formed venture. Some of the properties held for contribution may, under certain circumstances, be required to be depreciated under U.S. GAAP. If this circumstance arises, we intend to include in our calculation of FFO gains or losses related to the contribution of previously depreciated real estate to co investment ventures. Although such a change, if instituted, will be a departure from the current NAREIT definition, we believe such a calculation of FFO will better reflect the value created as a result of the contributions. To date, we have not included gains or losses from the contribution of previously depreciated warehoused assets in FFO. AMB believes that FFO and FFOPS are meaningful supplemental measures of its operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Thus, FFO and FFOPS are supplemental measures of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that exclude historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by U.S. GAAP. We believe that the use of FFO and FFOPS, combined with the required U.S. GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO and FFOPS to be useful measures for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO and FFOPS can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO and FFOPS are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, these measures do not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO and FFOPS also do not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets nor are FFO or FFOPS necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. 66 Table of Contents The following table reflects the calculation of FFO reconciled from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts): 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Net income available to common stockholders(1) $ 295,524 $ 209,420 $ 250,419 $ 118,340 $ 116,716 Gains from sale or contribution of real estate, net of minority interests(2) (85,544 ) (42,635 ) (132,652 ) (47,224 ) (50,325 ) Depreciation and amortization: Total depreciation and amortization 161,925 174,721 159,469 134,574 109,828 Discontinued operations depreciation 1,801 5,256 20,835 32,776 32,509 Non real estate depreciation (5,623 ) (4,546 ) (3,388 ) (871 ) (720 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from consolidated co investment ventures: Co investment venture partners minority interests (Net income) 27,748 37,190 35,338 29,027 21,041 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Net income) 5,121 2,367 3,045 1,957 1,806 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Development gains) 7,148 4,948 2,262 435 344 Discontinued operations minority interests (Net income) 370 1,254 10,198 14,724 16,760 FFO attributable to minority interests (62,902 ) (82,861 ) (100,275 ) (80,192 ) (65,603 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from unconsolidated co investment ventures: Our share of net income (7,467 ) (23,240 ) (10,770 ) (3,781 ) (5,445 ) Our share of FFO 27,391 16,038 14,441 7,549 9,755 Our share of development gains, net of taxes 5,441 Funds from operations $ 365,492 $ 297,912 $ 254,363 $ 207,314 $ 186,666 Basic FFO per common share and unit $ 3.60 $ 3.24 $ 2.87 $ 2.39 $ 2.17 Diluted FFO per common share and unit $ 3.51 $ 3.12 $ 2.75 $ 2.30 $ 2.13 Weighted average common shares and units: Basic 101,550,001 92,047,678 88,684,262 86,885,250 85,859,899 Diluted 104,168,707 95,444,072 92,508,725 90,120,250 87,616,365 (1) Includes gains from undepreciated land sales of $9.2 million, $5.6 million, $25.0 million, $3.7 million and $1.2 million for 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003 respectively. (2) The information for 2007 includes accumulated depreciation re capture of approximately $10.1 million associated with the sale of two value added conversion projects. The information for 2005 includes accumulated depreciation re capture of approximately $1.1 million associated with the sale of one value added conversion project. 67 Table of Contents SS NOI. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider same store net operating income, or SS NOI, and cash basis SS NOI to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. Properties that are considered part of the same store pool include all properties that were owned, or owned and managed, as the case may be, as of the end of both the current and prior year reporting periods and exclude development properties for both the current and prior reporting periods. The same store pool is set annually and excludes properties purchased and developments stabilized after December 31, 2005 (generally defined as properties that are 90% leased or properties that have been substantially complete for at least 12 months). In deriving SS NOI, we define net operating income as rental revenues, including reimbursements, less property operating expenses, both of which are calculated in accordance with GAAP. Property operating expenses exclude depreciation, amortization, general and administrative expenses and interest expense. In calculating cash basis SS NOI, we exclude straight line rents and amortization of lease intangibles from the calculation of SS NOI. We consider cash basis SS NOI to be an appropriate and useful supplemental performance measure because it reflects the operating performance of our real estate portfolio excluding effects of non cash adjustments and provides a better measure of actual cash basis rental growth for a year over year comparison. In addition, we believe that SS NOI and cash basis SS NOI help the investing public compare our operating performance with that of other companies. While SS NOI and cash basis SS NOI are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, they do not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. SS NOI and cash basis SS NOI also do not reflect general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization costs, capital expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development and construction activities that could materially impact our results from operations. Further, our computation of SS NOI and cash basis SS NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating these measures. The following table reconciles SS NOI and cash basis SS NOI from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands): 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Net income $ 314,260 $ 224,072 $ 257,807 $ 125,471 $ 129,128 Private capital revenues (31,707 ) (46,102 ) (43,942 ) (12,895 ) (13,337 ) Depreciation and amortization 161,925 174,721 159,469 134,574 109,828 General and administrative 129,510 104,262 71,564 58,843 46,417 Fund costs 1,076 2,091 1,482 1,741 825 Impairment losses 1,157 6,312 5,251 Other expenses 5,112 2,620 5,038 892 475 Total other income and expenses (100,577 ) 23,609 55,339 120,161 95,918 Total minority interests share of income 54,845 61,632 73,348 52,103 55,896 Total discontinued operations (71,702 ) (60,852 ) (134,180 ) (71,344 ) (80,344 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (193 ) Net Operating Income (NOI) 463,899 492,172 445,925 409,546 350,057 Less non same store NOI (61,639 ) (104,147 ) (17,293 ) (22,725 ) (17,334 ) Less non cash adjustments(1) (2,861 ) (9,502 ) (15,237 ) (13,085 ) (6,111 ) Cash basis same store NOI $ 399,399 $ 378,523 $ 413,395 $ 373,736 $ 326,612 (1) Non cash adjustments include straight line rents and amortization of lease intangibles for the same store pool only. 68 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices, interest rates and international exchange rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimize the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings and our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2007, we had one outstanding interest rate swap with a notional amount of $25.0 million (in U.S. dollars). See Financial Instruments below. The table below summarizes the maturities and interest rates associated with our fixed and variable rate debt outstanding before net unamortized debt discounts of $5.2 million as of December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands): 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Fixed rate debt(1) $ 255,780 $ 185,957 $ 418,873 $ 248,484 $ 449,570 $ 576,675 $ 2,135,339 Average interest rate 6.9 % 5.0 % 6.5 % 6.7 % 5.9 % 10.8 % 7.5 % Variable rate debt(2) $ 231,587 $ 63,386 $ 659,562 $ 234,242 $ 74,387 $ 101,495 $ 1,364,659 Average interest rate 2.1 % 5.9 % 3.4 % 3.6 % 5.6 % 9.8 % 3.9 % Interest Payments $ 22,582 $ 12,913 $ 49,868 $ 25,131 $ 30,675 $ 72,238 $ 213,407 (1) Represents 61.0% of all outstanding debt at December 31, 2007. (2) Represents 39.0% of all outstanding debt at December 31, 2007. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased or decreased by 10%, then the increase or decrease in interest cost on the variable rate debt would be $5.0 million (net of the swap) annually. As of December 31, 2007, the book value and the estimated fair value of our total consolidated debt (both secured and unsecured) was $3.5 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively, based on our estimate of current market interest rates. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, variable rate debt comprised 39.0% and 37.1%, respectively, of all our outstanding debt. Variable rate debt was $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. The increase is primarily due to higher outstanding balances on our credit facilities. This increase in our outstanding variable rate debt increases our risk associated with unfavorable interest rate fluctuations. Financial Instruments. We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income or income. For revenues or expenses denominated in non functional currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instrument in effect at December 31, 2007 was one interest rate swap hedging cash flows of variable rate borrowings based on U.S. Libor (USD). The following table summarizes our financial instruments as of December 31, 2007 (in thousands): Maturity Dates June 9, Notional Related Derivatives (In thousands) 2010 Amount Fair Value Notional Amount (U.S. dollars) $ 25,000 $ 25,000 Receive Floating(%) US LIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 5.17 % Fair Market Value $ (786 ) $ (786 ) Total $ 25,000 $ (786 ) International Operations. Our exposure to market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries operating in the United States and Mexico. The functional currency for our subsidiaries operating outside the United States, other than Mexico, is generally the local currency 69 Table of Contents of the country in which the entity or property is located, mitigating the effect of foreign exchange gains and losses. Our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. We translate income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. The gains resulting from the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders equity and totaled $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Our international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. In these instances, non monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period. We also record gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated. For the year ended December 31, 2007, unrealized and realized gains from remeasurement and translation included in our results of operations were $3.9 million. 
 
Item 7: Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources. (5) Effective October 1, 2006, we deconsolidated AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. on a prospective basis, due to the re evaluation of the accounting for our investment in the fund because of changes to the partnership agreement regarding the general partners rights effective October 1, 2006. As a result, the financial measures for the years 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003, included in our operating data, other data and balance sheet data above are not comparable. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations GENERAL You should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial statements. We are a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust and expect that we have qualified, and will continue to qualify, as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes beginning with the year ended December 31, 1997. As a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust, our own employees perform our corporate administrative and management functions, rather than our relying on an outside manager for these services. We manage our portfolio of properties generally through direct property management performed by our own employees. Additionally, within our flexible operating model, we may from time to time establish relationships with third party real estate management firms, brokers and developers that provide some property level administrative and management services under our direction. Managements Overview The primary source of our revenue and earnings is rent received from customers under long term (generally three to ten years) operating leases at our properties, including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs. We also generate earnings from our private capital business, which consists of acquisition and development fees, asset management fees and priority distributions, and promoted interests and incentive distributions from our co investment ventures. Additionally, we generate earnings from the disposition of projects in our development for sale and value 37 Table of Contents added conversion programs, from the contributions of development properties to our co investment ventures and from land sales. Our long term growth is driven by our ability to: maintain and increase occupancy rates and or increase rental rates at our properties; continue to develop properties profitably and sell to third parties or contribute to our co investment ventures; and continue to grow our earnings from our private capital business through the contribution of properties or from the acquisition of new properties. Real Estate Operations Real estate fundamentals in the United States industrial markets held steady during 2007 due to balanced supply and demand. According to data provided by Torto Wheaton Research, availability was 9.4% for the quarter ended December 31, 2007, up 20 basis points from the prior quarter and unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2006. Activity levels were lower than the prior year. According to Torto Wheaton Research, absorption was 21.4 million square feet for the fourth quarter and 120.2 million square feet for the full year, down from 209.3 million square feet in 2006, whereas construction completions were 40.3 million square feet in the quarter and 126.8 million square feet for the full year, down from 175.1 million square feet in 2006. While absorption in 2007 was 17.5% below the 19 year quarter average, construction completions were 22.6% below the average for the same period, which we believe indicates a market in equilibrium with a moderating supply of new industrial space entering the market. Reflecting the slowdown in the U.S. economy, we believe that net absorption for the first quarter of 2008 will be at or slightly below the fourth quarter 2007 level and similar in the second quarter of 2008. We presently expect pick up in the second half of 2008 to a full year absorption level approximating that of 2007. With a similar moderation in deliveries, we believe that year end vacancy will also approximate that of 2007. We think the strongest industrial markets in the United States are the major coastal markets tied to global trade, including Southern California which is our largest market Seattle, the San Francisco Bay Area, Northern New Jersey/New York and Miami. While we expect demand to moderate in the first half of 2008, due primarily to the slower growth rate in import volumes and the uncertainty in the economy, we believe our coastal markets will outperform other U.S. industrial markets. These markets have some of the highest occupancy rates in the country and we, therefore, expect to see some further rate growth in 2008, even as the national economic picture plays out. The table below summarizes key operating and leasing statistics for our owned and managed operating properties for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Total/Weighted Owned and Managed Property Data(1) The Americas Europe Asia Average For the year ended December 31, 2007: Rentable square feet 101,627,803 8,500,962 8,051,530 118,180,295 Occupancy percentage at period end(3) 96.0 % 96.1 % 96.6 % 96.0 % Same space square footage leased 18,144,411 405,912 690,569 19,240,892 Trailing four quarter rent change on renewals and rollovers(2)(3) 4.1 % 7.6 % 19.5 % 4.9 % For the year ended December 31, 2006: Rentable square feet 92,498,200 4,238,193 3,966,522 100,702,915 Occupancy percentage at period end(3) 96.3 % 98.1 % 89.6 % 96.3 % Same space square footage leased 15,968,855 42,334 192,391 16,203,580 Trailing four quarter rent change on renewals and rollovers(2)(3) (0.1 )% (0.1 )% 1.0 % (0.1 )% (1) Schedule includes owned and managed operating properties which we define as properties in which we have at least a 10% ownership interest, for which we are the property or asset manager, and which we intend to hold for the long term. This excludes development and renovation projects and recently completed development projects available for sale or contribution. 38 Table of Contents (2) Rent changes on renewals and rollovers are calculated as the difference, weighted by square feet, of the net ABR due the first month of a term commencement and the net ABR due the last month of the former tenants term. If free rent is granted, then the first positive full rent value is used as a point of comparison. The rental amounts exclude base stop amounts, holdover rent and premium rent charges. If either the previous or current lease terms are under 12 months, then they are excluded from this calculation. If the lease is first generation or there is no prior lease for comparison, then it is excluded from this calculation. (3) On a consolidated basis for the Americas, Europe and Asia, occupancy percentage at period end for 2007 was 96.6%, 100.0% and 100.0%, and rent change on renewals and rollovers at period end for 2007 was 4.2%, 0.0% and 48.7%, respectively. On a consolidated basis, for the Americas, Europe and Asia, occupancy percentage at period end for 2006 was 97.0%, 98.1% and 100.0%, and rent change on renewals and rollovers at period end for 2006 was 4.2%, 0.0% and 0.0%, respectively. We believe that higher occupancy levels in our portfolio, driven in part by strengthening fundamentals in our markets tied to global trade, are contributing to rental rate growth in our portfolio. Our operating portfolios average occupancy rate in the fourth quarter of 2007 was 95.6%, on an owned and managed basis, an increase of 20 basis points from the prior quarter and 30 basis points from December 31, 2006. Rental rates on lease renewals and rollovers in our portfolio increased 4.9% in the fourth quarter of 2007, which we think reflect the generally positive trends in real estate fundamentals in our markets. During the quarter, cash basis same store net operating income, with and without the effect of lease termination fees, grew by 3.3% and 4.8%, respectively, on an owned and managed basis. See Supplemental Earnings Measures below for a discussion of cash basis same store net operating income and a reconciliation of cash basis same store net operating income and net income. We believe that market rents have generally recovered from their lows and, in many of our markets, are back to or above their prior peak levels of 2001. Private Capital Business In June 2007, we announced the formation of AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS, our eleventh co investment fund since our initial public offering in 1997. This Euro denominated, open end commingled fund is our tenth active fund. The funds investment strategy focuses on acquiring stabilized industrial distribution properties, including those developed by us, near high volume airports, seaports and transportation networks, and in the major metropolitan areas of Europe, with initial target markets in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom and Central/Eastern Europe. The gross asset value of AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS was approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2007. Going forward, we believe that our co investment program with private capital investors will continue to serve as a significant source of revenues and capital for new investments. Through these co investment ventures, we typically earn acquisition fees, asset management fees and priority distributions, as well as promoted interests and incentive distributions based on the performance of the co investment ventures; however, we cannot assure you that we will continue to do so. Through contribution of development properties to our co investment ventures, we expect to recognize value creation from our development pipeline. In anticipation of the formation of future co investment ventures, we may also hold acquired and newly developed properties for later contribution to future funds. As of December 31, 2007, we owned approximately 83.4 million square feet of our properties (56.5% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated co investment ventures. We may make additional investments through these co investment ventures or new co investment ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. Development Business Our development business consists of ground up development, redevelopment, renovations, land sales, and value added conversions. We generate earnings from our development business through the disposition or contribution of projects from these activities. We expect our development business to be a significant driver of our earnings growth as we expand the pipeline across each category. We believe that customer demand for new industrial space in strategic markets tied to global trade will continue to outpace supply. To capitalize on this demand, we intend to continue to expand our development business 39 Table of Contents in our existing markets and into new markets around the world that are essential to global trade. We also will continue to redevelop existing industrial buildings opportunistically by investing significant amounts of capital to enhance the functionality of the properties to meet current industrial market demands. In addition to our committed development pipeline, we hold a total of 2,535 acres of land for future development or sale, 91% of which is located in the Americas. We currently estimate that these 2,535 acres of land could support approximately 44.0 million square feet of future development. We believe that our historical investment focus on industrial real estate in some of the worlds most strategic infill markets positions us to create value through the select conversion of industrial properties to higher and better uses (value added conversions). Generally, we expect to sell to third parties our value added conversion projects at some point in the re entitlement/conversion process, thus recognizing the enhanced value of the underlying land that supports the propertys repurposed use. Value added conversions involve the repurposing of industrial properties to a higher and better use, including office, residential, retail, research development or manufacturing. Activities required to prepare the property for conversion to a higher and better use may include such activities as rezoning, redesigning, reconstructing and retenanting. The sales price of the value added conversion project is generally based on the underlying land value based on its ultimate use and as such, little to no residual value is ascribed to the industrial building. Our long term capital allocation goal is to have approximately 50% of our owned and managed operating portfolio invested in non U.S. markets based on owned and managed annualized base rent. As of December 31, 2007, our non U.S. operating properties comprised 23.8% of our owned and managed operating portfolio and 4.5% of our consolidated operating portfolio based on annualized base rent. In addition to the United States, we include Canada and Mexico as target countries in the Americas. In Europe, our target countries currently are Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. In Asia, our target countries currently are China, India, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. We expect to add additional target countries outside the United States in the future, including countries in Central/Eastern Europe. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust, we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income. As a result, we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our on going operations to the same extent that other corporations that are not real estate investment trusts can. We must continue to raise capital in both the debt and equity markets to fund our working capital needs, acquisitions and developments. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for a complete discussion of the sources of our capital.

See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 5, 8 and 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our capital markets transactions. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Investments in Real Estate. Investments in real estate and leasehold interests are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. We also regularly review the impact of above or below market leases, in place leases and lease origination costs for acquisitions, and record an intangible asset or liability accordingly. Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a property by property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable. Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying value of the property. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future economics and market conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying value of our long lived assets could occur in the future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings. For properties held for sale, impairment is recognized when the carrying value of the property is less than its estimated fair value net of cost to sell. As a result of leasing activity and the economic environment, we re evaluated the carrying value of our investments and recorded impairment charges of $1.2 million, $6.3 million and $0.0, during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, on certain of our investments. Revenue Recognition. We record rental revenue from operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts, security deposits and letters of credit, then we may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our customers on an on going basis by reviewing their financial condition periodically as appropriate. Each period we review our outstanding accounts receivable, including straight line rents, for doubtful accounts and provide allowances as needed. We also record lease termination fees when a customer has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us. If a customer remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement, the applicable termination fees are deferred and recognized over the term of such customers occupancy. Property Dispositions. We report real estate dispositions in three separate categories on our consolidated statements of operations. First, when we divest a portion of our interests in real estate entities or properties, gains from the sale represent the interests acquired by third party investors for cash and are included in gains from disposition of real estate interests in the statement of operations. Second, we dispose of value added conversion projects and build to suit and speculative development projects for which we have not generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is reported net of estimated 42 Table of Contents taxes, when applicable, and are included in development profits, net of taxes, within continuing operations of the statement of operations. Third, we dispose of value added conversion and other redevelopment projects for which we may have generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized is reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable, in the development gains line within discontinued operations. Lastly, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, requires us to separately report as discontinued operations the historical operating results attributable to operating properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the properties, which is included in development gains and gains from dispositions of real estate, net of taxes and minority interests, in the statement of operations. The consolidated statements of operations for prior periods are also adjusted to conform with this classification. There is no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial position, net income or cash flows. In all cases, gains and losses are recognized using the full accrual method of accounting. Gains relating to transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met. Co investment Ventures. We hold interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated co investment ventures. We determine consolidation based on standards set forth in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, or FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46). For co investment ventures that are variable interest entities as defined under FIN 46 where we are not the primary beneficiary, we do not consolidate the co investment venture for financial reporting purposes. Based on the guidance set forth in EITF 04 5, we consolidate certain co investment venture investments because we exercise significant control over major operating decisions, such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, asset management, investment activity and changes in financing. For co investment ventures under EITF 04 5, where we do not exercise significant control over major operating and management decisions, but where we exercise significant influence, we use the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the co investment venture for financial reporting purposes. Capitalized General and Administrative Expenses. We capitalize general and administrative expenses, related to development projects based on time spent on development activities. Real Estate Investment Trust. As a real estate investment trust, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes in the United States if we meet minimum distribution, income, asset and shareholder tests. However, some of our subsidiaries may be subject to federal and state taxes. In addition, foreign entities may also be subject to the taxes of the host country. An income tax allocation is required to be estimated on our taxable income arising from our taxable real estate investment trust subsidiaries and international entities. A deferred tax component could arise based upon the differences in GAAP versus tax income for items such as depreciation and gain recognition. However, we believe deferred tax is an immaterial component of our consolidated balance sheet. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Effective October 1, 2006, we deconsolidated AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., on a prospective basis, due to the re evaluation of the accounting for our investment in the fund because of changes to the partnership agreement regarding the general partners rights effective October 1, 2006. As a result, our results of operations presented below are not comparable between years presented. The analysis below includes changes attributable to same store growth, acquisitions, development activity and divestitures. Same store pool includes all properties that are owned as of the end of both the current and prior year reporting periods and excludes development properties stabilized after December 31, 2005 (generally defined as properties that are 90% leased or properties that have been substantially complete for at least 12 months). As of December 31, 2007, same store industrial pool consisted of properties aggregating approximately 72.9 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2007 consisted of seven properties, aggregating approximately 0.7 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2006 consisted of 31 properties, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. During 2007, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 32 43 Table of Contents properties, aggregating approximately 8.6 million square feet. In 2006, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 50 properties, aggregating approximately 7.5 million square feet. Our future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition of additional properties and dispositions. Our future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical results. For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 (dollars in millions): For the Years Ended December 31, Revenues 2007 2006 $ Change % Change Rental revenues U.S. industrial: Same store $ 553.3 $ 580.0 $ (26.7 ) (4.6 )% 2007 acquisitions 0.5 0.5 100.0 % 2006 acquisitions 10.0 10.4 (0.4 ) (3.8 )% Development 10.7 4.7 6.0 127.7 % Other industrial 11.2 7.6 3.6 47.4 % Non U.S. industrial 52.3 62.5 (10.2 ) (16.3 )% Total rental revenues 638.0 665.2 (27.2 ) (4.1 )% Private capital revenues 31.7 46.1 (14.4 ) (31.2 )% Total revenues $ 669.7 $ 711.3 $ (41.6 ) (5.8 )% U.S. industrial same store rental revenues decreased $26.7 million from the prior year due primarily to the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., on October 1, 2006 partially offset by rent increases on renewals and rollovers. Same store rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been $513.4 million if AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. had been deconsolidated as of January 1, 2006. The 2006 acquisitions consisted of 31 properties, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. The 2007 acquisitions consisted of seven properties, aggregating approximately 0.7 million square feet. The increase in rental revenues from development was primarily due to increased occupancy at several of our development projects where development activities have been substantially completed as well as an increase in the number of development projects. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated co investment venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. The increase in other industrial revenues was primarily due to an increase in base rents. The decrease in revenues from non U.S. industrial properties was primarily due to the contribution of 4.2 million square feet of operating properties and approximately 1.8 million square feet of completed development projects into AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS. The decrease in private capital income of 44 Table of Contents $14.4 million was primarily due to a decrease in incentive fees, acquisition fees, and disposition fees offset by an increase in asset management fees as a result of an increase in total assets under management.

Same store operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been $140.3 million if AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. had been deconsolidated as of January 1, 2006. The increase of approximately $12.5 million, had AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. been deconsolidated as of January 1, 2006, was primarily due to increased insurance costs, real estate taxes, roads and grounds expense, and management fees. The 2006 acquisitions consisted of 31 properties, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. The 2007 acquisitions consisted of seven properties, aggregating approximately 0.7 million square feet. The increase in development operating costs was primarily due to increased operations in certain development projects which have been substantially completed. This increase was primarily due to increases in real estate taxes and utilities. The increase in other industrial property operating costs was primarily due to insurance, cleaning and non reimbursable expenses. The decrease in property operating costs from non U.S. industrial properties is primarily due to the contribution of 4.2 million square feet of operating properties and approximately 1.8 million square feet of completed development projects into AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to additional staffing and the opening of new offices both domestically and internationally. The decrease of fund costs from the prior year is due primarily to the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. The impairment losses during the year ended December 31, 2007 were taken on non core assets as a result of leasing activities and changes in the economic environment. The impairment losses during the year ended December 31, 2006 were taken on several non core assets as a result of leasing activities and changes in the economic environment 45 Table of Contents and the holding period of certain assets. Other expenses increased approximately $2.5 million from the prior year due primarily to an increase in dead deal expenditures. For the Years Ended December 31, Other Income and (Expenses) 2007 2006 $ Change % Change Development gains, net of taxes $ 124.3 $ 106.4 $ 17.9 16.8 % Gains from dispositions of real estate interests, net 73.4 73.4 100.0 % Equity in earnings of unconsolidated co investment ventures, net 7.5 23.2 (15.7 ) (67.7 )% Other income 22.3 11.9 10.4 87.4 % Interest expense, including amortization (126.9 ) (165.1 ) (38.2 ) (23.1 )% Total other income and (expenses), net $ 100.6 $ (23.6 ) $ (124.2 ) (526.3 )% Development gains represent gains from the sale or contribution of development projects including land. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we sold seven completed development projects totaling 0.5 million square feet and three land parcels for approximately $115.1 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $28.6 million. In addition, we contributed 15 completed development projects totaling 3.6 million square feet and two land parcels into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS, AMB DFS Fund I, LLC, and AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., five of our unconsolidated co investment ventures. As a result of these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after tax gain of $95.7 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed assets acquired by the third party co investors for cash. During 2006, we sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $13.3 million. In addition, during 2006, we received approximately $0.4 million in connection with the condemnation of a parcel of land resulting in a loss of $1.0 million, $0.8 million of which was the co investment venture partners share. During 2006, we also contributed a total of ten completed development projects into unconsolidated co investment ventures. Four projects totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Japan Fund I, L.P, two projects totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet were contributed into AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, three projects totaling approximately 0.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and one land parcel was contributed into AMB DFS Fund I, LLC. As a result of these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after tax gain of $94.1 million, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party investors for cash. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we contributed 4.2 million square feet in operating properties into AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS, contributed a 0.2 million square foot operating property into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and contributed an operating property aggregating approximately 0.1 million square feet into AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, for a total of approximately $524.9 million. As a result of these contributions, we recognized gains from contribution of real estate interests of approximately $73.4 million, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed properties acquired by the third party investors for cash. The decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated co investment ventures of approximately $15.7 million was primarily due to a decrease in gains from the disposition of real estate by our unconsolidated co investment ventures partially offset by the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. Other income increased approximately $10.4 million from the prior year due primarily to an increase in the gain on currency remeasurement of approximately $3.9 million, an increase in insurance proceeds of approximately $2.9 million related to losses from Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma and an increase in interest income of $2.3 million. The decrease in interest expense, including amortization, was due primarily to decreased borrowings on unsecured credit facilities and the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P.

The increase in preferred stock dividends is due to the then newly issued shares. On April 17, 2007, the operating partnership redeemed all 800,000 of its outstanding 7.95% Series J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units and all 800,000 of its outstanding 7.95% Series K Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units. In addition, on April 17, 2007, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, repurchased all 510,000 of its outstanding 8.00% Series I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units. As a result of the redemptions and repurchase, we recognized a reduction of income available to common stockholders of $2.9 million for the original issuance costs during the year ended December 31, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2006, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, repurchased all 840,000 of its outstanding 8.125% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units, all 220,440 of its outstanding 7.75% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units, all 201,139 of its outstanding 7.95% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units and all 729,582 of its outstanding 5.00% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units. As a result, we recognized a decrease in income available to common stockholders of $1.1 million for the original issuance costs, net of discount on repurchase. For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (dollars in millions): For the Years Ended December 31, Revenues 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Rental revenues U.S. industrial: Same store $ 580.0 $ 556.4 $ 23.6 4.2 % 2006 acquisitions 10.4 10.4 100.0 % Development 4.7 2.0 2.7 135.0 % Other industrial 7.6 3.2 4.4 137.5 % Non U.S. industrial 62.5 41.4 21.1 51.0 % Total rental revenues 665.2 603.0 62.2 10.3 % Private capital revenues 46.1 43.9 2.2 5.0 % Total revenues $ 711.3 $ 646.9 $ 64.4 10.0 % U.S. industrial same store revenues increased $23.6 million from the prior year despite the decrease of $66.6 million in same store revenues due to the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., effective October 1, 2006, attributable primarily to improved occupancy and increased rental rates in various markets. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 29 properties, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2006 consisted of 31 properties, aggregating approximately 7.3 million square feet. The increase in rental revenues from development was primarily due to increased occupancy at several of our development projects where development activities have been substantially completed as well as an increase in the number of development projects. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have 47 Table of Contents been contributed to unconsolidated co investment ventures, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. Non U.S. industrial revenues increased approximately $21.1 million from the prior year due primarily to the stabilization of properties in Japan and the continued acquisition of properties in France, Germany, and Mexico. The increase in private capital income was primarily due to increased asset management and acquisition fees from additional assets held in co investment ventures, which were partially offset by a decrease in incentive distributions of approximately $3.9 million. During 2006, we received incentive distributions of $22.5 million, of which $19.8 million was from AMB Partners II, L.P., as compared to incentive distribution of $26.4 million for the sale of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., during 2005.

The 2005 acquisitions consisted of 29 properties, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. The 2006 acquisitions consisted of 31 properties, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to unconsolidated co investment ventures, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. Non U.S. industrial property operating costs increased approximately $5.7 million from the prior year due primarily to the stabilization of properties in Japan and the continued acquisition of properties in France, Germany, and Mexico. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate during the year. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased stock based compensation expense as a result of higher values assigned to option and stock awards and executive departures, additional staffing and expenses for our international expansion, and the acquisition of AMB Blackpine. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our co investment ventures. The 2006 impairment loss was taken on several non core assets as a result of leasing activities and changes in the economic environment and the holding 48 Table of Contents period of certain assets. Other expenses decreased approximately $2.4 million from the prior year due primarily to a decrease in losses associated with our deferred compensation plan and a decrease in certain deal costs. For the Years Ended December 31, Other Income and (Expenses) 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Development profits, net of taxes $ 106.4 $ 54.8 $ 51.6 94.2 % Gains from dispositions of real estate interests, net 19.1 (19.1 ) 100.0 % Equity in earnings of unconsolidated co investment ventures, net 23.2 10.8 12.4 114.8 % Other income 11.9 7.5 4.4 58.7 % Interest expense, including amortization (165.1 ) (147.5 ) 17.6 11.9 % Total other income and (expenses), net $ (23.6 ) $ (55.3 ) $ (31.7 ) (57.3 )% Development profits represent gains from the sale of development projects and land as part of our development for sale program. The increase in development profits was due to increased disposition and contribution volume during 2006. During 2006, we sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $13.3 million. In addition, during 2006, we received approximately $0.4 million in connection with the condemnation of a parcel of land resulting in a loss of $1.0 million, $0.8 million of which was the co investment venture partners share. During 2006, we also contributed a total of ten completed development projects into unconsolidated co investment ventures. Four projects totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Japan Fund I, L.P, two projects totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet were contributed into AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, three projects totaling approximately 0.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and one land parcel was contributed into AMB DFS Fund I, LLC. As a result of these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after tax gain of $94.1 million, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party investors for cash. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated co investment venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $1.9 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. The 2005 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted primarily from our contribution of $106.9 million (using the exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties to our then newly formed unconsolidated co investment venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. The $12.4 million increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated co investment ventures was primarily due to gains of $17.5 million from the disposition of real estate by our unconsolidated co investment ventures during 2006. During 2005, such gains were $5.5 million. In addition, effective October 1, 2006, the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., resulted in an increase of approximately $5.1 million in equity in earnings of unconsolidated co investment ventures. The increases in 2006 were partially offset by an increase in expenses by our unconsolidated co investment ventures. The increase in other income was primarily due to increased bank interest income and an increase in property management income due to the expansion of our property management activities. The increase in interest expense, including amortization, was due primarily to increased borrowings on unsecured credit facilities and other debt.

During 2005, we divested ourselves of 18 industrial properties and one retail center, aggregating approximately 9.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $926.6 million, with a resulting net gain of $113.6 million. Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., for $618.5 million. The multi investor fund owned approximately 5.8 million square feet. We received cash and a distribution of an on tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund. For the Years Ended December 31, Preferred Stock 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Preferred stock dividends $ (13.6 ) $ (7.4 ) $ 6.2 83.8 % Preferred unit redemption (issuance costs) discount (1.1 ) 1.1 100.0 % Total preferred stock $ (14.7 ) $ (7.4 ) $ 7.3 98.6 % In December 2005, we issued 3,000,000 shares of 7.00% Series O Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. In August 2006, we issued 2,000,000 shares of 6.85% Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. The increase in preferred stock dividends is due to the newly issued shares. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2006, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, repurchased all 840,000 of its outstanding 8.125% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units, all 220,440 of its outstanding 7.75% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units, all 201,139 of its outstanding 7.95% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units and all 729,582 of its outstanding 5.00% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units. As a result, we recognized a decrease in income available to common stockholders of $1.1 million for the original issuance costs, net of discount on repurchase. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Balance Sheet Strategy. In general, we use unsecured lines of credit, unsecured notes, preferred stock and common equity (issued by us and or the operating partnership and its subsidiaries) to capitalize our wholly owned assets. Over time, we plan to retire non recourse, secured debt encumbering our wholly owned assets and replace that debt with unsecured notes where practicable. In managing the co investment ventures, in general, we use non recourse, secured debt to capitalize our co investment ventures. We currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for acquisitions, development, expansion and renovation of properties will include: retained earnings and cash flow from operations; private capital from co investment partners; net proceeds from contributions of properties and completed development projects to our co investment ventures; net proceeds from the sales of development projects, value added conversion projects and land to third parties; net proceeds from divestitures of properties; proceeds from equity (common and preferred) or debt securities offerings; borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities; other forms of secured or unsecured financing; and proceeds from limited partnership unit offerings (including issuances of limited partnership units by our subsidiaries). 50 Table of Contents We currently expect that our principal funding requirements will include: working capital; development, expansion and renovation of properties; acquisitions; debt service; and dividends and distributions on outstanding common and preferred stock and limited partnership units. Cash flows. As of December 31, 2007, cash provided by operating activities was $240.5 million as compared to $335.9 million for the same period in 2006. This change is primarily due to changes in our assets and liabilities offset by gains from sales and contributions of real estate interests, net, and an increase in operating distributions received by unconsolidated co investment ventures. Cash used in investing activities was $632.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to cash used for investing activities of $880.6 million for the same period in 2006. This change is primarily due to a decrease in cash used for property acquisitions, offset by additions to interests in unconsolidated co investment ventures and additions to land and buildings. Cash provided by financing activities was $420.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to cash provided by financing activities of $483.6 million for the same period in 2006. This change is due primarily to an increase in payments on other debt, credit facilities, senior debt, the cost of repurchase of preferred units, and a decrease in proceeds from issuances of senior debt, and contributions from co investment partners. This activity was partially offset by the issuance of common stock and increased borrowings on secured debt and credit facilities. We believe our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow from operations, borrowings available under our unsecured credit facilities and our ability to access private and public debt and equity capital, are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Resources Development sales activity to third parties during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was as follows (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Number of completed development projects 7 6 5 Number of land parcels 3 5 5 Square feet 498,017 1,323,748 921,740 Gross sales price $ 130,419 $ 86,629 $ 155,206 Development gains, net of taxes $ 28,575 $ 12,440 $ 52,925 51 Table of Contents Development contribution activity during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was as follows (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Number of projects contributed to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. 4 3 Square feet 1,006,164 554,279 Number of projects contributed to AMB SGP Mexico, LLC 2 2 1 Square feet 329,114 843,439 391,457 Number of land parcels contributed to AMB DFS Fund I, LLC 2 1 Square feet Number of projects contributed to AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS 8 Square feet 1,838,011 Number of projects contributed to AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. 1 4 Square feet 469,627 2,644,258 Total number of contributed development assets 17 10 1 Total square feet 3,642,916 4,041,976 391,457 Development gains, net of taxes $ 95,713 $ 93,949 $ 1,886 Property Divestitures. During 2007, we divested ourselves of three industrial properties, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $120.0 million, with a resulting net gain of approximately $2.0 million and a gain of approximately $60.0 million associated with the sale of two value added conversion projects. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized development profits of approximately $95.7 million, as a result of the contribution of 15 completed development projects and approximately 82 acres of land to AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., AMB DFS Fund I, LLC, and AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. In addition, we recognized development profits of approximately $28.6 million as a result of the sale of seven development projects and 76 acres of land during the year ended December 31, 2007.

We recognized a gain of $73.4 million on the contributions, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed properties acquired by the third party investors for cash. During 2006, there were no comparable events. Properties Held for Contribution. As of December 31, 2007, we held for contribution to co investment ventures 17 properties with an aggregate net book value of $488.3 million, which, when contributed, will reduce our average ownership interest in these projects from approximately 90% currently to an expected range of 15 20%. Properties Held for Divestiture. As of December 31, 2007, we held for divestiture five properties with an aggregate net book value of $40.5 million. These properties either are not in our core markets or do not meet our current investment objectives, or are included as part of our development for sale or value added conversion programs. The divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. Properties held for divestiture are stated at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less costs to sell. Co investment Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment ventures with institutional investors. These co investment ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund certain acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. We consolidate these co investment ventures for financial reporting purposes when they are 52 Table of Contents not variable interest entities and when we are the sole managing general partner and control all major operating decisions. However, in certain cases, our co investment ventures are unconsolidated because we do not control all major operating decisions and the general partners do not have significant rights under the EITF Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights. Third party equity interests in the co investment ventures are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2007, we owned approximately 83.4 million square feet of our properties (56.5% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated co investment ventures. We may make additional investments through these co investment ventures or new co investment ventures in the future and presently plan to do so.

These equity investments of approximately $2.1 million and $2.7 million, respectively, are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006.

We contributed the net proceeds of approximately $55.4 million to the operating partnership, and in exchange, the operating partnership issued to us 2,300,000 63/4% Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units. On June 23, 2003, we issued and sold 2,000,000 shares of 61/2% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at a price of $25.00 per share. Dividends are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable quarterly in arrears at a rate per share equal to $1.625 per annum. The series L preferred stock is redeemable by us on or after June 23, 2008, subject to certain conditions, for cash at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, if any, to the redemption date. We contributed the net proceeds of approximately $48.0 million to the operating partnership, and in exchange, the operating partnership issued to us 2,000,000 61/2% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units. The operating partnership used the proceeds, in addition to proceeds previously contributed to the operating partnership from other equity issuances, to redeem all 3,995,800 of its 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units from us on July 28, 2003. We, in turn, used those proceeds to redeem all 3,995,800 of our 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for $100.2 million, including all accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, to the redemption date. In December 2005, our board of directors approved a two year common stock repurchase program for the discretionary repurchase of up to $200.0 million of our common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate price of $53.4 million at a weighted average price of $49.87 per share. We have the authorization to repurchase up to an additional $146.6 million of our common stock under this program. On December 18, 2007, we extended this program through December 31, 2009. Debt. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, we presently intend over the long term to operate with an our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio of approximately 45% or less. As of December 31, 2007, our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio was 34.4%. (See footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratios table below for our definitions of our share of total market capitalization, market equity and our share of total debt.) However, we typically finance our co investment ventures with secured debt at a loan to value ratio of 50 65% per our co investment venture agreements. Additionally, we currently intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these policies, however, our organizational 56 Table of Contents documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our management could alter or eliminate these policies without stockholder approval or circumstances could arise that could render us unable to comply with these policies. As of December 31, 2007, the aggregate principal amount of our secured debt was $1.5 billion, excluding unamortized debt premiums of $4.2 million. Of the $1.5 billion of secured debt, $1.1 billion is secured by properties in our co investment ventures. The secured debt is generally non recourse and bears interest at rates varying from 1.1% to 9.4% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 5.6%) and final maturity dates ranging from January 2008 to February 2024. As of December 31, 2007, $1.0 billion of the secured debt obligations bear interest at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%, while the remaining $426.0 million bear interest at variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 3.8%). On February 14, 2007, seven subsidiaries of AMB SGP, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, which is one of our subsidiaries, entered into a loan agreement for a $305 million secured financing. On the same day, pursuant to the loan agreement, the same seven subsidiaries delivered four promissory notes to the two lenders, each of which matures on March 5, 2012. One note has a principal of $160 million and an interest rate that is fixed at 5.29%. The second is a $40 million note with an interest rate of 81 basis points above the one month LIBOR rate. The third note has a principal of $84 million and a fixed interest rate of 5.90%. The fourth note has a principal of $21 million and bears interest at a rate of 135 basis points above the one month LIBOR rate. As of December 31, 2007, the operating partnership had outstanding an aggregate of $1.0 billion in unsecured senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 6.1% and had an average term of 4.2 years. The unsecured senior debt securities are subject to various covenants. The covenants contain affirmative covenants, including compliance with financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to its senior debt securities. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then our cash flow may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Credit Facilities. The operating partnership has a $550.0 million (includes Euros, Yen, British pounds sterling or U.S. dollar denominated borrowings) unsecured revolving credit facility, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% at December 31, 2007. This facility matures on June 1, 2010. We are a guarantor of the operating partnerships obligations under the credit facility. The line carries a one year extension option and can be increased to up to $700.0 million upon certain conditions. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the operating partnerships long term debt rating, which was 42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2007, with an annual facility fee of 15 basis points. The four year credit facility includes a multi currency component, under which up to $550.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Euros, Yen or British pounds sterling. The operating partnership uses the credit facility principally for acquisitions, funding development activity and general working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2007, the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2007, was $259.4 million and the remaining amount available was $273.8 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $16.8 million. AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating partnership, has a Yen denominated unsecured revolving credit facility with an initial borrowing limit of 55.0 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2007, equaled approximately $492.4 million U.S. dollars and bore a weighted average interest rate of 1.2%. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K. under the credit facility, as well as the obligations of any other entity in which the operating partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the credit agreement. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and for other real estate purposes in Japan, China and South Korea. Generally, borrowers under the credit 57 Table of Contents facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the credit facility with certain real estate assets or equity in entities holding such real estate assets. The credit facility matures in June 2010 and has a one year extension option. The extension option is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding commitments under the facility at that time. The rate on the borrowings is generally TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt and was 42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2007. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, payable in quarterly amounts, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt, and was 15 basis points of the outstanding commitments under the facility as of December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2007, the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2007, was $399.5 million in U.S. dollars. The credit agreement contains affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. On July 16, 2007, certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries and the operating partnership, each acting as a borrower, with us and the operating partnership as guarantors, entered into a fifth amended and restated revolving credit agreement for a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility that replaced the existing $250 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The fifth amended and restated credit facility amends the fourth amended and restated credit facility to, among other things, increase the facility amount to $500 million with an option to further increase the facility to $750 million, to extend the maturity date to July 2011 and to allow for future borrowing in Indian rupees. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations for such subsidiaries and other entities controlled by the operating partnership that are selected by the operating partnership from time to time to be borrowers under and pursuant to our credit facility. Generally, borrowers under the credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the credit facility. The credit facility includes a multi currency component under which up to $500.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Singapore dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds sterling, and Euros with the ability to add Indian rupees. The line, which matures in July 2011 and carries a one year extension option, can be increased to up to $750.0 million upon certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding commitments. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships senior unsecured long term debt, which was 60 basis points as of December 31, 2007, with an annual facility fee based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships senior unsecured long term debt. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and general working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2007, the outstanding balance on this credit facility was approximately $217.2 million and bore a weighted average interest rate of 5.3%. The credit agreement contains affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios by the operating partnership, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. On December 8, 2006, we executed a 228.0 million Euros facility agreement (approximately $303.3 million in U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at June 12, 2007, the date the facility was assumed by AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS, as discussed below), which provides that certain of our affiliates may borrow either acquisition loans, up to a 100.0 million Euros sub limit (approximately $133.0 million in U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at June 12, 2007), or secured term loans, in connection with properties located in France, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Italy or Spain. On March 21, 2007, we increased the facility amount limit from 228.0 million Euros to 328.0 million Euros. Drawings under the term facility bear interest at a rate of 65 basis points over EURIBOR and may occur until, and mature on, April 30, 2014. Drawings under the acquisition loan facility bear interest at a rate of 75 basis points over EURIBOR and are repayable within six months of the date of advance, unless extended. We initially guaranteed the acquisition loan facility and were the carve out indemnitor in respect of the term loans. In accordance with the terms of the facility agreement, on June 12, 2007, AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS, assumed, and the operating partnership was released from, all of the operating partnerships obligations and liabilities under the facility agreement. On June 12, 2007, there were 267.0 million Euros (approximately $355.2 million in U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at June 12, 2007) of term loans and no acquisition loans outstanding under the facility agreement. 58 Table of Contents The tables below summarize our debt maturities and capitalization and reconcile our share of total debt to total consolidated debt as of December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands): Our Co investment Unsecured Secured Venture Senior Credit Other Total Debt(1) Debt(1) Debt Facilities(2) Debt Debt 2008 $ 199,970 $ 98,989 $ 175,000 $ $ 13,408 $ 487,367 2009 25,799 122,671 100,000 873 249,343 2010 65,905 102,661 250,000 658,928 941 1,078,435 2011 115 189,420 75,000 217,177 1,014 482,726 2012 3,753 459,111 61,093 523,957 2013 3,053 46,195 175,000 65,920 290,168 2014 3,216 4,102 616 7,934 2015 3,387 18,806 112,491 664 135,348 2016 3,567 54,795 58,362 Thereafter 42,267 19,091 125,000 186,358 Subtotal $ 351,032 $ 1,115,841 $ 1,012,491 $ 876,105 $ 144,529 $ 3,499,998 Unamortized premiums/(discount) 1,027 3,187 (9,368 ) (5,154 ) Total consolidated debt $ 352,059 $ 1,119,028 $ 1,003,123 $ 876,105 $ 144,529 $ 3,494,844 AMBs share of unconsolidated co investment venture debt(3) 556,710 36,368 593,078 Total debt(4) $ 352,059 $ 1,675,738 $ 1,003,123 $ 876,105 $ 180,897 $ 4,087,922 Co investment venture partners share of consolidated debt(4) (715,409 ) (100,000 ) (815,409 ) Our share of total debt(4) $ 352,059 $ 960,329 $ 1,003,123 $ 876,105 $ 80,897 $ 3,272,513 Weighted average interest rate 4.0 % 6.1 % 6.1 % 3.4 % 6.0 % 5.2 % Weighted average maturity (years) 2.4 4.1 4.2 2.7 4.6 3.6 (1) Our secured debt and co investment venture debt include debt related to European and Asian assets in the amount of $62.0 million and $192.1 million, respectively, translated to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2007.

(3) The weighted average interest and average maturity for the unconsolidated co investment venture debt were 4.8% and 5.4 years, respectively. (4) Our share of total debt represents the pro rata portion of the total debt based on our percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated or unconsolidated co investment ventures holding the debt. We believe that our share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze our leverage and to compare our leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of our debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their co investment ventures. Our share of total debt is not intended to reflect our actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the co investment ventures.

As of December 31, 2007, we had $30.2 million in restricted cash. Our board of directors declared a regular cash dividend for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 of $0.50 per share of common stock, and the operating partnership announced its intention to pay a regular cash distribution for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 of $0.50 per common unit. The dividends and distributions were payable on January 7, 2008 to stockholders and unitholders of record on December 21, 2007.

The anticipated size of our distributions, using only cash from operations, will not allow us to pay all of our debt as it comes due. Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. 61 Table of Contents Capital Commitments Development starts, generally defined as projects where we have obtained building permits and have begun physical construction, during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 The Americas: Number of new development projects 26 16 Number of value added conversion projects(1) 1 2 Square feet 7,427,914 5,428,642 Estimated total investment(2) $ 559,276 $ 356,843 Europe: Number of new development projects 6 4 Square feet 1,687,601 711,956 Estimated total investment(2) $ 220,200 $ 72,104 Asia: Number of new development projects 6 8 Square feet 3,060,335 4,283,572 Estimated total investment(2) $ 305,872 $ 485,344 Total: Number of new development projects 38 28 Number of value added conversion projects 1 2 Square feet 12,175,850 10,424,170 Estimated total investment(2) $ 1,085,348 $ 914,291 Land acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 The Americas: Acres 1,231 774 Estimated build out potential (square feet) 21,083,750 11,974,941 Investment(3) $ 221,645 $ 199,785 Europe: Acres 182 Estimated build out potential (square feet) 3,328,267 Investment(3) $ 38,544 Asia: Acres 28 61 Estimated build out potential (square feet) 997,537 3,506,843 Investment(3) $ 20,977 $ 93,429 Total: Acres 1,441 835 Estimated build out potential (square feet) 25,409,554 15,481,784 Investment(3) $ 281,166 $ 293,214 62 Table of Contents (1) Value added conversion projects represent the repurposing of industrial properties to a higher and better use, including office, residential, retail, research and development or manufacturing.

As of December 31, 2007, we had 56 industrial projects in our development pipeline, which are expected to total approximately 17.8 million square feet and have an aggregate estimated investment of $1.7 billion upon completion. We have an additional 12 development projects available for sale or contribution totaling approximately 4.2 million square feet, with an aggregate estimated investment of $304.7 million. As of December 31, 2007, we and our co investment venture partners have funded an aggregate of $1.2 billion and needed to fund an estimated additional $500 million in order to complete our development pipeline. The development pipeline, at December 31, 2007, included projects expected to be completed through the fourth quarter of 2009. In addition to our committed development pipeline, we hold a total of 2,535 acres of land for future development or 63 Table of Contents sale, approximately 91% of which is located in the Americas. We currently estimate that these 2,535 acres of land could support approximately 44.0 million square feet of future development. Lease Commitments. We have entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily on tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms from one to 55 years. These buildings and improvements subject to ground leases are amortized ratably over the lesser of the terms of the related leases or 40 years. Future minimum rental payments required under non cancelable operating leases in effect as of December 31, 2007 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2008 $ 23,208 2009 22,632 2010 21,932 2011 21,577 2012 20,501 Thereafter 284,158 Total $ 394,008 Co investment Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment ventures with institutional investors. These co investment ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. As of December 31, 2007, we had investments in co investment ventures with a gross book value of $2.5 billion, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, and net equity investments in five significant unconsolidated co investment ventures of $274.9 million and a gross book value of $4.4 billion. As of December 31, 2007, we may make additional capital contributions to current and planned co investment ventures of up to $151.0 million (using the exchange rates at December 31, 2007) pursuant to the terms of the co investment venture agreements. From time to time, we may raise additional equity commitments for AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open ended unconsolidated co investment venture formed in 2004 with institutional investors, which invests through a private real estate investment partnership, and for AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS, an open ended unconsolidated co investment venture formed in 2007 with institutional investors. This would increase our obligation to make additional capital commitments to these funds. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and the management regulations of AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS, we are obligated to contribute 20% of the total equity commitments to each fund until such time when our total equity commitment is greater than $150.0 million or 150.0 million Euros, respectively, at which time, our obligation is reduced to 10% of the total equity commitments. We expect to fund these contributions with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances or net proceeds from property divestitures, which could adversely affect our cash flow. Captive Insurance Company. In December 2001, we formed a wholly owned captive insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd. (Arcata), which provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the deductible under our third party policies. The captive insurance company is one element of our overall risk management program. We capitalized Arcata in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata established annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss experience of our properties. Annually, we engage an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims, related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata may be adjusted based on this estimate. Like premiums paid to third party insurance companies, premiums paid to Arcata may be reimbursed by customers pursuant to specific lease terms. Through this structure, we think that we have more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market. Potential Contingent and Unknown Liabilities. Contingent and unknown liabilities may include the following: liabilities for environmental conditions; claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with our acquisition transactions that had not been asserted prior to our formation or acquisition transactions; 64 Table of Contents accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; and tax liabilities. Overview of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our debt, interest and lease payments due by period as of December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands): Less than 1 3 3 5 More than Contractual Obligations 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Total Debt $ 487,367 $ 1,327,778 $ 1,006,683 $ 678,170 $ 3,499,998 Debt interest payments 22,582 62,781 55,806 72,238 213,407 Operating lease commitments 23,208 44,564 42,078 284,158 394,008 Construction commitments 77,194 77,194 Total $ 610,351 $ 1,435,123 $ 1,104,567 $ 1,034,566 $ 4,184,607 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Standby Letters of Credit. As of December 31, 2007, we had provided approximately $24.2 million in letters of credit, of which $16.8 million were provided under the operating partnerships $550.0 million unsecured credit facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other commitments. Guarantees and Contribution Obligations. Excluding parent guarantees associated with unsecured debt or contribution obligations as discussed in Notes 5 and 9, we had outstanding guarantees and contribution obligations in the aggregate amount of $405.2 million as described below. As of December 31, 2007, we had outstanding guarantees in the amount of $95.9 million in connection with certain acquisitions. As of December 31, 2007, we also guaranteed $41.2 million and $107.9 million on outstanding loans on five of our consolidated co investment ventures and two of our unconsolidated co investment ventures, respectively. Also, we have entered into contribution agreements with certain of our unconsolidated co investment venture funds. These contribution agreements require us to make additional capital contributions to the applicable co investment venture fund upon certain defaults by the co investment venture of certain of its debt obligations to the lenders. Such additional capital contributions will cover all or part of the applicable co investment ventures debt obligation and may be greater than our share of the co investment ventures debt obligation or the value of our share of any property securing such debt. Our contribution obligations under these agreements will be reduced by the amounts recovered by the lender and the fair market value of the property, if any, used to secure the debt and obtained by the lender upon default. Our potential obligations under these contribution agreements are $160.2 million as of December 31, 2007. Performance and Surety Bonds. As of December 31, 2007, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $15.2 million. These bonds were issued in connection with certain of our development projects and were posted to guarantee certain tax obligations and the construction of certain real property improvements and infrastructure. Performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the taxes due or the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. Promoted Interests and Other Contractual Obligations. Upon the achievement of certain return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, we may be obligated to make payments to certain of our co investment venture partners pursuant to the terms and provisions of their contractual agreements with us. From time to time in the normal course of our business, we enter into various contracts with third parties that may obligate us to make payments, pay promotes, or perform other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. 65 Table of Contents SUPPLEMENTAL EARNINGS MEASURES Funds From Operations (FFO) and Funds From Operations Per Share and Unit (FFOPS). We believe that net income, as defined by U.S. GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider funds from operations, or FFO, and FFO per share and unit, or FFOPS, to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. We define FFOPS as FFO per fully diluted weighted average share of our common stock and operating partnership units. We calculate FFO as net income, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, less gains (or losses) from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estate related depreciation, and adjustments to derive our pro rata share of FFO of consolidated and unconsolidated co investment ventures. We do not adjust FFO to eliminate the effects of non recurring charges. We include the gains from development, including those from value added conversion projects, before depreciation recapture, as a component of FFO. We believe that value added conversion dispositions are in substance land sales and as such should be included in FFO, consistent with the real estate investment trust industrys long standing practice to include gains on the sale of land in FFO. However, our interpretation of FFO or FFOPS may not be consistent with the views of others in the real estate investment trust industry, who may consider it to be a divergence from the NAREIT definition, and may not be comparable to FFO or FFOPS reported by other real estate investment trusts that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. In connection with the formation of a co investment venture, we may warehouse assets that are acquired with the intent to contribute these assets to the newly formed venture. Some of the properties held for contribution may, under certain circumstances, be required to be depreciated under U.S. GAAP. If this circumstance arises, we intend to include in our calculation of FFO gains or losses related to the contribution of previously depreciated real estate to co investment ventures. Although such a change, if instituted, will be a departure from the current NAREIT definition, we believe such a calculation of FFO will better reflect the value created as a result of the contributions. To date, we have not included gains or losses from the contribution of previously depreciated warehoused assets in FFO. AMB believes that FFO and FFOPS are meaningful supplemental measures of its operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Thus, FFO and FFOPS are supplemental measures of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that exclude historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by U.S. GAAP. We believe that the use of FFO and FFOPS, combined with the required U.S. GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO and FFOPS to be useful measures for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO and FFOPS can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO and FFOPS are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, these measures do not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO and FFOPS also do not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets nor are FFO or FFOPS necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. 66 Table of Contents The following table reflects the calculation of FFO reconciled from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts): 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Net income available to common stockholders(1) $ 295,524 $ 209,420 $ 250,419 $ 118,340 $ 116,716 Gains from sale or contribution of real estate, net of minority interests(2) (85,544 ) (42,635 ) (132,652 ) (47,224 ) (50,325 ) Depreciation and amortization: Total depreciation and amortization 161,925 174,721 159,469 134,574 109,828 Discontinued operations depreciation 1,801 5,256 20,835 32,776 32,509 Non real estate depreciation (5,623 ) (4,546 ) (3,388 ) (871 ) (720 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from consolidated co investment ventures: Co investment venture partners minority interests (Net income) 27,748 37,190 35,338 29,027 21,041 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Net income) 5,121 2,367 3,045 1,957 1,806 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Development gains) 7,148 4,948 2,262 435 344 Discontinued operations minority interests (Net income) 370 1,254 10,198 14,724 16,760 FFO attributable to minority interests (62,902 ) (82,861 ) (100,275 ) (80,192 ) (65,603 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from unconsolidated co investment ventures: Our share of net income (7,467 ) (23,240 ) (10,770 ) (3,781 ) (5,445 ) Our share of FFO 27,391 16,038 14,441 7,549 9,755 Our share of development gains, net of taxes 5,441 Funds from operations $ 365,492 $ 297,912 $ 254,363 $ 207,314 $ 186,666 Basic FFO per common share and unit $ 3.60 $ 3.24 $ 2.87 $ 2.39 $ 2.17 Diluted FFO per common share and unit $ 3.51 $ 3.12 $ 2.75 $ 2.30 $ 2.13 Weighted average common shares and units: Basic 101,550,001 92,047,678 88,684,262 86,885,250 85,859,899 Diluted 104,168,707 95,444,072 92,508,725 90,120,250 87,616,365 (1) Includes gains from undepreciated land sales of $9.2 million, $5.6 million, $25.0 million, $3.7 million and $1.2 million for 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003 respectively. (2) The information for 2007 includes accumulated depreciation re capture of approximately $10.1 million associated with the sale of two value added conversion projects. The information for 2005 includes accumulated depreciation re capture of approximately $1.1 million associated with the sale of one value added conversion project. 67 Table of Contents SS NOI. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider same store net operating income, or SS NOI, and cash basis SS NOI to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. Properties that are considered part of the same store pool include all properties that were owned, or owned and managed, as the case may be, as of the end of both the current and prior year reporting periods and exclude development properties for both the current and prior reporting periods. The same store pool is set annually and excludes properties purchased and developments stabilized after December 31, 2005 (generally defined as properties that are 90% leased or properties that have been substantially complete for at least 12 months). In deriving SS NOI, we define net operating income as rental revenues, including reimbursements, less property operating expenses, both of which are calculated in accordance with GAAP. Property operating expenses exclude depreciation, amortization, general and administrative expenses and interest expense. In calculating cash basis SS NOI, we exclude straight line rents and amortization of lease intangibles from the calculation of SS NOI. We consider cash basis SS NOI to be an appropriate and useful supplemental performance measure because it reflects the operating performance of our real estate portfolio excluding effects of non cash adjustments and provides a better measure of actual cash basis rental growth for a year over year comparison. In addition, we believe that SS NOI and cash basis SS NOI help the investing public compare our operating performance with that of other companies. While SS NOI and cash basis SS NOI are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, they do not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. SS NOI and cash basis SS NOI also do not reflect general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization costs, capital expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development and construction activities that could materially impact our results from operations. Further, our computation of SS NOI and cash basis SS NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating these measures. The following table reconciles SS NOI and cash basis SS NOI from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands): 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Net income $ 314,260 $ 224,072 $ 257,807 $ 125,471 $ 129,128 Private capital revenues (31,707 ) (46,102 ) (43,942 ) (12,895 ) (13,337 ) Depreciation and amortization 161,925 174,721 159,469 134,574 109,828 General and administrative 129,510 104,262 71,564 58,843 46,417 Fund costs 1,076 2,091 1,482 1,741 825 Impairment losses 1,157 6,312 5,251 Other expenses 5,112 2,620 5,038 892 475 Total other income and expenses (100,577 ) 23,609 55,339 120,161 95,918 Total minority interests share of income 54,845 61,632 73,348 52,103 55,896 Total discontinued operations (71,702 ) (60,852 ) (134,180 ) (71,344 ) (80,344 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (193 ) Net Operating Income (NOI) 463,899 492,172 445,925 409,546 350,057 Less non same store NOI (61,639 ) (104,147 ) (17,293 ) (22,725 ) (17,334 ) Less non cash adjustments(1) (2,861 ) (9,502 ) (15,237 ) (13,085 ) (6,111 ) Cash basis same store NOI $ 399,399 $ 378,523 $ 413,395 $ 373,736 $ 326,612 (1) Non cash adjustments include straight line rents and amortization of lease intangibles for the same store pool only. 68 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices, interest rates and international exchange rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimize the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings and our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2007, we had one outstanding interest rate swap with a notional amount of $25.0 million (in U.S. dollars). See Financial Instruments below. The table below summarizes the maturities and interest rates associated with our fixed and variable rate debt outstanding before net unamortized debt discounts of $5.2 million as of December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands): 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Fixed rate debt(1) $ 255,780 $ 185,957 $ 418,873 $ 248,484 $ 449,570 $ 576,675 $ 2,135,339 Average interest rate 6.9 % 5.0 % 6.5 % 6.7 % 5.9 % 10.8 % 7.5 % Variable rate debt(2) $ 231,587 $ 63,386 $ 659,562 $ 234,242 $ 74,387 $ 101,495 $ 1,364,659 Average interest rate 2.1 % 5.9 % 3.4 % 3.6 % 5.6 % 9.8 % 3.9 % Interest Payments $ 22,582 $ 12,913 $ 49,868 $ 25,131 $ 30,675 $ 72,238 $ 213,407 (1) Represents 61.0% of all outstanding debt at December 31, 2007. (2) Represents 39.0% of all outstanding debt at December 31, 2007. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased or decreased by 10%, then the increase or decrease in interest cost on the variable rate debt would be $5.0 million (net of the swap) annually. As of December 31, 2007, the book value and the estimated fair value of our total consolidated debt (both secured and unsecured) was $3.5 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively, based on our estimate of current market interest rates. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, variable rate debt comprised 39.0% and 37.1%, respectively, of all our outstanding debt. Variable rate debt was $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. The increase is primarily due to higher outstanding balances on our credit facilities. This increase in our outstanding variable rate debt increases our risk associated with unfavorable interest rate fluctuations. Financial Instruments. We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income or income. For revenues or expenses denominated in non functional currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instrument in effect at December 31, 2007 was one interest rate swap hedging cash flows of variable rate borrowings based on U.S. Libor (USD). The following table summarizes our financial instruments as of December 31, 2007 (in thousands): Maturity Dates June 9, Notional Related Derivatives (In thousands) 2010 Amount Fair Value Notional Amount (U.S. dollars) $ 25,000 $ 25,000 Receive Floating(%) US LIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 5.17 % Fair Market Value $ (786 ) $ (786 ) Total $ 25,000 $ (786 ) International Operations. Our exposure to market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries operating in the United States and Mexico. The functional currency for our subsidiaries operating outside the United States, other than Mexico, is generally the local currency 69 Table of Contents of the country in which the entity or property is located, mitigating the effect of foreign exchange gains and losses. Our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. We translate income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. The gains resulting from the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders equity and totaled $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Our international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. In these instances, non monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period. We also record gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated. For the year ended December 31, 2007, unrealized and realized gains from remeasurement and translation included in our results of operations were $3.9 million. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations GENERAL You should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial statements. We are a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust and expect that we have qualified, and will continue to qualify, as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes beginning with the year ended December 31, 1997. As a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust, our own employees perform our corporate administrative and management functions, rather than our relying on an outside manager for these services. We manage our portfolio of properties generally through direct property management performed by our own employees. Additionally, within our flexible operating model, we may from time to time establish relationships with third party real estate management firms, brokers and developers that provide some property level administrative and management services under our direction. Managements Overview The primary source of our revenue and earnings is rent received from customers under long term (generally three to ten years) operating leases at our properties, including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs. We also generate earnings from our private capital business, which consists of acquisition and development fees, asset management fees and priority distributions, and promoted interests and incentive distributions from our co investment ventures. Additionally, we generate earnings from the disposition of projects in our development for sale and value 37 Table of Contents added conversion programs, from the contributions of development properties to our co investment ventures and from land sales. Our long term growth is driven by our ability to: maintain and increase occupancy rates and or increase rental rates at our properties; continue to develop properties profitably and sell to third parties or contribute to our co investment ventures; and continue to grow our earnings from our private capital business through the contribution of properties or from the acquisition of new properties. Real Estate Operations Real estate fundamentals in the United States industrial markets held steady during 2007 due to balanced supply and demand. According to data provided by Torto Wheaton Research, availability was 9.4% for the quarter ended December 31, 2007, up 20 basis points from the prior quarter and unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2006. Activity levels were lower than the prior year. According to Torto Wheaton Research, absorption was 21.4 million square feet for the fourth quarter and 120.2 million square feet for the full year, down from 209.3 million square feet in 2006, whereas construction completions were 40.3 million square feet in the quarter and 126.8 million square feet for the full year, down from 175.1 million square feet in 2006. While absorption in 2007 was 17.5% below the 19 year quarter average, construction completions were 22.6% below the average for the same period, which we believe indicates a market in equilibrium with a moderating supply of new industrial space entering the market. Reflecting the slowdown in the U.S. economy, we believe that net absorption for the first quarter of 2008 will be at or slightly below the fourth quarter 2007 level and similar in the second quarter of 2008. We presently expect pick up in the second half of 2008 to a full year absorption level approximating that of 2007. With a similar moderation in deliveries, we believe that year end vacancy will also approximate that of 2007. We think the strongest industrial markets in the United States are the major coastal markets tied to global trade, including Southern California which is our largest market Seattle, the San Francisco Bay Area, Northern New Jersey/New York and Miami. While we expect demand to moderate in the first half of 2008, due primarily to the slower growth rate in import volumes and the uncertainty in the economy, we believe our coastal markets will outperform other U.S. industrial markets. These markets have some of the highest occupancy rates in the country and we, therefore, expect to see some further rate growth in 2008, even as the national economic picture plays out. The table below summarizes key operating and leasing statistics for our owned and managed operating properties for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Total/Weighted Owned and Managed Property Data(1) The Americas Europe Asia Average For the year ended December 31, 2007: Rentable square feet 101,627,803 8,500,962 8,051,530 118,180,295 Occupancy percentage at period end(3) 96.0 % 96.1 % 96.6 % 96.0 % Same space square footage leased 18,144,411 405,912 690,569 19,240,892 Trailing four quarter rent change on renewals and rollovers(2)(3) 4.1 % 7.6 % 19.5 % 4.9 % For the year ended December 31, 2006: Rentable square feet 92,498,200 4,238,193 3,966,522 100,702,915 Occupancy percentage at period end(3) 96.3 % 98.1 % 89.6 % 96.3 % Same space square footage leased 15,968,855 42,334 192,391 16,203,580 Trailing four quarter rent change on renewals and rollovers(2)(3) (0.1 )% (0.1 )% 1.0 % (0.1 )% (1) Schedule includes owned and managed operating properties which we define as properties in which we have at least a 10% ownership interest, for which we are the property or asset manager, and which we intend to hold for the long term. This excludes development and renovation projects and recently completed development projects available for sale or contribution. 38 Table of Contents (2) Rent changes on renewals and rollovers are calculated as the difference, weighted by square feet, of the net ABR due the first month of a term commencement and the net ABR due the last month of the former tenants term. If free rent is granted, then the first positive full rent value is used as a point of comparison. The rental amounts exclude base stop amounts, holdover rent and premium rent charges. If either the previous or current lease terms are under 12 months, then they are excluded from this calculation. If the lease is first generation or there is no prior lease for comparison, then it is excluded from this calculation. (3) On a consolidated basis for the Americas, Europe and Asia, occupancy percentage at period end for 2007 was 96.6%, 100.0% and 100.0%, and rent change on renewals and rollovers at period end for 2007 was 4.2%, 0.0% and 48.7%, respectively. On a consolidated basis, for the Americas, Europe and Asia, occupancy percentage at period end for 2006 was 97.0%, 98.1% and 100.0%, and rent change on renewals and rollovers at period end for 2006 was 4.2%, 0.0% and 0.0%, respectively. We believe that higher occupancy levels in our portfolio, driven in part by strengthening fundamentals in our markets tied to global trade, are contributing to rental rate growth in our portfolio. Our operating portfolios average occupancy rate in the fourth quarter of 2007 was 95.6%, on an owned and managed basis, an increase of 20 basis points from the prior quarter and 30 basis points from December 31, 2006. Rental rates on lease renewals and rollovers in our portfolio increased 4.9% in the fourth quarter of 2007, which we think reflect the generally positive trends in real estate fundamentals in our markets. During the quarter, cash basis same store net operating income, with and without the effect of lease termination fees, grew by 3.3% and 4.8%, respectively, on an owned and managed basis. See Supplemental Earnings Measures below for a discussion of cash basis same store net operating income and a reconciliation of cash basis same store net operating income and net income. We believe that market rents have generally recovered from their lows and, in many of our markets, are back to or above their prior peak levels of 2001. Private Capital Business In June 2007, we announced the formation of AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS, our eleventh co investment fund since our initial public offering in 1997. This Euro denominated, open end commingled fund is our tenth active fund. The funds investment strategy focuses on acquiring stabilized industrial distribution properties, including those developed by us, near high volume airports, seaports and transportation networks, and in the major metropolitan areas of Europe, with initial target markets in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom and Central/Eastern Europe. The gross asset value of AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS was approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2007. Going forward, we believe that our co investment program with private capital investors will continue to serve as a significant source of revenues and capital for new investments. Through these co investment ventures, we typically earn acquisition fees, asset management fees and priority distributions, as well as promoted interests and incentive distributions based on the performance of the co investment ventures; however, we cannot assure you that we will continue to do so. Through contribution of development properties to our co investment ventures, we expect to recognize value creation from our development pipeline. In anticipation of the formation of future co investment ventures, we may also hold acquired and newly developed properties for later contribution to future funds. As of December 31, 2007, we owned approximately 83.4 million square feet of our properties (56.5% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated co investment ventures. We may make additional investments through these co investment ventures or new co investment ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. Development Business Our development business consists of ground up development, redevelopment, renovations, land sales, and value added conversions. We generate earnings from our development business through the disposition or contribution of projects from these activities. We expect our development business to be a significant driver of our earnings growth as we expand the pipeline across each category. We believe that customer demand for new industrial space in strategic markets tied to global trade will continue to outpace supply. To capitalize on this demand, we intend to continue to expand our development business 39 Table of Contents in our existing markets and into new markets around the world that are essential to global trade. We also will continue to redevelop existing industrial buildings opportunistically by investing significant amounts of capital to enhance the functionality of the properties to meet current industrial market demands. In addition to our committed development pipeline, we hold a total of 2,535 acres of land for future development or sale, 91% of which is located in the Americas. We currently estimate that these 2,535 acres of land could support approximately 44.0 million square feet of future development. We believe that our historical investment focus on industrial real estate in some of the worlds most strategic infill markets positions us to create value through the select conversion of industrial properties to higher and better uses (value added conversions). Generally, we expect to sell to third parties our value added conversion projects at some point in the re entitlement/conversion process, thus recognizing the enhanced value of the underlying land that supports the propertys repurposed use. Value added conversions involve the repurposing of industrial properties to a higher and better use, including office, residential, retail, research development or manufacturing. Activities required to prepare the property for conversion to a higher and better use may include such activities as rezoning, redesigning, reconstructing and retenanting. The sales price of the value added conversion project is generally based on the underlying land value based on its ultimate use and as such, little to no residual value is ascribed to the industrial building. Our long term capital allocation goal is to have approximately 50% of our owned and managed operating portfolio invested in non U.S. markets based on owned and managed annualized base rent. As of December 31, 2007, our non U.S. operating properties comprised 23.8% of our owned and managed operating portfolio and 4.5% of our consolidated operating portfolio based on annualized base rent. In addition to the United States, we include Canada and Mexico as target countries in the Americas. In Europe, our target countries currently are Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. In Asia, our target countries currently are China, India, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. We expect to add additional target countries outside the United States in the future, including countries in Central/Eastern Europe. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust, we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income. As a result, we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our on going operations to the same extent that other corporations that are not real estate investment trusts can. We must continue to raise capital in both the debt and equity markets to fund our working capital needs, acquisitions and developments. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for a complete discussion of the sources of our capital. Summary of Key Transactions in 2007 During the year ended December 31, 2007, we completed the following significant capital deployment and other transactions: Acquired, on an owned and managed basis, 53 properties in the Americas, Asia and Europe aggregating approximately 11.9 million square feet for $1.0 billion, including 46 properties aggregating approximately 11.2 million square feet for $979.6 million through unconsolidated co investment ventures and seven properties aggregating approximately 0.7 million square feet for $62.2 million acquired directly by us; Committed to 38 new development projects and one value added conversion project in the Americas, Asia and Europe totaling 12.2 million square feet with an estimated total investment of approximately $1.1 billion; Acquired 1,441 acres of land for development in the Americas, Europe and Asia for approximately $281.2 million; Sold seven development projects totaling approximately 0.5 million square feet plus three land parcels for an aggregate sale price of $115.1 million; Formed an unconsolidated open end co investment venture, AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS, with the contribution to the co investment venture of $584.0 million (using the exchange rate on the date of contribution), aggregating approximately 4.7 million square feet of operating properties and completed development projects, and contributed an additional five completed development projects, aggregating 40 Table of Contents approximately 1.4 million square feet, for approximately $215.3 million during the year to this co investment venture; Contributed 10 completed development projects totaling 1.8 million square feet and two land parcels into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, AMB DFS Fund I, LLC, and AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., four of our unconsolidated co investment ventures; Divested three operating properties aggregating 0.3 million square feet and two value added conversion projects for approximately $120.0 million; and Exercised the purchase option for the remaining equity interest held by an unrelated third party member of AMB Pier One, LLC, which held the location of our global headquarters.

See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 5, 8 and 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our capital markets transactions. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Investments in Real Estate. Investments in real estate and leasehold interests are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. We also regularly review the impact of above or below market leases, in place leases and lease origination costs for acquisitions, and record an intangible asset or liability accordingly. Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a property by property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable. Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying value of the property. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future economics and market conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying value of our long lived assets could occur in the future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings. For properties held for sale, impairment is recognized when the carrying value of the property is less than its estimated fair value net of cost to sell. As a result of leasing activity and the economic environment, we re evaluated the carrying value of our investments and recorded impairment charges of $1.2 million, $6.3 million and $0.0, during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, on certain of our investments. Revenue Recognition. We record rental revenue from operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts, security deposits and letters of credit, then we may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our customers on an on going basis by reviewing their financial condition periodically as appropriate. Each period we review our outstanding accounts receivable, including straight line rents, for doubtful accounts and provide allowances as needed. We also record lease termination fees when a customer has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us. If a customer remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement, the applicable termination fees are deferred and recognized over the term of such customers occupancy. Property Dispositions. We report real estate dispositions in three separate categories on our consolidated statements of operations. First, when we divest a portion of our interests in real estate entities or properties, gains from the sale represent the interests acquired by third party investors for cash and are included in gains from disposition of real estate interests in the statement of operations. Second, we dispose of value added conversion projects and build to suit and speculative development projects for which we have not generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is reported net of estimated 42 Table of Contents taxes, when applicable, and are included in development profits, net of taxes, within continuing operations of the statement of operations. Third, we dispose of value added conversion and other redevelopment projects for which we may have generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized is reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable, in the development gains line within discontinued operations. Lastly, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, requires us to separately report as discontinued operations the historical operating results attributable to operating properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the properties, which is included in development gains and gains from dispositions of real estate, net of taxes and minority interests, in the statement of operations. The consolidated statements of operations for prior periods are also adjusted to conform with this classification. There is no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial position, net income or cash flows. In all cases, gains and losses are recognized using the full accrual method of accounting. Gains relating to transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met. Co investment Ventures. We hold interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated co investment ventures. We determine consolidation based on standards set forth in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, or FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46). For co investment ventures that are variable interest entities as defined under FIN 46 where we are not the primary beneficiary, we do not consolidate the co investment venture for financial reporting purposes. Based on the guidance set forth in EITF 04 5, we consolidate certain co investment venture investments because we exercise significant control over major operating decisions, such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, asset management, investment activity and changes in financing. For co investment ventures under EITF 04 5, where we do not exercise significant control over major operating and management decisions, but where we exercise significant influence, we use the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the co investment venture for financial reporting purposes. Capitalized General and Administrative Expenses. We capitalize general and administrative expenses, related to development projects based on time spent on development activities. Real Estate Investment Trust. As a real estate investment trust, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes in the United States if we meet minimum distribution, income, asset and shareholder tests. However, some of our subsidiaries may be subject to federal and state taxes. In addition, foreign entities may also be subject to the taxes of the host country. An income tax allocation is required to be estimated on our taxable income arising from our taxable real estate investment trust subsidiaries and international entities. A deferred tax component could arise based upon the differences in GAAP versus tax income for items such as depreciation and gain recognition. However, we believe deferred tax is an immaterial component of our consolidated balance sheet. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Effective October 1, 2006, we deconsolidated AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., on a prospective basis, due to the re evaluation of the accounting for our investment in the fund because of changes to the partnership agreement regarding the general partners rights effective October 1, 2006. As a result, our results of operations presented below are not comparable between years presented. The analysis below includes changes attributable to same store growth, acquisitions, development activity and divestitures. Same store pool includes all properties that are owned as of the end of both the current and prior year reporting periods and excludes development properties stabilized after December 31, 2005 (generally defined as properties that are 90% leased or properties that have been substantially complete for at least 12 months). As of December 31, 2007, same store industrial pool consisted of properties aggregating approximately 72.9 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2007 consisted of seven properties, aggregating approximately 0.7 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2006 consisted of 31 properties, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. During 2007, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 32 43 Table of Contents properties, aggregating approximately 8.6 million square feet. In 2006, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 50 properties, aggregating approximately 7.5 million square feet. Our future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition of additional properties and dispositions. Our future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical results. For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 (dollars in millions): For the Years Ended December 31, Revenues 2007 2006 $ Change % Change Rental revenues U.S. industrial: Same store $ 553.3 $ 580.0 $ (26.7 ) (4.6 )% 2007 acquisitions 0.5 0.5 100.0 % 2006 acquisitions 10.0 10.4 (0.4 ) (3.8 )% Development 10.7 4.7 6.0 127.7 % Other industrial 11.2 7.6 3.6 47.4 % Non U.S. industrial 52.3 62.5 (10.2 ) (16.3 )% Total rental revenues 638.0 665.2 (27.2 ) (4.1 )% Private capital revenues 31.7 46.1 (14.4 ) (31.2 )% Total revenues $ 669.7 $ 711.3 $ (41.6 ) (5.8 )% U.S. industrial same store rental revenues decreased $26.7 million from the prior year due primarily to the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., on October 1, 2006 partially offset by rent increases on renewals and rollovers. Same store rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been $513.4 million if AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. had been deconsolidated as of January 1, 2006. The 2006 acquisitions consisted of 31 properties, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. The 2007 acquisitions consisted of seven properties, aggregating approximately 0.7 million square feet. The increase in rental revenues from development was primarily due to increased occupancy at several of our development projects where development activities have been substantially completed as well as an increase in the number of development projects. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated co investment venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. The increase in other industrial revenues was primarily due to an increase in base rents. The decrease in revenues from non U.S. industrial properties was primarily due to the contribution of 4.2 million square feet of operating properties and approximately 1.8 million square feet of completed development projects into AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS. The decrease in private capital income of 44 Table of Contents $14.4 million was primarily due to a decrease in incentive fees, acquisition fees, and disposition fees offset by an increase in asset management fees as a result of an increase in total assets under management.

Same store operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been $140.3 million if AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. had been deconsolidated as of January 1, 2006. The increase of approximately $12.5 million, had AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. been deconsolidated as of January 1, 2006, was primarily due to increased insurance costs, real estate taxes, roads and grounds expense, and management fees. The 2006 acquisitions consisted of 31 properties, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. The 2007 acquisitions consisted of seven properties, aggregating approximately 0.7 million square feet. The increase in development operating costs was primarily due to increased operations in certain development projects which have been substantially completed. This increase was primarily due to increases in real estate taxes and utilities. The increase in other industrial property operating costs was primarily due to insurance, cleaning and non reimbursable expenses. The decrease in property operating costs from non U.S. industrial properties is primarily due to the contribution of 4.2 million square feet of operating properties and approximately 1.8 million square feet of completed development projects into AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to additional staffing and the opening of new offices both domestically and internationally. The decrease of fund costs from the prior year is due primarily to the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. The impairment losses during the year ended December 31, 2007 were taken on non core assets as a result of leasing activities and changes in the economic environment. The impairment losses during the year ended December 31, 2006 were taken on several non core assets as a result of leasing activities and changes in the economic environment 45 Table of Contents and the holding period of certain assets. Other expenses increased approximately $2.5 million from the prior year due primarily to an increase in dead deal expenditures. For the Years Ended December 31, Other Income and (Expenses) 2007 2006 $ Change % Change Development gains, net of taxes $ 124.3 $ 106.4 $ 17.9 16.8 % Gains from dispositions of real estate interests, net 73.4 73.4 100.0 % Equity in earnings of unconsolidated co investment ventures, net 7.5 23.2 (15.7 ) (67.7 )% Other income 22.3 11.9 10.4 87.4 % Interest expense, including amortization (126.9 ) (165.1 ) (38.2 ) (23.1 )% Total other income and (expenses), net $ 100.6 $ (23.6 ) $ (124.2 ) (526.3 )% Development gains represent gains from the sale or contribution of development projects including land. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we sold seven completed development projects totaling 0.5 million square feet and three land parcels for approximately $115.1 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $28.6 million. In addition, we contributed 15 completed development projects totaling 3.6 million square feet and two land parcels into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS, AMB DFS Fund I, LLC, and AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., five of our unconsolidated co investment ventures. As a result of these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after tax gain of $95.7 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed assets acquired by the third party co investors for cash. During 2006, we sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $13.3 million. In addition, during 2006, we received approximately $0.4 million in connection with the condemnation of a parcel of land resulting in a loss of $1.0 million, $0.8 million of which was the co investment venture partners share. During 2006, we also contributed a total of ten completed development projects into unconsolidated co investment ventures. Four projects totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Japan Fund I, L.P, two projects totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet were contributed into AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, three projects totaling approximately 0.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and one land parcel was contributed into AMB DFS Fund I, LLC. As a result of these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after tax gain of $94.1 million, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party investors for cash. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we contributed 4.2 million square feet in operating properties into AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS, contributed a 0.2 million square foot operating property into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and contributed an operating property aggregating approximately 0.1 million square feet into AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, for a total of approximately $524.9 million. As a result of these contributions, we recognized gains from contribution of real estate interests of approximately $73.4 million, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed properties acquired by the third party investors for cash. The decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated co investment ventures of approximately $15.7 million was primarily due to a decrease in gains from the disposition of real estate by our unconsolidated co investment ventures partially offset by the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. Other income increased approximately $10.4 million from the prior year due primarily to an increase in the gain on currency remeasurement of approximately $3.9 million, an increase in insurance proceeds of approximately $2.9 million related to losses from Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma and an increase in interest income of $2.3 million. The decrease in interest expense, including amortization, was due primarily to decreased borrowings on unsecured credit facilities and the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P.

The increase in preferred stock dividends is due to the then newly issued shares. On April 17, 2007, the operating partnership redeemed all 800,000 of its outstanding 7.95% Series J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units and all 800,000 of its outstanding 7.95% Series K Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units. In addition, on April 17, 2007, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, repurchased all 510,000 of its outstanding 8.00% Series I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units. As a result of the redemptions and repurchase, we recognized a reduction of income available to common stockholders of $2.9 million for the original issuance costs during the year ended December 31, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2006, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, repurchased all 840,000 of its outstanding 8.125% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units, all 220,440 of its outstanding 7.75% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units, all 201,139 of its outstanding 7.95% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units and all 729,582 of its outstanding 5.00% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units.

For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (dollars in millions): For the Years Ended December 31, Revenues 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Rental revenues U.S. industrial: Same store $ 580.0 $ 556.4 $ 23.6 4.2 % 2006 acquisitions 10.4 10.4 100.0 % Development 4.7 2.0 2.7 135.0 % Other industrial 7.6 3.2 4.4 137.5 % Non U.S. industrial 62.5 41.4 21.1 51.0 % Total rental revenues 665.2 603.0 62.2 10.3 % Private capital revenues 46.1 43.9 2.2 5.0 % Total revenues $ 711.3 $ 646.9 $ 64.4 10.0 % U.S. industrial same store revenues increased $23.6 million from the prior year despite the decrease of $66.6 million in same store revenues due to the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., effective October 1, 2006, attributable primarily to improved occupancy and increased rental rates in various markets. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 29 properties, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2006 consisted of 31 properties, aggregating approximately 7.3 million square feet. The increase in rental revenues from development was primarily due to increased occupancy at several of our development projects where development activities have been substantially completed as well as an increase in the number of development projects. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have 47 Table of Contents been contributed to unconsolidated co investment ventures, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. Non U.S. industrial revenues increased approximately $21.1 million from the prior year due primarily to the stabilization of properties in Japan and the continued acquisition of properties in France, Germany, and Mexico. The increase in private capital income was primarily due to increased asset management and acquisition fees from additional assets held in co investment ventures, which were partially offset by a decrease in incentive distributions of approximately $3.9 million. During 2006, we received incentive distributions of $22.5 million, of which $19.8 million was from AMB Partners II, L.P., as compared to incentive distribution of $26.4 million for the sale of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., during 2005.

The 2005 acquisitions consisted of 29 properties, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. The 2006 acquisitions consisted of 31 properties, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to unconsolidated co investment ventures, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. Non U.S. industrial property operating costs increased approximately $5.7 million from the prior year due primarily to the stabilization of properties in Japan and the continued acquisition of properties in France, Germany, and Mexico. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate during the year. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased stock based compensation expense as a result of higher values assigned to option and stock awards and executive departures, additional staffing and expenses for our international expansion, and the acquisition of AMB Blackpine. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our co investment ventures. The 2006 impairment loss was taken on several non core assets as a result of leasing activities and changes in the economic environment and the holding 48 Table of Contents period of certain assets. Other expenses decreased approximately $2.4 million from the prior year due primarily to a decrease in losses associated with our deferred compensation plan and a decrease in certain deal costs. For the Years Ended December 31, Other Income and (Expenses) 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Development profits, net of taxes $ 106.4 $ 54.8 $ 51.6 94.2 % Gains from dispositions of real estate interests, net 19.1 (19.1 ) 100.0 % Equity in earnings of unconsolidated co investment ventures, net 23.2 10.8 12.4 114.8 % Other income 11.9 7.5 4.4 58.7 % Interest expense, including amortization (165.1 ) (147.5 ) 17.6 11.9 % Total other income and (expenses), net $ (23.6 ) $ (55.3 ) $ (31.7 ) (57.3 )% Development profits represent gains from the sale of development projects and land as part of our development for sale program. The increase in development profits was due to increased disposition and contribution volume during 2006. During 2006, we sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $13.3 million. In addition, during 2006, we received approximately $0.4 million in connection with the condemnation of a parcel of land resulting in a loss of $1.0 million, $0.8 million of which was the co investment venture partners share. During 2006, we also contributed a total of ten completed development projects into unconsolidated co investment ventures. Four projects totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Japan Fund I, L.P, two projects totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet were contributed into AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, three projects totaling approximately 0.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and one land parcel was contributed into AMB DFS Fund I, LLC. As a result of these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after tax gain of $94.1 million, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party investors for cash. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated co investment venture, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after tax gain of $1.9 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third party co investor for cash. The 2005 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted primarily from our contribution of $106.9 million (using the exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties to our then newly formed unconsolidated co investment venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. The $12.4 million increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated co investment ventures was primarily due to gains of $17.5 million from the disposition of real estate by our unconsolidated co investment ventures during 2006. During 2005, such gains were $5.5 million. In addition, effective October 1, 2006, the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., resulted in an increase of approximately $5.1 million in equity in earnings of unconsolidated co investment ventures. The increases in 2006 were partially offset by an increase in expenses by our unconsolidated co investment ventures. The increase in other income was primarily due to increased bank interest income and an increase in property management income due to the expansion of our property management activities. The increase in interest expense, including amortization, was due primarily to increased borrowings on unsecured credit facilities and other debt. For the Years Ended December 31, Discontinued Operations 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Income attributable to discontinued operations, net of minority interests $ 18.2 $ 20.6 $ (2.4 ) (11.7 )% Development gains and gains from dispositions of real estate, net of taxes and minority interests 42.6 113.6 (71.0 ) (62.5 )% Total discontinued operations $ 60.8 $ 134.2 $ (73.4 ) (54.7 )% 49 Table of Contents During 2006, we divested ourselves of 17 industrial properties, aggregating approximately 3.5 million square feet, for an aggregate price of approximately $175.3 million, with a resulting net gain of approximately $42.6 million. During 2005, we divested ourselves of 18 industrial properties and one retail center, aggregating approximately 9.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $926.6 million, with a resulting net gain of $113.6 million. Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., for $618.5 million. The multi investor fund owned approximately 5.8 million square feet. We received cash and a distribution of an on tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund.

In August 2006, we issued 2,000,000 shares of 6.85% Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. The increase in preferred stock dividends is due to the newly issued shares. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2006, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, repurchased all 840,000 of its outstanding 8.125% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units, all 220,440 of its outstanding 7.75% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units, all 201,139 of its outstanding 7.95% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units and all 729,582 of its outstanding 5.00% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units. As a result, we recognized a decrease in income available to common stockholders of $1.1 million for the original issuance costs, net of discount on repurchase. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Balance Sheet Strategy. In general, we use unsecured lines of credit, unsecured notes, preferred stock and common equity (issued by us and or the operating partnership and its subsidiaries) to capitalize our wholly owned assets. Over time, we plan to retire non recourse, secured debt encumbering our wholly owned assets and replace that debt with unsecured notes where practicable. In managing the co investment ventures, in general, we use non recourse, secured debt to capitalize our co investment ventures. We currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for acquisitions, development, expansion and renovation of properties will include: retained earnings and cash flow from operations; private capital from co investment partners; net proceeds from contributions of properties and completed development projects to our co investment ventures; net proceeds from the sales of development projects, value added conversion projects and land to third parties; net proceeds from divestitures of properties; proceeds from equity (common and preferred) or debt securities offerings; borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities; other forms of secured or unsecured financing; and proceeds from limited partnership unit offerings (including issuances of limited partnership units by our subsidiaries). 50 Table of Contents We currently expect that our principal funding requirements will include: working capital; development, expansion and renovation of properties; acquisitions; debt service; and dividends and distributions on outstanding common and preferred stock and limited partnership units. Cash flows. As of December 31, 2007, cash provided by operating activities was $240.5 million as compared to $335.9 million for the same period in 2006. This change is primarily due to changes in our assets and liabilities offset by gains from sales and contributions of real estate interests, net, and an increase in operating distributions received by unconsolidated co investment ventures. Cash used in investing activities was $632.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to cash used for investing activities of $880.6 million for the same period in 2006. This change is primarily due to a decrease in cash used for property acquisitions, offset by additions to interests in unconsolidated co investment ventures and additions to land and buildings. Cash provided by financing activities was $420.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to cash provided by financing activities of $483.6 million for the same period in 2006. This change is due primarily to an increase in payments on other debt, credit facilities, senior debt, the cost of repurchase of preferred units, and a decrease in proceeds from issuances of senior debt, and contributions from co investment partners. This activity was partially offset by the issuance of common stock and increased borrowings on secured debt and credit facilities. We believe our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow from operations, borrowings available under our unsecured credit facilities and our ability to access private and public debt and equity capital, are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Resources Development sales activity to third parties during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was as follows (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Number of completed development projects 7 6 5 Number of land parcels 3 5 5 Square feet 498,017 1,323,748 921,740 Gross sales price $ 130,419 $ 86,629 $ 155,206 Development gains, net of taxes $ 28,575 $ 12,440 $ 52,925 51 Table of Contents Development contribution activity during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was as follows (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Number of projects contributed to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. 4 3 Square feet 1,006,164 554,279 Number of projects contributed to AMB SGP Mexico, LLC 2 2 1 Square feet 329,114 843,439 391,457 Number of land parcels contributed to AMB DFS Fund I, LLC 2 1 Square feet Number of projects contributed to AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS 8 Square feet 1,838,011 Number of projects contributed to AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. 1 4 Square feet 469,627 2,644,258 Total number of contributed development assets 17 10 1 Total square feet 3,642,916 4,041,976 391,457 Development gains, net of taxes $ 95,713 $ 93,949 $ 1,886 Property Divestitures. During 2007, we divested ourselves of three industrial properties, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $120.0 million, with a resulting net gain of approximately $2.0 million and a gain of approximately $60.0 million associated with the sale of two value added conversion projects. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized development profits of approximately $95.7 million, as a result of the contribution of 15 completed development projects and approximately 82 acres of land to AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS, AMB SGP Mexico, LLC, AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., AMB DFS Fund I, LLC, and AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. In addition, we recognized development profits of approximately $28.6 million as a result of the sale of seven development projects and 76 acres of land during the year ended December 31, 2007. Gains from Sale or Contribution of Real Estate Interests.

We recognized a gain of $73.4 million on the contributions, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed properties acquired by the third party investors for cash. During 2006, there were no comparable events. Properties Held for Contribution. As of December 31, 2007, we held for contribution to co investment ventures 17 properties with an aggregate net book value of $488.3 million, which, when contributed, will reduce our average ownership interest in these projects from approximately 90% currently to an expected range of 15 20%. Properties Held for Divestiture. As of December 31, 2007, we held for divestiture five properties with an aggregate net book value of $40.5 million. These properties either are not in our core markets or do not meet our current investment objectives, or are included as part of our development for sale or value added conversion programs. The divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. Properties held for divestiture are stated at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less costs to sell. Co investment Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment ventures with institutional investors. These co investment ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund certain acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. We consolidate these co investment ventures for financial reporting purposes when they are 52 Table of Contents not variable interest entities and when we are the sole managing general partner and control all major operating decisions. However, in certain cases, our co investment ventures are unconsolidated because we do not control all major operating decisions and the general partners do not have significant rights under the EITF Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights. Third party equity interests in the co investment ventures are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2007, we owned approximately 83.4 million square feet of our properties (56.5% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated co investment ventures. We may make additional investments through these co investment ventures or new co investment ventures in the future and presently plan to do so.

We, in turn, used those proceeds to redeem all 3,995,800 of our 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for $100.2 million, including all accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, to the redemption date. In December 2005, our board of directors approved a two year common stock repurchase program for the discretionary repurchase of up to $200.0 million of our common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate price of $53.4 million at a weighted average price of $49.87 per share. We have the authorization to repurchase up to an additional $146.6 million of our common stock under this program. On December 18, 2007, we extended this program through December 31, 2009. Debt. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, we presently intend over the long term to operate with an our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio of approximately 45% or less. As of December 31, 2007, our share of total debt to our share of total market capitalization ratio was 34.4%. (See footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratios table below for our definitions of our share of total market capitalization, market equity and our share of total debt.) However, we typically finance our co investment ventures with secured debt at a loan to value ratio of 50 65% per our co investment venture agreements. Additionally, we currently intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these policies, however, our organizational 56 Table of Contents documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our management could alter or eliminate these policies without stockholder approval or circumstances could arise that could render us unable to comply with these policies. As of December 31, 2007, the aggregate principal amount of our secured debt was $1.5 billion, excluding unamortized debt premiums of $4.2 million. Of the $1.5 billion of secured debt, $1.1 billion is secured by properties in our co investment ventures. The secured debt is generally non recourse and bears interest at rates varying from 1.1% to 9.4% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 5.6%) and final maturity dates ranging from January 2008 to February 2024. As of December 31, 2007, $1.0 billion of the secured debt obligations bear interest at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%, while the remaining $426.0 million bear interest at variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 3.8%). On February 14, 2007, seven subsidiaries of AMB SGP, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, which is one of our subsidiaries, entered into a loan agreement for a $305 million secured financing. On the same day, pursuant to the loan agreement, the same seven subsidiaries delivered four promissory notes to the two lenders, each of which matures on March 5, 2012. One note has a principal of $160 million and an interest rate that is fixed at 5.29%. The second is a $40 million note with an interest rate of 81 basis points above the one month LIBOR rate. The third note has a principal of $84 million and a fixed interest rate of 5.90%. The fourth note has a principal of $21 million and bears interest at a rate of 135 basis points above the one month LIBOR rate. As of December 31, 2007, the operating partnership had outstanding an aggregate of $1.0 billion in unsecured senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 6.1% and had an average term of 4.2 years. The unsecured senior debt securities are subject to various covenants. The covenants contain affirmative covenants, including compliance with financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. We guarantee the operating partnerships obligations with respect to its senior debt securities. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then our cash flow may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Credit Facilities. The operating partnership has a $550.0 million (includes Euros, Yen, British pounds sterling or U.S. dollar denominated borrowings) unsecured revolving credit facility, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% at December 31, 2007. This facility matures on June 1, 2010. We are a guarantor of the operating partnerships obligations under the credit facility. The line carries a one year extension option and can be increased to up to $700.0 million upon certain conditions. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the operating partnerships long term debt rating, which was 42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2007, with an annual facility fee of 15 basis points. The four year credit facility includes a multi currency component, under which up to $550.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Euros, Yen or British pounds sterling. The operating partnership uses the credit facility principally for acquisitions, funding development activity and general working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2007, the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2007, was $259.4 million and the remaining amount available was $273.8 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $16.8 million. AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating partnership, has a Yen denominated unsecured revolving credit facility with an initial borrowing limit of 55.0 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2007, equaled approximately $492.4 million U.S. dollars and bore a weighted average interest rate of 1.2%. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K. under the credit facility, as well as the obligations of any other entity in which the operating partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the credit agreement. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and for other real estate purposes in Japan, China and South Korea. Generally, borrowers under the credit 57 Table of Contents facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the credit facility with certain real estate assets or equity in entities holding such real estate assets. The credit facility matures in June 2010 and has a one year extension option. The extension option is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding commitments under the facility at that time. The rate on the borrowings is generally TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt and was 42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2007. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, payable in quarterly amounts, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships long term debt, and was 15 basis points of the outstanding commitments under the facility as of December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2007, the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2007, was $399.5 million in U.S. dollars. The credit agreement contains affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. On July 16, 2007, certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries and the operating partnership, each acting as a borrower, with us and the operating partnership as guarantors, entered into a fifth amended and restated revolving credit agreement for a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility that replaced the existing $250 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The fifth amended and restated credit facility amends the fourth amended and restated credit facility to, among other things, increase the facility amount to $500 million with an option to further increase the facility to $750 million, to extend the maturity date to July 2011 and to allow for future borrowing in Indian rupees. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations for such subsidiaries and other entities controlled by the operating partnership that are selected by the operating partnership from time to time to be borrowers under and pursuant to our credit facility. Generally, borrowers under the credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the credit facility. The credit facility includes a multi currency component under which up to $500.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Singapore dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds sterling, and Euros with the ability to add Indian rupees. The line, which matures in July 2011 and carries a one year extension option, can be increased to up to $750.0 million upon certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding commitments. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships senior unsecured long term debt, which was 60 basis points as of December 31, 2007, with an annual facility fee based on the credit rating of the operating partnerships senior unsecured long term debt. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and general working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2007, the outstanding balance on this credit facility was approximately $217.2 million and bore a weighted average interest rate of 5.3%. The credit agreement contains affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios by the operating partnership, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. On December 8, 2006, we executed a 228.0 million Euros facility agreement (approximately $303.3 million in U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at June 12, 2007, the date the facility was assumed by AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS, as discussed below), which provides that certain of our affiliates may borrow either acquisition loans, up to a 100.0 million Euros sub limit (approximately $133.0 million in U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at June 12, 2007), or secured term loans, in connection with properties located in France, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Italy or Spain. On March 21, 2007, we increased the facility amount limit from 228.0 million Euros to 328.0 million Euros. Drawings under the term facility bear interest at a rate of 65 basis points over EURIBOR and may occur until, and mature on, April 30, 2014. Drawings under the acquisition loan facility bear interest at a rate of 75 basis points over EURIBOR and are repayable within six months of the date of advance, unless extended. We initially guaranteed the acquisition loan facility and were the carve out indemnitor in respect of the term loans. In accordance with the terms of the facility agreement, on June 12, 2007, AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS, assumed, and the operating partnership was released from, all of the operating partnerships obligations and liabilities under the facility agreement. On June 12, 2007, there were 267.0 million Euros (approximately $355.2 million in U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at June 12, 2007) of term loans and no acquisition loans outstanding under the facility agreement. 58 Table of Contents The tables below summarize our debt maturities and capitalization and reconcile our share of total debt to total consolidated debt as of December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands): Our Co investment Unsecured Secured Venture Senior Credit Other Total Debt(1) Debt(1) Debt Facilities(2) Debt Debt 2008 $ 199,970 $ 98,989 $ 175,000 $ $ 13,408 $ 487,367 2009 25,799 122,671 100,000 873 249,343 2010 65,905 102,661 250,000 658,928 941 1,078,435 2011 115 189,420 75,000 217,177 1,014 482,726 2012 3,753 459,111 61,093 523,957 2013 3,053 46,195 175,000 65,920 290,168 2014 3,216 4,102 616 7,934 2015 3,387 18,806 112,491 664 135,348 2016 3,567 54,795 58,362 Thereafter 42,267 19,091 125,000 186,358 Subtotal $ 351,032 $ 1,115,841 $ 1,012,491 $ 876,105 $ 144,529 $ 3,499,998 Unamortized premiums/(discount) 1,027 3,187 (9,368 ) (5,154 ) Total consolidated debt $ 352,059 $ 1,119,028 $ 1,003,123 $ 876,105 $ 144,529 $ 3,494,844 AMBs share of unconsolidated co investment venture debt(3) 556,710 36,368 593,078 Total debt(4) $ 352,059 $ 1,675,738 $ 1,003,123 $ 876,105 $ 180,897 $ 4,087,922 Co investment venture partners share of consolidated debt(4) (715,409 ) (100,000 ) (815,409 ) Our share of total debt(4) $ 352,059 $ 960,329 $ 1,003,123 $ 876,105 $ 80,897 $ 3,272,513 Weighted average interest rate 4.0 % 6.1 % 6.1 % 3.4 % 6.0 % 5.2 % Weighted average maturity (years) 2.4 4.1 4.2 2.7 4.6 3.6 (1) Our secured debt and co investment venture debt include debt related to European and Asian assets in the amount of $62.0 million and $192.1 million, respectively, translated to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2007.

(3) The weighted average interest and average maturity for the unconsolidated co investment venture debt were 4.8% and 5.4 years, respectively. (4) Our share of total debt represents the pro rata portion of the total debt based on our percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated or unconsolidated co investment ventures holding the debt. We believe that our share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze our leverage and to compare our leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of our debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their co investment ventures. Our share of total debt is not intended to reflect our actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the co investment ventures. The above table reconciles our share of total debt to total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure. 59 Table of Contents Market Equity as of December 31, 2007 Shares/Units Market Market Security Outstanding Price Value Common stock 99,210,508 $ 57.56 $ 5,710,557 Common limited partnership units(1) 3,992,607 57.56 229,814 Total 103,203,115 $ 5,940,371 (1) Includes class B common limited partnership units issued by AMB Property II, L.P.

As of December 31, 2007, we had $30.2 million in restricted cash. Our board of directors declared a regular cash dividend for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 of $0.50 per share of common stock, and the operating partnership announced its intention to pay a regular cash distribution for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 of $0.50 per common unit. The dividends and distributions were payable on January 7, 2008 to stockholders and unitholders of record on December 21, 2007.

The anticipated size of our distributions, using only cash from operations, will not allow us to pay all of our debt as it comes due. Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. 61 Table of Contents Capital Commitments Development starts, generally defined as projects where we have obtained building permits and have begun physical construction, during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 The Americas: Number of new development projects 26 16 Number of value added conversion projects(1) 1 2 Square feet 7,427,914 5,428,642 Estimated total investment(2) $ 559,276 $ 356,843 Europe: Number of new development projects 6 4 Square feet 1,687,601 711,956 Estimated total investment(2) $ 220,200 $ 72,104 Asia: Number of new development projects 6 8 Square feet 3,060,335 4,283,572 Estimated total investment(2) $ 305,872 $ 485,344 Total: Number of new development projects 38 28 Number of value added conversion projects 1 2 Square feet 12,175,850 10,424,170 Estimated total investment(2) $ 1,085,348 $ 914,291 Land acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 The Americas: Acres 1,231 774 Estimated build out potential (square feet) 21,083,750 11,974,941 Investment(3) $ 221,645 $ 199,785 Europe: Acres 182 Estimated build out potential (square feet) 3,328,267 Investment(3) $ 38,544 Asia: Acres 28 61 Estimated build out potential (square feet) 997,537 3,506,843 Investment(3) $ 20,977 $ 93,429 Total: Acres 1,441 835 Estimated build out potential (square feet) 25,409,554 15,481,784 Investment(3) $ 281,166 $ 293,214 62 Table of Contents (1) Value added conversion projects represent the repurposing of industrial properties to a higher and better use, including office, residential, retail, research and development or manufacturing.

Acquisition activity during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Number of properties acquired by AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. 28 21 Square feet 6,213,093 6,598,560 Expected investment $ 527,264 $ 540,021 Number of properties acquired by AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS 7 Square Feet 2,101,393 Expected investment $ 201,794 $ Number of properties acquired by AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. 8 Square feet 1,107,261 Expected investment $ 180,901 $ Number of properties acquired by AMB SGP Mexico, LLC 3 Square Feet 1,739,976 Expected investment $ 69,688 $ Number of properties acquired by AMB Partners II, L.P. 3 Square Feet 816,049 Expected investment $ $ 73,936 Number of properties acquired by AMB Property, L.P. 7 13 Square feet 701,629 2,393,627 Expected investment $ 62,241 $ 220,232 Total number of properties acquired 53 37 Total square feet 11,863,352 9,808,236 Total acquisition cost $ 1,022,547 $ 814,128 Total acquisition capital $ 19,341 $ 20,061 Total expected investment $ 1,041,888 $ 834,189 Development Pipeline. As of December 31, 2007, we had 56 industrial projects in our development pipeline, which are expected to total approximately 17.8 million square feet and have an aggregate estimated investment of $1.7 billion upon completion. We have an additional 12 development projects available for sale or contribution totaling approximately 4.2 million square feet, with an aggregate estimated investment of $304.7 million. As of December 31, 2007, we and our co investment venture partners have funded an aggregate of $1.2 billion and needed to fund an estimated additional $500 million in order to complete our development pipeline. The development pipeline, at December 31, 2007, included projects expected to be completed through the fourth quarter of 2009. In addition to our committed development pipeline, we hold a total of 2,535 acres of land for future development or 63 Table of Contents sale, approximately 91% of which is located in the Americas. We currently estimate that these 2,535 acres of land could support approximately 44.0 million square feet of future development. Lease Commitments. We have entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily on tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms from one to 55 years. These buildings and improvements subject to ground leases are amortized ratably over the lesser of the terms of the related leases or 40 years. Future minimum rental payments required under non cancelable operating leases in effect as of December 31, 2007 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2008 $ 23,208 2009 22,632 2010 21,932 2011 21,577 2012 20,501 Thereafter 284,158 Total $ 394,008 Co investment Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co investment ventures with institutional investors. These co investment ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. As of December 31, 2007, we had investments in co investment ventures with a gross book value of $2.5 billion, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, and net equity investments in five significant unconsolidated co investment ventures of $274.9 million and a gross book value of $4.4 billion. As of December 31, 2007, we may make additional capital contributions to current and planned co investment ventures of up to $151.0 million (using the exchange rates at December 31, 2007) pursuant to the terms of the co investment venture agreements. From time to time, we may raise additional equity commitments for AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open ended unconsolidated co investment venture formed in 2004 with institutional investors, which invests through a private real estate investment partnership, and for AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS, an open ended unconsolidated co investment venture formed in 2007 with institutional investors. This would increase our obligation to make additional capital commitments to these funds. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and the management regulations of AMB Europe Fund I, FCP FIS, we are obligated to contribute 20% of the total equity commitments to each fund until such time when our total equity commitment is greater than $150.0 million or 150.0 million Euros, respectively, at which time, our obligation is reduced to 10% of the total equity commitments. We expect to fund these contributions with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances or net proceeds from property divestitures, which could adversely affect our cash flow. Captive Insurance Company. In December 2001, we formed a wholly owned captive insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd. (Arcata), which provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the deductible under our third party policies. The captive insurance company is one element of our overall risk management program. We capitalized Arcata in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata established annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss experience of our properties. Annually, we engage an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims, related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata may be adjusted based on this estimate. Like premiums paid to third party insurance companies, premiums paid to Arcata may be reimbursed by customers pursuant to specific lease terms. Through this structure, we think that we have more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market. Potential Contingent and Unknown Liabilities. Contingent and unknown liabilities may include the following: liabilities for environmental conditions; claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with our acquisition transactions that had not been asserted prior to our formation or acquisition transactions; 64 Table of Contents accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; and tax liabilities. Overview of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our debt, interest and lease payments due by period as of December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands): Less than 1 3 3 5 More than Contractual Obligations 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Total Debt $ 487,367 $ 1,327,778 $ 1,006,683 $ 678,170 $ 3,499,998 Debt interest payments 22,582 62,781 55,806 72,238 213,407 Operating lease commitments 23,208 44,564 42,078 284,158 394,008 Construction commitments 77,194 77,194 Total $ 610,351 $ 1,435,123 $ 1,104,567 $ 1,034,566 $ 4,184,607 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Standby Letters of Credit. As of December 31, 2007, we had provided approximately $24.2 million in letters of credit, of which $16.8 million were provided under the operating partnerships $550.0 million unsecured credit facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other commitments. Guarantees and Contribution Obligations. Excluding parent guarantees associated with unsecured debt or contribution obligations as discussed in Notes 5 and 9, we had outstanding guarantees and contribution obligations in the aggregate amount of $405.2 million as described below. As of December 31, 2007, we had outstanding guarantees in the amount of $95.9 million in connection with certain acquisitions. As of December 31, 2007, we also guaranteed $41.2 million and $107.9 million on outstanding loans on five of our consolidated co investment ventures and two of our unconsolidated co investment ventures, respectively. Also, we have entered into contribution agreements with certain of our unconsolidated co investment venture funds. These contribution agreements require us to make additional capital contributions to the applicable co investment venture fund upon certain defaults by the co investment venture of certain of its debt obligations to the lenders. Such additional capital contributions will cover all or part of the applicable co investment ventures debt obligation and may be greater than our share of the co investment ventures debt obligation or the value of our share of any property securing such debt. Our contribution obligations under these agreements will be reduced by the amounts recovered by the lender and the fair market value of the property, if any, used to secure the debt and obtained by the lender upon default. Our potential obligations under these contribution agreements are $160.2 million as of December 31, 2007. Performance and Surety Bonds. As of December 31, 2007, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $15.2 million. These bonds were issued in connection with certain of our development projects and were posted to guarantee certain tax obligations and the construction of certain real property improvements and infrastructure. Performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the taxes due or the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. Promoted Interests and Other Contractual Obligations. Upon the achievement of certain return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, we may be obligated to make payments to certain of our co investment venture partners pursuant to the terms and provisions of their contractual agreements with us. From time to time in the normal course of our business, we enter into various contracts with third parties that may obligate us to make payments, pay promotes, or perform other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. 65 Table of Contents SUPPLEMENTAL EARNINGS MEASURES Funds From Operations (FFO) and Funds From Operations Per Share and Unit (FFOPS). We believe that net income, as defined by U.S. GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider funds from operations, or FFO, and FFO per share and unit, or FFOPS, to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. We define FFOPS as FFO per fully diluted weighted average share of our common stock and operating partnership units. We calculate FFO as net income, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, less gains (or losses) from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estate related depreciation, and adjustments to derive our pro rata share of FFO of consolidated and unconsolidated co investment ventures. We do not adjust FFO to eliminate the effects of non recurring charges. We include the gains from development, including those from value added conversion projects, before depreciation recapture, as a component of FFO. We believe that value added conversion dispositions are in substance land sales and as such should be included in FFO, consistent with the real estate investment trust industrys long standing practice to include gains on the sale of land in FFO. However, our interpretation of FFO or FFOPS may not be consistent with the views of others in the real estate investment trust industry, who may consider it to be a divergence from the NAREIT definition, and may not be comparable to FFO or FFOPS reported by other real estate investment trusts that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. In connection with the formation of a co investment venture, we may warehouse assets that are acquired with the intent to contribute these assets to the newly formed venture. Some of the properties held for contribution may, under certain circumstances, be required to be depreciated under U.S. GAAP. If this circumstance arises, we intend to include in our calculation of FFO gains or losses related to the contribution of previously depreciated real estate to co investment ventures. Although such a change, if instituted, will be a departure from the current NAREIT definition, we believe such a calculation of FFO will better reflect the value created as a result of the contributions. To date, we have not included gains or losses from the contribution of previously depreciated warehoused assets in FFO. AMB believes that FFO and FFOPS are meaningful supplemental measures of its operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Thus, FFO and FFOPS are supplemental measures of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that exclude historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by U.S. GAAP. We believe that the use of FFO and FFOPS, combined with the required U.S. GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO and FFOPS to be useful measures for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO and FFOPS can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO and FFOPS are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, these measures do not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO and FFOPS also do not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets nor are FFO or FFOPS necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. 66 Table of Contents The following table reflects the calculation of FFO reconciled from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts): 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Net income available to common stockholders(1) $ 295,524 $ 209,420 $ 250,419 $ 118,340 $ 116,716 Gains from sale or contribution of real estate, net of minority interests(2) (85,544 ) (42,635 ) (132,652 ) (47,224 ) (50,325 ) Depreciation and amortization: Total depreciation and amortization 161,925 174,721 159,469 134,574 109,828 Discontinued operations depreciation 1,801 5,256 20,835 32,776 32,509 Non real estate depreciation (5,623 ) (4,546 ) (3,388 ) (871 ) (720 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from consolidated co investment ventures: Co investment venture partners minority interests (Net income) 27,748 37,190 35,338 29,027 21,041 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Net income) 5,121 2,367 3,045 1,957 1,806 Limited partnership unitholders minority interests (Development gains) 7,148 4,948 2,262 435 344 Discontinued operations minority interests (Net income) 370 1,254 10,198 14,724 16,760 FFO attributable to minority interests (62,902 ) (82,861 ) (100,275 ) (80,192 ) (65,603 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from unconsolidated co investment ventures: Our share of net income (7,467 ) (23,240 ) (10,770 ) (3,781 ) (5,445 ) Our share of FFO 27,391 16,038 14,441 7,549 9,755 Our share of development gains, net of taxes 5,441 Funds from operations $ 365,492 $ 297,912 $ 254,363 $ 207,314 $ 186,666 Basic FFO per common share and unit $ 3.60 $ 3.24 $ 2.87 $ 2.39 $ 2.17 Diluted FFO per common share and unit $ 3.51 $ 3.12 $ 2.75 $ 2.30 $ 2.13 Weighted average common shares and units: Basic 101,550,001 92,047,678 88,684,262 86,885,250 85,859,899 Diluted 104,168,707 95,444,072 92,508,725 90,120,250 87,616,365 (1) Includes gains from undepreciated land sales of $9.2 million, $5.6 million, $25.0 million, $3.7 million and $1.2 million for 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003 respectively. (2) The information for 2007 includes accumulated depreciation re capture of approximately $10.1 million associated with the sale of two value added conversion projects. The information for 2005 includes accumulated depreciation re capture of approximately $1.1 million associated with the sale of one value added conversion project. 67 Table of Contents SS NOI. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider same store net operating income, or SS NOI, and cash basis SS NOI to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. Properties that are considered part of the same store pool include all properties that were owned, or owned and managed, as the case may be, as of the end of both the current and prior year reporting periods and exclude development properties for both the current and prior reporting periods. The same store pool is set annually and excludes properties purchased and developments stabilized after December 31, 2005 (generally defined as properties that are 90% leased or properties that have been substantially complete for at least 12 months). In deriving SS NOI, we define net operating income as rental revenues, including reimbursements, less property operating expenses, both of which are calculated in accordance with GAAP. Property operating expenses exclude depreciation, amortization, general and administrative expenses and interest expense. In calculating cash basis SS NOI, we exclude straight line rents and amortization of lease intangibles from the calculation of SS NOI. We consider cash basis SS NOI to be an appropriate and useful supplemental performance measure because it reflects the operating performance of our real estate portfolio excluding effects of non cash adjustments and provides a better measure of actual cash basis rental growth for a year over year comparison. In addition, we believe that SS NOI and cash basis SS NOI help the investing public compare our operating performance with that of other companies. While SS NOI and cash basis SS NOI are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, they do not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. SS NOI and cash basis SS NOI also do not reflect general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization costs, capital expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development and construction activities that could materially impact our results from operations. Further, our computation of SS NOI and cash basis SS NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating these measures. The following table reconciles SS NOI and cash basis SS NOI from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands): 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Net income $ 314,260 $ 224,072 $ 257,807 $ 125,471 $ 129,128 Private capital revenues (31,707 ) (46,102 ) (43,942 ) (12,895 ) (13,337 ) Depreciation and amortization 161,925 174,721 159,469 134,574 109,828 General and administrative 129,510 104,262 71,564 58,843 46,417 Fund costs 1,076 2,091 1,482 1,741 825 Impairment losses 1,157 6,312 5,251 Other expenses 5,112 2,620 5,038 892 475 Total other income and expenses (100,577 ) 23,609 55,339 120,161 95,918 Total minority interests share of income 54,845 61,632 73,348 52,103 55,896 Total discontinued operations (71,702 ) (60,852 ) (134,180 ) (71,344 ) (80,344 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (193 ) Net Operating Income (NOI) 463,899 492,172 445,925 409,546 350,057 Less non same store NOI (61,639 ) (104,147 ) (17,293 ) (22,725 ) (17,334 ) Less non cash adjustments(1) (2,861 ) (9,502 ) (15,237 ) (13,085 ) (6,111 ) Cash basis same store NOI $ 399,399 $ 378,523 $ 413,395 $ 373,736 $ 326,612 (1) Non cash adjustments include straight line rents and amortization of lease intangibles for the same store pool only. 68 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices, interest rates and international exchange rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimize the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings and our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2007, we had one outstanding interest rate swap with a notional amount of $25.0 million (in U.S. dollars). See Financial Instruments below. The table below summarizes the maturities and interest rates associated with our fixed and variable rate debt outstanding before net unamortized debt discounts of $5.2 million as of December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands): 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Fixed rate debt(1) $ 255,780 $ 185,957 $ 418,873 $ 248,484 $ 449,570 $ 576,675 $ 2,135,339 Average interest rate 6.9 % 5.0 % 6.5 % 6.7 % 5.9 % 10.8 % 7.5 % Variable rate debt(2) $ 231,587 $ 63,386 $ 659,562 $ 234,242 $ 74,387 $ 101,495 $ 1,364,659 Average interest rate 2.1 % 5.9 % 3.4 % 3.6 % 5.6 % 9.8 % 3.9 % Interest Payments $ 22,582 $ 12,913 $ 49,868 $ 25,131 $ 30,675 $ 72,238 $ 213,407 (1) Represents 61.0% of all outstanding debt at December 31, 2007. (2) Represents 39.0% of all outstanding debt at December 31, 2007. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased or decreased by 10%, then the increase or decrease in interest cost on the variable rate debt would be $5.0 million (net of the swap) annually. As of December 31, 2007, the book value and the estimated fair value of our total consolidated debt (both secured and unsecured) was $3.5 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively, based on our estimate of current market interest rates. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, variable rate debt comprised 39.0% and 37.1%, respectively, of all our outstanding debt. Variable rate debt was $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. The increase is primarily due to higher outstanding balances on our credit facilities. This increase in our outstanding variable rate debt increases our risk associated with unfavorable interest rate fluctuations. Financial Instruments. We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income or income. For revenues or expenses denominated in non functional currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instrument in effect at December 31, 2007 was one interest rate swap hedging cash flows of variable rate borrowings based on U.S. Libor (USD). The following table summarizes our financial instruments as of December 31, 2007 (in thousands): Maturity Dates June 9, Notional Related Derivatives (In thousands) 2010 Amount Fair Value Notional Amount (U.S. dollars) $ 25,000 $ 25,000 Receive Floating(%) US LIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 5.17 % Fair Market Value $ (786 ) $ (786 ) Total $ 25,000 $ (786 ) International Operations. Our exposure to market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries operating in the United States and Mexico. The functional currency for our subsidiaries operating outside the United States, other than Mexico, is generally the local currency 69 Table of Contents of the country in which the entity or property is located, mitigating the effect of foreign exchange gains and losses. Our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. We translate income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. The gains resulting from the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders equity and totaled $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Our international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. In these instances, non monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period. We also record gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated. For the year ended December 31, 2007, unrealized and realized gains from remeasurement and translation included in our results of operations were $3.9 million.
