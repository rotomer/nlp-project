ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC. The Corporation is one of the largest diversified financial services companies in the United States, operating businesses engaged in regional community banking, wholesale banking, wealth management, asset management and global fund processing services. The Corporation provides certain products and services nationally and others in PNCs primary geographic markets in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Ohio and Kentucky. The Corporation also provides certain banking, asset management and global fund processing services internationally. PNCs strategies to enhance shareholder value include expanding its deposit driven banking franchise through internal growth and, as opportunities arise, through targeted acquisitions. In addition, the Corporation plans to leverage its customer base and leading technology to grow the asset management and processing businesses in an efficient and effective manner. Efforts in recent years to reduce risk, grow deposits and diversify the Corporations revenue mix have enabled PNC to improve liquidity and build a strong capital position. OVERVIEW OF KEY FACTORS AFFECTING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE The financial performance of financial services companies such as PNC is affected by a variety of key factors. Given the nature of its business, PNCs performance is substantially dependent on general economic factors such as overall economic activity, loan demand, interest rates and the shape of the yield curve, and the performance of the equity and debt markets. PNC, like other financial services companies, does not have the ability to exercise control over these economic factors, although it can manage its business to take advantage of the opportunities offered and to mitigate the risks presented by changes in these factors. On the other hand, PNCs performance also relies on its ability to develop and execute effective business plans and to maintain an effective risk management program. During 2003, PNC was able to achieve success in a number of critical areas, impacting PNCs results in 2003 and contributing to PNCs ability to continue to grow its businesses and to respond to the challenges it expects to face in 2004 and thereafter. One significant example of these successes was the improvement in client acquisition and retention across most of PNCs businesses. Further, the success of PNCs efforts to enhance cross selling to its client base is evidenced by the year over year increase in fee based income. On the expense side, PNCs efficiency initiative identified and realized almost $150 million in savings on a run rate basis into 2004, and the Corporation is building on this initiative as it moves into 2004. Managing and deploying capital in a disciplined fashion was another critical factor that affected PNCs financial performance in 2003 and should help build its foundation for the future. PNC deployed excess economic capital to strengthen its banking businesses by acquiring United National; it returned additional excess capital to its shareholders by increasing the quarterly dividend by four percent and repurchasing approximately 11.9 million of its shares. Economic factors, however, had a negative impact on PNCs overall growth, with a continuation of historically low interest rates and weak loan demand both having a major effect on performance in 2003. These economic factors are the areas that PNCs management sees as presenting the greatest challenges for 2004. Indeed, the key factor affecting PNCs results of operations for 2004 that is neither readily predictable nor responsive to actions substantially within PNCs control is likely to be the timing and extent of changes in market interest rates. Also, loan demand should respond positively to improving economic conditions, but the timing and extent of increased loan demand is not now predictable, depending in substantial part on the nature of the continuing economic recovery. PNC is thus not assuming that its 2004 results will reflect significant improvement in this area. As part of its enhanced risk management framework, PNC has avoided the temptation to respond to the pressures presented by these economic factors by increasing the Corporations risk profile in an effort to bolster short term earnings. In addition to the need to manage its business effectively to deal with these and other critical economic factors, PNCs success in 2004 will depend on its success in a number of other key areas, including: Maintaining stable asset quality; Leveraging the Corporations customer base to deepen relationships and drive revenue growth; Leveraging PNCs operating and technology platform to improve efficiency; Managing the revenue/expense relationship; and Building best of class corporate governance and risk management systems. SUMMARY FINANCIAL RESULTS Consolidated net income for 2003 was $1.001 billion or $3.55 per diluted share compared with $1.184 billion or $4.15 per diluted share for 2002. Results for 2003 reflected the impact of expenses totaling $87 million after taxes, or $.31 per diluted share, in connection with PNCs previously announced agreement with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and related legal and consulting costs. Net income for 2003 also included the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle that negatively impacted earnings by $28 million, or $.10 per diluted share. Results for 2002 included a loss from discontinued operations of $16 million, or $.05 per diluted share. 15 Table of Contents Return on average common shareholders equity was 15.06% for 2003 and 18.83% for 2002. Return on average assets was 1.49% for 2003 and 1.78% for 2002. The Corporations performance in 2003 reflected significant progress in a number of key areas: Regional Community Banking grew home equity loans 17% on average during 2003 compared with the prior year while noninterest bearing demand deposits grew 10% on average. Earnings from BlackRock increased 17% in 2003 compared with 2002. Consolidated assets under management grew to $354 billion at December 31, 2003, an increase of $41 billion, or 13%, compared with the balance at December 31, 2002. PFPC provided accounting/administration services for $667 billion of investment assets at December 31, 2003 compared with $510 billion at December 31, 2002, an increase of $157 billion or 31%. Asset quality improved significantly, including a $90 million or 22% decline in nonperforming assets at December 31, 2003 compared with the balance at December 31, 2002. The efficiency initiatives in 2003 resulted in expense savings of approximately $100 million for the year and nearly $150 million on a run rate basis into 2004. In September 2003, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency lifted their formal written agreements with the Corporation and PNC Bank, N.A., respectively. On January 1, 2004, the Corporation successfully completed its previously announced acquisition of United National Bancorp. BALANCE SHEET HIGHLIGHTS Total assets were $68.2 billion at December 31, 2003 compared with $66.4 billion at December 31, 2002. Total assets at December 31, 2003 included $2.6 billion due to PNCs adoption of FIN 46R. Average interest earning assets were $55.2 billion in 2003, down $.2 billion from 2002 primarily due to decreases in average loans, average loans held for sale and average federal funds sold that were partially offset by increases in average securities, and purchased customer receivables recorded in connection with PNCs adoption of FIN 46R. Average loans for 2003 were $34.7 billion compared with $37.1 billion in 2002, a decline of $2.4 billion or 6%. Loans represented 63% of average interest earning assets for 2003 compared with 67% for 2002. The decreases were primarily due to prepayments of residential mortgages, continued weak commercial loan demand coupled with strategic commercial loan downsizing and the run off of vehicle leases, partially offset by an increase in home equity loans. The term loans in this Report excludes loans held for sale and securities that represent interests in pools of loans. Average securities totaled $14.7 billion for 2003, an increase of $2.7 billion from 2002. Securities comprised 27% of average interest earning assets for 2003 compared with 22% for 2002. The increase was primarily due to the purchase of U.S. government agencies securities resulting from the redeployment of liquidity and other interest rate risk management activities. Funding cost is affected by the volume and composition of funding sources as well as related rates paid thereon. Average total deposits were $44.5 billion for 2003 compared with $44.1 billion for 2002. Average deposits comprised 66% of total sources of funds for both 2003 and 2002. Average interest bearing demand and money market deposits totaled $22.4 billion for 2003 compared with $21.5 billion in 2002. The increase reflected focused marketing efforts to grow and maintain more valuable transaction accounts while higher cost, less valuable retail certificates of deposit were not emphasized. Average borrowed funds for 2003 decreased $.2 billion, to $10.5 billion, compared with 2002 commensurate with the decline in average interest earning assets. Average borrowed funds for 2003 included $1.3 billion and $.4 billion related to the impact of the adoption of FIN 46R and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. (SFAS) 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, respectively. See the Consolidated Average Balance Sheet and Net Interest Analysis under Item 8 of this Report for additional information. 16 Table of Contents LINE OF BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS PNC operates seven major businesses engaged in regional community banking; wholesale banking, including corporate banking, real estate finance and asset based lending; wealth management; asset management and global fund processing services. Treasury management activities, which include cash and investment management, receivables management, disbursement services and global trade services; capital markets products, which include foreign exchange, derivatives trading and loan syndications; and equipment leasing products are offered through Corporate Banking and sold by several businesses across the Corporation. Highlights of 2003 results for each of the lines of business follows. Regional Community Banking Regional Community Banking earnings were $608 million in 2003 compared with $697 million in 2002. The decline in total revenue in 2003 compared with the prior year reflected the negative impact of lower interest rates, residential mortgage loan prepayments and the managed run off of the vehicle leasing portfolio. These factors, and an increase in employee benefit costs, contributed to the decline in earnings. Wholesale Banking Total Wholesale Banking earnings were $306 million in 2003 compared with $280 million in 2002. The higher earnings for 2003 reflected improved overall asset quality and higher noninterest income. Wholesale Banking Corporate Banking Corporate Banking earnings were $173 million for 2003 compared with $150 million for 2002. The earnings improvement reflected a lower provision for credit losses that more than offset decreased total revenue and higher noninterest expense compared with the prior year. Wholesale Banking PNC Real Estate Finance PNC Real Estate Finance earned $102 million for 2003 and $90 million for 2002. The increase was primarily due to higher gains on commercial mortgage loan sales in 2003 that more than offset the impact of lower taxable equivalent net interest income and a lower benefit from the provision for credit losses. Wholesale Banking PNC Business Credit PNC Business Credit earned $31 million for 2003 compared with $40 million for 2002. The decline in earnings for 2003 compared with the prior year was primarily due to a $17 million increase in the provision for credit losses in 2003. PNC Advisors PNC Advisors earned $72 million for 2003 compared with $97 million in 2002. The earnings decline reflected lower fee income due to net asset outflows, reduced brokerage revenue and lower taxable equivalent net interest income resulting from the residential mortgage portfolio runoff and the level of interest rates in 2003. BlackRock BlackRock earned $155 million for 2003 compared with $133 million for 2002. Earnings increased for 2003 compared with the prior year as higher revenue, driven by an increase in assets under management and BlackRock Solutions assignments, and higher investment income more than offset increases in general and administration and other operating expenses. BlackRock financial information included in Item 7 of this Report is presented on a stand alone basis. PFPC PFPC earned $61 million for 2003 compared with $65 million for 2002. Lower fund servicing revenue, largely attributable to the sale of the retirement services unit, client attrition and the impact of competitive market conditions on pricing, were substantially offset by a decline in operating expenses, primarily due to benefits from efficiency initiatives that exceeded $50 million. PFPCs 2002 results included the benefits of a $19 million reduction in reserves that were originally established in 2001 and $13 million of fees related to the renegotiation of a client contract. Other Aggregate results of the lines of businesses differ from consolidated results from continuing operations of PNC due to intercompany eliminations and due to various items captured in Other discussed within the Review of Businesses section of Item 7 of this Report. See Note 27 Segment Reporting included in Item 8 of this Report for a reconciliation of line of business results to PNC Consolidated Results from Continuing Operations. Other includes differences between management accounting practices and GAAP such as: capital assignments rather than legal entity shareholders equity, unit cost allocations rather than actual expense assignments, and policies that do not fully allocate holding company expenses; minority interest in income of BlackRock; and other corporate items. Other also includes equity management activities, residual asset and liability management activities and certain insurance related activities which do not meet the criteria for disclosure as a separate reportable business. Other reflected a net loss of $167 million for 2003 compared with a net loss of $63 million for 2002. Other for 2003 included pretax expenses of $120 million, or $87 million after taxes, in connection with the DOJ agreement, including related legal and consulting costs, and a pretax charge of $25 million, or $16 million after taxes, related to leased facilities. 17 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME REVIEW NET INTEREST INCOME Changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of earning assets, related yields and associated funding costs. Accordingly, portfolio size, composition and yields earned and funding costs can have a significant impact on net interest income and margin. See Statistical Information Average Consolidated Balance Sheet and Net Interest Analysis under Item 8 of this Report for additional information. Net interest income was $1.996 billion for 2003 compared with $2.197 billion for 2002. Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis was $2.006 billion and the net interest margin was 3.64 % for 2003, a decline of $204 million and 35 basis points compared with 2002. The low interest rate environment, decreases in commercial loans, prepayments in the residential mortgage loan portfolio, and sales and maturities of securities that were replaced at lower yields resulted in a decline in taxable equivalent net interest income compared with 2002. See below for a reconciliation of net interest income as reported under GAAP to net interest income presented on a taxable equivalent basis. In addition, PNCs adoption effective July 1, 2003, of SFAS 150 negatively impacted 2003 taxable equivalent net interest income by $29 million and the net interest margin by 5 basis points. As required by SFAS 150, the Corporations mandatorily redeemable capital securities of subsidiary trusts (trust preferred securities) totaling $848 million were reclassified in the third quarter of 2003 from between the liabilities and shareholders equity sections of the Consolidated Balance Sheet to borrowed funds. The dividends paid on these financial instruments, previously classified as noninterest expense, were recharacterized as interest expense. Reclassification of prior period amounts was not permitted under SFAS 150. Effective December 31, 2003, the trusts that issued trust preferred securities were deconsolidated based on guidance provided by FIN 46R see Off Balance Sheet Arrangements And Consolidated VIEs in Item 7 of this Report for additional information. Also, the consolidation of variable interest entities due to the adoption of FIN 46R increased 2003 taxable equivalent net interest income by $3 million and average interest earning assets by $1.2 billion. These changes negatively impacted the 2003 net interest margin by 7 basis points. See Market Risk Management Interest Rate Risk in the Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report for additional information. RECONCILIATION OF NET INTEREST INCOME The interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than a taxable investment In order to provide accurate comparisons of yields and margins for all earning assets, the interest income earned on tax exempt assets has been increased to make them fully equivalent to other taxable interest income investments. A reconciliation of net interest income as reported in the Consolidated Statement of Income to net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis follows (in millions): For the year ended Dec. 31, 2003 Dec. 31, 2002 Dec. 31, 2001 Net interest income, GAAP basis $ 1,996 $ 2,197 $ 2,262 Taxable equivalent adjustment 10 13 16 Net interest income, taxable equivalent basis $ 2,006 $ 2,210 $ 2,278 See Consolidated Income Statement Review under the 2002 Versus 2001 section of Item 7 of this Report for further information regarding 2001 taxable equivalent net interest income. PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES The provision for credit losses was $177 million for 2003 compared with $309 million for 2002. The decline in the provision for credit losses compared with the prior year was primarily due to the overall improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio during 2003. The provision for 2002 reflected additions to reserves for PNC Business Credit and Corporate Banking and losses in Corporate Banking related to Market Street Funding Corporation (Market Street) liquidity facilities. See Allowances for Credit Losses And Unfunded Loan Commitments And Letters of Credit in the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report for additional information regarding factors impacting the provision for credit losses. NONINTEREST INCOME Noninterest income totaled $3.257 billion for 2003 compared with $3.197 billion for 2002, an increase of $60 million, or 2%. Asset management fees totaled $861 million for 2003, an increase of $8 million compared with $853 million for 2002. The level of asset management fees is driven in large part by the Corporations assets under management. Consolidated assets under management were $354 billion at December 31, 2003, an increase of $41 billion, or 13%, compared with $313 billion at December 31, 2002. Growth in fixed income assets managed by BlackRock, attributable to net subscriptions and net market appreciation, was the primary factor in the increase in assets under management during 2003. Fund servicing fees were $762 million for 2003, a decrease of $54 million or 7% compared with the prior year. Fund servicing fees are largely attributable to PFPC. Fund servicing fees for 2002 included the favorable impact of $13 million of fees related to the renegotiation of a client contract at PFPC and an additional $15 million related to PFPCs retirement services business, which was sold effective June 30, 2003. Apart from these items, the positive impact of new sales of accounting/administration services and offshore growth in 2003 was more than offset by revenue declines resulting from client attrition and the impact of competitive market conditions on pricing. 18 Table of Contents Service charges on deposits totaled $239 million for 2003, an increase of $12 million or 5% compared with 2002. The increase for 2003 reflected higher volumes partially offset by lower monthly service charges due to higher sales and continued implementation of free checking. Consumer noninterest bearing demand deposits grew 10% on average during 2003 compared with the prior year and total checking relationships of 1.611 million at December 31, 2003 represented a 4% increase compared with the number at December 31, 2002. Brokerage fees totaled $184 million for 2003, down $11 million or 6% compared with the prior year. The decrease compared with 2002 reflected the impact of lower trading volumes and lower annuity fees in 2003. While brokerage activity improved in the latter part of 2003, this did not compensate for the lower trading volumes earlier in the year. Consumer services revenue of $251 million for 2003 represented an increase of $12 million or 5% compared with 2002. Higher revenue in 2003 was primarily due to the impact of additional fees from debit card transactions related to higher transaction volumes and additional fees from ATM transactions. Visa settled litigation in 2003 with major retailers regarding pricing and usage of customer debit cards. The settlement effectively lowered prices paid by merchants to Visa and its member banks. Although PNC was not a defendant in the litigation, the settlement lowered future revenue from certain debit card transactions. The rate changes went into effect August 1, 2003. The lost revenue impact to PNC in 2003 was $6 million. Comparing current rates to those in effect prior to August 1, 2003, the lost revenue impact on 2004 is estimated to be $18 million. Corporate services revenue was $485 million for 2003, a decline of $41 million or 8% compared with 2002. Net gains in excess of valuation adjustments related to the liquidation of institutional loans held for sale are reflected in this line item and totaled $69 million for 2003 compared with $147 million for 2002. Partially offsetting this decline were net gains on sales of commercial mortgages that totaled $52 million for 2003, an increase of $21 million compared with 2002. Cash management and letters of credit fees totaled $250 million, a $14 million increase compared with 2002. This increase also partially offset the decline in net gains in excess of valuation adjustments. Equity management (private equity activities) net losses on portfolio investments were $25 million for 2003 compared with net losses of $51 million for 2002. See Equity Management Asset Valuation in the Critical Accounting Policies And Judgments section and Market Risk Management Equity And Other Investment Risk in the Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report for further information. Net securities gains were $116 million in 2003 compared with $89 million in 2002. Net securities gains for 2003 included $25 million related to the liquidation in the first quarter of 2003 of the three entities formed in 2001 in the PAGIC transactions. Other noninterest income totaled $384 million for 2003, an increase of $81 million or 27% compared with $303 million for 2002. Other noninterest income from investments held by certain variable interest entities (VIEs) totaled $19 million for 2003 due solely to PNCs adoption of FIN 46R. Net trading income included in other noninterest income increased $40 million, to $131 million, in 2003 compared with the prior year. See Note 9 Trading Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Report for further information. Other noninterest income for 2002 included the impact of an additional $20 million benefit resulting from a reduction in the put option liability related to the NBOC acquisition and a $14 million gain on the sale of a real estate investment. PRODUCT REVENUE Treasury management, capital markets and equipment leasing products offered through Corporate Banking are marketed by several businesses across the Corporation. A portion of the revenue and expense related to these products is reflected in Corporate Banking and the remainder is reflected in the results of other businesses. Treasury Management revenue, which includes fees as well as revenue from customer deposit balances, grew to $350 million in 2003, up $13 million compared with the prior year. Applied technology drove 15% revenue growth in Wholesale Lockbox Services to corporate customers, making PNC a leading provider in the industry. Significant contracts were awarded to PNC by IBM and Dell Inc. as their sole provider of wholesale lockbox services in the United States. The shift in paper payments to electronic services results in lower unit pricing per transaction. PNC continues to manage systems and processing infrastructure to mitigate the effects of this continuing trend. PNCs electronic services collectively grew in 2003 by over 10% by introducing to corporate clients technology that capitalizes on the industry shift from paper based processing to electronic processing. External environmental factors affecting 2003 revenue included the stagnant economy and low interest rates. The stagnant economy resulted in fewer customer transactions, and the low interest rates eroded the value of corporate customer deposits. Consolidated revenue from capital markets products was $119 million for 2003, an increase of $15 million compared with 2002 primarily due to an increase in derivatives trading activity and underwriting profits partially offset by a decrease in corporate services fees. Consolidated revenue from equipment leasing products was $84 million for 2003 compared with $79 million for 2002, an increase of $5 million or 6%. As a component of its advisory services to clients, PNC provides a select set of insurance solutions to fulfill specific customer financial needs. Primary insurance offerings include annuities, life, health, disability and commercial lines coverage. Client segments served by these insurance solutions include those in PNC Advisors, Regional Community Banking and Wholesale Banking. Insurance products are sold by PNC 19 Table of Contents licensed insurance agents and through licensed third party arrangements. PNC recognized revenue from its insurance sales activities of $54 million in 2003, $59 million in 2002 and $63 million in 2001. Additionally, PNC, through its subsidiary companies, Alpine Indemnity Limited and PNC Insurance Corp., makes available credit life and disability insurance to consumers and participates in the underwriting of annuities under modified coinsurance agreements with select insurance carriers. See Impact of the Adoption of DIG B36 for further information. NONINTEREST EXPENSE Total noninterest expense was $3.476 billion for 2003, an increase of $249 million or 8% compared with $3.227 billion in 2002. The efficiency ratio was 66% for 2003 and 60% for 2002 on a continuing operations basis. A number of significant expense items impacted each year that drove the increase in total noninterest expense from approximately 3% to 8% in the year over year comparison. Noninterest expense for 2003 included the impact of the following items: $120 million recognized in connection with the DOJ agreement, including $5 million of related legal and consulting costs. $36 million due to the Corporations adoption of FIN 46R. $29 million of costs paid in connection with the liquidation of the three entities formed in 2001 in the PAGIC transactions, the impact of which was mostly offset by related net securities gains included in noninterest income. $25 million of facilities charges related to leased space consistent with the requirements of SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. The effect of these items in 2003 was partially offset by the impact of a $25 million benefit from the vehicle leasing settlement during the fourth quarter of 2003, as described in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Report. Noninterest expense for 2002 included the impact of the following items: $30 million of legal and consulting fees related to regulatory compliance and legal proceedings related to matters arising in connection with regulatory agreements entered into in 2002 and related matters. A $15 million adjustment related to incentive and retention arrangements in the form of co investment partnerships for certain equity management employees. Partially offsetting these items in 2002 was the benefit of a $19 million reduction in reserves at PFPC that were originally established in 2001 largely related to a previously reported plan to consolidate selected facilities. Apart from the items described above, noninterest expense for 2003 increased from 2002 as costs related to reinvestment in new business initiatives and higher pension, stock option, incentive compensation and marketing expenses more than offset a $100 million benefit from efficiency initiatives in 2003. The cost of executive risk insurance, including financial institution bond, directors and officers liability, professional and fiduciary liability, and employment practices liability coverage, will increase significantly in 2004 relative to the current level. The Corporation expensed approximately $10 million related to this insurance in 2003 and expects 2004 expense to total approximately $28 million. IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF DIG B36 Regional Community Bankings business includes the sale of various annuity products on which it realizes commission income. In connection with certain of these transactions, a separate PNC insurance subsidiary has entered into modified coinsurance agreements with select insurance carriers to reinsure 50% of these annuity transactions. These reinsurance agreements currently cover approximately 50,000 annuity contracts, with PNCs share of policyholder account value aggregating approximately $1.2 billion. As part of these agreements, PNC receives a return on a portfolio of assets held and managed by the insurance carriers. Management has discontinued reinsuring new annuity contracts effective January 1, 2004, and is currently evaluating strategic alternatives with respect to the existing book of business. Effective October 1, 2003, as required by the FASB, the Corporation adopted the provisions of Derivatives Implementation Group Statement 133 Implementation Issue No. B36, Embedded Derivatives: Modified Coinsurance Arrangements and Debt Instruments That Incorporate Credit Risk Exposures That Are Unrelated or Only Partially Related to the Creditworthiness of the Obligor under Those Instruments (DIG B36), which affects the accounting for these coinsurance agreements. DIG B36 clarifies SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, by requiring separate accounting for the impact of certain risks embedded in modified coinsurance agreements as derivatives under SFAS 133. The initial adoption of the provisions of DIG B36 to existing coinsurance agreements as of October 1, 2003 was reported in PNCs Consolidated Statement of Income as the cumulative effect of an accounting change and reduced both fourth quarter and full year 2003 net income by $28 million, or $.10 per diluted share. Subsequent to its initial adoption, the application of DIG B36 increased other noninterest income by $8 million for fourth quarter and full year 2003. 20 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET REVIEW BALANCE SHEET DATA December 31 in millions 2003 2002 Assets Loans, net of unearned income $ 34,080 $ 35,450 Securities 15,690 13,763 Loans held for sale 1,400 1,607 Other 16,998 15,557 Total assets $ 68,168 $ 66,377 Liabilities Funding sources $ 56,694 $ 54,098 Other 4,367 4,302 Total liabilities 61,061 58,400 Minority and noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities 462 270 Capital securities 848 Total shareholders equity 6,645 6,859 Total liabilities, minority and noncontrolling interests, capital securities and shareholders equity $ 68,168 $ 66,377 The Corporations Consolidated Balance Sheet is included under Item 8 of this Report. Total assets were $68.2 billion at December 31, 2003 compared with $66.4 billion at December 31, 2002. PNCs adoption of FIN 46R resulted in increases in total assets of $2.6 billion, increases in total liabilities of $2.4 billion and increases in minority and noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities of $216 million at December 31, 2003. See Impact of FIN 46R Consolidating Balance Sheet within the Off Balance Sheet Arrangements And Consolidated VIEs section of Item 7 of this Report for a line by line analysis of the impact of FIN 46R. Apart from FIN 46R, the decrease in total assets at December 31, 2003 compared with December 31, 2002 reflected changes in the mix of total assets as a $1.8 billion decrease in federal funds sold and a smaller loan portfolio more than offset the impact of purchases of U.S. government agencies securities in 2003. An analysis of changes in selected balance sheet categories follows. LOANS Loans were $34.1 billion at December 31, 2003 compared with $35.5 billion at December 31, 2002. The decline of $1.4 billion from the prior year was primarily due to run off in the residential mortgage and vehicle lease portfolios, and a decline in commercial loans, partially offset by an increase in home equity loans.

The equipment lease portfolio totaled $3.7 billion at December 31, 2003 and included approximately $1.7 billion of cross border leases. Cross border leases are primarily leveraged leases of equipment located in foreign countries, primarily in western Europe and Australia. Aggregate residual value at risk on the total commercial lease portfolio at December 31, 2003 was $1.2 billion. Steps have been taken to mitigate $.7 billion of this residual risk, including residual value insurance coverage with third parties, third party guarantees, and other actions. Approximately $.5 billion of this risk was unmitigated. At December 31, 2003, PNCs total loans included $698 million of vehicle leases, net of unearned income. PNCs vehicle leasing business, which has been designated for exit, is 21 Table of Contents comprised of vehicle leases with an aggregate residual value of $557 million and $187 million of estimated future customer lease payments. As of December 31, 2003, the active vehicle leases scheduled to mature are as follows. Vehicle Lease Maturity Schedule Scheduled Maturity Date (a) Dollars in millions Number of Active Vehicle Leases Associated Residual Values 2004 19,000 $ 327 2005 12,000 166 2006 6,000 64 Total 37,000 $ 557 (a) The approximate number of active leases scheduled to mature in 2007 is less than 100. The Corporation recognized a charge of $135 million in late 2001 in connection with the vehicle leasing business that included exit costs and additions to reserves related to insured residual value exposures. The remaining reserve at December 31, 2002 was $119 million. During the fourth quarter of 2003 PNC recognized the benefit of a $25 million settlement related to the vehicle leasing business. This settlement was reached with insurance carriers regarding certain residual value claims for which a reserve had been provided in 2001. Also primarily as a result of this settlement, claims receivable and related reserves were reduced by $61 million during 2003. At December 31, 2003, the remaining liability was $33 million. Until the remaining leases mature, the Corporation will continue to be subject to risks inherent in the vehicle leasing business, including credit risk and the risk that vehicles returned during or at the conclusion of the lease term cannot be disposed of at a price at least equal to the Corporations remaining investment in the vehicles after application of any available residual value insurance or related reserves. The assumptions that were used to establish these reserves in 2001 are monitored, evaluated and updated on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, the remaining liability was considered adequate at December 31, 2003.

Commercial commitments are reported net of participations, assignments and syndications, primarily to financial institutions, totaling $6.4 billion at December 31, 2003 and $6.2 billion at December 31, 2002. Net outstanding standby letters of credit totaled $4.0 billion at December 31, 2003 and $3.7 billion at December 31, 2002. Standby letters of credit commit the Corporation to make payments on behalf of customers if specified future events occur. At December 31, 2003, purchased customer receivables totaled $2.2 billion. These receivables related to Market Street and resulted from PNCs adoption of FIN 46R. Unfunded commitments related to purchased customer receivables totaled $911 million at December 31, 2003. See the Off Balance Sheet Arrangements And Consolidated VIEs section under Item 7 of this Report and Note 2 Variable Interest Entities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Report for further information. At December 31, 2002, prior to the adoption of FIN 46R, PNCs unfunded commitments related to Market Street were reflected in the Commercial category in the Net Unfunded Loan Commitments table and totaled $3.2 billion.

At December 31, 2003, the securities available for sale balance included a net unrealized gain of $4 million, which represented the difference between fair value and amortized cost. The comparable amount at December 31, 2002 was a net 22 Table of Contents unrealized gain of $274 million. Net unrealized gains and losses in the securities available for sale portfolio are included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax. The expected weighted average life of securities available for sale was 2 years and 11 months at December 31, 2003 compared with 2 years and 9 months at December 31, 2002. Management estimates the effective duration (change in fair value given a change in interest rates) of securities available for sale is 2.7% for an immediate 50 basis points parallel increase in interest rates and 2.5% for an immediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in interest rates. Mortgage backed securities (MBS) comprised 37% or $5.8 billion of available for sale securities at December 31, 2003. These securities are predominantly CMOs (collateralized mortgage obligations) and securitized pools of hybrid adjustable rate mortgages. The Corporation has limited holdings of fixed rate MBS. Securities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost. All securities classified as held to maturity at December 31, 2002 were assets of companies formed in 2001 in transactions with AIG that were consolidated in PNCs financial statements. In January 2003, these securities were sold and these companies were liquidated. The expected weighted average life of securities held to maturity was 2 years and 7 months at December 31, 2003 and 20 years and 2 months at December 31, 2002.

Substantially all education loans are classified as loans held for sale. Generally, education loans are sold when the loans go into repayment status. Details of the credit exposure and outstandings by business in the institutional lending held for sale and exit portfolios are included in the Wholesale Banking sections of the Review of Businesses within Item 7 of this Report. A rollforward of the institutional lending held for sale portfolio follows.

Transfers to loan portfolio occurred due to changes in the overall economics of the relationship or the mitigation of risks resulting in managements decision to retain the exposure. The liquidation of institutional loans held for sale resulted in net gains in excess of valuation adjustments of $69 million in 2003 compared with $147 million in 2002.

This increase reflected the recognition of commercial paper totaling $2.2 billion and liabilities of certain variable interest entities of $144 million due to PNCs adoption of FIN 46R. In addition, the adoption of FIN 46R required the deconsolidation of certain subsidiary trusts and the recognition of junior subordinated debentures totaling $1.2 billion at December 31, 2003, $300 million of which was issued in December 2003. Total borrowed funds at December 31, 2003 also reflected PNCs fourth quarter 2003 issuance of $600 million of 5.25% Subordinated Notes due November 2015. The impact of these items was partially offset by bank notes, senior debt and subordinated debt maturities during 2003. Total shareholders equity was $6.6 billion at December 31, 2003 compared with $6.9 billion at December 31, 2002. The decline in total shareholders equity compared with the balance at December 31, 2002 reflected the impact of the Corporations repurchase of common stock during 2003 at a total cost of $508 million as further described below and a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income that more than offset an increase in retained earnings during this period. Common shares outstanding at December 31, 2003 were 276.8 million. PNCs prior stock repurchase program permitted the purchase of up to 35 million shares of common stock through February 29, 2004. Under this program, 11.1 million common shares were repurchased since inception, of which 10.8 million were repurchased during 2003. In February 2004, the board of directors authorized PNC to purchase up to 20 million shares of its common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions through February 28, 2005. The new repurchase authorization is a replacement and continuation of the prior repurchase program that was originally scheduled to end February 29, 2004. The extent and timing of share repurchases under the new program will depend on a number of factors including, among others, market and general economic conditions, economic and regulatory capital considerations, alternative uses of capital, the potential impact on PNCs credit rating and approval by PNCs Board of Directors and any conditions they may establish. In October 2003, the Corporations Board of Directors approved a four percent increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock, to 50 cents a share. The access to and cost of funding new business initiatives, including acquisitions, the ability to engage in expanded business activities, the ability to pay dividends, the level of deposit insurance costs, and the level and nature of regulatory oversight depend, in part, on a financial institutions capital strength. At December 31, 2003, each bank subsidiary of the Corporation was considered well capitalized based on regulatory capital ratio requirements. See Supervision And Regulation under Item 1 of this Report and Note 4 Regulatory Matters under Item 8 of this Report for additional information. The capital position is managed through balance sheet size and composition, issuance of debt and equity instruments, treasury stock activities, dividend policies and retention of earnings.

These activities are found in most larger financial institutions with the size and activities of PNC. Most of these involve financial products distributed to customers, trust and custody services, and processing and funds transfer services, and the amounts involved can be quite large in relation to the Corporations assets, equity and earnings. A discussion of former off balance sheet entities that have been consolidated in connection with PNCs adoption of FIN 46R and significant off balance sheet entities at December 31, 2003 follows: FIN 46 AND FIN 46R: 2003 CHRONOLOGY AND IMPACT OF ADOPTION In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46. The consolidation requirements of FIN 46 applied immediately to VIEs created after January 31, 2003 and applied to all other VIEs in the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. In October 2003, the FASB announced that the effective date of FIN 46 was deferred from July 1, 2003 to December 31, 2003 for interests held by public companies in VIEs created prior to February 1, 2003. PNC, as permitted, elected to adopt the accounting provisions of FIN 46 as of the original July 1, 2003 implementation date by consolidating those VIEs that management believed were then subject to the standard and of which PNC was considered at that time to be the primary beneficiary. In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46R, which clarified and or modified many of the provisions of FIN 46. Application of the revised rules resulted in the Corporation determining that it was no longer the primary beneficiary of certain VIEs. In accordance with the transition provisions of FIN 46R, the Corporation deconsolidated certain entities effective July 1, 2003 that had previously been consolidated as of that date under the provisions of FIN 46. The following VIEs were consolidated under the provisions of FIN 46R effective July 1, 2003: Market Street Funding Corporation (Market Street), a multi seller asset backed commercial paper conduit that is independently owned and managed. PNC Bank, N.A. provides credit enhancement, liquidity facilities and certain administrative services to Market Street. The activities of Market Street are limited to the purchase of, or making of, loans secured by interests primarily in pools of receivables from U.S. corporations that desire access to the commercial paper market. Market Street funds the purchases or loans by issuing commercial paper. Market Streets commercial paper has been rated A1/P1 by Standard & Poors and Moodys. PNC Bank, N.A. provides certain administrative services, a portion of the program level credit enhancement and the majority of liquidity facilities to Market Street in exchange for fees negotiated based on market rates. Credit enhancement is provided in part by PNC Bank, N.A. in the form of a cash collateral account that is funded by a credit loan facility with a five year term expiring on December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2003, approximately $80 million was outstanding on this facility. This amount was eliminated in PNCs Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2003 due to the consolidation of Market Street under FIN 46R. An additional $239 million was provided by a major insurer. Also at December 31, 2003, Market Street had committed liquidity facilities available supporting individual pools of receivables totaling $3.2 billion, of which $2.5 billion was provided by PNC Bank, N.A. As Market Streets program administrator, PNC recognized revenue of $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Commitment fees related to PNCs portion of the liquidity facilities amounted to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. PNC holds no ownership interest in Market Street. Program administrator and commitment fees of $4.6 million and $1.3 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31,2003 were eliminated in PNCs Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2003 due to the consolidation of Market Street. All of Market Streets assets at December 31, 2003 collateralize its commercial paper obligations. Neither creditors nor equity investors in Market Street have any recourse to the general credit of PNC. The consolidation of Market Street was reflected in the Corporate Banking business segment. Certain equity investments made by PNC Real Estate Finance in various limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects utilizing the Low Income Housing Tax Credit pursuant to Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital, to facilitate the sale of additional affordable housing product offerings and 25 Table of Contents to assist PNC in achieving goals associated with the Community Reinvestment Act. The primary activities of the limited partnerships include the identification, development and operation of multi family housing that is leased to qualifying residential tenants. The investments are funded through a combination of debt and equity, with equity typically comprising 30% to 60% of the total project capital. PNC owns a majority of the limited partnership interests in these entities. Also consolidated were certain entities in which PNC Real Estate Finance, as a national syndicator of affordable housing equity, serves as the general partner (together with the aforementioned low income housing tax credit limited partnership investments, the LIHTC investments) and no other entity owns a majority of the limited partnership interests. In these syndication transactions, PNC creates funds in which a PNC subsidiary is the general partner and sells limited partnership interests to third parties, and in some cases may also purchase a limited partnership interest in the fund. The funds limited partners generally can remove the general partner without cause at any time. The purpose of this business is to generate income from the syndication of these funds and to generate servicing fees from the management of the funds. General partner activities include selecting, evaluating, structuring, negotiating, and closing the funds investments in operating limited partnerships, as well as oversight of the ongoing operations of the fund portfolio. Neither creditors nor equity investors in the LIHTC investments have any recourse to the general credit of PNC. The consolidation of the LIHTC investments was reflected in the PNC Real Estate Finance business segment. The Corporation deconsolidated the assets and liabilities of PNC Institutional Capital Trust A, Trust B, and Trust C, and PNC Capital Trust D (the Trusts) effective December 31, 2003 based on the guidance included in FIN 46R. The deconsolidation of the Trusts removed $1.148 billion of Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Securities issued by the Trusts while adding $1.184 billion of junior subordinated debentures and $36 million of other assets to the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2003. A Consolidating Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2003 and a Consolidating Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2003 are included below to indicate the impact of the adoption of FIN 46R on a line item basis and on selected ratios. See Note 2 Variable Interest Entities and Note 20 Capital Securities of Subsidiary Trusts in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Report for further information. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The following represent significant off balance sheet arrangements of PNC that are not consolidated under FIN 46R: BlackRock, a majority owned subsidiary of PNC, acts as collateral manager for six collateralized debt obligation funds (CDOs). The CDOs invest in high yield securities and bank loans, among other investments, and offer opportunity for high return and are subject to greater risk than traditional investment products. These CDOs are structured to take advantage of the yield differential between their assets and liabilities and have terms to maturity ranging from eight to twelve years when issued. At December 31, 2003, the aggregate assets and debt of the CDOs were $2.7 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively. BlackRocks equity ownership, which represents the extent of BlackRocks risk of loss, was approximately $16 million at December 31, 2003. Neither creditors nor equity investors in the funds have any recourse to the general credit of BlackRock or PNC. PNCs maximum exposure to loss in these funds, consisting of its ownership percentage of BlackRocks equity investment and investments in funds held by another PNC subsidiary, was approximately $38 million at December 31, 2003. A number of private investment funds, organized as limited partnerships, are managed by the Hawthorn division of PNC Advisors (Private Funds). All of the Private Funds $1.1 billion of assets at December 31, 2003 collateralize their obligations. Neither creditors nor investors in the Private Funds have recourse to the general credit of PNC. PNCs maximum exposure to loss in these funds is limited to the value of its ownership interests in the partnerships, which was approximately $2.9 million in the aggregate at December 31, 2003 BlackRock acts as trading adviser and special member to an entity which has created a series of municipal securities trusts in which the entity has retained interests. These trusts purchase fixed rate, long term, highly rated, insured or escrowed municipal bonds financed by the issuance of trust certificates. The trust certificates entitle the holder to receive future payments of principal and variable interest and to tender such certificates at the option of the holder on a periodic basis. A third party acts as placement agent for the entity and the trusts and as liquidity provider to the trusts. This entity, including the trusts, had assets and debt of $375 million and $227 million, respectively, at December 31, 2003. BlackRocks equity ownership, which represents the maximum exposure to loss, was $5 million at December 31, 2003. PNC Real Estate Finance has equity investments in various limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects utilizing the Low Income Housing Tax Credit pursuant to Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code. Certain of these entities were consolidated under FIN 46R as described above as PNC is considered the 26 Table of Contents primary beneficiary. Additionally, PNC is considered to have a significant variable interest in certain of these entities. PNC does not own a majority of the limited partnership interests in these entities and is not the primary beneficiary. These entities had total assets of $40.5 million at December 31, 2003. PNC uses the equity method to account for its investment in these entities. PNC had $5.5 million recorded as its investment at December 31, 2003 and no unfunded commitments to these entities; as a result, its maximum potential loss is $5.5 million. In addition, the Corporation has subsidiaries that invest in and act as the investment manager for a private equity fund that is organized as a limited partnership as part of its equity management activities. The fund invests in private equity investments to generate capital appreciation and profits. At December 31, 2003, aggregate assets and equity in the fund were approximately $52.9 million and $51.6 million, respectively. PNCs ownership interest in the fund was approximately $13.2 million at December 31, 2003, which represents its maximum exposure to loss. Under the transition guidance in FIN 46R, application of the provisions of the interpretation has been deferred for companies that follow specialized accounting for investment companies pending further action by the FASB. 27 Table of Contents Impact of FIN 46R Information Consolidating Statement of Income Impact of FIN 46R For the year ended December 31, 2003In millions Results beforeadoptionof FIN 46R MarketStreetFunding AffordableHousingPartnerships Results asreported Interest Income Loans and fees on loans $ 1,941 $ (1 ) $ 1,940 Securities 579 579 Loans held for sale 48 48 Other 121 22 $ 2 145 Total interest income 2,689 21 2 2,712 Interest Expense Deposits 457 457 Borrowed funds 239 14 6 259 Total interest expense 696 14 6 716 Net interest income 1,993 7 (4 ) 1,996 Provision for credit losses 177 177 Net interest income less provision for credit losses 1,816 7 (4 ) 1,819 Noninterest Income Asset management 861 861 Fund servicing 762 762 Service charges on deposits 239 239 Brokerage 184 184 Consumer services 251 251 Corporate services 490 (5 ) 485 Equity management (25 ) (25 ) Net securities gains 116 116 Other 365 19 384 Total noninterest income 3,243 (5 ) 19 3,257 Noninterest Expense Staff expense 1,804 1,804 Net occupancy 282 282 Equipment 276 276 Marketing 64 64 Distributions on capital securities 28 28 Other 986 2 34 1,022 Total noninterest expense 3,440 2 34 3,476 Income before minority and noncontrolling interests and income taxes 1,619 (19 ) 1,600 Minority and noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated entities 51 (19 ) 32 Income taxes 539 539 Income before cumulative effect of accounting change 1,029 1,029 Cumulative effect of accounting change (less applicable income tax benefit of $14) (28 ) (28 ) Net income $ 1,001 $ 1,001 Net interest margin 3.71 % (.06 )% (.01 )% 3.64 % 28 Table of Contents Impact of FIN 46R Information Consolidating Balance Sheet Impact of FIN 46R At December 31, 2003In millions Results beforeadoptionof FIN 46R MarketStreetFunding AffordableHousingPartnerships TrustPreferredSecurities Results asreported Assets Cash and due from banks $ 2,965 $ 3 $ 2,968 Federal funds sold 50 50 Resale agreements 1,827 1,827 Other short term investments 719 719 Loans held for sale 1,400 1,400 Securities 15,688 $ 2 15,690 Loans, net of unearned income of $1,009 34,176 (80 ) (16 ) 34,080 Allowance for credit losses (633 ) 1 (632 ) Net loans 33,543 (79 ) (16 ) 33,448 Goodwill 2,390 2,390 Other intangible assets 317 317 Purchased customer receivables 2,223 2,223 Other 6,651 449 $ 36 7,136 Total assets $ 65,550 $ 2,146 $ 436 $ 36 $ 68,168 Liabilities Deposits Noninterest bearing $ 11,505 $ 11,505 Interest bearing 33,816 $ (80 ) 33,736 Total deposits 45,321 (80 ) 45,241 Borrowed funds Federal funds purchased 169 169 Repurchase agreements 1,081 1,081 Bank notes and senior debt 2,823 2,823 Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings 1,115 1,115 Subordinated debt 2,545 $ 1,184 3,729 Mandatorily redeemable capital securities of subsidiary trusts 1,148 (1,148 ) Commercial paper 2,226 2,226 Other borrowed funds 166 $ 144 310 Total borrowed funds 9,047 2,226 144 36 11,453 Allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit 90 90 Accrued expenses 2,275 2,275 Other 1,926 76 2,002 Total liabilities 58,659 2,146 220 36 61,061 Minority and noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities 246 216 462 Shareholders Equity Common stock $5 par value Authorized 800 shares, issued 353 shares 1,764 1,764 Capital surplus 1,108 1,108 Retained earnings 7,642 7,642 Deferred benefit expense (29 ) (29 ) Accumulated other comprehensive income 60 60 Common stock held in treasury at cost: 76 shares (3,900 ) (3,900 ) Total shareholders equity 6,645 6,645 Total liabilities, minority and noncontrolling interests and shareholders equity $ 65,550 $ 2,146 $ 436 $ 36 $ 68,168 CAPITAL AND OTHER RATIOS Tier 1 risk based (a) 9.6 % (.1 )% 9.5 % Total risk based (a) 13.9 (.1 ) 13.8 Leverage 8.6 (.3 )% (.1 ) 8.2 Shareholders equity to total assets 10.14 (.32 ) (.06 ) (.01 )% 9.75 Common shareholders equity to total assets 10.12 (.32 ) (.06 ) (.01 ) 9.73 Return on average assets 1.64 (.06 ) (.01 ) 1.57 (a) Regulatory capital relief has been granted through March 31, 2004 with respect to consolidation of the Market Street conduit. 29 Table of Contents REVIEW OF BUSINESSES Results of individual businesses are presented based on PNCs management accounting practices and the Corporations management structure. There is no comprehensive, authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to generally accepted accounting principles; therefore, the financial results of individual businesses are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company. Financial results are presented, to the extent practicable, as if each business operated on a stand alone basis. Also, certain amounts for 2002 have been reclassified to conform with the 2003 presentation. The management accounting process uses various balance sheet and income statement assignments and transfers to measure performance of the businesses. Methodologies are refined from time to time as management accounting practices are enhanced and businesses change. There were no significant methodology changes made during 2003. Securities or borrowings and related net interest income are assigned based on the net asset or liability position of each business. Capital is assigned based on managements assessment of inherent risks and equity levels at independent companies providing similar products and services. The allowance for credit losses is allocated based on managements assessment of risk inherent in the loan portfolios. The costs incurred by support areas not directly aligned with the businesses are allocated primarily based on the utilization of services. Total business financial results differ from total consolidated results from continuing operations. The impact of these differences is reflected in the Intercompany eliminations and Other categories. Intercompany eliminations reflects activities conducted among PNCs businesses that are eliminated in the consolidated results. Other includes differences between management accounting practices and GAAP such as: capital assignments rather than legal entity shareholders equity, unit cost allocations rather than actual expense assignments, and policies that do not fully allocate holding company expenses; minority interest in income of BlackRock; and other corporate items. Other also includes equity management activities, residual asset and liability management activities and certain insurance related activities which do not meet the criteria for disclosure as a separate reportable business. Other reflected a net loss of $167 million for 2003 compared with a net loss of $63 million for 2002. Other for 2003 included pretax expenses of $120 million, or $87 million after taxes, in connection with the DOJ agreement, including related legal and consulting costs, and a pretax charge of $25 million, or $16 million after taxes, related to leased facilities. Business results, including inter segment revenues, are included in Note 27 Segment Reporting under Item 8 of this Report. Other Information included in the separate line of business tables that follow is presented as of period end, except for net charge offs, net gains (losses) on loans held for sale and average full time equivalent employees (FTEs), which represent amounts for the periods presented. FTE statistics as reported by business reflect staff directly employed by the respective businesses and exclude corporate and shared services employees. Prior period FTE amounts are not restated for organizational changes. 30 Table of Contents Results Of Businesses Summary Earnings (Loss) Revenue (a) Return onAssigned Capital (b) Average Assets (c) Year ended December 31 dollars in millions 2003 2002 2003 2002 2003 2002 2003 2002 Banking Businesses Regional Community Banking $ 608 $ 697 $ 2,064 $ 2,182 23 % 27 % $ 38,450 $ 38,976 Wholesale Banking Corporate Banking 173 150 685 786 20 14 12,467 13,807 PNC Real Estate Finance 102 90 267 229 29 23 4,758 5,018 PNC Business Credit 31 40 192 182 13 16 3,817 3,837 Total Wholesale Banking 306 280 1,144 1,197 21 17 21,042 22,662 PNC Advisors 72 97 615 654 14 19 2,912 2,929 Total banking businesses 986 1,074 3,823 4,033 22 22 62,404 64,567 Asset Management and Processing Businesses BlackRock 155 133 598 577 23 24 967 864 PFPC 61 65 762 817 29 31 1,909 1,888 Total asset management and processing businesses 216 198 1,360 1,394 24 26 2,876 2,752 Total business results 1,202 1,272 5,183 5,427 22 23 65,280 67,319 Intercompany eliminations (6 ) (9 ) (89 ) (101 ) (1,898 ) (1,971 ) Other (167 ) (63 ) 169 81 3,897 1,241 Results from continuing operations 1,029 1,200 5,263 5,407 15 19 67,279 66,589 Discontinued operations (16 ) Results before cumulative effect of accounting change 1,029 1,184 5,263 5,407 15 19 67,279 66,589 Cumulative effect of accounting change (28 ) Total consolidated (b) $ 1,001 $ 1,184 $ 5,263 $ 5,407 15 19 $ 67,279 $ 66,589 (a) Business revenue is presented on a taxable equivalent basis except for BlackRock and PFPC, which are presented on a book (GAAP) basis.

During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Corporation accelerated the timeframe for recognizing delinquent, well secured residential mortgage loans as nonperforming. This change resulted in the classification of an additional $15 million of residential mortgages as nonperforming (nonaccrual) loans at December 31, 2003. (b) Included in other noninterest income above. Regional Community Banking earnings were $608 million in 2003 compared with $697 million in 2002. While continued progress was made in 2003 in the execution of a strategy to build a valuable base of customers anchored with a checking relationship, the benefits of this growth were offset by managing to a moderate risk asset mix in a low interest rate environment, resulting in a decline in revenue. Increases in expenses in 2003 were primarily driven by higher employee benefit and pension costs and the ongoing investment in technology and network expansion to support business growth strategies. Regional Community Banking remained focused on its long term growth strategy during 2003, while reducing risk and managing through a challenging economic environment. The base of checking customers continued to grow through account acquisition and high levels of customer satisfaction and retention. The increased checking account base allowed for increased levels of other product and service usage. The increase in the number of customers and their relationship depth is the primary driver of growth in high quality loan balances, low cost core deposits and fee income. These performance improvements were offset by decreases in revenue attributable to the negative impact of lower interest rates on loans and investments and the targeted downsizing of the residential mortgage and vehicle leasing portfolios throughout the year. Highlights of 2003 for Regional Community Banking follow: The number of consumer and small business checking relationships grew for the third consecutive year, increasing by 4% from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003. The three year compound annual growth rate for this customer base exceeded 5%. The growth in checking relationships drove a 10% increase in noninterest bearing demand deposits and a 6% increase in deposit and consumer service revenue. Active use of checking services continued to improve with debit card utilization increasing by 9% and on line banking and bill pay usage increasing by 26% and 24%, respectively. Relationship based lending growth was driven by a 17% increase in the home equity portfolio. This growth was achieved while realizing a simultaneous improvement in credit quality evidenced by an increase in first lien positions and FICO scores. PNC Investments outperformed industry benchmark of revenue per retail deposits by approximately 20% and was recognized by the Bank Securities Association with an Award of Excellence. Investments in future growth and expansion in attractive markets included the United National acquisition and the alliance with Stop & Shop Supermarkets in New Jersey. Total revenue was $2.1 billion for 2003 compared with $2.2 billion for 2002. A 10% decline in taxable equivalent net interest income of $142 million more than offset the performance improvements in the core 32 Table of Contents business drivers. The lower interest rate environment in 2003 and the continued downsizing of the vehicle lease portfolio contributed to a significant decline in yield on assets funded by Regional Community Bankings deposit gathering activities. Accelerating loan pre payments and lower yields on reinvestments resulted in a $90 million decline in taxable equivalent net interest income generated from the mortgage loan and mortgage backed securities portfolios. The continued run off of the vehicle lease portfolio and a corresponding decline in yield contributed to a $48 million decline in taxable equivalent net interest income. An additional $32 million decline in taxable equivalent net interest income was attributable to lower yields on securities. Growth in the home equity loan balances produced a $31 million increase in taxable equivalent net interest income. Other noninterest income increased $15 million compared with 2002 driven by a $12 million improvement in deposit related fee revenue and a $10 million increase in debit card and ATM fees associated with the growth in checking relationships. During the latter half of the year, debit card fees were negatively impacted by Visas settlement with major retailers regarding the pricing and usage of customer debit cards as described in the Consolidated Statement of Income Review section of Item 7 of this Report. Other noninterest income was negatively impacted by declining gains on sales of assets and a decrease in brokerage revenue of $4 million due to lower trading volume and a reduced demand for fixed annuities as rates declined. Net securities gains increased $9 million for 2003 compared with 2002. Overall credit quality continued to improve in 2003. The provision for credit losses declined $6 million compared with 2002 primarily due to a decrease in required specific reserves. The decrease in reserves reflected an improved loan portfolio mix consistent with the moderate risk loan growth objectives of the business. The $8 million increase in total nonperforming assets was attributable to managements decision to accelerate the timeframe for recognizing delinquent mortgage loans as nonperforming. Noninterest expenses increased $33 million or 3% compared with 2002. The impact of higher pension and benefit costs, increased costs associated with home equity loan volumes, investments in the branch network and increases in net occupancy associated with additional off site ATMs more than offset the benefit of a $25 million vehicle leasing settlement recognized in the fourth quarter of 2003. The settlement was reached with insurance carriers regarding certain residual value claims for which a reserve had been provided in 2001. See the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of Item 7 of this Report for further information. Average total loans decreased by 3% in 2003 compared with 2002. Regional Community Banking has adopted a relationship based lending strategy to deepen relationships with checking customers while managing the overall loan portfolio to a moderate risk profile. The execution of this strategy targets certain portfolios for growth (home equity and commercial ) while allowing other portfolios to run off. Home equity loans grew by 17% on average compared with the prior year driven by record levels of new loan volume fueled in part by first mortgage refinancing activity. The growth in home equity loans and a higher level of residential mortgage prepayments reflected consumer debt trends during the periods presented which may not continue. As of December 31, 2003, 96% of the home equity portfolio was within PNCs geographic footprint, consistent with the relationship building strategy of the business. Commercial loans outstanding grew by 10% due to growth in small business relationships and a 16% increase in lending to automobile dealerships that reflected both the acquisition of new relationships and existing dealers expanding their auto inventories during 2003. The overall decline in loans was primarily attributable to residential mortgage loan prepayments and the managed run off of the vehicle leasing portfolio. Growth in core deposits as a low cost source of funding for PNC is one of the primary objectives of the Regional Community Banking checking relationship growth strategy. Average total deposits declined 2% in 2003 compared with the previous year as growth in the core deposit products of checking, money market and savings were more than offset by a decline in certificates of deposit. Demand deposit growth of 7% was primarily attributable to the growth in consumer and small business checking relationships. Savings and money market balances were relatively flat as the progress with cross selling efforts was offset by the adverse impact of aggressive competitor pricing on balances attracted and retained. The certificates of deposit portfolio declined as higher cost maturing certificates were not targeted for aggressive retention offers and were allowed to run off or were replaced with fixed rate annuities based on customer needs and preferences. 33 Table of Contents WHOLESALE BANKING SUMMARY Wholesale Banking (comprised of Corporate Banking, PNC Real Estate Finance and PNC Business Credit) had earnings of $306 million for 2003 compared with $280 million for 2002. The year over year increase of 9% was driven by improved overall asset quality and noninterest income growth that more than offset a decline in taxable equivalent net interest income of $60 million. Highlights of 2003 for Wholesale Banking follow: Sales of value added products from treasury management and capital markets exceeded targets and contributed to the ongoing effort of continuing to penetrate the existing customer base with PNCs products and services. The impact of this improvement was reflected in noninterest income. A significant contribution to noninterest income growth was the PNC Real Estate Finance segment, which sells commercial mortgage loans to third parties that are pooled with other loans and distributed in the securitization market. Volumes distributed in 2003 exceeded 2002 levels and favorable market pricing and strong execution resulted in gains in 2003 increasing $21 million or 68% from 2002. The repositioning of the institutional lending business and continued progress toward a best in class risk management organization resulted in improved overall asset quality and a decline in the provision for credit losses of $135 million or 53%. Overall asset quality improvement was evidenced by a decline of $104 million or 31% in nonperforming assets compared with 2002 levels. Another focus of Wholesale Banking is the proper alignment of the revenue and expense relationship as represented by the efficiency ratio. There were several items distorting changes in this relationship in 2003, such as the consolidation of VIEs effective July 1, 2003 as required by FIN 46R, non recurring gains resulting from the institutional repositioning of the loan portfolio and liquidation of certain loans put to PNC by NBOC as part of the 2002 acquisition. Apart from these items, the efficiency ratio was negatively impacted by the deleveraging of the balance sheet and loan run off. New client acquisition targets exceeded expectations in 2003. Management is focused on the strategic objective of increasing market share over time. New client acquisition will continue to be a focus throughout 2004. Overall revenue declined by $53 million or 4% year over year as a result of a 10% or $1.7 billion decline in average loan outstandings. Quality loan growth is a strategic imperative for future growth of Wholesale Banking. 34 Table of Contents WHOLESALE BANKING CORPORATE BANKING Year ended December 31 Taxable equivalent basis Dollars in millions 2003 2002 INCOME STATEMENT Net interest income $ 301 $ 349 Noninterest income 384 437 Total revenue 685 786 Provision for credit losses 48 203 Noninterest expense 370 359 Pretax earnings 267 224 Income taxes 94 74 Earnings $ 173 $ 150 AVERAGE BALANCE SHEET Loans $ 8,180 $ 9,477 Purchased customer receivables 1,230 Loans held for sale 202 1,369 Other assets 2,855 2,961 Total assets $ 12,467 $ 13,807 Deposits $ 5,135 $ 4,683 Commercial paper 1,232 Assigned funds and other liabilities 5,254 8,088 Assigned capital 846 1,036 Total funds $ 12,467 $ 13,807 PERFORMANCE RATIOS Return on assigned capital 20 % 14 % Noninterest income to total revenue 56 56 Efficiency 54 46 OTHER INFORMATION Consolidated revenue from treasury management $ 350 $ 337 Consolidated revenue from capital markets $ 119 $ 104 Total nonperforming assets (a) $ 116 $ 187 Net charge offs $ 90 $ 137 Average FTE staff 1,890 2,123 Institutional lending repositioning Loans held for sale Credit exposure $ 85 $ 564 Outstandings $ 51 $ 245 Exit portfolio Credit exposure $ 51 $ 413 Outstandings Net gains on loans held for sale (b) $ 62 $ 155 (a) Includes nonperforming loans of $71 million at December 31, 2003 and $104 million at December 31, 2002. (b) Included in noninterest income above. Corporate Banking earnings were $173 million for 2003 compared with $150 million for 2002. The earnings improvement reflected a significantly lower provision for credit losses that more than offset decreased total revenue driven by the reduction of loan assets by $1.3 billion, a lower level of gains in the held for sale loan portfolio and higher noninterest expense compared with the prior year. Highlights of 2003 for Corporate Banking follow: Corporate Bankings focus on acquisition, retention and growth of customers is beginning to show positive results. Client retention and acquisition accomplishments exceeded plan. Significant progress has been made in developing relationships as demonstrated by revenue growth in treasury management and capital markets products. The credit risk profile has significantly improved. The potential for revenue and loan growth exists as the economy improves. Efficiency remains a concern but should return to more typical levels as loan growth materializes. Effective July 1, 2003, PNC consolidated Market Street into its financial statements in connection with the adoption of FIN 46R. While the consolidation of Market Street had no impact on earnings for Corporate Banking or PNC in 2003, it increased taxable equivalent net interest income by $7 million, decreased noninterest income by $5 million, and increased noninterest expense by $2 million. In addition, the impact of FIN 46R affected Corporate Bankings average balance sheet primarily due to the addition of purchased customer receivables and commercial paper. The decrease in taxable equivalent net interest income for 2003 compared with the prior year was primarily due to the reduction in average loans and average loans held for sale resulting from the institutional lending repositioning that began in 2001 that more than offset the effect of lower borrowing costs. Average loans declined $1.3 billion or 14% due to continued weak loan demand and a strategy to exit client relationships that did not meet the desired risk/retention profile for the capital invested. Noninterest income decreased $53 million compared with 2002 primarily due to a $93 million reduction in net gains on loans held for sale compared with 2002. Gains realized in both years resulted from a more active market than was anticipated at the time the loans were transferred to held for sale, the negotiation of individual loan sales rather than bulk transactions, and sales occurring faster than had been expected. Additionally, declines in credit exposure resulting from payments, refinancings and reductions in credit facilities also contributed to the gains in both years. These gains were partially offset by additional valuation adjustments required on certain credit facilities remaining in the portfolio. Partially offsetting the decline in net gains on loans held for sale was $23 million of net securities gains recognized in 2003 in connection with the liquidation of two entities formed in 2001 in the PAGIC transactions with American International Group, Inc. (AIG). The decrease in the provision for credit losses in 2003 compared with 2002 reflected an improvement in overall asset quality, as reflected by a $71 million decline in total nonperforming assets compared with the balance at December 31, 2002. In addition, the provision for credit losses for 2002 reflected charge offs of $90 million related to Market Street matters, a $24 million reserve for a single airline industry credit and the impact of refinements to the reserve methodology related to impaired loans and pooled reserves. The increase in noninterest expense of $11 million in 2003 compared with 2002 reflected $22 million of costs paid in 2003 in connection with the liquidation of two entities formed in 2001 in the PAGIC transactions and higher pension and stock option costs, partially offset by lower servicing costs associated with the reduction in average loans and average loans held for sale. The reduction in nonperforming assets at December 31, 2003 of $71 million compared with December 31, 2002 was primarily due to the Corporations continued liquidation of the institutional lending held for sale portfolio. 35 Table of Contents WHOLESALE BANKING PNC REAL ESTATE FINANCE Year ended December 31 Taxable equivalent basis Dollars in millions except as noted 2003 2002 INCOME STATEMENT Net interest income $ 107 $ 117 Net interest income FIN 46R (4 ) Total net interest income 103 117 Noninterest income Net commercial mortgage banking Net gains on loan sales 52 31 Servicing and other fees, net of amortization 39 40 Other FIN 46R 19 Other 54 41 Total noninterest income 164 112 Total revenue 267 229 Provision for credit losses (7 ) (10 ) Noninterest expense 165 160 Noninterest expense FIN 46R 34 Pretax earnings 75 79 Noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated entities (21 ) (2 ) Income tax (benefit) expense (6 ) (9 ) Earnings $ 102 $ 90 AVERAGE BALANCE SHEET Loans Commercial real estate $ 1,872 $ 2,230 Commercial real estate related 1,404 1,471 Total loans 3,276 3,701 Commercial mortgages held for sale 324 271 Other loans held for sale 25 141 Other assets 1,133 905 Total assets $ 4,758 $ 5,018 Deposits $ 1,133 $ 750 Liabilities of certain variable interest entities 64 Noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities 67 Assigned funds and other liabilities 3,142 3,876 Assigned capital 352 392 Total funds $ 4,758 $ 5,018 PERFORMANCE RATIOS Return on assigned capital 29 % 23 % Noninterest income to total revenue 61 49 Efficiency 75 70 OTHER INFORMATION Total nonperforming assets (a) $ 3 $ 2 Net charge offs (recoveries) $ 1 $ (6 ) Average FTE staff 743 789 Net carrying amount of commercial mortgage servicing rights $ 209 $ 201 Institutional lending repositioning Loans held for sale Credit exposure $ 16 $ 49 Outstandings $ 16 $ 44 Exit portfolio Credit exposure $ 25 Outstandings $ 4 Net gains on loans held for sale (b) $ 8 $ 3 COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE SERVICING PORTFOLIO (c) January 1 $ 74 $ 68 Acquisitions/additions 23 19 Repayments/transfers (14 ) (13 ) December 31 $ 83 $ 74 (a) Includes nonperforming loans of $2 million at both December 31, 2003 and 2002.

The loss of loan outstandings and the inability to replace those loans with new loans having acceptable risks and returns adversely impacted its loan outstanding maintenance goal in 2003. Loan servicing goals were exceeded in terms of dollars serviced, and Midland successfully converted substantially all of its loan servicing platform from a third party vendor to its own technology. Highlights of 2003 for PNC Real Estate Finance follow: Gains on the sale of commercial mortgage loans increased $21 million in 2003 compared with 2002. Favorable market conditions for the sale of commercial mortgage backed securities and higher volumes were the primary drivers of this increase. Average loans outstanding decreased $425 million in 2003 compared with 2002. This decline in average loans was the primary contributor to the decline in taxable equivalent net interest income. Credit quality remained excellent and was a contributing factor, along with the overall decrease in loans, in the negative provision for credit losses in 2003. The commercial mortgage servicing portfolio increased $9 billion to $83 billion at December 31, 2003. PNC Real Estate Finance earned $102 million for 2003 compared with $90 million in 2002. The increase was primarily due to higher income from distribution activities, especially gains on the sale of commercial mortgages loans into securitizations underwritten by third parties. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net interest income due to lower loan outstandings. Effective July 1, 2003, PNC Real Estate Finance consolidated certain equity investments in various limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects utilizing the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) in connection with the Corporations adoption of FIN 46R. The adoption of FIN 46R was also applied to certain investment vehicles in which PNC Real Estate Finance is a syndicator of affordable housing equity and is the general partner. The application of FIN 46R to these entities had no impact on earnings for PNC Real Estate Finance for 2003. However, certain line items on the income statement were increased as a result of the consolidation of these entities. See the Off Balance Sheet Arrangements And Consolidated VIEs section of Item 7 of this Report and Note 2 Variable Interest Entities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Report for further information. Taxable equivalent net interest income declined in 2003 compared with the prior year primarily due to the decrease in average loans outstanding as described above. Apart from the impact of FIN 46R, noninterest income increased in 2003 due to higher gains on the sale of commercial mortgage loans and higher gains on the sale of certain loans in the institutional lending repositioning portfolio. Apart from the impact of FIN 46R, noninterest expense increased $5 million, or 3%, in 2003 compared with the prior year primarily due to employee costs. 36 Table of Contents PNC Real Estate Finance recognized an income tax benefit in both 2003 and 2002, as it received tax credits on its LIHTC investments. The income tax benefits were partially offset by passive losses included in noninterest expense on these investments. Midland, as a third party servicer, is required to comply with various contractual obligations, including the obligation to monitor property taxes and insurance and to advance funds for delinquent borrower payments and property protection purposes, subject to certain recoverability provisions. A total of $93 million of advances were outstanding at December 31, 2003, compared with $80 million at December 31, 2002. Midlands right to be reimbursed for these advances from borrower repayments, liquidation proceeds and other sources as set forth in the applicable servicing contracts is superior in priority to all other claims on the cash flows from the related securitizations, including claims by the security holders. 37 Table of Contents WHOLESALE BANKING PNC BUSINESS CREDIT Year ended December 31 Taxable equivalent basis Dollars in millions 2003 2002 INCOME STATEMENT Net interest income $ 136 $ 134 Noninterest income 56 48 Total revenue 192 182 Provision for credit losses 81 64 Noninterest expense 61 53 Pretax earnings 50 65 Income taxes 19 25 Earnings $ 31 $ 40 AVERAGE BALANCE SHEET Loans $ 3,551 $ 3,535 Loans held for sale 21 68 Other assets 245 234 Total assets $ 3,817 $ 3,837 Deposits $ 105 $ 84 Assigned funds and other liabilities 3,464 3,503 Assigned capital 248 250 Total funds $ 3,817 $ 3,837 PERFORMANCE RATIOS Return on assigned capital 13 % 16 % Noninterest income to total revenue 29 26 Efficiency 32 29 OTHER INFORMATION Total nonperforming assets (a) $ 108 $ 142 Net charge offs $ 67 $ 32 NBOC put option liability $ 57 NBOC put option valuation income $ 8 $ 28 Marketing locations 24 23 Average FTE staff 252 241 INSTITUTIONAL LENDING REPOSITIONING Loans held for sale Credit exposure $ 3 $ 13 Outstandings $ 3 $ 9 Net losses on loans held for sale (b) $ (1 ) $ (11 ) (a) Includes nonperforming loans of $104 million at December 31, 2003 and $126 million at December 31, 2002.

PNC Business Credit plans to build upon sales momentum achieved over the past two years and capitalize on scale advantages over regional competitors, while striving to maintain hold levels under $35 million per client. Highlights of 2003 for PNC Business Credit follow: PNC Business Credits revenue grew 5% in 2003 compared with the prior year. The number of customers acquired directly through PNC Business Credits marketing force was up 36% in 2003 over the prior year. These customers bring the potential for additional future revenue through cross selling. Business Credit was one of the top 5 lenders in the asset backed lending industry in 2003. Assets acquired in 2002 from NBOC were successfully integrated into this business in 2003. Results have been adversely impacted by credit costs in both 2003 and 2002. Management expects that trend to reverse in 2004 with an overall improvement in asset quality. PNC Business Credit earned $31 million for 2003 compared with $40 million for 2002. The decline in earnings for 2003 compared with the prior year was primarily due to a $17 million increase in the provision for credit losses in 2003. Total revenue was $192 million for 2003 and $182 million for 2002. Noninterest income increased $8 million in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase in noninterest income was primarily due to higher product related revenue and a lower level of losses recognized on the institutional loans held for sale that more than offset the impact of a $20 million decline in income resulting from the reduction in the value of the NBOC put option liability. See Note 3 Acquisitions in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for further information on the NBOC transaction. The provision for credit losses for 2003 was $81 million, an increase of $17 million compared with 2002. Net charge offs were $67 million for 2003, an increase of $35 million compared with the prior year period. Net charge offs for 2003 included a $42 million charge off related to a single loan to a wholesale goods/retail customer. A reserve has been provided at December 31, 2003 in connection with this customers remaining balance. This is the largest single nonperforming relationship in this business and was supported more by its franchise value than a collateral value. Approximately 99% of the total portfolio in this business is underwritten based on the value of collateral. PNC Business Credit loans, including those acquired in the NBOC acquisition, are primarily secured loans to borrowers, many of whom are highly leveraged, experiencing rapid growth, or have elected to utilize asset based financing. As a result, the risk profile of these loans typically reflects a higher risk of default and a greater proportion being classified as nonperforming. The impact of these loans on the provision for credit losses and the level of nonperforming assets may be even more pronounced during periods of economic downturn. The ability of customers to borrow under these loan agreements is typically constrained by the amount of collateral that the customer has available to support the loan. Collateral is monitored and periodically audited by PNC Business Credit to verify its existence and condition. Therefore, other than the 2003 charge off described above, net charge offs on asset based loans have historically been relatively low due to recoveries provided by the underlying collateral. Compensation for this higher risk of default is obtained by way of higher interest rates charged. Total noninterest expense increased $8 million in 2003 compared with 2002, primarily due to higher average FTEs and benefit costs. Nonperforming assets declined by $34 million at December 31, 2003 compared with December 31, 2002, primarily due to reductions to credits through managed liquidation and charge offs. 38 Table of Contents PNC ADVISORS Year ended December 31 Taxable equivalent basis Dollars in millions except as noted 2003 2002 INCOME STATEMENT Net interest income $ 82 $ 100 Noninterest income Investment management and trust 313 334 Brokerage 123 131 Other 97 89 Total noninterest income 533 554 Total revenue 615 654 Provision for credit losses 3 4 Noninterest expense 500 497 Pretax earnings 112 153 Income taxes 40 56 Earnings $ 72 $ 97 AVERAGE BALANCE SHEET Loans Consumer $ 1,317 $ 1,228 Residential mortgage 244 501 Commercial 438 460 Other 287 320 Total loans 2,286 2,509 Other assets 626 420 Total assets $ 2,912 $ 2,929 Deposits $ 2,122 $ 2,007 Assigned funds and other liabilities 262 399 Assigned capital 528 523 Total funds $ 2,912 $ 2,929 PERFORMANCE RATIOS Return on assigned capital 14 % 19 % Noninterest income to total revenue 87 85 Efficiency 81 76 OTHER INFORMATION Total nonperforming assets $ 11 $ 5 Brokerage assets administered (in billions) (a) $ 37 $ 32 Full service brokerage offices 98 106 Financial consultants 549 615 Margin loans $ 256 $ 260 Average FTE staff 3,093 3,351 ASSETS UNDER ADMINISTRATION (b) Assets under management Personal $ 44 $ 41 Institutional 9 9 Total $ 53 $ 50 Asset Type Equity $ 31 $ 26 Fixed income 16 17 Liquidity/other 6 7 Total $ 53 $ 50 Nondiscretionary assets under administration Personal $ 22 $ 20 Institutional 65 62 Total $ 87 $ 82 Asset Type Equity $ 30 $ 27 Fixed income 30 29 Liquidity/other 27 26 Total $ 87 $ 82 (a) Includes assets administered by brokers operating within Regional Community Banking.

The earnings decline reflected the impact of challenged equity markets in the first half of 2003, limited new client acquisition and lower taxable equivalent net interest income resulting from lower average loan balances and the level of interest rates in 2003. This business faced challenges in 2002 surrounding net asset outflows, new client acquisition, and investment performance. In 2003, PNC Advisors addressed these issues by taking steps to strengthen client relationships and position itself as an advice based provider. The business introduced managed accounts with over 20 selected investment managers in October 2003, providing clients with a broader array of investment choices. Investment performance has improved. In addition, PNC Advisors completed several cost reduction measures, including centralization of backoffice functions and realignment of resources, resulting in nearly $20 million of expense reductions on an annual basis beginning in 2004. With retention efforts yielding positive results and a streamlined cost structure, PNC Advisors is positioned to grow earnings in 2004. Highlights of 2003 for PNC Advisors follow: Assets under management at December 31, 2003 increased $3 billion compared with the balance at December 31, 2002 as the impact of improved equity markets more than offset the effect of net asset outflows during 2003. Despite modest growth in consumer loans and deposits, net interest income declined 18% due to runoff of residential mortgages and a narrower net interest margin. Investment management and trust income was down $21 million reflecting lower 2003 average equity markets, net asset outflows and a revised agreement reflecting a reduction in the rate of fees received from BlackRock. Although personal brokerage activity increased as the markets improved in the second half of 2003, brokerage revenue for 2003 declined 6% from 2002. Other revenue reflects $8 million of growth in underwriting profits. Noninterest expense increased $3 million in 2003. Apart from the one time charges in each period described below, noninterest expense remained relatively flat year over year. Charges to implement several cost reduction measures were incurred in 2003. In the fourth quarter of 2003, PNC Advisors incurred a $5 million charge related to certain employment contracts. A ruling by a National Association of Securities Dealers arbitration panel in a matter related to Hilliard Lyons hiring of brokers and support staff prior to PNCs acquisition of Hilliard Lyons in December 1998 resulted in a $10 million pretax charge at PNC Advisors in the fourth quarter of 2002, after taking into account the application of related reserves and accruals. 39 Table of Contents BLACKROCK Year ended December 31 Dollars in millions except as noted 2003 2002 INCOME STATEMENT Investment advisory and administrative fees $ 529 $ 519 Other income 69 58 Total revenue 598 577 Operating expense 337 320 Fund administration and servicing costs 33 42 Total expense 370 362 Operating income 228 215 Nonoperating income 23 9 Pretax earnings 251 224 Income taxes 96 91 Earnings $ 155 $ 133 PERIOD END BALANCE SHEET Goodwill and other intangible assets $ 192 $ 183 Other assets 775 681 Total assets $ 967 $ 864 Liabilities $ 254 $ 229 Stockholders equity 713 635 Total liabilities and stockholders equity $ 967 $ 864 PERFORMANCE DATA Return on equity 23 % 24 % Operating margin (a) 40 40 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.36 $ 2.04 OTHER INFORMATION Average FTE staff 962 894 ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT(b) Separate accounts Fixed income $ 190 $ 157 Liquidity 6 6 Liquidity securities lending 10 6 Equity 9 10 Alternative investment products 7 5 Total separate accounts 222 184 Mutual funds (c) Fixed income 24 19 Liquidity 59 66 Equity 4 4 Total mutual funds 87 89 Total assets under management $ 309 $ 273 (a) Calculated as operating income divided by total revenue less administration and servicing costs.

Fund administration and servicing costs have been excluded from the operating margin calculation because these costs are a fixed, asset based expense which can fluctuate based on the discretion of a third party. (b) December 31 in billions. (c) Includes BlackRock Funds, BlackRock Liquidity Funds, BlackRock Closed End Funds, Short Term Investment Fund and BlackRock Global Series Funds. BlackRock earned $155 million for 2003 compared with $133 million for 2002. Earnings increased for 2003 compared with the prior year as higher revenue, driven by increases in assets under management and BlackRock Solutions&reg; assignments, and higher investment income more than offset increases in marketing and other operating expenses. During 2003, BlackRock continued to operate in a global marketplace characterized by volatility and economic weakness. Management believes the following factors contributed to financial results in 2003 and position the business to continue to produce solid financial performance going forward. Assets under management at December 31, 2003 increased $36 billion, or 13%, compared with assets under management at December 31, 2002. Growth in fixed income assets managed by BlackRock was the primary factor in the increase from 2002. The increase in assets under management reflected net subscriptions of $22 billion and net market appreciation of $14 billion. Over the past five years, assets under management have grown at a compound annual rate of 19%, the majority of which was attributable to new business activity. The business ended 2003 with competitive investment performance in fixed income and liquidity products and continued to experience favorable operating leverage in these areas. The equity business was restructured with the hiring of a quantitative team to lead the U.S. large cap equity management effort. New business opportunities remain strong, particularly for international clients and in the insurance sector. Higher revenue in 2003 reflected increases in separate account base fees and other income that were partially offset by decreases in separate account performance fees earned on BlackRocks fixed income hedge fund and mutual fund revenue. BlackRock will not earn additional performance fees on the fixed income hedge fund until such time as positive investment performance exceeds the high water mark, which, assuming historical returns, could be expected to occur in the second quarter of 2004. The increase in separate account base fees resulted from strong growth in fixed income separate account assets. Expenses increased in 2003 largely due to an increase in general and administration expense that was partially offset by lower fund administration costs and lower employee compensation and benefits. During 2003, BlackRock incurred or reserved approximately $4 million to cover the estimated aggregate costs in connection with industry wide investigations of mutual fund matters. Income taxes increased 5% in 2003 compared with 2002 despite a 12% increase in pretax earnings. The effective tax rate for 2003 decreased due to a decision that BlackRock will file certain combined and unitary state income tax returns with other PNC subsidiaries. BlackRock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BLK. Additional information about BlackRock is available in its SEC filings at www.sec.gov and on BlackRocks website at www.blackrock.com. 40 Table of Contents PFPC Year ended December 31 Dollars in millions except as noted 2003 2002 INCOME STATEMENT Fund servicing revenue $ 762 $ 817 Operating expense 618 650 (Accretion)/amortization of other intangibles, net (18 ) (19 ) Net operating income 162 186 Nonoperating income (a) 8 10 Debt financing 69 88 Pretax earnings 101 108 Income taxes 40 43 Earnings $ 61 $ 65 AVERAGE BALANCE SHEET Goodwill and other intangible assets $ 1,037 $ 1,028 Other assets 872 860 Total assets $ 1,909 $ 1,888 Debt financing $ 1,279 $ 1,290 Assigned funds and other liabilities 422 390 Assigned capital 208 208 Total funds $ 1,909 $ 1,888 PERFORMANCE RATIOS Return on assigned capital 29 % 31 % Operating margin 21 23 OTHER INFORMATION Average FTE staff 5,081 5,834 SERVICING STATISTICS Accounting/administration net assets (b) Domestic $ 622 $ 481 Foreign (c) 45 29 Total $ 667 $ 510 Asset type Money market $ 341 $ 297 Equity 193 118 Fixed income 92 72 Other 41 23 Total $ 667 $ 510 Custody assets (b) $ 401 $ 336 Shareholder accounts (in millions) Transfer agency 21 26 Subaccounting 32 25 Total 53 51 (a) Net of nonoperating expense.

PFPCs 2002 results included the benefits of a $19 million, or $11 million after taxes, reduction in reserves, originally established in 2001 largely related to a previously reported plan to consolidate selected facilities, and $13 million, or $8 million after taxes, of fees related to the renegotiation of a client contract. Apart from these items, earnings for 2002 would have been $46 million. Highlights of 2003 for PFPC follow: PFPC continued to streamline operations throughout 2003, repositioning itself given current economic and competitive conditions. The sales process was re engineered, greatly enhancing focus along product line expertise. PFPC greatly expanded its managed account servicing offering through ADVISORport. The accounting/administration unit realized several major wins in 2003 and benefited from a renewed equity market, resulting in a 31% increase in assets serviced since year end 2002. Headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, PFPCs offshore operation continued to experience significant growth, as assets serviced increased more than 50% compared with the prior year. Related to debt financing provided by PNC, PFPC made payments to PNC totaling $196 million during 2003, of which $125 million represented the repayment of principal effective December 1, 2003. Apart from the items described in the first paragraph, improved operating results in 2003 compared with 2002 reflected a decline in operating expenses, primarily due to benefits from efficiency initiatives exceeding $50 million and a decrease of approximately $31 million of expenses related to the retirement services unit that was sold effective June 30, 2003. In addition, results for 2003 were favorably impacted by a $19 million decrease in debt financing costs due to debt refinancing at more favorable rates in December 2002. The effect of these factors was partially offset by lower fund servicing revenue, partly due to the impact of competitive market conditions on pricing, and costs incurred to support net new business in 2003. Fund servicing revenue decreased $55 million in 2003 compared with 2002. The positive impact of new sales of accounting/administration services and offshore growth was more than offset by revenue declines resulting from client attrition and the impact of competitive market conditions on pricing. In addition, fund servicing revenue for 2002 included the benefit of $13 million of fees related to the renegotiation of a client contract referred to above and an additional $15 million related to the retirement services unit that was sold in 2003. Operating expense decreased $32 million, or 5%, in 2003 compared with the prior year. Operating expense for 2002 reflected the benefit of a $19 million reduction in reserves described above. The decline in operating expenses compared with 2002 was primarily due to reductions in staff and contract programmers, the impact of the sale of the retirement services business and the initiatives launched in the second half of 2002 designed to improve efficiency. In 2003, PFPC reduced expenses by over $50 million before considering the impact of technology and new business reinvestment. Accordingly, the workforce has been reduced as average FTEs declined 13% in 2003 compared with 2002. Net operating income for 2003 reflected $33 million in accretion of a discounted client contract liability. Accretion for 2002 was $35 million. The benefit of accretion related to this contract liability is expected to decrease significantly in 2004 as the underlying contract matures during the second quarter of 2004. PFPCs performance is partially dependent on the underlying performance of its fund clients and, in particular, their ability to attract and retain customers. As a result, to the extent that its clients businesses are adversely affected by ongoing governmental investigations into the practices of the mutual and hedge fund industries, PFPCs results could be impacted. Increases in both accounting/administration and custody investment assets at December 31, 2003 compared with the balances at December 31, 2002 resulted primarily from new business, asset inflows from existing clients and positive equity market performance during 2003. The decline in 2003 in transfer agency accounts serviced by PFPC was primarily due to a loss of one large client in the first quarter. Subaccounting shareholder accounts serviced by PFPC increased in 2003 primarily due to net new business and growth in existing client accounts. Total assets serviced by PFPC amounted to $1.6 trillion at December 31, 2003 compared with $1.4 trillion at December 31, 2002. 41 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS The Corporation is subject to a number of risks potentially impacting its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition to the risks described in other parts of this Report, including the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 and in the Risk Management and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information sections of this Item 7, the following are key risk factors affecting the Corporation. BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS The Corporations business and results of operations are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States. These conditions include the level and movement of interest rates, inflation, monetary supply, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, and the strength of the U.S. economy, in general, and the regional economies in which the Corporation conducts business. A sustained weakness or weakening of the economy could decrease the value of loans held for sale, decrease the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the Corporation, increase or decrease usage of unfunded commitments or increase the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to the Corporation. An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets, net charge offs, provision for credit losses, and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale. Changes in interest rates could affect the value of certain on balance sheet and off balance sheet financial instruments of the Corporation. Changes in interest rates could also affect the value of assets under management or for which processing services are provided. In a period of rapidly rising interest rates, such assets would likely be negatively impacted by reduced asset values and increased redemptions. Also, changes in equity markets could affect the value of equity investments and the value of net assets under management and for which processing services are provided. A more detailed description of aspects of the interest rate and market risks facing PNC is included in the Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report. MONETARY AND OTHER POLICIES The activities and results of operations of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries are affected by monetary, tax and other policies of the government and its agencies, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board). An important function of the Federal Reserve Board is to regulate the national supply of bank credit. The Federal Reserve Board employs open market operations in U.S. Government securities, changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements on bank deposits to implement its monetary policy objectives. These instruments of monetary policy are used in varying combinations to influence the overall level of bank loans, investments and deposits, the interest rates charged on loans and paid for deposits, the price of the dollar in foreign exchange markets and the level of inflation. The Federal Reserve Boards policies influence the rates of interest that PNC charges on loans and pays on borrowings and interest bearing deposits and can also affect the value of on balance sheet and off balance sheet financial instruments. Those policies also influence, to a significant extent, the cost of funding for the Corporation. It is not possible to predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, tax and other policies or the effect that they may have on the Corporations activities and results of operations. COMPETITION PNC operates in a highly competitive environment, both in terms of the products and services offered and the geographic markets in which PNC conducts business. This environment could become even more competitive in the future, as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation in the financial services industry. The Corporation competes with local, regional and national banks, thrifts, credit unions and non bank financial institutions, such as investment banking firms, investment advisory firms, brokerage firms, investment companies, private equity firms, mutual fund complexes and insurance companies, as well as other entities that offer financial and processing services, and through alternative delivery channels such as the internet. Technological advances and legislation, among other changes, have lowered barriers to entry, have made it possible for non bank institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks, and have increased the level of competition faced by the Corporation. Many of the Corporations competitors benefit from fewer regulatory constraints and lower cost structures, allowing for more competitive pricing of products and services. As a result, PNC could lose business to competitors or be forced to price its products and services on less advantageous terms to retain customers. DISINTERMEDIATION Disintermediation is the process of eliminating the role of the intermediary in completing a transaction. For the financial services industry, this means eliminating or significantly reducing the role of banks and other depository institutions in completing transactions that have traditionally involved banks. Disintermediation could result in, among other things, the loss of customer deposits and decreases in transactions that generate fee income. ASSET MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE Asset management revenue is primarily based on a percentage of the value of assets under management and performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on assets under management. A decline in the value of debt and equity instruments, among other things, could cause asset management revenue to decline. Investment performance is an important factor for the level of assets under management. Poor investment performance could impair revenue and growth as existing clients might withdraw funds in favor of better performing products. Also, performance fees could be lower or nonexistent. Additionally, the ability to attract funds from existing and new clients might diminish. 42 Table of Contents FUND SERVICING Fund servicing fees are primarily derived from the market value of the assets and the number of shareholder accounts administered by the Corporation for its clients. A rise in interest rates or a sustained weakness, weakening or volatility in the debt and equity markets could influence an investors decision to invest or maintain an investment in a mutual fund or other pooled investment product. As a result, fluctuations may occur in the level or value of assets for which PNC provides processing services. A significant investor migration from mutual fund and other pooled investments could have a negative impact on the Corporations revenues by reducing the assets and the number of shareholder accounts it services. The fund servicing business is also highly competitive with a relatively small number of providers. There has been and continues to be merger, acquisition and consolidation activity in the financial services industry. In the future, mergers or consolidations of financial institutions or other financial intermediaries could impact the number of existing or potential fund servicing clients. ACQUISITIONS The Corporation expands its business from time to time by acquiring other financial services companies. Factors pertaining to acquisitions that could adversely affect the Corporations business and earnings include, among others: anticipated cost savings or potential revenue enhancements that may not be fully realized or realized within the expected time frame; key employee, customer or revenue loss following an acquisition that may be greater than expected; and costs or difficulties related to the integration of acquired businesses that may be greater than expected. The Corporation could also be prevented from pursuing attractive acquisition opportunities due to regulatory restraints. See the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information section in Item 7 of this Report for additional information regarding risk factors in connection with the United National acquisition in particular and acquisitions in general. TERRORIST ACTIVITIES AND INTERNATIONAL HOSTILITIES The impact of terrorist activities and responses to such activities and of international hostilities cannot be predicted with respect to severity or duration, but may adversely affect the economy and financial and capital markets generally, or specific industries and the Corporation specifically. The impact could adversely affect the Corporation in a number of ways including, among others, an increase in delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults that could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets, net charge offs and provision for credit losses. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND JUDGMENTS The Corporations consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of certain accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Certain of these policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or be subject to variations which may significantly affect PNCs reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods. The use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary when financial assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in more financial statement volatility. Fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on either quoted market prices or are provided by other independent third party sources, when available. When such information is not available, management estimates valuation adjustments primarily by using internal cash flow and other financial modeling techniques. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on PNCs future financial condition and results of operations. ALLOWANCES FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT The allowances for credit losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit are calculated with the objective of maintaining reserve levels believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable credit losses. Managements determination of the adequacy of the allowances is based on periodic evaluations of the credit portfolio and other relevant factors. However, this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates, including, among others, expected default probabilities, loss given default, exposure at default, the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, value of collateral, estimated losses on consumer loans and residential mortgages, and general amounts for historical loss experience. The process also considers economic conditions, uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the various credit portfolios. All of these factors may be susceptible to significant change. Also, the allocation of the allowance for credit losses to specific loan pools is based on historical loss trends and managements judgment concerning those trends. Commercial loans are the largest category of credits and are the most sensitive to changes in assumptions and judgments underlying the determination of the allowance for credit losses. Approximately $514 million, or 81%, of the total allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2003 has been allocated to the commercial loan category. This allocation also considers other relevant factors such as actual versus estimated losses, regional and national economic conditions, business segment and portfolio concentrations, industry competition and consolidation, the impact of government regulations, and risk of potential estimation or judgmental errors. To the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates, additional provision for credit losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods. See the following for additional information: Allowances For Credit Losses And Unfunded Loan Commitments And Letters Of Credit in the Credit Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report; and Note 1 43 Table of Contents Accounting Policies, Note 14 Allowances For Credit Losses And Unfunded Loan Commitments And Letters of Credit, and Allocation Of Allowance For Credit Losses in the Statistical Information section of Item 8 of this Report. LOANS AND COMMITMENTS HELD FOR SALE At the time management intends to sell credit exposure, management designates the exposure as held for sale. At the initial transfer date to held for sale, any lower of cost or market (LOCOM) adjustment is recorded as a charge off, which on an outstanding loan results in a new cost basis. On the unfunded portion of the total exposure, a liability is established. Any subsequent adjustment as a result of LOCOM is recorded as a valuation allowance through noninterest income on the loan portion classified as held for sale. Any permanent reduction of the exposure, such as sale or termination of the exposure, may have a positive or negative impact on the exposures valuation allowance or liability. This change in valuation allowance or liability is recorded through noninterest income. Although the market value for certain held for sale assets may be readily obtainable, the majority of these types of assets require significant judgments by management as to the value that could be realized at the balance sheet date. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the cash flows generated from the asset, the timing of a sale, the value of any collateral, the market conditions for the particular credit, overall investor demand for these assets and the determination of a proper discount rate. Changes in market conditions and actual liquidation experience may result in additional valuation adjustments that could adversely impact earnings in future periods. See the Loans and Loans Held For Sale sections of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review included in Item 7 of this Report and Note 1 Accounting Policies included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. EQUITY MANAGEMENT ASSET VALUATION Equity management (private equity) assets are valued at each balance sheet date based on primarily either, in the case of limited partnership investments, the financial statements received from the general partner or, with respect to direct investments, the estimated fair value of the investments. There is a time lag in the Corporations receipt of the financial information that is the primary basis for the valuation of its limited partnership interests. PNC will recognize in the first quarter of 2004 valuation changes related to limited partnership investments that reflect the impact of fourth quarter 2003 market conditions and performance of the underlying companies. Due to the nature of the direct investments, management must make assumptions as to future performance, financial condition, liquidity, availability of capital, and market conditions, among others, to determine the estimated fair value of the investments. The valuation procedures applied to direct investments include techniques such as multiple of cash flow of the entity, independent appraisals of the entity or the pricing used to value the entity in a recent financial transaction. General partnership interests are valued based on the underlying investments of the partnership utilizing procedures consistent with those applied to direct investments. Changes in the value of equity management investments are reflected in the Corporations results of operations. Market conditions and actual performance of the companies invested in could differ from these assumptions resulting in lower valuations that could adversely impact earnings in future periods. Accordingly, the valuations may not represent amounts that will ultimately be realized from these investments. See Note 1 Accounting Policies in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS Commercial mortgage servicing rights (MSR) are intangible assets that represent the value of rights that arise from the servicing of commercial loan contracts. While servicing is inherent in most financial assets, it becomes a distinct asset when (a) contractually separated from the underlying financial asset by sale or securitization of the asset with servicing retained or (b) through the separate purchase and assumption of the servicing. The Corporations MSR asset value (both originated and purchased) arises from estimates of future revenues from contractually specified servicing fees, interest income and other ancillary revenues, net of estimated operating expenses, which are expected to yield an acceptable level of risk adjusted return for the servicer. The fair value of the Corporations MSR asset is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology, which calculates the net present value of future cash flows of the servicing portfolio over the estimated life of the asset based on various assumptions and market factors, the most significant of which include interest rates for escrow and deposit balance earnings, estimated prepayment speeds, estimated servicing costs, portfolio stratification, and discount rates. The reasonableness of these factors is reviewed by management and is based on expectations of the portfolio, market conditions, and loan characteristics. The Corporations commercial loan servicing portfolio is subject to various risks, the most significant being interest rate and prepayment risk, which subject the MSR asset to impairment risk. While the MSR asset is amortized over its estimated life in proportion to estimated net servicing income, it is also tested for impairment at a strata level on a quarterly basis. The impairment testing includes a positive and negative scenario for sensitivity characteristics. If the estimated fair value of the MSR is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss would be recognized in the current period; however, any fair value in excess of the cost basis would not be recognized as income. See Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 17 Securitizations included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. LEASE RESIDUALS Leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments and the estimated residual value of the leased property, less unearned income. The Corporation provides financing for various types of equipment, aircraft, energy and power systems, rolling stock and vehicles through a variety of lease arrangements. A significant portion of the residual value is covered by residual value insurance and or operating reserves or is guaranteed by governmental entities. Residual values are subject to judgments as to the value of the underlying equipment that can be affected by changes in economic and market conditions and the financial viability of the residual guarantors and insurers. To the extent not guaranteed or assumed by a third party, or otherwise reserved or insured against, the Corporation bears the risk of ownership of the leased assets including the risk that the actual value of the leased assets at the end of the lease term will be less than the residual value which could result in a charge and adversely impact earnings in future periods. See Note 1 Accounting Policies included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. 44 Table of Contents GOODWILL Goodwill arising from business acquisitions represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired. The majority of the Corporations goodwill relates to value inherent in fund servicing and banking businesses. The value of this goodwill is dependent upon the Corporations ability to provide quality, cost effective services in the face of competition from other market leaders on a national and global basis. This ability in turn relies upon continuing investments in processing systems, the development of value added service features, and the ease of access to the Corporations services. As such, goodwill value is supported ultimately by earnings, which is driven by the volume of business transacted and, for certain businesses, the market value of assets under administration or for which processing services are provided. A decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the Corporations inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill, which could result in a charge and adversely impact earnings in future periods. Total goodwill was $2.4 billion at December 31, 2003. See Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 15 Goodwill And Other Intangible Assets included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. REVENUE RECOGNITION PNC derives interest and noninterest income from various sources including lending, investment management and fund servicing, customer deposits, loan servicing, brokerage services, sale of loans, certain private equity activities and derivatives trading activities. Fees and commissions are also earned from issuing loan commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, selling various insurance products, providing treasury management services and participating in certain capital market transactions. The timing and amount of revenue recognized in any period is dependent on estimates, judgments, assumptions, and interpretation of contractual terms. Changes in these factors can have a significant impact on revenue recognized in any period due to changes in products, market conditions or industry norms. STATUS OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN The Corporation has a noncontributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan (plan or pension plan) covering most employees. Retirement benefits are derived from a cash balance formula based on compensation levels, age and length of service. Pension contributions are based on an actuarially determined amount necessary to fund total benefits payable to plan participants. Plan assets are currently approximately 60% invested in equity investments with most of the remainder invested in fixed income instruments. Plan investment policy is determined and reviewed by plan fiduciaries. On an annual basis, management reviews the actuarial assumptions related to the pension plan, including the discount rate, rate of compensation increase and the expected return on plan assets. The expense associated with the pension plan is calculated in accordance with SFAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and utilizes assumptions and methods determined in accordance therewith, including a policy of reflecting trust assets at their fair market value. The expense is not significantly affected by the discount rate or compensation increase assumptions, but is significantly affected by the expected return on asset assumption, which was changed from 9.50% to 8.50% for 2003, causing expense to increase by approximately $10 million. The expense is also significantly affected by actual trust returns, with each one percentage point difference in actual return versus the expectation causing the following years expense to change by as much as $3 million. Management currently estimates 2004 expense for the pension plan to be approximately $10 million, compared with $50 million for 2003. Lower amortization of actuarial losses from prior years due to improved returns on trust assets in 2003 is the primary reason for the expected decrease in pension expense in 2004. In accordance with SFAS 87 and SFAS 132 (Revised 2003), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, the Corporation may be required to eliminate any prepaid pension asset and recognize a minimum pension liability if the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets at year end. The corresponding charge would be recognized as a component of other comprehensive income and reduce total shareholders equity, but would not impact net income. At December 31, 2003, the fair value of plan assets was $1.352 billion, which exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation of $973 million. The status at year end 2004 will depend primarily upon 2004 trust returns and the level of contributions, if any, made to the plan by the Corporation during 2004. Contribution requirements are primarily affected by trust investment performance and are not particularly sensitive to actuarial assumptions. Although there were no required contributions to the pension plan during 2002 or 2003, the Corporation continued its strategy of fully funding the plan at maximum tax deductible levels, contributing $183 million in 2003 and $210 million in 2002. If future investment performance exceeds that of recent years, the permitted tax deductible contribution in future years will be significantly reduced. In any case and irrespective of any factors, any large near term contributions to the plan will be at the discretion of management as the minimum required contributions under current law are expected to be zero for several years. BLACKROCK LONG TERM RETENTION AND INCENTIVE PLAN BlackRocks long term retention and incentive plan (LTIP) permits the grant of up to $240 million in deferred compensation awards (the LTIP Awards), subject to the achievement of certain performance hurdles by BlackRock no later than March 2007. The Compensation Committee of BlackRocks Board of Directors may vest a portion of the LTIP Awards, in its sole discretion, if BlackRock achieves certain alternative performance hurdles during the vesting period. 45 Table of Contents There will be no expense recognition associated with the LTIP Awards unless vesting occurs or a partial vesting determination is considered probable and estimable. BlackRocks Compensation and Audit Committees have determined, based on current conditions, that the probability of indicating any partial vesting prior to the opportunity for commencement of full vesting of the program at the conclusion of the first quarter of 2005 is unlikely. The LTIP was constructed such that the expected increase in value to stockholders necessary to fully vest the program had to result from continued growth in BlackRocks earnings rather than from changes in the financial markets. As such, a minimum performance period (through December 31, 2004) was established under which no vesting of the program would occur. At such time, the Compensation and Audit Committees will evaluate the likelihood that BlackRock will complete the program term with alternative vesting criteria performance in excess of LTIP requirements. BlackRock will accrue expense for this contingency accordingly. If the performance hurdles are achieved, the LTIP Awards will be funded with up to 4 million shares of BlackRock common stock to be surrendered by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants, less income tax withholding. In addition, distributed shares to LTIP participants will include an option to put such distributed shares back to BlackRock at fair market value. BlackRock will fund the remainder of the LTIP Awards with up to $40 million in cash. See Note 24 Stock Based Compensation Plans for additional information. RISK MANAGEMENT The Corporation encounters risk as part of the normal course of its business and designs risk management processes to help manage these risks. This section will first provide an overview of the governance structure, measurement, control strategies, and monitoring aspects of the Corporations corporate level risk management processes generally. Following this discussion is an analysis of the same aspects of the risk management process for what management views as the Corporations primary areas of risk: credit, operational, liquidity, and market. The Corporations use of financial and other derivatives as part of its overall asset and liability risk management process is also addressed within the Risk Management section of this report. In appropriate places within this section, historical performance is also addressed. OVERVIEW As a financial services organization, the Corporation takes a certain amount of risk in every business decision. For example, every time the Corporation opens an account or approves a loan for a customer, processes a payment, hires a new employee, or implements a new computer system, the Corporation incurs a certain amount of risk. As an organization, the Corporation must balance revenue generation and profitability with the risks associated with its business activities. Risk management is not about eliminating risks, but about accepting risks that are expected to optimize shareholder value and that the Corporation seeks to effectively manage. The key to effective risk management is to be proactive in seeking to identify, measure, control, and monitor risk on an ongoing basis. Risk management practices support decision making, improve the success rate for new initiatives, and strengthen the organization. CORPORATE LEVEL RISK MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW Governance Structure Risk management is supported through a governance structure at the Board and management level, and through a risk organization structure at both the corporate and business unit level. These structures are designed to provide active and effective management of risks. Although the Board as a whole is responsible generally for oversight of risk management, committees of the Board provide oversight to specific areas of risk with respect to the level of risk and risk management structure. The Board committees with primary responsibility for risk management oversight are as follows: Audit Committee: major financial risk exposures, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, internal and disclosure controls, and the Corporations Code of Business Conduct and Ethics Credit Committee: risk within the Corporations lending and credit related activities Finance Committee: the risk management process and internal control structure relating to interest rate and liquidity risks, trading activities, capital management activities, equity investments, and fiduciary activities Operations and Technology Committee: operations and operational risk management, and activities related to information technology and information security Nominating and Governance Committee: recommendation of nominees for the Corporations Board and implementation of appropriate corporate governance practices Management level risk committees are designed to help ensure that business decisions are executed within the Boards desired risk profile. The Executive Risk Management Committee (ERMC), consisting of senior management executives, provides oversight for the establishment and implementation of new comprehensive risk management initiatives, reviews risk profiles and discusses key risk issues. There are several other management level risk management committees charged with various risk management oversight responsibilities. Within each of the Corporations major businesses, a business risk officer serves an important role by helping the business to identify risks and develop action plans to manage those risks. By acting as partners to business managers and corporate risk officers, business risk officers help ensure that strategic business goals, including acceptable levels of risk, are achieved. 46 Table of Contents The following tables outline the three primary corporate level risk management areas: Area Risk Management Executive Chief Risk Officer Key roles of corporate team Facilitates the identification, assessment and monitoring of risk across the Corporation Sets risk tolerance limits Has authority to review and challenge all risk taking activities Provides support and oversight to the businesses Identifies and implements risk management best practices Area Regulatory Relations and Compliance Executives Chief Regulatory Officer Chief Compliance Officer Key roles of corporate team Facilitates the identification, assessment and monitoring of regulatory and compliance risk throughout the Corporation Facilitates relationships with regulatory agencies and serves as liaison to the businesses Provides compliance support and oversight at the corporate level and to the businesses Administers the Corporations ethics and business conduct programs Area Legal Executives Vice Chairman, Legal and Governance General Counsel Key roles of corporate team Facilitates the identification, assessment, and monitoring of legal risk throughout the Corporation Provides legal counsel to the Corporation and across all businesses and staff areas Each corporate risk management area is empowered and actively involved in risk identification, measurement, control and monitoring across the Corporation. Risk Measurement Risk measurement activities are conducted specific to the area of risk. Corporate risk management is involved in the development of models and analytic tools to evaluate the level of risk, providing a holistic approach to aggregating and understanding enterprise wide risk. The primary vehicle for aggregation of enterprise wide risk is a new comprehensive risk management methodology developed during 2003 that is based on economic capital. This primary risk aggregation measure is augmented with secondary measures of risk to arrive at an estimate of enterprise wide risk. The economic capital framework is a measure of potential losses above and beyond expected losses. Potential one year losses are capitalized to a level commensurate with a financial institution with an A rating by the credit rating agencies. Economic capital incorporates risk associated with potential credit losses (Credit Risk), fluctuations of the estimated market value of financial instruments (Market Risk) and other risks such as the failure of people, processes or systems (Operational Risk). Management has not previously used economic capital in evaluating the performance of its business segments, and this methodology has not been used in the calculation of return on assigned capital for 2003 or 2002 business segment performance as disclosed in the Review of Businesses section of Item 7 of this Report. Management plans to use economic capital to evaluate each of the Corporations business segments performance in 2004. Risk Control Strategies Policy development and exception oversight is centrally managed through corporate level risk management. Corporate risk management is authorized to take action to either prevent or mitigate exceptions to policies and is responsible for monitoring compliance with risk management policies. The Corporate Audit function performs an independent analysis of the internal control environment. Corporate Audit plays a critical role in risk management, testing the operation of the internal control system and reporting findings to management and to the Audit Committee. The Corporation uses a review process for significant new initiatives which requires the preparation of a business case, including a risk analysis, for review by an appropriate risk management committee. Risk Monitoring Corporate risk management reports on a regular basis to the Board regarding the enterprise risk profile of the Corporation. These reports aggregate and present the level of risk by type of risk and communicate significant risk issues, including performance relative to risk tolerance limits. Both the Board and the ERMC provide guidance on actions to address key risk issues as identified in these reports. CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT Credit risk represents the possibility that a customer, counterparty or issuer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms. Credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from extending credit to customers, purchasing securities and entering into financial derivative transactions. Credit risk is one of the most common risks in banking and one of the most significant risks to PNC. Approved risk tolerances, in addition to credit policies and procedures, set portfolio objectives for the level of credit risk. Guidelines have been established for acceptable levels of aggregate borrower exposure, problem loans and other credit measures. The Corporation seeks to achieve credit portfolio objectives by maintaining a customer base that is diverse in borrower exposure and industry. Reductions in risk concentrations are achieved through loan participations with third parties, loan sales and the purchase of credit derivatives. Governance Structure The credit granting businesses maintain direct responsibility for credit risk within the Corporation. The Corporate Credit Policy area provides independent oversight to the measurement, monitoring and reporting of the Corporations credit risk and reports to the Chief Risk Officer. Corporate 47 Table of Contents Credit Policy is responsible for establishing risk management policies as they relate to credit objectives and limits. Significant changes are reviewed with and approved by the Credit Committee of the Board. Centrally, Corporate Credit Policy monitors compliance with policies and commercial customer covenant compliance. Corporate Credit Policy is involved in the review of commercial loans and provides oversight to the underwriting standards for consumer lending activities. Credit account management staff report up through the Corporate Credit Policy organization and perform relationship transactional analysis and administration. The Credit Risk Management Committee (CRMC) develops portfolio credit risk objectives and determines the appropriateness of portfolio limits and guidelines. CRMC reviews the Corporations exposure to certain industries and portfolios, monitoring emerging concentrations. Corporate Credit Policy oversees the role of portfolio management. The portfolio management function supports the development of portfolio risk limits to achieve associated objectives and is responsible for initiating secondary market activities to help optimize portfolio composition. The Special Asset Committee (SAC) is the management committee charged with the responsibility of reviewing all criticized credits throughout the Corporation in excess of a set dollar threshold. Additionally, SAC sets the standards for business level committees for reviewing all criticized credits below the corporate exposure threshold. SAC meets regularly and sets specific reserve levels for nonperforming loans and evaluates the risk rating and disclosure status for reviewed credits. The Reserve Adequacy Committee (RAC) reviews the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses for business units and major bank subsidiaries. RAC provides oversight for the allowance evaluation process, including quarterly evaluations as well as methodology and estimation changes. The results of the evaluations are reported to the Credit Committee of the Board. Risk Measurement The Corporation actively measures sources of credit risk based on the calculated expected and unexpected losses in the portfolio. Expected loss is a component in calculating the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses. See the Allowances For Credit Losses And Unfunded Commitments And Letters Of Credit portion of this Credit Risk Management discussion. Unexpected loss seeks to capture the loss volatility in the portfolio and is the foundation for economic capital measurement at the business level. Stress testing and scenario analyses are performed regularly, providing guidance to management on the potential impact of macroeconomic events on the level of credit risk. Loan evaluation tools are used to assess credit quality at origination and to identify deteriorating borrower credit quality. They are employed to actively manage and reduce exposures as warranted. These loan evaluation tools have been developed internally as well as purchased from external vendors. Loan evaluation tool policies are established and usage monitored by Corporate Credit Policy. Risk Control Strategies Corporate Credit Policy monitors policy compliance and communicates exceptions to management on a monthly basis and to the Credit Committee of the Board quarterly. PNC has established credit portfolio risk tolerance and concentration limits, both at the corporate level and by individual lending business. Corporate Credit Policy evaluates compliance with risk tolerance and concentration limits quarterly and oversees appropriate adjustment of portfolio strategies to remain or move within an acceptable range of risk, balanced by the strategic objectives of the Corporation. Critical to the measurement of commercial credit risk is the accuracy of internal risk ratings in the commercial loan portfolio. Corporate Credit Policy reviews and if necessary adjusts risk ratings at the time of approval. If a credit relationship deteriorates and becomes a criticized credit, it is reviewed through the SAC process. Additionally, an independent Credit Risk Review function, reporting directly to the Credit Committee of the Board and indirectly to the Chief Risk Officer, performs regular analyses of the quality of credit risk management and level of credit risk. Risk Monitoring On a quarterly basis, Corporate Credit Policy reports on credit risk to the Credit Committee of the Board. Policy exceptions and compliance with portfolio limits are included within the report. Additionally, Credit Risk Review provides an independent assessment of the credit risk profile and the findings from targeted reviews. Each primary credit granting business presents a report on the current trends, key risk factors and credit strategy of the business to the Credit Committee of the Board. Senior credit management receives management level portfolio reports that include current trends within the business. The reports contain detailed information on exposure concentrations across portfolio segments. 48 Table of Contents Nonperforming, Past Due And Potential Problem Assets Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructurings, nonaccrual loans held for sale and foreclosed and other assets. In addition, certain performing assets have interest payments that are past due or have the potential for future repayment problems. Nonperforming Assets By Type Dollars in millions December 312003 December 312002 Nonaccrual loans Commercial $ 213 $ 226 Lease financing 11 57 Commercial real estate 6 7 Consumer 11 11 Residential mortgage 24 7 Total nonaccrual loans 265 308 Troubled debt restructured loan 1 1 Total nonperforming loans 266 309 Nonperforming loans held for sale (a) 27 97 Foreclosed and other assets Lease 17 Residential mortgage 9 6 Other 9 6 Total foreclosed and other assets 35 12 Total nonperforming assets (b) $ 328 $ 418 Nonperforming loans to total loans .78 % .87 % Nonperforming assets to total loans, loans held for sale and foreclosed and other assets .92 1.13 Nonperforming assets to total assets .48 .63 (a) Includes troubled debt restructured loans held for sale of $10 million and $17 million as of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. (b) Excludes equity management assets carried at estimated fair value of $37 million and $40 million at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively, and included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These amounts include $5 million and $12 million of troubled debt restructured assets at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. Of the total nonperforming loans at December 31, 2003, 39% are related to PNC Business Credit. PNC Business Credit loans, including those acquired in the NBOC acquisition, are primarily secured loans to borrowers, many of whom are highly leveraged, experiencing rapid growth, or who have elected to utilize asset based financing. As a result, the risk profile of these loans typically reflects a higher risk of default and a greater proportion are classified as nonperforming. Historically, the Corporation has found that the collateralized nature of asset based financing has resulted in lower losses relative to comparable commercial loans within the loan portfolio. During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Corporation accelerated the timeframe for recognizing delinquent, well secured residential mortgage loans as nonperforming. This change resulted in the classification of an additional $15 million of residential mortgages as nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2003. The decline in nonperforming loans held for sale at December 31, 2003 compared with December 31, 2002 reflected reductions in principal balances and sales of nonperforming loans during 2003. The foreclosed lease assets at December 31, 2003 primarily represented the Corporations repossession of collateral related to a single airline industry credit during the second quarter of 2003 that was previously classified as a nonaccrual loan. The amount of nonperforming loans that were current as to principal and interest was $116 million at December 31, 2003 and $107 million at December 31, 2002. The amount of nonperforming loans held for sale that were current as to principal and interest was $4 million at December 31, 2003 and $46 million at December 31, 2002.

Approximately 67% of these loans are in the PNC Business Credit portfolio. Loans held for sale relate to the institutional lending repositioning. Allowances For Credit Losses And Unfunded Loan Commitments And Letters Of Credit The Corporation maintains an allowance for credit losses to absorb losses from the loan portfolio. The allowance is determined based on quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The methodology for measuring the appropriate level of the allowance consists of several elements, including specific allocations to impaired loans, allocations to pools of non impaired loans and unallocated reserves. While allocations are made to specific loans and pools of loans, the total reserve is available for all loan losses. In addition to the allowance for credit losses, the Corporation maintains an allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. This amount, reported as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, is determined using estimates of the probability of the ultimate funding and losses related to those credit exposures. The methodology used is similar to the methodology used for determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. Specific allowances are established for loans considered impaired by a method prescribed by SFAS 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan. All nonperforming loans are considered impaired under SFAS 114. Specific allowances are determined for individual loans over a set dollar threshold by SAC based on an analysis of the present value of its expected future cash flows discounted at its effective interest rate, its observable market price or the fair value of the underlying collateral. A minimum specific allowance is established on all impaired loans at the applicable pool reserve allocation for similar loans. Allocations to non impaired commercial and commercial real estate loans (pool reserve allocations) are assigned to pools of loans as defined by PNCs business structure and internal risk rating categories. Key elements of the pool reserve methodology include expected default probabilities (EDP), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD). EDPs are derived from historical default analyses and are a function of the borrowers risk rating grade and expected loan term. LGDs are derived from historical loss data and are a function of the loans collateral value and other structural factors that may affect the ultimate ability to collect on the loan. EADs are derived from banking industry and PNCs own exposure at default data. This methodology is sensitive to changes in key risk parameters such as EDPs, LGDs and EADs. In general, a given change in any of the major risk parameters will have a commensurate change in the pool reserve allocations to non impaired commercial loans. Additionally, other factors such as the rate of migration in the severity of problem loans or changes in the maturity distribution of the loans will contribute to the final pool reserve allocations. Consumer (including residential mortgage) loan allocations are made at a total portfolio level by consumer product line based on historical loss experience. A four quarter average loss rate is computed from net charge offs for the prior four quarters as a percentage of the average loans outstanding in those quarters. This loss rate is applied to loans outstanding at the end of the current period to set the consumer loan allocation. The final loan reserve allocations are based on this methodology and managements judgment of other qualitative factors which may include, among others, regional and national economic conditions, business segment and portfolio concentrations, historical versus estimated losses, model risk and changes to the level of credit risk in the portfolio. Unallocated reserves are established to provide coverage for probable losses not considered in the specific, pool and consumer reserve methodologies, such as, but not limited to, potential judgment and data errors. Furthermore, events may have occurred as of the reserve evaluation date that are not yet reflected in the risk measures or characteristics of the portfolio due to inherent lags in information. Managements evaluation of these and other relevant factors determines the level of unallocated reserves established at the evaluation date. 50 Table of Contents Allocation Of Allowance For Credit Losses December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 Dollars in millions Allowance Loans toTotalLoans Allowance Loans toTotalLoans Commercial $ 514 41.6 % $ 504 42.3 % Commercial real estate 34 5.3 52 6.4 Consumer 28 33.5 28 27.8 Residential mortgage 7 8.5 10 11.0 Lease financing and other 49 11.1 79 12.5 Total $ 632 100.0 % $ 673 100.0 % For purposes of this presentation, the unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses of $116 million at December 31, 2003 and $112 million at December 31, 2002 has been assigned to loan categories based on the relative specific and pool allocation amounts. The unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses represented 18% of the total allowance and .34% of total loans at December 31, 2003 and 17% of the total allowance and .32% of total loans at December 31, 2002. The provision for credit losses for 2003 and the evaluation of the allowances for credit losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit as of December 31, 2003 reflected changes in loan portfolio composition, the impact of refinements to the Corporations reserve methodology and changes in asset quality. The provision includes amounts for probable losses on loans and credit exposure related to unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit.

The decrease was primarily due to the impact of $90 million of charge offs in 2002 related to Market Street that more than offset the impact of two significant charge offs in 2003. Net charge offs for 2003 included $42 million related to a single PNC Business Credit loan to a wholesale goods/retail customer and $26 million related to a single airline industry credit for which a substantial reserve had been provided at December 31, 2002. CREDIT RELATED INSTRUMENTS Credit Default Swaps Credit default swaps provide, for a fee, an assumption of a portion of the credit risk associated with the underlying financial instruments. The Corporation primarily uses such contracts to mitigate credit risk associated with commercial lending activities. At December 31, 2003, credit default swaps with $166 million in notional amount were used by the Corporation to manage credit risk associated with commercial lending activities and are included in the Other Derivatives table in the Financial And Other Derivatives section of Item 7 of this Report. Net losses realized in connection with credit default swaps for 2003 were $4.6 million. Interest Rate Derivative Risk Participation Agreements The Corporation enters into risk participation agreements to share credit exposure with other financial counterparties related to interest rate derivative contracts. Risk participation agreements executed by the Corporation to mitigate credit risk had a total notional amount of $22 million at December 31, 2003. Additionally, risk participation agreements entered into in which the Corporation assumed credit exposure had a total notional amount of $49 million at December 31, 2003. These agreements were entered into prior to July 1, 2003 and are considered to be financial guarantees and therefore are not included in the Financial And Other Derivatives section of Item 7 of this Report. Agreements entered into subsequent to June 30, 2003 had a notional amount of $20 million and are included in the Financial And Other Derivatives section. 51 Table of Contents OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people or systems or from external events. The definition also includes losses that may arise from legal actions that may result from operating deficiencies or noncompliance with contracts, laws or regulations. Technology risk management is a significant component of the operational risk program. Governance Structure Each business unit holds primary responsibility for its operational risk management program, given that operational risk management is integral to direct business management and most easily affected at the business unit level. Corporate Operational Risk Management oversees the day to day operational risk management activities at PNC and reports to the Chief Risk Officer. The Business Risk Committee and the Corporate Technology Governance Committee both review significant risk strategies and operational and technology risk exposures, measure and monitor key risks, and communicate exposures to management, audit, regulators and the Board. Risk Measurement And Control Strategies The Corporation maintains a system of internal controls that is designed to reduce risk and to provide management timely and accurate information about the operations of PNC. Senior business managers are accountable for managing the operational risks of their respective businesses. Management believes that the internal controls are adequate to reduce such risks to a level consistent with the Corporations financial strength, business and market characteristics, and the regulatory environment to which it is subject. A comprehensive enterprise wide operational risk framework is currently being implemented to further enhance the management of operational risk. PNC has an integrated security and technology risk management framework designed to help ensure a secure, sound, and compliant infrastructure for information management. The technology risk management process is aligned with the strategic direction of the businesses and is integrated into the technology management culture, structure and practices. The application of this framework across the enterprise helps to support comprehensive and reliable internal controls. The technology risk program is the foundation for information privacy, integrity, and availability. Key elements of the program include: technology risk assessment, privacy, information security, crisis management, business resiliency, fraud avoidance, and physical security. The security and technology risk management strategy supports existing and emerging business risks and complies with various regulatory guidelines. Appropriate access to information is fundamental to ensuring privacy and security. The access management program is aligned to support emerging regulatory requirements, and is designed to ensure information protection and integrity. The PNC business resiliency program manages the organizations capabilities to continue to provide services at any time, regardless of the event and impact. Prioritization of investments in people, processes, technology and facilities are based on different types of events, business risk and criticality. Comprehensive testing validates PNCs resiliency capabilities on an ongoing basis, and an integrated governance model is designed to assure transparent management reporting. Risk Monitoring Business units perform self assessments of operational risk to identify trends and correlations that will enable proactive steps to be taken to address emerging operational risks and control gaps. Corporate Operational Risk Management provides oversight to the accuracy and consistency of the self assessments. Insurance As a component of its risk management practices, PNC purchases comprehensive insurance programs designed to protect it against accidental loss or losses which, in the aggregate, may significantly affect personnel, property, financial objectives, or the ability of PNC to continue to meet its responsibilities to its various stakeholder groups. Major insurance programs purchased include the following: financial institution bond, directors and officers liability, professional and fiduciary liability, employment practices liability, all risk property (including terrorism), general liability, automobile liability and workers compensation coverage, subject to certain exclusions, limits and deductibles. PNCs limits of coverage and deductibles are established based upon valuation of assets, peer group benchmarks, actual loss experience and identified insurance risks. PNC, through subsidiary companies, Alpine Indemnity Limited and PNC Insurance Corp., participates as a reinsurer for its general liability, automobile liability and workers compensation programs and as a direct writer for its property and certified domestic terrorism programs. PNCs risks associated with its participation as a reinsurer or direct writer for these programs are mitigated through policy limits, annual aggregate limits, umbrella/excess liability coverage and reinsurance ceded beyond per occurrence deductible limits. LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT Liquidity risk is the risk of potential for loss from an inability of the Corporation to meet its funding requirements at a reasonable cost. The objective of liquidity risk management is to help ensure that the Corporation can obtain cost effective funding to meet current and future obligations under both normal business as usual and stressful circumstances. The Corporation typically maintains its liquidity positions through: A large and stable deposit base derived from the Corporations retail and wholesale banking activities; A portfolio of liquid investment securities; Diversified sources of short term and long term wholesale funding; and Significant unused borrowing capacity at both the Federal Home Loan Bank and the Federal Reserve discount window. 52 Table of Contents Governance Structure Asset and Liability Management (ALM), reporting to the Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, is accountable for managing the liquidity position within the limits and guidelines set forth in the Corporations risk management policies approved by the Board Finance Committee. Market Risk Management provides independent oversight for the measurement, monitoring and reporting of the Corporations liquidity risk and reports to the Chief Risk Officer. Risk Measurement The Liquidity Risk Management Policy for PNC Bank, N.A. and the Capital Management Policy for the parent company established the process and operating guidelines for measuring, monitoring and reporting liquidity, including compliance with the limits that govern the liquidity position at both the bank and parent company level. For policy compliance purposes, stress scenarios are simulated monthly that incorporate assumptions about retail deposit outflows, and other factors that could adversely affect PNC Bank, N.A.s liquidity position given adverse events affecting the Bank. The parent companys routine funding needs consist primarily of the return of capital to shareholders (dividends and share repurchase), debt service and the funding of its non bank affiliates and acquisitions. Parent company liquidity guidelines are designed to help ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet these requirements over the succeeding twelve month period. Risk Control Strategies Market Risk Management monitors the Corporations liquidity positions against established policy limits. All limit exceptions are reported to managements Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) and to the Board Finance Committee. The Corporation also establishes process and operating guidelines for managing liquidity in a crisis situation. These activities are coordinated with the business units to develop strategies to help minimize the outflow of funds and obtain detailed information focused on tracking deposit and loan trends to identify significant, unexpected withdrawals or draws on commitments which could adversely affect the Corporations liquidity position. Risk Monitoring Liquidity positions are monitored at both the bank and the parent company level. Compliance with the Corporations liquidity policy limits and guidelines is reviewed with ALCO and the Board Finance Committee. Liquid assets consist of short term investments (federal funds sold and other short term investments) and securities available for sale. At December 31, 2003, such assets totaled $18.3 billion, with $6.7 billion pledged as collateral for borrowings, trust and other commitments. Secured advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank, of which PNC Bank, N.A. is a member, are generally secured by residential mortgages, other real estate related loans and mortgage backed securities. At December 31, 2003, total unused borrowing capacity from the Federal Home Loan Bank under current collateral requirements was $14.6 billion. Funding can also be obtained through alternative forms of borrowing, including federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements and short term and long term debt issuance. Liquidity for the parent company and PNCs non bank subsidiaries can be generated through the issuance of securities in public or private markets. The PNC Capital Trust D issued $300 million of capital securities in December 2003. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2003 PNC issued $600 million of 5.25% Subordinated Notes due in November 2015. At December 31, 2003, the Corporation had unused capacity under effective shelf registration statements of approximately $2.7 billion of debt or equity securities. The parent company also had an unused non reciprocal credit facility of $200 million at December 31, 2003. The principal source of parent company revenue and cash flow is the dividends it receives from PNC Bank, N.A. PNC Bank, N.A.s dividend level may be impacted by its capital needs, laws and regulations, corporate policies, contractual restrictions and other factors. Also, there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of national banks to pay dividends or make other capital distributions. The amount available for dividend payments to the parent company by PNC Bank, N.A. without prior regulatory approval was approximately $324 million at December 31, 2003. In 2003, PNC Bank, N.A., received regulatory approval to reduce its capital surplus by up to $500 million which was completed by two transfers of cash to the parent company of $250 million each in December 2003 and January 2004. In addition to dividends from PNC Bank, N.A., other sources of parent company liquidity include cash and short term investments, as well as dividends and loan repayments from other subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2003, the parent company had approximately $1.7 billion in funds available from its cash and short term investments or other funds available from unrestricted subsidiaries available for the repayment of contractual obligations with maturities of less than one year of $1.1 billion. The Corporation regularly assesses its ability to meet both the obligatory and discretionary funding needs of the parent company. Based on the amount of funds currently available at the parent company and the projected amount of dividends from PNC Bank, N.A., and taking into account the cash portion of the United National acquisition, management expects the parent company to have sufficient liquidity to meet current obligations to its debt holders, vendors, and others and to pay dividends at current levels through the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2003, borrowed funds totaling $5.7 billion are scheduled for repayment during 2004. See Note 19 Borrowed Funds in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. 53 Table of Contents Commitments The following tables set forth contractual obligations and various commitments representing required and potential cash outflows as of December 31, 2003.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW Market risk is the risk of potential losses due to adverse movements in market factors such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. Market risk is inherent in the operations of the Corporation, arising from both trading and non trading activities. Trading activities involve transactions in capital markets products such as bonds, stocks and their related derivative instruments. The primary market risk in non trading activities is the interest rate risk inherent in the traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Equity investment risk is another significant type of non trading market risk arising from private equity and other types of equity investment activities. Market Risk Management has responsibility for market risks in both trading and non trading activities. The four key aspects of Market Risk Management functions are enterprise wide market risk policy, measurement, monitoring and reporting. The Board Finance Committee reviews and approves the Corporations market risk policies and limits. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT INTEREST RATE RISK Interest rate risk results primarily from the Corporations traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates and consumer preferences, affect the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities. In managing interest rate risk, the Corporation seeks to limit its reliance on a particular interest rate scenario as a source of earnings while positioning itself to optimize net interest income and net interest margin. The Corporation uses securities purchases and sales, short term and long term funding, financial derivatives and other capital markets instruments to achieve these objectives. Governance Structure The Board Finance Committee approves market risk policies, including the interest rate risk management policy, the investment policy and the financial derivatives policy, that govern interest rate risk management. The policies define the Corporations overall interest rate risk management philosophy and risk tolerance level. ALCO is the management committee that oversees all market risk taking activities, including interest rate risk management activities conducted by ALM. ALCO delegates the execution and implementation of interest rate risk management strategies to ALM. In this capacity, ALM is responsible for making investment and trading decisions within the authorized limits and guidelines. Market Risk Management is responsible for monitoring compliance with the approved policy and market risk limits. Risk Measurement The Corporation measures and seeks to manage both the short term and long term effects of changing interest rates through its interest rate risk simulation model. The simulation model measures the sensitivity of net interest income (NII) to changing interest rates over the next 24 month period. The model also measures the sensitivity of the economic value of equity (EVE) to instantaneous changes in interest rates. EVE is a measurement of the inherent economic value of the Corporation at a given point in time. The NII simulation model is the tool used to measure the direction and magnitude of changes in net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates. Forecasting net interest income and its sensitivity to changes in interest rates requires that the Corporation make assumptions about the volume and characteristics of new business and the behavior of existing positions. These business assumptions are based on 54 Table of Contents the Corporations experience, business plans and published industry experience. Key assumptions employed in the model include prepayment speeds on mortgage related assets and consumer loans, loan volumes and pricing, deposit volumes and pricing, the expected life and repricing characteristics of nonmaturity loans and deposits, and managements financial and capital plans. EVE is also based on a series of assumptions, primarily about the expected maturity and repricing behavior of existing on and off balance sheet positions. Actual results may differ from those determined under these assumptions. To the extent possible, these assumptions are consistent with those used in the NII simulation process. Using these assumptions, the Corporation calculates EVE given parallel instantaneous changes in interest rates. As part of that calculation, the Corporation also calculates changes in fair value given a change in interest rates, referred to as effective duration,of key on and off balance sheet positions. At December 31, 2003, the effective duration of key on and off balance sheet positions was as follows, given a +/ 50 basis point change in interest rates: loans 1.2%, securities 2.5%, total assets 1.4%, deposits 1.7%, borrowed funds 1.8%, total liabilities 1.6%, and receive fixed interest rate swaps 3.0%. The Corporations interest rate risk simulation model is designed to capture key components of interest rate risk such as repricing risk, yield curve or nonparallel rate shift risk, basis risk and options risk. Because the assumptions employed in the model are inherently uncertain, actual results may differ from simulated results. Management uses such analyses to help it identify risks and develop appropriate risk management strategies. Risk Control Strategies PNC has established policy limits and processes for Market Risk Management to actively monitor its interest rate risk profile. Policy limits are established both for NII and EVE sensitivities. Risk Monitoring The Corporation has established a process for reporting its interest rate risk profile and any significant risk issues. NII and EVE sensitivity reports are reviewed regularly by ALCO and the Board Finance Committee. The following table sets forth the sensitivity results and market interest rate benchmarks for the last two years. Interest Sensitivity Analysis Dec. 31 2003 Dec. 31 2002 Net Interest Income Sensitivity Simulation Effect on net interest income in first year from gradual interest rate change over following 12 months of: 100 basis point increase (.5 )% .4 % 100 basis point decrease (.9 )% (2.9 )% Effect on net interest income in second year from gradual interest rate change over the preceding 12 months of: 100 basis point increase 1.1 % 2.8 % 100 basis point decrease (7.6 )% (11.4 )% Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity Model Effect on value of on and off balance sheet positions as a percentage of economic value of equity from instantaneous change in interest rates of: 200 basis point increase (7.0 )% (3.9 )% 200 basis point decrease (.2 )% (2.4 )% Key Period End Interest Rates One month LIBOR 1.12 % 1.38 % Three year swap 2.76 % 2.40 % In addition to measuring the effect on net interest income assuming parallel changes in current interest rates, PNC routinely simulates the effects of a number of nonparallel interest rate environments. The following table reflects the percentage change in net interest income over the next two 12 month periods assuming the PNC Economists most likely rate forecast, implied market forward rates, a lower/steeper rate scenario and a lower/flatter rate scenario. The Corporation is inherently sensitive to a low and flat yield curve. When forecasting net interest income, the Corporation makes assumptions about interest rates and the shape of the yield curve, the volume and characteristics of new business, and the behavior of existing positions. These assumptions determine the future level of simulated net interest income in the base interest rate scenario and the other interest rate scenarios presented in the following table. These simulations assume that as assets and liabilities mature and are replaced or repriced, this occurs at market rates. As a result, given the current low level of interest rates and shape of the yield curve, forecasted net interest income and the resulting net interest margin in the base rate scenario decline from current levels as higher yielding assets are replaced or repriced at lower yields. All changes in forecasted net interest income are relative to results in a base rate scenario where current market rates are assumed to remain unchanged over the forecast horizon. 55 Table of Contents Net Interest Income Sensitivity To Alternative Rate Scenarios (as of December 31, 2003) PNCEconomist MarketForward Low/Steep Low/Flat Change in forecasted net interest income: First year sensitivity (.2 )% (.3 )% .8 % (1.4 )% Second year sensitivity (1.2 )% (1.5 )% 2.4 % (8.1 )% The graph below presents the yield curves for the base rate scenario and each of the alternative scenarios one year forward.

The Corporation makes and manages direct investments in a variety of transactions, including management buyouts, recapitalizations and later stage growth financings, and in a variety of industries. The Corporation also invests in non affiliated and affiliated funds that make similar private equity investments. The private equity portfolio is comprised of investments that vary by industry, stage and type of investment. The Corporation continues to make private equity investments at a more moderate pace than in prior years, consistent with current market conditions. From a risk management standpoint, the strategy is to invest in companies with proven business models, structure investment transactions to protect value in downside scenarios and invest in less volatile industries. Currently, emphasis is being placed on the management of capital for other investors. PNC also makes investments in affiliated and non affiliated funds with both traditional and alternative investment strategies. Such investments include investments in BlackRocks mutual funds and hedge funds. The Market Risk Management group also measures and monitors the sensitivities of the economic values of other types of assets or investments on or off the Corporations balance sheet. The economic values could be driven by either the fixed income market, or the equity markets or both. As of December 31, 2003, major investments of this type include modified coinsurance contracts with various insurance carriers, low income housing tax credits, and capitalized servicing rights for commercial mortgage loans. Governance Structure PNC Equity Management Corp (PNC EMC) and other PNC business units manage the equity and other investment activities of PNC. The Board Finance Committee approves policies and capital limits related to investment activities across PNC. PNC businesses are responsible for making investment decisions within the approved policy limits and guidelines. Market Risk Management provides independent oversight by monitoring compliance with these limits and guidelines, and reporting significant risks in the business to the Board Finance Committee and ERMC. Risk Measurement The primary risk measurement for equity and other investments is the concept of economic capital. The economic capital is a common measure of risk for credit, market and operational risk. It is the worst case value depreciation over one year within 99.9% confidence level. Given the illiquid nature of many of these types of investments, it is a challenge to determine their fair economic values. Market Risk Management provides independent oversight of the valuation process. Private equity investments are reported at fair value. Changes in the values of private equity investments are reflected in the Corporations results of operations. Due to the nature of the direct investments, management must make assumptions as to future performance, financial condition, liquidity, availability of capital, and market conditions, among other factors, to determine the estimated fair value of the investments. Market conditions and actual performance of the investments could differ from these assumptions. Accordingly, lower valuations may occur that could adversely impact earnings in future periods. Also, the valuations may not represent amounts that will ultimately be realized from these investments. See Equity Management Asset Valuation in the Critical Accounting Policies And Judgments section under Item 7 of this Report for additional information. Risk Control Strategies Equity and other investments across the Corporation are made within capital limits approved by the Board Finance Committee. Given the illiquid nature of most of the investments, assessing their fair values is a challenge. The fair market value of the investments is updated and reviewed at 56 Table of Contents both corporate and business unit levels. In addition, Market Risk Management monitors the equity investment portfolio. Risk Monitoring At December 31, 2003, private equity investments carried at estimated fair value totaled approximately $531 million compared with $530 million at December 31, 2002. As of December 31, 2003, approximately 48% of the amount is invested directly in a variety of companies and approximately 52% is invested in various limited partnerships. Private equity unfunded commitments totaled $176 million at December 31, 2003 compared with $173 million at December 31, 2002. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT TRADING RISK Most of the Corporations trading activities are designed to provide capital markets services to customers and not to position the Corporations portfolio for gains from market movements. Trading activities are confined to financial instruments and financial derivatives. PNC participates in derivatives and foreign exchange trading as well as underwriting and market making in equity securities primarily for its customers. PNC also engages in trading activities as part of its risk management strategies. Net trading income was $131 million for 2003 compared with $92 million for 2002. See Note 9 Trading Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Report for additional information. Governance Structure The Board Finance Committee reviews and approves the Corporate trading risk policy. This policy governs risk management philosophy, processes and limits for all trading activities across the Corporation. ALCO oversees all trading activities across the Corporation. For each trading group (e.g., fixed income derivatives, foreign exchange), there is a specific market risk policy and a set of risk limits that govern that particular group. The overall Corporate trading risk policy governs these policies and limits. Risk Measurement The Corporation uses a variety of statistical and non statistical measurements to assess the level of market risk arising from trading activities. The key market risk measure for trading activities is Value at Risk (VaR). For a trading portfolio, VaR seeks to measure the maximum potential loss within a specified confidence level over a given holding period. The Corporation measures its VaR using a 99% confidence level over a one day period. VaR offers a common currency to compare market risk across multiple instruments and portfolios. It accounts for risk at the individual position level as well as the positions effect on the overall portfolio. In addition to the levels of volatility of market risk factors, the Corporations VaR methodology incorporates market liquidity risk by lengthening the holding period for illiquid positions. Currently, the Corporation does not perform a VaR calculation for its portfolio of credit default swaps that are used to economically hedge its on balance sheet corporate loans. The notional amount of credit default swaps is $166 million as of December 31, 2003. See Credit Default Swaps in the Credit Related Instruments section under Item 7 of this Report for further information. The trading activities of the Corporation are governed by both a daily VaR limit and a month to date stop loss limit. As of December 31, 2003, the total VaR usage for the Corporation was $.9 million. Total VaR usage ranged from $.5 million to $1.8 million during 2003. Currently, interest rate risk, equity risk and foreign exchange risk contribute fairly evenly to the overall VaR level. In addition to measuring VaR, Market Risk Management performs stress testing to assess the potential impacts of extreme market scenarios beyond the 99% confidence level on all of PNCs trading portfolios. The appropriateness of these scenarios is reviewed regularly by management to reflect the changing market conditions and portfolio compositions. Risk Control Strategies Under current policy, the Board Finance Committee and ALCO review the Corporations trading activities at least twice a year to consider and approve any significant changes to risk management policies, limits and business strategies. On a daily basis, Market Risk Management monitors the market conditions and their impact on the Corporations trading positions. In addition, Market Risk Management also monitors exposure levels relative to relevant risk limits. Risk Monitoring Market risk reports for the trading activities are generated daily and reviewed by Market Risk Management staff. Monthly VaR, stop loss and stress testing reports, together with market risk trend and summary reports, are presented to senior management in risk management committee meetings at both the business unit and corporate levels. Market Risk Management also generates a backtesting report on a daily basis. The purpose of the backtesting report is to validate the accuracy of the VaR measurement by comparing the current days actual trading profit/loss against the prior days VaR. A backtesting exception occurs when the actual loss exceeds the relevant VaR and can be an indication that the VaR measurement is underestimating risk. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Corporation experienced no backtesting exceptions at the enterprise wide level. IMPACT OF INFLATION The assets and liabilities of the Corporation are primarily monetary in nature. Accordingly, future changes in prices do not affect the obligations to pay or receive fixed and determinable amounts of money. During periods of inflation, monetary assets lose value in terms of purchasing power and monetary liabilities have corresponding purchasing power gains. The concept of purchasing power, however, is not an adequate indicator of the effect of inflation on banks because it does not take into account changes in interest rates, which are an important determinant of the Corporations earnings. 57 Table of Contents FINANCIAL AND OTHER DERIVATIVES Effective January 1, 2001, the Corporation implemented SFAS 133, as amended. The statement requires the Corporation to recognize all derivative instruments at fair value as either assets or liabilities. Financial derivatives are reported at fair value in other assets or other liabilities. The cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle resulting from the adoption of SFAS 133 was an after tax charge of $5 million reported in the Consolidated Statement Of Income in the first quarter of 2001, and an after tax accumulated other comprehensive loss of $4 million in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 22 Financial Derivatives under Item 8 of this Report for additional information. The Corporation uses a variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage interest rate, market and credit risk inherent in the Corporations business activities. Substantially all such instruments are used to manage risk related to changes in interest rates. Interest rate and total return swaps, purchased interest rate caps and floors and futures contracts are the primary instruments used by the Corporation for interest rate risk management. Interest rate swaps are agreements with a counterparty to exchange periodic fixed and floating interest payments calculated on a notional amount. The floating rate is based on a money market index, primarily short term LIBOR. Total return swaps are agreements with a counterparty to exchange an interest rate payment for the total return on a specified reference index calculated on a notional amount. Purchased interest rate caps and floors are agreements where, for a fee, the counterparty agrees to pay the Corporation the amount, if any, by which a specified market interest rate exceeds or is less than a defined rate applied to a notional amount, respectively. Interest rate futures contracts are exchange traded agreements to make or take delivery of a financial instrument at an agreed upon price and are settled in cash daily. Financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, interest rate, market and credit risk. For interest rate swaps and total return swaps, caps and floors and futures contracts, only periodic cash payments and, with respect to caps and floors, premiums, are exchanged. Therefore, cash requirements and exposure to credit risk are significantly less than the notional amount. Not all elements of interest rate, market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial or other derivatives, and such instruments may be ineffective for their intended purposes due to unanticipated market characteristics, among other reasons. The following tables set forth changes during 2003 in the notional amount of financial derivatives used for risk management and designated as accounting hedges.

Risk exposure from customer positions is managed through transactions with other dealers. Also included in other derivatives are derivative transactions the Corporation enters into for risk management and proprietary purposes that are not designated as accounting hedges, primarily interest rate basis swaps, and the total return swaps resulting from the implementation of DIG B36, and certain interest rate locked loan origination commitments (included in other). Other noninterest income included $8 million of net losses for 2003 and $7 million of net gains for 2002 related to the derivatives held for risk management purposes not designated as accounting hedges.

Results for 2002 reflected the adoption of SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, under which goodwill is no longer amortized to expense. Goodwill amortization expense for 2001 impacted net income for that year by $93 million, or $.32 per diluted share. Results for 2001 reflected the cost of actions taken during the year to accelerate the repositioning of PNCs lending business and other strategic initiatives. These charges totaled $1.2 billion pretax and reduced 2001 net income by $768 million or $2.65 per diluted share. Results for 2002 included a loss from discontinued operations of $16 million, or $.05 per diluted share, compared with income from discontinued operations in 2001 of $5 million, or $.02 per diluted share. Results for 2001 also included an after tax loss of $5 million, or $.02 per diluted share, related to the cumulative effect of the accounting change for the adoption of SFAS 133. Net Interest Income Net interest income was $2.197 billion for 2002 compared with $2.262 billion for 2001. Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis was $2.210 billion for 2002, down $68 million, or 3%, from $2.278 billion for 2001. The decline in net interest income for 2002 compared with the prior year reflected the effects of a lower rate environment and growth in average transaction deposits in 2002 that was more than offset by the impact of the continued downsizing of the loan portfolio. The net interest margin widened 15 basis points to 3.99% for 2002 compared with 3.84% for 2001. The widening of the net interest margin for 2002 resulted from the impact of changes in balance sheet composition and a lower interest rate environment, combined with a steep yield curve. Provision For Credit Losses The provision for credit losses was $309 million for 2002 compared with $903 million for 2001. The provision for 2002 reflected additions to reserves for PNC Business Credit and Corporate Banking and losses in Corporate Banking primarily related to Market Street liquidity facilities. Provision expense for 2001 reflected $714 million for net charge offs associated with institutional lending repositioning initiatives. Net charge offs were $223 million, or .60%, of average loans for 2002 compared with $948 million or 2.12%, respectively, for 2001. Net charge offs for 2002 included two charge offs totaling $90 million related to Market Street liquidity facilities. Net charge offs for 2001 included $804 million related to institutional lending repositioning initiatives. Noninterest Income Noninterest income was $3.197 billion for 2002 compared with $2.652 billion for 2001. Noninterest income in 2001 included charges of $259 million for valuation adjustments on loans held for sale related to the institutional lending repositioning and $17 million of charges for asset impairments associated with other strategic initiatives. Apart from these items, the increase from 2001 was primarily due to the recognition of net gains in excess of valuation adjustments related to the liquidation of institutional loans held for sale of $147 million in 2002 and a $128 million decrease in losses from equity management investments. Asset management fees totaled $853 million for 2002, up $5 million compared with 2001. The increase primarily reflected an increase in separate account base fee revenue arising from growth in assets under management at BlackRock, partially offset by lower asset management fees at PNC Advisors primarily due to weak equity markets in 2002 and the recognition of $15 million of revenue accrual adjustments that benefited 2001. Consolidated assets under management were $313 billion at December 31, 2002, an increase of $29 billion compared with December 31, 2001, due to growth at BlackRock. Fund servicing fees decreased $17 million, to $816 million, for 2002 compared with 2001. Fund servicing fees for 2002 included a benefit of approximately $13 million recognized at PFPC related to the renegotiation of a client contract. Depressed financial market conditions, pricing and other competitive factors including customer attrition contributed to the decline in 2002. Service charges on deposits were $227 million for 2002 compared with $218 million for 2001. The increase in 2002 reflected the benefit of an increase in average transaction deposits that offset the impact of price reductions from comparable services. Brokerage fees declined $11 million, to $195 million, for 2002 compared with the prior year as lower sales commissions resulted from the impact of depressed financial market conditions and lower trading volumes. Consumer services revenue increased $10 million, to $239 million, for 2002 compared with 2001, reflecting additional fees from ATM and debit card transactions arising from increased transaction volumes. Corporate services revenue totaled $526 million for 2002 compared with $60 million for 2001. Net gains in excess of valuation adjustments related to the liquidation of institutional loans held for sale totaled $147 million in 2002, while revenue in 2001 was adversely impacted by valuation adjustments on loans held for sale of $259 million. Apart from these items, corporate services revenue increased in 2002 primarily due to growth in treasury management fees and higher gains from commercial mortgage loan sales. Equity management (private equity activities) net losses on portfolio investments were $51 million in 2002 compared with net losses of $179 million in 2001. Net securities gains were $89 million for 2002 compared with $131 million for 2001. 62 Table of Contents Other noninterest income totaled $303 million for 2002 compared with $306 million for 2001. Other noninterest income for 2002 included a $28 million benefit resulting from a reduction in the put option liability related to the NBOC acquisition, a $14 million gain on the sale of a real estate investment and a lower level of asset write downs compared with the prior year. The impact of these items was more than offset by lower revenue from trading activities in 2002 and lower gains related to securitizations in 2002. Net trading income included in other noninterest income was $91 million for 2002 compared with $142 million in 2001. Gains from securitization transactions totaled $12 million in 2002 compared with $31 million in 2001. Noninterest Expense Total noninterest expense was $3.227 billion for 2002 compared with $3.414 billion for 2001, a decline of $187 million. Noninterest expense for 2001 included the impact of charges totaling $135 million in connection with the vehicle leasing business including exit costs and additions to reserves related to insured residual value exposures, integration and severance costs of $56 million related to other strategic initiatives, and goodwill amortization expense of $117 million. Apart from these items, noninterest expense increased in 2002 compared with the prior year. The increase in noninterest expense in 2002 was primarily attributable to increases of $29 million, $25 million and $24 million at BlackRock, PFPC and PNC Business Credit, respectively. These increases reflected higher operating expenses to support revenue growth at PNC Business Credit and BlackRock and new product support at PFPC. In addition, noninterest expense for 2002 included $30 million of legal and consulting fees related to regulatory compliance and legal proceedings. Partially offsetting these increases in 2002 was the benefit of a $19 million reduction in facilities consolidation reserves at PFPC. The PFPC reserves were originally established in 2001 as part of the other strategic initiatives referred to above and are primarily related to a previously announced plan to consolidate selected facilities. The facilities strategy had been modified as certain originally contemplated relocations did not occur. CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET REVIEW Loans Loans were $35.5 billion at December 31, 2002 compared with $38.0 billion at December 31, 2001. The decline of $2.5 billion from the prior year was due to the impact of residential mortgage loan prepayments and sales, transfers to held for sale and the managed reduction of institutional loans, which more than offset the impact in 2002 of the NBOC acquisition and growth in home equity loans. Securities Total securities at December 31, 2002 were $13.8 billion compared with $13.9 billion at December 31, 2001. Securities represented 21% of total assets at December 31, 2002 compared with 20% at December 31, 2001. At December 31, 2002, the securities available for sale balance included a net unrealized gain of $274 million, which represented the difference between fair value and amortized cost. The comparable amount at December 31, 2001 was a net unrealized loss of $132 million. The expected weighted average life of securities available for sale was 2 years and 8 months at December 31, 2002 compared with 4 years at December 31, 2001. Securities designated as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost and were assets of companies formed in 2001 in transactions with AIG that were consolidated in PNCs financial statements. In January 2003, these securities were sold and these companies were liquidated. The expected weighted average life of securities held to maturity was 20 years and 2 months at December 31, 2002 compared with 18 years and 11 months at December 31, 2001. Loans Held For Sale Loans held for sale totaled $1.6 billion at December 31, 2002, a decline of $2.6 billion from December 31, 2001. The institutional lending held for sale portfolio declined $2.3 billion during 2002 and represented the majority of the decline in total loans held for sale. In addition, education loans classified as held for sale declined $.3 billion to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2002. Substantially all education loans were classified as held for sale. Asset Quality Nonperforming assets were $418 million at December 31, 2002 compared with $391 million at December 31, 2001. The ratio of nonperforming assets to total loans, loans held for sale and foreclosed assets was 1.13% at December 31, 2002 compared with .93% at December 31, 2001. The allowance for credit losses was $673 million and represented 1.90% of total loans and 218% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2002. The comparable amounts were $560 million, 1.47% and 265%, respectively, at December 31, 2001. Funding Sources Total funding sources were $54.1 billion at December 31, 2002 and $59.4 billion at December 31, 2001, a decrease of $5.3 billion corresponding to a decrease of $3.3 billion in total assets and increases in accrued expenses and other liabilities and in total shareholders equity of $.9 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. Total deposits were $45 billion at December 31, 2002 compared with $47.3 billion at December 31, 2001. Total deposits decreased $2.3 billion from December 31, 2001 primarily due to a $1.1 billion decrease in deposits in foreign offices and a $.9 billion decrease in retail certificates of deposit. Shareholders Equity Shareholders equity totaled $6.9 billion at December 31, 2002 compared with $5.8 billion at December 31, 2001. The increase in shareholders equity at December 31, 2002 compared with December 31, 2001 reflected the impact of 63 Table of Contents 2002 net income and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income primarily due to net unrealized securities gains. The regulatory capital ratios were 8.1% for leverage, 8.8% for tier 1 risk based and 12.5% for total risk based capital at December 31, 2002 compared with 6.8% for leverage, 7.8% for tier 1 risk based and 11.8% for total risk based capital at December 31, 2001.
