ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC. PNC is one of the largest diversified financial services companies in the United States, operating businesses engaged in regional community banking, wholesale banking, wealth management, asset management and global fund processing services. We operate directly and through numerous subsidiaries, providing many of our products and services nationally and others in our primary geographic markets in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Ohio and Kentucky. We also provide certain asset management and global fund processing services internationally. KEY STRATEGIC GOALS Our strategy to enhance shareholder value centers on achieving growth in our lines of business underpinned by prudent risk and capital management. In each of our business segments, the primary drivers of growth are the acquisition, expansion and retention of customer relationships. We strive to achieve such growth in our customer base by providing convenient banking options, leading technological systems and a broad range of asset management products and services. We also intend to grow through appropriate and targeted acquisitions and, in certain businesses, by expanding into new geographical markets. In recent years, we have managed interest rate risk toward achieving a moderate risk profile with limited exposure to earnings volatility resulting from interest rate fluctuations. Our actions have created a balance sheet characterized by strong asset quality and significant flexibility to take advantage, where appropriate, of rising interest rates. We anticipate that interest rates will continue to rise in 2005 and that the overall impact of a rise in long term interest rates will be beneficial to us. Effective January 31, 2005, our majority owned subsidiary BlackRock acquired SSRM Holdings, Inc. (SSRM), the holding company for State Street Research & Management Company and SSR Realty Advisors Inc., from MetLife, Inc. At closing, MetLife, Inc. received approximately $285 million in cash and approximately 550,000 shares of BlackRock restricted class A common stock. Additional cash consideration, which could increase the purchase price by up to 25%, may be paid over five years contingent on certain measures. We expect that the addition of SSRM will enhance BlackRocks investment management platform with additional U.S. equity, alternative investment and real estate equity management capabilities, expanding the universe of products offered to institutional and individual investors worldwide. On February 10, 2005, we entered into an amended and restated agreement to acquire Riggs National Corporation (Riggs), a Washington, D.C. based banking company, replacing the original acquisition agreement entered into July 16, 2004. The transaction will give us a substantial presence on which to build a market leading franchise in the affluent Washington metropolitan area. The total consideration under the amended and restated agreement is comprised of a fixed number of approximately 6.4 million shares of PNC common stock and $286 million in cash, subject to adjustment. The merger is subject to closing conditions including, among others, receipt of regulatory approvals and waivers and approval of the Riggs shareholders. Our Current Reports on Form 8 K dated July 16, 2004, July 22, 2004 and February 10, 2005 provide additional information on this pending acquisition. The Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger for this transaction is included as Exhibit 10.31 to this Report. We include additional information on Riggs and SSRM in Note 3 Acquisitions in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report and in the Risk Factors section of Item 7 of this Report. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE Our financial performance is substantially affected by several external factors outside of our control, including: General economic conditions, Loan demand, Interest rates, The shape of the interest rate yield curve, and The performance of the capital markets. We seek a moderate risk profile in the management of our businesses to limit the risk of loss resulting from quickly changing market conditions. We focus on the development and management of our customer franchises to generate longer term growth in revenue and earnings. During 2004, we achieved success in growing our business segments, with customer growth and retention improving in a number of key areas. We believe such growth enhances our overall value by increasing revenues that are less susceptible to changes in economic and market conditions. Noninterest income increased by 9% in 2004 compared with 2003. This improvement reflects, among other things, growth in fee based customer revenues. Economic factors, particularly low interest rates, continued to pressure net interest income through the first half of 2004. Loan demand increased during the second half of the year. While we expect interest rates to continue to rise and loan demand to continue to increase, we cannot predict the timing and magnitude of these increases with certainty. To some extent, the benefits of rising interest rates and increases in loan demand will trail these increases. 15 Table of Contents In addition to changes in general economic conditions, including the direction, timing and magnitude of movement in interest rates and the performance of the capital markets, our success in 2005 will depend, among other things, upon: Further success in the acquisition, growth and retention of customers, Growth in market share across businesses, Disciplined expense control and improved efficiency, Maintaining strong overall asset quality, Prudent risk and capital management, and Successful completion of the acquisition and integration of Riggs. As described in Note 31 Subsequent Events in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report, the transfer of BlackRock from PNC Bank, N.A., to PNC Bancorp, Inc. will have an impact on our first quarter 2005 earnings. SUMMARY FINANCIAL RESULTS Consolidated net income for 2004 was $1.197 billion or $4.21 per diluted share compared with $1.001 billion or $3.55 per diluted share for 2003. Results for 2004 reflected the impact of charges totaling $49 million after taxes, or $.17 per diluted share, related to the 2002 BlackRock Long Term Retention and Incentive Plan (LTIP). This LTIP is described under 2002 BlackRock Long Term Incentive Plan in the Critical Accounting Policies and Judgments section of Item 7 of this Report. Results for 2003 included expenses totaling $87 million after taxes, or $.31 per diluted share, in connection with the agreement with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), including related legal and consulting costs, which we describe in Item 3 of this Report and in our Current Report on Form 8 K dated June 23, 2004. Net income for 2003 also included the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle that negatively impacted earnings by $28 million, or $.10 per diluted share. Return on average common shareholders equity was 16.82% for 2004 and 15.06% for 2003. Return on average assets was 1.59% in 2004 and 1.49% for 2003. Our performance in 2004 included the following accomplishments: We successfully integrated United National that we acquired in January 2004, Average loans increased 14% in 2004 compared with 2003 and average deposits increased 12% driven by the impact of the United National acquisition and customer growth, Overall asset quality improved significantly as nonperforming assets at December 31, 2004 declined 47% from December 31, 2003, Noninterest income increased 9% for the year compared with 2003 and now represents 64% of total revenue, Assets under management grew 8% from the prior year end, to $383 billion, driven largely by BlackRock performance, and Total business segment earnings grew 8% in 2004, to $1.266 billion, compared with 2003. See Note 25 Segment Reporting in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for a reconciliation of total business segment earnings to total PNC consolidated earnings as reported on a GAAP basis, and see Net Interest Income GAAP Reconciliation in the Consolidated Statement of Income Review section of Item 7 of this Report for a reconciliation of net income as reported under GAAP to net interest income presented on a taxable equivalent basis. BALANCE SHEET HIGHLIGHTS Total average assets were $75.3 billion for 2004 compared with $67.3 billion for 2003. Average interest earning assets were $61.8 billion in 2004 compared with $55.2 billion in 2003, an increase of $6.6 billion, or 12%. The increase in average interest earning assets in 2004 primarily resulted from an increase of $6.2 billion in average loans and securities due to organic growth, the January 2004 United National acquisition that added $1.9 billion of loans, and the comparative impact of our adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46 (Revised 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, (FIN 46) in the second half of 2003. During the third quarter of 2004, we reclassified on our Consolidated Balance Sheet certain assets related to the Market Street Funding Corporation (Market Street) conduit from purchased customer receivables to loans. These assets totaled $2.3 billion at December 31, 2004 and $2.2 billion at December 31, 2003. Our average total loans for 2004 included $1.9 billion related to Market Street while our average total loans for 2003 included $1.2 billion as a result of Market Street. Average loans for 2004 were $40.9 billion compared with $35.9 billion in 2003, an increase of $5.0 billion or 14%. Apart from the comparative impact of Market Street as a result of our adoption of FIN 46 as described above, the increase in average total loans was primarily attributable to growth in home equity loans of approximately $2.7 billion and commercial loans of approximately $1.3 billion, including the addition of loans from the United National acquisition. The effect of these increases was partially offset by a $.6 billion decline in lease financing loans. During the second quarter of 2004, we sold our vehicle leasing portfolio as more fully described in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of Item 7 of this Report. Loans represented 66% of average interest earning assets for 2004 compared with 65% for 2003. The term loans in this Report excludes loans held for sale and securities that represent interests in pools of loans. 16 Table of Contents Average securities totaled $15.9 billion in 2004 and $14.7 billion in 2003. Securities comprised 26% of average interest earning assets for 2004 compared with 27% for 2003. The increase in average securities in 2004 compared with the prior year was primarily due to increases in U.S. Treasury and government agencies/corporations securities, partially offset by a decline in other debt securities. Funding cost is affected by the volume and type of funding sources that we have as well as the rates that we pay on those sources. Average total deposits were $49.7 billion for 2004 compared with $44.5 billion for 2003. The increase in average total deposits was attributable to increased customer volumes and the acquisition of United National that added approximately $2.2 billion of average deposits. Average total deposits comprised 66% of total sources of funds for 2004 and 2003. Average transaction deposits were $35.9 billion for 2004 and $33.0 billion for 2003. Average borrowed funds increased to $12.5 billion for 2004 compared with $10.5 billion for 2003. The following contributed to this increase: The addition to our Consolidated Balance Sheet of $1.2 billion of junior subordinated debentures ($300 million of which was issued in December 2003) at December 31, 2003, the effective date that we deconsolidated our trust preferred securities under FIN 46, The comparative impact of the addition of commercial paper related to Market Street resulting from the adoption of FIN 46 in the second half of 2003, Our issuance of $600 million of subordinated notes in November 2003 and $500 million of subordinated notes in December 2004, and An increase in short term borrowings to fund asset growth. These increases in average borrowed funds were partially offset by Federal Home Loan Bank maturities of $1.3 billion and senior and subordinated debt maturities totaling $1.1 billion during 2004. LINE OF BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS We refer you to Item 1 of this Report for an overview of our business segments. Total business segment earnings were $1.266 billion for 2004 and $1.176 billion for 2003. Regional Community Banking Regional Community Bankings earnings were $504 million for 2004 and $477 million for 2003. Checking relationships as of December 31, 2004 grew 8% compared with December 31, 2003, while Regional Community Banking average loans grew 30% and average demand deposits grew 14% in 2004 compared with 2003. Earnings growth for 2004 reflected increased loan demand and focused efforts to increase and retain the customer base. The impact of these factors on results for 2004 was partially offset by higher noninterest expense and a higher provision for credit losses. Wholesale Banking Earnings from Wholesale Banking were $443 million for 2004 and $391 million for 2003. The benefit of a $116 million decline in the provision for credit losses, reflecting overall improved asset quality, and an increase in taxable equivalent net interest income resulting from higher average loan and deposit balances drove the improvement in 2004. These factors were partially offset by higher staff expense to support business growth initiatives and lower net gains on institutional loans held for sale. PNC Advisors PNC Advisors earned $106 million in 2004 and $89 million in 2003. The increased earnings reflected a pretax gain of $10 million, or $7 million after tax, from the sale of certain Hawthorn investment consulting activities, comparatively stronger equity markets, increased loan and deposit balances and lower noninterest expense, partially offset by the loss of earnings from the sold Hawthorn activities. BlackRock BlackRock reported earnings of $143 million for 2004 compared with $155 million for 2003. The decreased earnings in 2004 reflected a 20% increase in advisory fees driven by a growing base of assets under management as well as a total of $18 million in tax benefits recorded in the first and fourth quarters of 2004, more than offset by $66 million of after tax LTIP related charges. See the 2002 BlackRock Long term Retention and Incentive Plan section of Item 7 of this Report for additional information regarding the LTIP charges. BlackRocks assets under management totaled $342 billion at December 31, 2004, an increase of 10% compared with the prior year end level. The increase was attributable to net new subscriptions and market appreciation. PNC owns approximately 71% of BlackRock and we consolidate BlackRock into our financial statements. Accordingly, approximately 29% of BlackRocks earnings is recognized as minority interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income. BlackRock financial information in Item 7 of this Report is presented on a stand alone basis. The market value of our BlackRock shares was approximately $3.5 billion at December 31, 2004, while the book value at that date was $.6 billion. PFPC PFPC earned $70 million for 2004 and $64 million for 2003. The higher earnings were primarily attributable to increased fund servicing revenues, the divestiture of the retirement services business and the acquisition of ADVISORport, Inc., both executed in 2003. Improved results for 2004 also reflected net new and expanded business, expense savings initiatives and debt management. PFPCs accounting/administration net fund assets increased 10% and custody fund assets increased 12% as of December 31, 2004 compared with the balances at December 31, 2003. The increases were driven by improved equity market conditions, net new business and asset inflows from existing clients. Other The Other net loss for 2004 was $27 million compared with a net loss of $100 million in 2003. Equity management gains in 2004 and the comparative effect of $87 million of after tax charges related to the DOJ agreement reflected in the 2003 amounts more than offset the impact of lower net securities gains in 2004. The decline in Other revenue for 2004 compared with the prior year was primarily due to a decline in net interest income from asset and liability management activities and the impact of the second quarter 2004 sale of our vehicle leasing business. 17 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME REVIEW NET INTEREST INCOME OVERVIEW Changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of earning assets and related yields, interest bearing liabilities and related rates paid, and noninterest bearing sources. See Statistical Information Average Consolidated Balance Sheet and Net Interest Analysis in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. NET INTEREST INCOME GAAP RECONCILIATION The interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than a taxable investment. In order to provide more meaningful comparisons of yields and margins for all earning assets, the interest income earned on tax exempt assets has been increased to make them fully equivalent to other taxable interest income investments. A reconciliation of net interest income as reported in the Consolidated Statement of Income (GAAP basis) to net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis follows (in millions): For the year ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Net interest income, GAAP basis $1,969 $1,996 $2,197 Taxable equivalent adjustment 20 10 13 Net interest income, taxable equivalent basis $1,989 $2,006 $2,210 NET INTEREST MARGIN The net interest margin was 3.22% for 2004, a decline of 42 basis points compared with 2003. The following factors contributed to the decline in net interest margin in 2004: The low interest rate environment that persisted through 2004 resulted in the average yield on loans declining by 47 basis points for 2004 compared with 2003. The decline in loan yields was attributable to the level of interest rates, the repricing mix of our loan portfolio, competitive pricing pressure on commercial loans, more aggressive pricing on home equity loans and the sale of the vehicle leasing portfolio. While the average yield on loans declined 47 basis points as described above, the average rate paid on deposits declined only seven basis points in 2004 compared with the prior year. The average rate paid on money market accounts, the largest single component of interest bearing deposits, increased 13 basis points, reflecting the increase in short term interest rates that began in mid 2004. The increase in the average rate paid on money market accounts was more than offset by declines in average rates paid on other interest bearing deposits, resulting in the net decline of seven basis points in the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits during 2004. To the extent that securities were sold, prepaid or matured and were replaced, the average yield on our securities portfolio declined. This decline totaled 36 basis points for 2004 compared with 2003. See Note 18 Capital Securities of Subsidiary Trusts in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report regarding the impact of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. (SFAS) 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, and FIN 46 on the accounting for these instruments and the related impact on interest expense during 2003 and 2004. Consolidated net interest margin was negatively impacted by 13 basis points in 2004 and five basis points for 2003 resulting from the accounting for these instruments. The impact of the United National acquisition on 2004 taxable equivalent net interest income and net interest margin partially offset the factors described above. United National added approximately $123 million of net interest income and eight basis points to the net interest margin during 2004. See Consolidated Statement of Income Review under the 2003 Versus 2002 section of Item 7 of this Report for further information regarding 2002 taxable equivalent net interest income and margin. PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES The provision for credit losses was $52 million for 2004 compared with $177 million for 2003. The significant decline in the provision for credit losses compared with the prior year was primarily due to the overall improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio during 2004. This improved credit quality reflected a 46% decline in nonperforming loans since December 31, 2003 and a reduction in problems related to performing credits. The favorable impact of these factors on the provision was partially offset by the impact of overall loan growth in 2004. We expect the provision for credit losses to be higher in 2005 as a result of anticipated loan growth. See Allowances for Loan And Lease Losses And Unfunded Loan Commitments And Letters of Credit in the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report for additional information regarding factors impacting the provision for credit losses. NONINTEREST INCOME Summary Noninterest income totaled $3.563 billion for 2004 compared with $3.257 billion for 2003, an increase of $306 million, or 9%. 18 Table of Contents Higher noninterest income in 2004 reflected the following: An increase of $188 million, or 12%, in asset management and fund servicing fees combined, Equity management gains of $67 million in 2004 compared with equity management losses of $25 million in the prior year, Pretax gains totaling $57 million from three sale transactions that occurred during the first half of 2004 as described in the analysis of other noninterest income below, and The impact of the addition of United Nationals business, which contributed approximately $21 million of noninterest income during 2004. Lower net securities gains, lower trading revenue included in other noninterest income and lower gains from loan sales partially offset the impact of these positive factors in the comparison with 2003. Additional Analysis Combined asset management and fund servicing fees totaled $1.811 billion for 2004, an increase of $188 million compared with 2003. This increase reflected growth in assets managed and serviced, partially due to improved equity market conditions that began in 2003 and continued into 2004. Consolidated assets under management were $383 billion at December 31, 2004, an increase of $29 billion from December 31, 2003, primarily due to growth in assets managed by BlackRock. PFPC provided fund accounting/administration services for $721 billion of net fund investment assets at December 31, 2004 compared with $654 billion at December 31, 2003. PFPC also provided custody services for $451 billion of fund investment assets at December 31, 2004, an increase of $50 billion from the prior year end. Net new business, comparatively improved equity market conditions and asset inflows from existing clients all contributed to the increases in the PFPC statistics. Service charges on deposits totaled $252 million for 2004, an increase of $13 million or 5% compared with 2003. Additional checking relationships, which increased 8% as of December 31, 2004, drove the improvement in this area. Brokerage fees totaled $219 million for 2004 and $184 million for 2003. The 19% increase compared with 2003 reflected higher non trade, fee based brokerage revenue. Consumer services fees grew 5% in 2004, to $264 million, compared with the prior year. Higher fees for 2004 were partially due to additional fees from debit card transactions that reflected higher volumes, including the impact of United National customers, partially offset by the impact of the sale of certain out of footprint ATMs. Visa settled litigation in 2003 with major retailers regarding pricing and usage of customer debit cards. The settlement effectively lowered prices paid by merchants to Visa and its member banks beginning August 1, 2003. Although PNC was not a defendant in the litigation, the settlement lowered future revenue from certain debit card transactions. The lost revenue impact to PNC in 2004 was approximately $10 million and for 2003 was approximately $6 million. Corporate services revenue was $473 million for 2004, a decline of $12 million or 2% compared with 2003. Net gains in excess of valuation adjustments related to our liquidation of institutional loans held for sale are reflected in this line item and totaled $52 million for 2004 compared with $69 million for 2003. As the liquidation of institutional loans held for sale is essentially complete, any additional gains in 2005 will be minimal. Higher fees related to an increase in commercial mortgage servicing activities and higher letters of credit fees partially offset the decline in net gains on institutional loans held for sale compared with the prior year. Equity management (private equity activities) net gains on portfolio investments totaled $67 million for 2004 compared with net losses of $25 million for 2003. See Private Equity Asset Valuation in the Critical Accounting Policies And Judgments section and Market Risk Management Equity And Other Investment Risk in the Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report for further information. Net securities gains were $55 million in 2004 compared with $116 million in 2003. Net securities gains for 2003 included $25 million related to the liquidation that year of the three entities formed in 2001 in the PAGIC transactions. Other noninterest income totaled $422 million for 2004, an increase of $38 million or 10% compared with 2003. Other noninterest income typically fluctuates from year to year depending on the nature and magnitude of transactions completed. Other noninterest income for 2004 included the following: A $34 million pretax gain related to the sale of our modified coinsurance contracts as described under DIG B36 Impact on 2003 Results and 2004 Sale of Modified Coinsurance Contracts below, A $13 million pretax gain recognized during the second quarter of 2004 in connection with BlackRocks sale of its interest in Trepp LLC, and A $10 million pretax gain related to the first quarter 2004 sale of certain investment consulting activities of the Hawthorn unit of PNC Advisors. In addition to these items, the increase in other noninterest income for 2004 compared with the prior year included the recognition of $25 million of private equity dividends in 2004 and the comparative impact of $12 million related to the mid 2003 adoption of FIN 46. Partially offsetting the impact of these items on other noninterest income was a $7 million decline in leasing revenue resulting from the 2004 sale of our vehicle leasing business and a $14 million decline in the component of trading revenue included in other noninterest income for 2004 compared with the prior year. See Trading Risk within the Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report and Note 8 Trading Activities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. 19 Table of Contents DIG B36 IMPACT ON 2003 RESULTS AND 2004 SALE OF MODIFIED COINSURANCE CONTRACTS As required by the FASB, effective October 1, 2003 we adopted the provisions of Derivatives Implementation Group Statement 133 Implementation Issue No. B36, Embedded Derivatives: Modified Coinsurance Arrangements and Debt Instruments That Incorporate Credit Risk Exposures That Are Unrelated or Only Partially Related to the Creditworthiness of the Obligor under Those Instruments (DIG B36), for our annuity coinsurance agreements. Our initial adoption of the provisions of DIG B36 to existing coinsurance agreements as of October 1, 2003 was reported in our Consolidated Statement of Income as the cumulative effect of an accounting change and reduced both fourth quarter and full year 2003 net income by $28 million, or $.10 per diluted share. Subsequent to initial adoption, other noninterest income increased by $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 as a result of DIG B36. During the first quarter of 2004, we recognized a $34 million pretax gain on the sale of our modified coinsurance contracts. We continue to sell various annuity products from which we earn commission income as further described under Product Revenue below. PRODUCT REVENUE Wholesale Banking offers treasury management, capital markets, commercial loan servicing and equipment leasing products that are marketed by several businesses across PNC. Treasury management revenue, which includes fees as well as revenue from customer deposit balances, totaled $373 million for 2004 compared with $360 million 2003. Treasury management revenue has increased due to the longer term nature of treasury management deposits and increased product sales, partially offset by the industry shift toward electronic payment service, which has lower revenue per item than check payment service. Consolidated revenue from capital markets totaled $140 million for 2004 and $119 million for 2003. The revenue growth was driven primarily by increased client related trading revenue and increased loan syndication fees. Midland Loan Services offers servicing and technology solutions for the commercial real estate finance industry. Midlands revenue, which includes fees as well as revenue from servicing deposit balances, totaled $108 million in 2004 compared with $96 million for 2003. The revenue growth was driven primarily by growth in the servicing portfolio and related services. Consolidated revenue from equipment leasing products totaled $84 million for both 2004 and 2003. We changed our product mix during 2004 as we no longer engage in higher spread, cross border leases but have shifted to more traditional leasing products. As a component of our advisory services to clients, we provide a select set of insurance products to fulfill specific customer financial needs. Primary insurance offerings include: Annuities, Credit life, Health, Disability, and Commercial lines coverage. Client segments served by these insurance solutions include those in PNC Advisors, Regional Community Banking and Wholesale Banking. Insurance products are sold by PNC licensed insurance agents and through licensed third party arrangements. We recognized revenue of $65 million in 2004 and $54 million in 2003. The increase in revenue compared with the prior year reflects the recognition of 100% of annuity sales commissions that began in 2004 following the sale of our annuity reinsurance contracts. Additionally, through our subsidiary companies, PNC Insurance Corp. and Alpine Indemnity Limited, we act as a reinsurer for credit life and accident and health insurance provided to customers of our subsidiaries. We also write, assume and cede insurance for property, workers compensation, commercial general liability and automobile liability of PNC and its affiliates. In the normal course of business PNC Insurance Corp. and Alpine Indemnity Limited maintain insurance reserves for reported claims and for claims incurred but not reported based on actuarial assessments. NONINTEREST EXPENSE Total noninterest expense was $3.735 billion for 2004, an increase of $259 million or 7% compared with $3.476 billion in 2003. The efficiency ratio was 68% for 2004 and 66% for 2003. Noninterest expense for 2004 included the following: Pretax charges totaling $110 million, including $96 million recorded in the third quarter, associated with the BlackRock LTIP. Total LTIP charges were comprised of $102 million of compensation expense, $2 million of employee benefits and $6 million of Other noninterest expense; Costs totaling approximately $78 million resulting from our first quarter 2004 acquisition of United National, including approximately $11 million of conversion related and other nonrecurring costs. The impact of these costs was reflected in several noninterest expense line items in our Consolidated Statement of Income and was included almost entirely in the Regional Community Banking business segment; A $22 million reduction in the benefit of accretion related to a discounted PFPC client contract liability that ended during the second quarter of 2004; 20 Table of Contents The fourth quarter 2004 benefit of $9 million resulting from the settlement of certain claims related to the 2001 PAGIC transactions; Expenses totaling $8 million in connection with the sale of our vehicle leasing business during the second quarter of 2004; and A $6 million impairment charge on an intangible asset related to the orderly liquidation of a particular fund managed by BlackRock. We recognized this charge during the first quarter of 2004. In addition to these items, the increase in noninterest expense for 2004 compared with the prior year included the impact of the following items, which had no effect on 2004 consolidated net income: An increase of $30 million related to the mid 2003 adoption of FIN 46, and An increase of $22 million in PFPC out of pocket and pass through expenses which are offset in noninterest income. Noninterest expense for 2003 included the impact of the following items: Expenses totaling $120 million recognized in connection with a subsidiarys second quarter 2003 agreement with the DOJ, including $5 million of related legal and consulting costs; Costs totaling $29 million paid in connection with our 2003 liquidation of the three entities formed in 2001 in the PAGIC transactions. The impact of these costs was mostly offset by related net securities gains included in noninterest income; Distributions on capital securities totaling $28 million; Facilities charges totaling $25 million related to leased space consistent with the requirements of SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities; and A $25 million benefit from the vehicle leasing settlement during the fourth quarter of 2003, as described in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Report. Apart from the items described above, noninterest expense for 2004 increased $169 million compared with 2003. Higher expenses in 2004 were primarily attributable to higher sales based compensation, stock based incentive compensation and marketing costs. These charges more than offset the benefit of lower pension expense in the comparison and an $87 million incremental benefit in 2004 from efficiency initiatives. We expect that the cost of our executive risk insurance will decrease in 2005 relative to the current level. We expensed approximately $28 million related to this insurance in 2004 and expect 2005 expense to total approximately $20 million. Executive risk insurance includes the following types of coverage: Financial institution bond, Directors and officers liability, Professional and fiduciary liability, and Employment practices liability. We expect to recognize a benefit to earnings from our pension plan activity in 2005 compared with expense in 2004. See the Status of Defined Benefit Pension Plan section of Item 7 of this Report for further information. EFFECTIVE TAX RATE Our effective tax rate for 2004 was 30.8% compared with 33.7% for 2003. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2004 was primarily attributable to the following: A reduced state and local tax expense due to tax benefits of $18 million recorded in connection with New York state and city audits, principally associated with BlackRock, A $14 million reduction in income tax expense following our determination in the third quarter of 2004 that we no longer required an income tax reserve related to bank owned life insurance, and The $8 million tax effect of the non deductible component of the second quarter 2003 expenses related to the DOJ agreement. 21 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET REVIEW SUMMARIZED BALANCE SHEET DATA December 31 in millions 2004 2003 Assets Loans, net of unearned income $43,495 $36,303 Securities available for sale and held to maturity 16,761 15,690 Loans held for sale 1,670 1,400 Other 17,797 14,775 Total assets $79,723 $68,168 Liabilities Funding sources $65,233 $56,694 Other 6,513 4,367 Total liabilities 71,746 61,061 Minority and noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities 504 462 Total shareholders equity 7,473 6,645 Total liabilities, minority and noncontrolling interests, and shareholders equity $79,723 $68,168 The summarized balance sheet data above is based upon our Consolidated Balance Sheet in Item 8 of this Report. The $11.6 billion increase in total assets at December 31, 2004 compared with December 31, 2003 was primarily driven by the following: The impact of our January 2004 acquisition of United National, Organic growth in total loans, Increases in other assets, other short term investments and goodwill, and A larger securities portfolio. An analysis of changes in selected balance sheet categories follows. LOANS, NET OF UNEARNED INCOME Loans increased $7.2 billion, or 20%, as of December 31, 2004 compared with December 31, 2003. The increase in total loans reflected the following: Home equity loans increased $2.9 billion, reflecting organic growth and the purchase of approximately $660 million of home equity loans in early 2004, Demand for commercial loans grew during the year, reflected in the $2.4 billion increase in this loan category, and Automobile and other consumer loans combined increased $.8 billion. The favorable impact of these factors on our loan balances was partially offset by the effect of the sale of the vehicle leasing portfolio in 2004. We added $1.9 billion of loans with the United National acquisition in 2004, as reflected in various loan categories.

The loans that we hold are also diversified across the geographic areas where we do business. As shown in the table below, the types of commercial loans and unfunded commitments in our Wholesale Banking business remained concentrated in investment grade equivalent exposure and secured lending.

Cross border Leases and Related Tax Matters The equipment lease portfolio totaled $3.9 billion at December 31, 2004 and included approximately $1.7 billion of cross border leases. Cross border leases are primarily leveraged leases of equipment located in foreign countries, primarily in western Europe and Australia. We no longer enter into new cross border lease transactions. 22 Table of Contents Aggregate residual value at risk on the total commercial lease portfolio at December 31, 2004 was $1.1 billion. We have taken steps to mitigate $.7 billion of this residual risk, including residual value insurance coverage with third parties, third party guarantees, and other actions. Approximately $.4 billion of this risk was unmitigated at December 31, 2004. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA) limits the tax deductions that may be taken in a given year related to certain lease transactions, including the types of cross border lease transactions that we have previously entered into. However, AJCA impacts only cross border lease transactions entered into after March 12, 2004. All of our cross border lease transactions were entered into prior to this date and are therefore not affected by AJCA. While only transactions entered into after March 12, 2004 are specifically impacted, AJCA is clear that no inference should be drawn as to the proper tax treatment of transactions entered into on or before this date. Thus, the tax treatment of existing transactions is still subject to challenge by the IRS. As part of the audit of our 1998 2000 consolidated federal income tax returns, the IRS has proposed adjustments to the following cross border lease transactions that we have previously entered into: Two lease in, lease out transactions, Seven qualified technological equipment leases, and Three lease to service contract transactions. The proposed adjustments would reverse the tax treatment of these transactions as we reported them on our filed tax returns. We believe the method used to report these transactions in our filed tax returns is supported by appropriate tax law and intend to pursue resolution of the matter through the appropriate IRS administrative appeal remedies. While we cannot predict with certainty the result of pursuing the administrative appeal remedies, any resolution would most likely involve a change in the timing of tax deductions which in turn, depending on the exact resolution, could significantly impact the economics of these transactions. However, we believe our reserves for this exposure were adequate at December 31, 2004. Further, the FASB has begun to consider whether any change in the timing of tax benefits associated with these transactions should result in a recalculation under SFAS 13, Accounting for Leases, and whether a lessor should re evaluate the classification of a leveraged lease when a recalculation of the lease is performed. In March 2005, the FASB directed its staff to issue a proposed staff position on this issue. If the FASB ultimately decides companies must recalculate and re evaluate leveraged lease classification, the impact on us could be material. For example, a cumulative adjustment to earnings could be required and the leases may no longer qualify as leveraged leases. Since the FASB has not finalized any guidance and we have not reached any settlement with the IRS, we cannot currently estimate the potential impact. Even though we intend to pursue resolution with the IRS through administrative appeal remedies, it is possible we will be unable to reach a settlement. If we are unable to reach settlement, we will evaluate other options, including litigation. There is, of course, no guarantee as to the outcome of litigation. In addition to the transactions described above, two lease to service contract transactions that we were party to were structured as partnerships for tax purposes. We have been informed that the partnerships are under audit by the IRS. However, we do not believe that our exposure from these transactions is material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The IRS is also beginning an audit of our 2001 2003 consolidated federal income tax returns. We expect them to again propose adjustments to the cross border lease transactions described above as well as to new cross border lease transactions entered in these years. VEHICLE AND AIRCRAFT LEASING BUSINESSES During the fourth quarter of 2003, we recognized the benefit of a $25 million settlement related to our vehicle leasing business. We reached this settlement with insurance carriers regarding certain residual value claims for which a reserve had been provided in 2001. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the sale of our subsidiary, PNC Vehicle Leasing LLC, and the related vehicle lease portfolio and other assets. In connection with this transaction, we also terminated our related residual insurance policies with our remaining residual insurance carrier. As a result of these actions, we have completed the exit of the consumer vehicle leasing business, including our related exposures to the used vehicle market and the payment of future residual insurance claims. We recognized a pretax net loss of $3 million related to this sale during the second quarter of 2004. On September 1, 2004, we acquired the business of the Aviation Finance Group, LLC (AFG), an Idaho based company that specializes in loans to finance private aircraft. Historically, AFG has originated a diversified loan portfolio with average individual loan balances of approximately $2 million and a loan to value ratio below 70%. AFGs loan volume has exceeded $150 million annually over the past few years. By combining the business of AFG with our existing business, we expect to increase our ability to offer a variety of loans and leasing products to corporate aircraft customers. See Note 3 Acquisitions in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. 23 Table of Contents Net Unfunded Credit Commitments December 31 in millions 2004 2003 Commercial $20,020 $18,065 Consumer 7,654 5,774 Commercial real estate 1,199 767 Education loans 279 252 Lease financing 153 85 Institutional lending repositioning 3 85 Other 38 155 Total $29,346 $25,183 Commitments to extend credit represent arrangements to lend funds or provide liquidity subject to specified contractual conditions. Commercial commitments are reported net of participations, assignments and syndications, primarily to financial institutions, totaling $6.7 billion at December 31, 2004 and $6.4 billion at December 31, 2003. The increase in consumer net unfunded commitments at December 31, 2004 compared with the balance at December 31, 2003 was primarily due to net unfunded commitments related to organic growth, our first quarter 2004 purchase of a portfolio of home equity loans and the acquisition of United National. Unfunded credit commitments related to Market Street totaled $962 million at December 31, 2004 and $911 million at December 31, 2003 and are included in the preceding table primarily within the Commercial and Consumer categories. See the Off Balance Sheet Arrangements And Consolidated VIEs section of Item 7 and Note 2 Variable Interest Entities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for further information regarding Market Street. In addition to credit commitments, our net outstanding standby letters of credit totaled $3.7 billion at December 31, 2004 and $4.0 billion at December 31, 2003. Standby letters of credit commit us to make payments on behalf of our customers if specified future events occur. Securities Details Of Securities In millions Amortized Cost Fair Value December 31, 2004 SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE Debt securities U.S. Treasury and government agencies $ 4,735 $ 4,722 Mortgage backed 8,506 8,433 Commercial mortgage backed 1,380 1,370 Asset backed 1,910 1,901 State and municipal 175 176 Other debt 33 33 Corporate stocks and other 123 125 Total securities available for sale $ 16,862 $ 16,760 SECURITIES HELD TO MATURITY Debt securities Asset backed $1 $1 Total securities held to maturity $1 $1 December 31, 2003 SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE Debt securities U.S. Treasury and government agencies $ 3,402 $ 3,416 Mortgage backed 5,889 5,814 Commercial mortgage backed 3,248 3,310 Asset backed 2,698 2,692 State and municipal 133 135 Other debt 55 57 Corporate stocks and other 259 264 Total securities available for sale $ 15,684 $ 15,688 SECURITIES HELD TO MATURITY Debt securities Asset backed $2 $2 Total securities held to maturity $2 $2 Securities represented 21% of total assets at December 31, 2004 compared with 23% at December 31, 2003. The increase in total securities compared with December 31, 2003 was primarily due to increases in U.S. Treasury and government agencies and mortgage backed securities, partially offset by declines in commercial mortgage backed and asset backed securities. At December 31, 2004, the securities available for sale balance included a net unrealized loss of $102 million, which represented the difference between fair value and amortized cost. The comparable amount at December 31, 2003 was a net unrealized gain of $4 million. The impact on bond prices of increases in interest rates during 2004 was reflected in the net unrealized loss position at December 31, 2004. 24 Table of Contents The fair value of securities available for sale decreases when interest rates increase and vice versa. Further increases in interest rates after December 31, 2004, if sustained, will adversely impact the fair value of securities available for sale in 2005 compared with the balance at year end. Net unrealized gains and losses in the securities available for sale portfolio are included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax. The expected weighted average life of securities available for sale was 2 years and 8 months at December 31, 2004 compared with 2 years and 11 months at December 31, 2003. We estimate the effective duration of securities available for sale is 2.7 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel increase in interest rates and 2.3 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in interest rates. LOANS HELD FOR SALE Education loans held for sale totaled $1.1 billion at December 31, 2004 and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2003 and represented the majority of our loans held for sale at each date. We classify substantially all of our education loans as loans held for sale. Generally, we sell education loans when the loans are placed into repayment status. Gains on sales of education loans totaled $30 million for 2004, $20 million for 2003 and $23 million for 2002. These gains are reflected in the Other noninterest income line item in our Consolidated Statement of Income and in the results of the Regional Community Banking segment. Loans held for sale remaining from our 2001 institutional lending repositioning totaled $5 million at December 31, 2004 and $70 million at December 31, 2003. Our liquidation of institutional loans held for sale resulted in net gains in excess of valuation adjustments of $52 million in 2004, $69 million in 2003 and $147 million in 2002. These gains are reflected in the Corporate Services line item in our Consolidated Statement of Income and in the results of the Wholesale Banking business segment. As the liquidation of institutional loans held for sale is essentially complete, any additional gains in 2005 will be minimal. OTHER ASSETS The increase of $3.0 billion in Assets Other in the Summarized Balance Sheet Data table above includes an increase of $1.1 billion in other short term investments and the impact of a $.6 billion increase in goodwill. Goodwill recorded in connection with the 2004 United National acquisition totaled $553 million and $35 million of goodwill was recorded during the third quarter of 2004 related to the AFG acquisition. CAPITAL AND FUNDING SOURCES Details Of Funding Sources December 31 in millions 2004 2003 Deposits Money market $21,250 $19,398 Demand 15,996 14,861 Retail certificates of deposit 9,969 8,142 Savings 2,851 2,114 Other time 833 380 Time deposits in foreign offices 2,370 346 Total deposits 53,269 45,241 Borrowed funds Federal funds purchased 219 169 Repurchase agreements 1,376 1,081 Bank notes and senior debt 2,383 2,823 Subordinated debt 4,050 3,729 Commercial paper (a) 2,251 2,226 Other borrowed funds 1,685 1,425 Total borrowed funds 11,964 11,453 Total $65,233 $56,694 (a) Attributable to Market Street. Total funding sources increased $8.5 billion, or 15%, from December 31, 2003. This increase reflected the impact of the following 2004 developments: Our United National acquisition, An 8% increase in checking relationships, An increase in time deposits in foreign offices that reflected our increased use of eurodollar deposits as a short term funding mechanism, The issuance of $500 million of 18 month, floating rate bank notes in September 2004 and $500 million of 5.25% subordinated bank notes due 2017 in December 2004, and An increase in other short term borrowings to fund asset growth. These increases were partially offset by debt maturities of $2.4 billion during 2004. 25 Table of Contents Capital We manage our capital position by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing debt and equity instruments, making treasury stock transactions, maintaining dividend policies and retaining earnings. The increase of $.8 billion, to $7.5 billion, in total shareholders equity at December 31, 2004 compared with the prior year end was primarily attributable to $360 million of common stock issued as part of the January 2004 United National acquisition and a higher retention of earnings through 2004 in anticipation of the SSRM acquisition by BlackRock and the pending acquisition of Riggs. Partially offsetting this increase was a decline in the fair value of securities available for sale and cash flow hedge derivatives due to the impact of rising interest rates that began during the second quarter of 2004 and continued into the latter half of the year. These fair value changes are captured in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of shareholders equity. See Note 26 Comprehensive Income in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. Common shares outstanding at December 31, 2004 were 282.6 million, an increase of 6 million over December 31, 2003, principally due to the issuance of common shares for the acquisition of United National. In January 2002, the Board of Directors authorized us to purchase up to 35 million shares of our common stock through February 29, 2004. Under this program, we purchased 10.8 million common shares during 2003 at a total cost of $507.8 million and .7 million shares at a total cost of $41.5 million during 2004. In February 2004, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 20 million shares of our common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions. The 2004 repurchase authorization was a replacement and continuation of the prior repurchase program. Under this program, we purchased 3.0 million common shares during 2004 at a total cost of $165.6 million. As of February 16, 2005, the 2004 program was terminated, and a new program to purchase up to 20 million shares was authorized. This program will remain in effect until fully utilized or until modified, superseded or terminated. The extent and timing of share repurchases under the 2005 program will depend on a number of factors including, among others, market and general economic conditions, economic and regulatory capital considerations, alternative uses of capital, and the potential impact on our credit rating. The pending acquisition of Riggs and BlackRocks acquisition of SSRM will cause us to constrain share purchases over the next several quarters as we seek to maintain our capital position.

However, these securities remained a component of Tier 1 risk based capital at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 based upon guidance from the Federal Reserve. (b) The federal banking agencies jointly issued a final rule amending their risk based capital standards regarding the capital treatment for certain asset backed commercial paper programs. This final rule ended the regulatory capital relief previously granted through July 1, 2004 with respect to the Market Street conduit. The impact on our risk based capital ratios with respect to the Market Street conduit is minimal at December 31, 2004 but the ratios may decrease slightly after the transition period ends September 30, 2005. The access to, and cost of, funding new business initiatives including acquisitions, the ability to engage in expanded business activities, the ability to pay dividends, the level of deposit insurance costs, and the level and nature of regulatory oversight depend, in part, on a financial institutions capital strength. The declines in the capital ratios at December 31, 2004 compared with the ratios at December 31, 2003 reflected the growth in our Consolidated Balance Sheet during 2004. At December 31, 2004, each of our banking subsidiaries was considered well capitalized based on regulatory capital ratio requirements. See the Supervision And Regulation section of Item 1 of this Report and Note 4 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. We believe our bank subsidiaries will continue to meet these requirements in 2005. 26 Table of Contents OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND VIES We engage in a variety of activities that involve unconsolidated entities or that are otherwise not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet that are generally referred to as off balance sheet arrangements. The following sections of this Report provide further information on these types of activities: Commitments, including contractual obligations and other commitments, included within the Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report, and Note 28 Commitments and Guarantees included in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. The following provides a summary of variable interest entities (VIEs), including those that we have consolidated into our financial statements and those that remained unconsolidated as of December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, the aggregate assets and debt of VIEs that we have consolidated in our financial statements are as follows: Consolidated VIEs PNC Is Primary Beneficiary In millions AggregateAssets AggregateDebt December 31, 2004 Market Street $2,167 $2,167 Partnership interests in low income housing projects 504 504 Other 13 10 Total consolidated VIEs $2,684 $2,681 December 31, 2003 Market Street $2,146 $2,146 Partnership interests in low income housing projects 436 436 Total consolidated VIEs $2,582 $2,582 Market Street is a multi seller asset backed commercial paper conduit that is independently owned and managed. The activities of Market Street are limited to the purchase of, or making of, loans secured by interests primarily in pools of receivables from U.S. corporations that desire access to the commercial paper market. Market Street funds the purchase or making of loans by issuing commercial paper. Market Streets commercial paper has been rated A1/P1 by Standard & Poors and Moodys. We hold no ownership interest in Market Street, but are considered to be the primary beneficiary. All of Market Streets assets at December 31, 2004 and 2003 collateralize the commercial paper obligations. These assets are primarily classified as loans on our consolidated balance sheet. Neither creditors nor equity investors in Market Street have any recourse to the general credit of PNC. Market Street results are reflected in our Wholesale Banking segment. Certain equity investments are made by us in various limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects utilizing the Low Income Housing Tax Credit pursuant to Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital, to facilitate the sale of additional affordable housing product offerings and to assist PNC in achieving goals associated with the Community Reinvestment Act. The primary activities of the limited partnerships include the identification, development and operation of multi family housing that is leased to qualifying residential tenants. Generally, these types of investments are funded through a combination of debt and equity, with equity typically comprising 30% to 60% of the total project capital. We own a majority of the limited partnership interests in these entities. We also consolidated certain entities in which we, as a national syndicator of affordable housing equity, serves as the general partner (together with the aforementioned limited partnership investments, the LIHTC investments), and no other entity owns a majority of the limited partnership interests. In these syndication transactions, we create funds in which our subsidiary is the general partner and sells limited partnership interests to third parties, and in some cases may also purchase a limited partnership interest in the fund. The funds limited partners can generally remove the general partner without cause at any time. The purpose of this business is to generate income from the syndication of these funds and to generate servicing fees from the management of the funds. General partner activities include selecting, evaluating, structuring, negotiating, and closing the funds investments in operating limited partnerships, as well as oversight of the ongoing operations of the fund portfolio. The assets are primarily included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Neither creditors nor equity investors in the LIHTC investments have any recourse to the general credit of PNC. The LIHTC investments are reflected in our Wholesale Banking segment. 27 Table of Contents We also hold significant variable interests in other VIEs that have not been consolidated because we are not considered the primary beneficiary. Information on these VIEs follows: Non Consolidated VIEs Significant Variable Interests In millions AggregateAssets Aggregate Debt PNC Equity/ Maximum EquityExposure December 31, 2004 Collateralized debt obligations (a) $3,152 $2,700 $36 Private investment funds (a) 1,872 125 33 Other partnership interests in low income housing projects 37 28 4 Total significant variable interests $5,061 $2,853 $73 December 31, 2003 Collateralized debt obligations (a) $2,740 $2,370 $38 Private investment funds (a) 375 227 5 Other partnership interests in low income housing projects 41 30 5 Private investment funds (managed by Hawthorn unit) (b) 1,144 1,144 3 Total significant variable interests $4,300 $3,771 $51 (a) Held by BlackRock. (b) Management of the funds was transferred as part of the sale of certain investment consulting activities of PNC Advisors Hawthorn unit during first quarter 2004. BlackRock is involved with various entities in the normal course of business that may be deemed to be VIEs and may hold interests therein, including investment advisory agreements and equity securities, which may be considered variable interests. BlackRock engages in these transactions principally to address client needs through the launch of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and private investment funds. BlackRock has not been deemed the primary beneficiary of these entities. We have a significant variable interest in certain other limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects. We do not own a majority of the limited partnership interests in these entities and are not the primary beneficiary. We use the equity method to account for our investment in these entities. We also have subsidiaries that invest in and act as the investment manager for a private equity fund that is organized as a limited partnership as part of our equity management activity. The fund invests in private equity investments to generate capital appreciation and profits. As permitted by FIN 46, we have deferred applying the provisions of the interpretation for this entity pending further action by the FASB.

Banking businesses include regional community banking, wholesale banking and wealth management. Our treasury management activities, which include cash and investment management, receivables management, disbursement services and global trade services; capital markets products, which include foreign exchange, derivatives and loan syndications; and equipment leasing products are offered through Wholesale Banking and marketed by several businesses across PNC. Results of individual businesses are presented based on our management accounting practices and our operating structure. There is no comprehensive, authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP); therefore, the financial results of individual businesses are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company. We refine our methodologies from time to time as our management accounting practices are enhanced and our businesses change. Financial results are presented, to the extent practicable, as if each business operated on a stand alone basis. We changed our financial reporting for our business segments beginning with first quarter 2004 reporting and restated all prior period amounts to conform with the new methodology. The principal changes to our segment reporting are as follows: We replaced the assignment of securities or funds to balance net assets for each business segment with a funds transfer pricing methodology. We removed the impact of our asset and liability management function from the business segments. This is now reflected in the results of Other. The Wholesale Banking business segment captures the results that were previously reported separately as Corporate Banking, PNC Real Estate Finance and PNC Business Credit to more accurately reflect the integrated operating strategy of this business. We have implemented a new capital measurement methodology based on the concept of economic capital for Regional Community Banking, Wholesale Banking, PNC Advisors and PFPC. However, we increased the capital assigned to Regional Community Banking to 6% of funds to reflect the capital required for well capitalized banks and to approximate market comparables for this business. The capital for BlackRock reflects legal entity shareholders equity consistent with BlackRocks separate public financial statement disclosures. We have allocated the allowance for loan and lease losses based on our assessment of risk inherent in the loan portfolios. Our allocation of the costs incurred by operations and other support areas not directly aligned with the businesses is primarily based on the use of services. Total business segment financial results differ from total consolidated results. The impact of these differences is primarily reflected in minority interest in income of BlackRock and in the Other category in the Results of Business Summary table that follows.

BlackRock in 2003 and PFPC for both years are presented on a book (GAAP) basis. The interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than a taxable investment. To provide more meaningful comparisons of yields and margins for all earning assets, the interest income earned on tax exempt assets has been increased to make them fully equivalent to other taxable interest income investments. A reconciliation of total consolidated revenue on a book basis to total consolidated revenue on a taxable equivalent basis is as follows (in millions): December 31 2004 December 31 2003 Total consolidated revenue, book (GAAP) basis $5,532 $5,253 Taxable equivalent adjustment 20 10 Total consolidated revenue, taxable equivalent basis $5,552 $5,263 (b) Percentages for BlackRock reflect return on equity.

(b) During the first quarter of 2004, management changed its policy for recognizing charge offs on smaller nonperforming commercial loans. This change resulted in the recognition of an additional $24 million of gross charge offs for the first quarter of 2004. For the remaining nine months of 2004, this portion of the portfolio experienced a reduction in gross charge offs and an increase in recoveries from expected levels. The impact of this change in future periods is not expected to be significant. (c) Included in other noninterest income. Regional Community Banking earnings increased $27 million in 2004 compared with 2003. Growth in customer relationships, loans and deposits combined with the United National acquisition produced a 10% increase in revenues. The revenue increase was partially offset by a 10% increase in noninterest expenses and a 55% increase in the segments provision for credit losses. Performance highlights for Regional Community Banking for 2004 include: A 14% increase in average demand deposit balances over 2003, which was driven by an 8% increase in consumer and small business checking account relationships. Approximately 60% of this net growth in checking relationships was from new customers with the remainder attributable to the acquisition of United National. Small business relationships grew by 13%, and drove growth in commercial loans and small business deposits. Approximately 60% of the growth in relationships resulted from accelerated acquisition of new customers while the remaining increase was attributable to United National. This increase was driven by additional sales staff, including increased small business customer calling efforts by branch managers. Average loans for 2004 increased $4.1 billion or 30% over 2003 levels driven by strong consumer and small business loan demand. Approximately 38% of this dollar increase in loans was attributable to United National. 31 Table of Contents A continuation of efforts to expand and optimize the configuration of the branch network. During the year, we opened six stand alone and 13 in store branches, and acquired 47 branches from United National. These additions to the branch network, partially offset by the consolidation and sale of certain branches, increased the network total to 774 branches. The percentage of our consumers banking with us online continued to increase. As of December 2004, 45% of our consumer checking relationships were utilizing web based banking options compared with 41% a year earlier. Taxable equivalent net interest income increased $137 million in 2004 primarily due to loan growth of 30% and deposit balance growth of 7%. The benefits of the loan and deposit growth were partially offset by a lower value assigned to deposits and additional carrying costs related to goodwill associated with United National. All of the goodwill associated with the United National acquisition is reflected in the Regional Community Banking segment. Noninterest income increased by $44 million over 2003 driven by the increase in checking relationships, higher income from payment related products such as debit card and merchant services, and higher gains on sales of education loans and the sale of two branches. These increases were partially offset by a decline in ATM surcharge revenue related to our strategic downsizing of out of footprint ATMs. Investment revenues decreased $4 million due to a reduced customer demand for fixed annuity products. In 2004 we also introduced free checking for small business customers and free web bill pay for consumers, and increased penetration of free checking for consumers initiatives geared toward improving customer acquisition and retention but which negatively impacted fee income growth. The 2004 provision for credit losses increased by $22 million over 2003. The larger provision was driven mainly by loan growth and managements decision earlier in 2004 to change the charge off policy for commercial loans less than $250,000. Overall credit quality indicators are currently stable and have improved over 2003. Home equity FICO scores, loan to value ratios and accounts 90 days past due improved. We update FICO scores for each account on a quarterly basis. While we are committed to lending within a moderate risk profile, further improvements in credit quality are not anticipated for 2005. Provisions for credit losses are expected to increase commensurate with loan growth in the coming year. Noninterest expenses in 2004 included $75 million of costs related to the acquisition of United National, including $11 million of conversion related and other nonrecurring costs. Approximately $17 million in expense growth can be attributed to the build out of our branch network (in store branches associated with the Stop & Shop initiative and standalone branch sites), expansion of the small business sales force, increased marketing and sales activities, as well as higher technology expenditures related to investments in teller and back office operations to increase productivity, improve service and strengthen risk management processes. We have adopted a relationship based lending strategy to target homeowners, small businesses and auto dealerships while seeking to maintain a moderate risk profile in the loan portfolio. Home equity loans grew by $2.5 billion or 30% on average for 2004 compared with the prior year. The increase is primarily attributable to continued strength in loan demand, the United National acquisition and the purchase of a $660 million portfolio in the first quarter of 2004. Home equity loans have experienced strong growth over the recent periods of low interest rates. We would expect future growth rates to moderate as interest rates rise. Average commercial loans grew 25% on the strength of increased loan demand from existing customers, the United National acquisition and an increase in the rate of small business customer acquisition. Floor plan and indirect loan portfolios grew 15% and 77% respectively over 2003 levels due to managed increases in our dealer portfolio through new relationships, the United National acquisition and a renewed emphasis on indirect lending. Residential mortgage loans increased $293 million due to the addition of a $518 million portfolio associated with the United National acquisition. The overall portfolio is decreasing as payoffs occur. This trend is expected to continue in 2005. Growth in core deposits as a low cost source of funding is one of the primary objectives of our checking relationship growth strategy. Average total deposits increased $2.4 billion or 7% on average in 2004 compared with the prior year. The deposit growth was driven by increases in the number of checking and savings relationships and the United National acquisition. Average consumer and small business demand deposits grew 14% over last year driven by the growth in our customer base and the acquisition of United National. For the year, the growth rate in balances, particularly in the consumer segment, exceeded the growth rate in relationships, as customers were hesitant to move funds into perceived higher risk alternatives such as equities, bonds or long term CDs during a period of low interest rates and economic uncertainty. As such, we expect the future average demand deposit balance growth rate to be closer to the customer growth rate. Customer integration and retention efforts for United National have been successful as evidenced by a stable customer base and deposit portfolio since the transaction was completed. Checking relationship retention has improved and benefited from the increased penetration rates of debit card, online banking and online bill payment products and services. Customer balances in other deposit products including savings, money market and certificates of deposit increased $712 million primarily due to the United National acquisition. Fourth quarter average portfolios grew by $593 million compared with second quarter as the rise in interest rates began to attract funds back into certificates of deposits after an extended period of portfolio declines in a low interest rate environment. 32 Table of Contents WHOLESALE BANKING Year ended December 31 Taxable equivalent basis Dollars in millions except as noted 2004 2003 INCOME STATEMENT Net interest income $694 $677 Net interest income FIN 46 4 3 Total net interest income 698 680 Noninterest income Net commercial mortgage banking Net gains on loan sales 50 52 Servicing and other fees, net of amortization 47 39 Net gains on institutional loans held for sale 52 69 Other FIN 46 17 14 Other 407 428 Noninterest income 573 602 Total revenue 1,271 1,282 Provision for credit losses 5 121 Noninterest expense FIN 46 61 36 Noninterest expense 610 598 Pretax earnings 595 527 Noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated entities (43 ) (21 ) Income taxes 195 157 Earnings $443 $391 AVERAGE BALANCE SHEET Loans Corporate banking (a) $9,865 $9,410 Commercial real estate 1,834 1,872 Commercial real estate related 1,631 1,404 PNC Business Credit 3,803 3,551 Total loans (a) 17,133 16,237 Loans held for sale 470 572 Other assets 4,470 4,214 Total assets $22,073 $21,023 Deposits $7,527 $6,354 Commercial paper 1,889 1,232 Other liabilities 3,433 3,250 Capital 1,672 1,994 Total funds $14,521 $12,830 PERFORMANCE RATIOS Return on capital 26 % 20 % Noninterest income to total revenue 45 47 Efficiency 53 49 COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE SERVICING PORTFOLIO (in billions) Beginning of period $83 $74 Acquisitions/additions 41 23 Repayments/transfers (26 ) (14 ) End of period $98 $83 OTHER INFORMATION Consolidated revenue from: Treasury management $373 $360 Capital markets $140 $119 Midland Loan Services $108 $96 Equipment leasing $84 $84 Total loans (a) (b) $17,959 $16,441 Total nonperforming assets (b) (c) $71 $227 Net charge offs $49 $158 Average FTE staff 3,086 2,989 Net carrying amount of commercial mortgage servicing rights (b) $242 $209 (a) Reflects reclassification to loans related to Market Street conduit.

(c) Includes nonperforming loans of $51 million at December 31, 2004 and $177 million at December 31, 2003. Wholesale Banking earnings increased 13% in 2004, primarily due to the overall improved credit quality of the loan portfolio, which was reflected in a $116 million decrease in the segments provision for credit losses. Highlights of 2004 for Wholesale Banking include: Total loans outstanding at December 31, 2004 increased $1.5 billion, or 9%, compared with December 31, 2003, driven by net new business and the acquisition of United National. Average deposits increased 18% in 2004 compared with the prior year as further described below. Client acquisition exceeded our expectations. Asset quality remained strong and nonperforming assets as of December 31, 2004 declined 69% compared with December 31, 2003. Capital markets revenue increased $21 million, or 18%, compared with 2003 driven by customer related trading activity and loan syndication fees. Revenue from Midland Loan Services grew $12 million, or 12%, compared with the prior year due to an 18% increase in the portfolio serviced. Taxable equivalent net interest income for 2004 increased $17 million compared with 2003, primarily due to loan and deposit growth. As economic expansion continues, we expect our customers to require additional lending facilities and to increase utilization of existing facilities. Although competition for high quality customers has increased, we believe we can continue to compete effectively through competitive pricing and the strength of our product offerings, such as treasury management and capital markets products and services. We are winning new clients both within our primary geographic footprint and across the nation, and this expansion is being achieved within our prudent risk/return parameters. Our corporate banking and national secured lending businesses, business credit, leasing and real estate finance, have benefited from improving economic conditions and improved sales efforts, resulting in significant loan growth. The provision for credit losses was $5 million for 2004 compared with $121 million in 2003. The reduced provision was attributable to improved overall credit quality, as demonstrated by an $109 million reduction in net charge offs and a 69% reduction in nonperforming assets compared with 2003. While we intend to continue to initiate new business within our prudent risk/return parameters, we do not expect to continue to experience significant levels of improvement in credit quality in 2005. In addition, we anticipate that our provision for credit losses will increase in 2005, driven by loan growth. Noninterest income for 2004 decreased 5%, to $573 million compared with 2003. The decrease was attributable primarily to a $17 million reduction in net gains on institutional loans held for sale compared with 2003 and $23 million of securities gains in 2003 related to the liquidation of two entities formed in 2001 in connection with the PAGIC transactions. These factors were partially offset by higher fees from our commercial mortgage servicing, treasury management, and capital markets products. 33 Table of Contents Noninterest expense for 2004 increased 6%, to $671 million, compared with 2003. Noninterest expense in 2003 included a $22 million impact related to the liquidation of two entities in connection with the PAGIC transactions and six months of noninterest expense related to the adoption of FIN 46, while noninterest expense for 2004 included a full year of expense related to FIN 46. Apart from these items, noninterest expense increased $34 million in 2004 as a result of our ongoing effort to add revenue producing employees. Average deposits increased 18% in 2004 compared with 2003. This increase was primarily due to: Successful sales of treasury management products, Increased liquidity among our customers, and An increased commercial mortgage servicing portfolio, which grew 18% from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004. We provide additional discussion regarding product revenue from our treasury management, capital markets, Midland Loan Services and equipment leasing businesses on page 20. Nonperforming assets at December 31, 2004 declined $156 million, or 69%, compared with December 31, 2003 due to overall improvements in credit quality, continued liquidation of the institutional loans held for sale portfolio and the resolution of the two largest nonperforming assets in PNC Business Credit. With the increase in the loan portfolio and the near completion of the liquidation of institutional loans held for sale, we do not expect this decline in nonperforming assets to continue. 34 Table of Contents PNC ADVISORS Year ended December 31 Taxable equivalent basis Dollars in millions except as noted 2004 2003 INCOME STATEMENT Net interest income $111 $107 Noninterest income Investment management and trust 316 313 Brokerage 111 101 Other 91 94 Total noninterest income 518 508 Total revenue 629 615 Provision for credit losses (1 ) 3 Noninterest expense 463 472 Pretax earnings 167 140 Income taxes 61 51 Earnings $106 $89 AVERAGE BALANCE SHEET Loans Consumer $1,518 $1,317 Residential mortgage 130 244 Commercial 407 438 Other 292 287 Total loans 2,347 2,286 Other assets 408 428 Total assets $2,755 $2,714 Deposits $2,264 $2,141 Other liabilities 278 259 Capital 307 313 Total funds $2,849 $2,713 PERFORMANCE RATIOS Return on capital 35 % 28 % Noninterest income to total revenue 82 83 Efficiency 74 77 ASSETS UNDER ADMINISTRATION (in billions) (a) (b) (c) Assets under management Personal $41 $44 Institutional 9 9 Total $50 $53 Asset Type Equity $30 $31 Fixed income 14 16 Liquidity/other 6 6 Total $50 $53 Nondiscretionary assets under administration Personal $29 $22 Institutional 64 65 Total $93 $87 Asset Type Equity $32 $30 Fixed income 33 30 Liquidity/other 28 27 Total $93 $87 OTHER INFORMATION (b) Total nonperforming assets $9 $11 Brokerage assets administered (in billions) $25 $23 Full service brokerage offices 75 76 Financial consultants 436 445 Margin loans $254 $256 Average FTE staff 2,796 2,918 (a) Excludes brokerage assets administered. (b) Presented as of period end, except for average FTEs. (c) Balance at December 31, 2004 reflects the first quarter 2004 sale of certain activities of the investment consulting business of the Hawthorn unit and the expected reduction of approximately $5.9 billion of assets under management with approximately $4.4 billion moving to nondiscretionary assets under administration. Higher 2004 earnings at PNC Advisors reflected the impact of comparatively stronger equity markets, increased loan and deposit balances and lower expenses compared with 2003, in addition to the impact of a $7 million after tax gain recognized in the first quarter of 2004 from the sale of certain investment consulting activities of the Hawthorn unit. Highlights of 2004 for PNC Advisors include: Personal and institutional investment management and trust sales increased compared with the comparable reporting period of 2003. The fourth quarter of 2004 reflected a reversal in the decline of Hilliard Lyons retail trading volumes that began in the second quarter of 2004. Average consumer loans increased 15% in 2004 compared with the prior year primarily due to home equity loan and line of credit volume. Average deposits increased 6% in 2004 compared with 2003. The sale of certain investment consulting activities of Hawthorn was completed in the first quarter of 2004. The sale resulted in a $10 million pretax gain and reduced assets under management by approximately $5.9 billion. Excluding the effect of the Hawthorn transaction, assets under management at December 31, 2004 increased approximately $3 billion compared with the balance at December 31, 2003. The effect of comparatively higher equity markets and the acquisition of United National more than offset net client asset outflows in 2004 apart from the Hawthorn transaction. Net client asset outflows are the result of ordinary distributions from trust and investment management accounts and account closures exceeding investment additions from new and existing clients. Net interest income increased $4 million in 2004 compared with 2003 primarily due to higher average deposits. Investment management and trust revenue increased $3 million in 2004 compared with 2003 despite the loss of $8 million in fees due to the sale of certain investment consulting activities of the Hawthorn unit. The favorable increase was due primarily to the comparatively higher equity markets. Brokerage revenue in 2004 increased $10 million compared with 2003 primarily due to increased fees. Excluding the effect of the Hawthorn transaction, other income declined $13 million through year end 2004 compared with the prior period primarily due to lower client related trading. Provision for credit losses declined $4 million in 2004 compared with the prior year primarily due to improvement in loan quality and lower net charge offs. Noninterest expense was down $9 million in 2004 compared with 2003, including a $7 million expense savings related to the Hawthorn transaction. In 2003, PNC Advisors incurred a $5 million charge related to certain employment contracts. Excluding the impact of these items, noninterest expense was essentially flat compared with 2003. 35 Table of Contents BLACKROCK Year ended December 31 Taxable equivalent basis (a) Dollars in millions except as noted 2004 2003 INCOME STATEMENT Investment advisory and administrative fees $633 $529 Other income 92 69 Total revenue 725 598 Operating expense 423 336 Operating expense LTIP 104 Fund administration and servicing costs 32 33 Total expense 559 369 Operating income 166 229 Nonoperating income 36 22 Pretax earnings 202 251 Minority interest 5 Income taxes 54 96 Earnings $143 $155 PERIOD END BALANCE SHEET Goodwill and other intangible assets $184 $192 Other assets 961 775 Total assets $1,145 $967 Liabilities $377 $254 Stockholders equity 768 713 Total liabilities and stockholders equity $1,145 $967 PERFORMANCE DATA Return on average equity 19 % 23 % Operating margin (b) 37 41 Diluted earnings per share $2.17 $2.36 ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT (in billions) (c) Separate accounts Fixed income $216 $190 Liquidity 7 6 Liquidity securities lending 7 10 Equity 10 9 Alternative investment products 8 7 Total separate accounts 248 222 Mutual funds (d) Fixed income 25 24 Liquidity 64 59 Equity 5 4 Total mutual funds 94 87 Total assets under management $342 $309 OTHER INFORMATION Average FTE staff 1,014 962 (a) Presented on a taxable equivalent basis for 2004 and on a book basis for 2003. (b) Calculated as operating income, adjusted for BlackRock LTIP charges and appreciation on Rabbi trust assets related to BlackRocks deferred compensation plans, divided by total revenue less fund administration and servicing costs. The following is a reconciliation of this presentation to operating margin calculated on a GAAP basis (operating income divided by total revenue) in millions: Operating income, GAAP basis $166 $229 Add back: LTIP expense 104 Less: BlackRock portion of LTIP expense, funding portion (19 ) Add back: appreciation on Rabbi trust assets 4 2 Operating income, as adjusted $255 $231 Total revenue, GAAP basis $725 $598 Less fund administration and servicing costs 32 33 Revenue used for operating margin calculation, as reported $693 $565 Operating margin, GAAP basis 23 % 38 % Operating margin, as reported 37 % 41 % We believe that operating margin, as reported, is a more relevant indicator of managements ability to effectively employ BlackRocks resources. The portion of the LTIP expense associated with awards to be met with the contribution of shares of BlackRock stock by PNC has been excluded from operating income because, exclusive of the impact related to LTIP participants option to put awarded shares to BlackRock, this non cash charge will not impact BlackRocks book value. Appreciation on Rabbi trust assets related to BlackRocks deferred compensation plans has been excluded because investment performance of these assets has a nominal impact on net income. We have excluded fund administration and servicing costs from the operating margin calculation because these costs are a fixed, asset based expense which can fluctuate based on the discretion of a third party. (c) At December 31. (d) Includes BlackRock Funds, BlackRock Liquidity Funds, BlackRock Closed End Funds, Short Term Investment Fund and BlackRock Global Series Funds. BlackRock earnings in 2004 reflected a 20% increase in advisory fees driven by a growing base of assets under management as well as a total of $18 million in tax benefits recorded in the first and fourth quarters of 2004, which were more than offset by the after tax impact of $66 million of LTIP related charges. During 2004, BlackRock continued to operate in a global marketplace characterized by substantial volatility. Highlights of BlackRocks 2004 performance follow. Assets under management at December 31, 2004 increased $33 billion, or 10%, compared with December 31, 2003. Growth in fixed income assets managed by BlackRock was the primary factor in the increase. The increase reflected net new subscriptions of $20 billion and net market appreciation of $13 billion. Over the past five years, assets under management have grown at a compound annual rate of 16%, the majority of which was attributable to new business activity. The business ended 2004 with superior investment performance in fixed income and liquidity products and continued to experience favorable operating leverage in these areas. The performance of the equity business improved following its 2003 restructuring. Higher revenue in 2004 reflected increases in fees earned from a larger base of assets. Other income increased primarily due to strong sales of BlackRock Solutions products and services and fees earned by the Advisory Services Group. Apart from the LTIP charges and a $6 million impairment of an acquired contract, expenses increased in 2004 largely due to an increase in employee incentive compensation, salaries and benefits due to higher staffing levels, higher legal and accounting service fees and higher marketing and professional expense related to new closed end issuances. Effective January 31, 2005, BlackRock acquired SSRM, the holding company of State Street Research & Management Company and SSR Realty Advisors Inc., from MetLife, Inc. SSRM, through its subsidiaries, actively manages stock, bond, balanced and real estate portfolios for both institutional and individual investors with approximately $55 billion in assets under management at December 31, 2004. At closing, MetLife, Inc. received approximately $285 million in cash and approximately 550,000 shares of BlackRock restricted class A common stock. The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to BlackRocks earnings. Additional cash considerations, which could increase the purchase price by up to 25%, may be paid over 5 years contingent on certain measures.

Highlights of PFPCs performance in 2004 follow. PFPC continued to streamline operations during the year to facilitate pursuit of higher margin business and increase efficiencies in lower margin businesses. PFPCs offshore revenues grew 40% and assets serviced offshore increased 36%. Alternative investment net assets serviced increased 45%, as PFPC executed its strategy to pursue hedge fund and other alternative investment business. Managed account services grew its asset base to $27 billion, an increase of 56% compared with December 31, 2003, reflecting the success of the ADVISORport separate accounts platform and related sales efforts. Fund servicing revenue increased $52 million in 2004 compared with 2003 reflecting the positive impact of new sales of accounting/administration services, offshore growth and growth in alternative investment and custody assets serviced. In addition, $22 million of the increase represented out of pocket and pass through items that had no impact on earnings. These factors were partially offset by highly competitive pricing in certain of PFPCs product areas and transfer agency client deconversion. Revenue loss attributable to the sale of PFPCs retirement services business during 2003 was largely replaced by the higher margin revenue from the ADVISORport acquisition that also occurred in 2003. Operating expense increased $25 million, or 4%, in 2004 compared with 2003. Apart from the out of pocket and pass through items referred to above, the net impact of the ADVISORport and retirement services transactions reduced operating expenses by $9 million in 2004 compared with the prior year. PFPC also benefited by $31 million in incremental cost savings initiatives in 2004. PFPC incurred higher depreciation of technology investments and other noncompensation expenses during 2004 which offset the benefits described above. These benefits were also partially offset by a lower benefit from accretion of a single discounted client contract liability that ended during the second quarter of 2004. PFPCs 2004 earnings also benefited from a reduction in pretax financing costs of $15 million, attributable to the retirement of debt during 2004 and 2003 of $115 million and $125 million, respectively, with PNC affiliates and the refinancing of certain remaining debt obligations with PNC affiliates at more favorable terms. PFPC anticipates continued reductions of debt principal during 2005. This benefit was partially offset by an $11 million reduction in nonoperating income, largely driven by an increase in non debt balance sheet funding. Effective January 2005, PFPC restructured portions of its remaining intercompany debt obligations given the rate environment at that time. Contractually, PFPC incurred $8 million in debt prepayment penalties to effect the restructuring, which is expected to be more than offset by resulting interest expense savings of approximately $10 million over 2005. The prepayment penalty will be reflected in PFPCs first quarter 2005 results. For information regarding a first quarter 2005 settlement with a former transfer agency client, we direct you to Note 31 Subsequent Events in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. PFPCs performance is partially dependent on the underlying performance of its fund clients and, in particular, their ability to attract and retain customers. As a result, to the extent that PFPC clients businesses are adversely affected by ongoing governmental investigations into the practices of the mutual and hedge fund industries, PFPCs results could be impacted. Increases in both accounting/administration and custody fund assets at December 31, 2004 compared with the prior year end resulted primarily from net new business, asset inflows from existing clients and generally positive equity market performance during 2004. Subaccounting shareholder accounts serviced by PFPC increased in 2004 primarily due to net new business and growth in existing client accounts. Total assets serviced by PFPC amounted to $1.8 trillion at December 31, 2004 compared with $1.6 trillion at December 31, 2003. 37 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS We are subject to a number of risks potentially impacting our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition to the risks described in other parts of this Report, including the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 and the Risk Management and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information sections of Item 7, the following are the key risk factors that affect us. BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS; IMPACT OF MONETARY AND OTHER POLICIES A sustained weakness or weakening in business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we do business could have one or more of the following impacts on our business: A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us, A decrease in the value of our loans held for sale, An increase or decrease in the usage of unfunded commitments, or An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to us. An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets, net charge offs, provision for credit losses, and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale. Given our business mix, and the fact that most of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature, we tend to be particularly sensitive to market interest rate movement and the performance of the financial markets. In addition to the impact on the economy generally, with some of the potential effects outlined above, changes in interest rates or in valuations in the debt or equity markets could directly impact us in one or more of the following ways: Such changes could affect the value of certain of our on balance sheet and off balance sheet financial instruments or the value of equity investments that we hold; Such changes could affect the value of the assets that we manage or otherwise administer; Such changes could affect the value of assets for which we provide processing services; or To the extent to which we access capital markets to raise funds to support our business, such changes could affect the cost of such funds or our ability to raise such funds. A more detailed description of aspects of the interest rate and market risks facing us is included in the Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report. The monetary, tax and other policies of the government and its agencies, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board), have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance, and thus can affect the activities and results of operations of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, such as PNC and our subsidiaries. An important function of the Federal Reserve Board is to regulate the national supply of bank credit. The Federal Reserve Board employs open market operations in U.S. Government securities, changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings, and changes in reserve requirements on bank deposits to implement its monetary policy objectives. These instruments of monetary policy are used in varying combinations to influence the following: The overall level of bank loans, Investments and deposits, The interest rates charged on loans and paid for deposits, The price of the dollar in foreign exchange markets, and The level of inflation. The Federal Reserve Boards policies have a general impact on the United States and, to some extent, global economies, but also have a significant specific impact on bank holding companies and others in the financial services industry, which specific impact is felt throughout PNC. By affecting market interest rates, these policies influence the rates of interest that we charge on loans and that we pay on borrowings and interest bearing deposits and, as described above, can also affect the value of our on balance sheet and off balance sheet financial instruments. Both due to the impact on rates and by controlling access to direct funding from the Federal Reserve Banks, these policies also influence, to a significant extent, our cost of funding. We cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, tax and other policies or the effect that they may have on our activities and results of operations. PENDING ACQUISITION OF RIGGS NATIONAL CORPORATION; OTHER ACQUISITIONS Our pending acquisition of Riggs National Corporation presents us with a number of risks and uncertainties related both to the transaction itself and to the integration of the remaining Riggs businesses into PNC. These risks and uncertainties include the following: Completion of the transaction is dependent on, among other things, receipt of stockholder and regulatory approvals and regulatory waivers, the timing of which cannot be predicted with precision at this point and which may not be received at all. Successful completion of the transaction and our ability to realize the benefits that we anticipate from the acquisition also depend on the nature of any future developments with respect to Riggs regulatory and legal issues, the ability to comply with the terms of all current or future requirements (including any related action plan) resulting from these issues, and the extent of future costs and expenses arising as a result of these issues, including the impact of increased litigation risk and any claims for indemnification or advancement of costs. Riggs regulatory and legal issues may cause reputational harm to PNC following the acquisition and integration of its business into ours. The transaction may be materially more expensive to complete than anticipated as a result of unexpected factors or events. 38 Table of Contents The integration into PNC of the Riggs business and operations that we acquire, which will include conversion of Riggs different systems and procedures, may take longer or be more costly than anticipated and may have unanticipated adverse results relating to Riggs or PNCs existing businesses. It may take longer than expected to realize the anticipated cost savings of the acquisition, and the anticipated cost savings may not be achieved in their entirety. The anticipated strategic and other benefits of the acquisition to PNC are dependent in part on the future performance of Riggs business. We can provide no assurance as to actual future results, which could be affected by various factors, including the risks and uncertainties generally related to the performance of PNCs and Riggs businesses (with respect to Riggs, you may review Riggs SEC reports, which are accessible on the SECs website at www.sec.gov) or due to factors related to the acquisition of Riggs and the process of integrating Riggs business at closing into PNC. In addition to the pending Riggs acquisition, we grow our business from time to time by acquiring other financial services companies. Other acquisitions generally present similar risks to those described above relating to the Riggs transaction. We could also be prevented from pursuing attractive acquisition opportunities due to regulatory restraints. COMPETITION We operate in a highly competitive environment, both in terms of the products and services offered and the geographic markets in which we conduct business. This environment could become even more competitive in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation in the financial services industry. We compete with the following: Local, regional and national banks, thrifts and credit unions, Non bank financial institutions, such as investment banking firms, investment advisory firms, brokerage firms, investment companies, private equity firms, mutual fund complexes and insurance companies, and Other entities that offer financial and processing services. Our competitive environment is also impacted by the growth of alternative delivery channels, in particular the internet, which facilitates competition by removing geographic barriers to providing certain of our products and services and which provides an additional and non traditional way in which companies seeking to provide banking and other financial services can distinguish themselves. Technological advances and legislation, among other changes, have lowered barriers to entry, have made it possible for non bank institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks, and have increased the level of competition that we face. Many of our competitors benefit from fewer regulatory constraints and lower cost structures, allowing for more competitive pricing of products and services. As a result, we could lose business to competitors or be forced to price our products and services on less advantageous terms to retain customers. ASSET MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE Asset management revenue is primarily based on a percentage of the value of assets under management and performance fees, in most cases expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on assets under management. A decline in the value of debt and equity instruments, among other things, could cause our asset management revenue to decline. Investment performance is an important factor influencing the level of assets under management. Poor investment performance could impair revenue and growth as existing clients might withdraw funds in favor of better performing products. Also, performance fees could be lower or nonexistent. Additionally, the ability to attract funds from existing and new clients might diminish. FUND SERVICING Fund servicing fees are primarily derived from the market value of the assets and the number of shareholder accounts that we administer for our clients. A rise in interest rates or a sustained weakness, weakening or volatility in the debt and equity markets could influence an investors decision to invest or maintain an investment in a mutual fund or other pooled investment product. As a result, fluctuations may occur in the level or value of assets for which we provide processing services. A significant investor migration from mutual fund and other pooled investments could result in lower revenues for us by reducing the assets and the number of shareholder accounts that we service. The fund servicing business is also highly competitive, with a relatively small number of providers. There has been and continues to be merger, acquisition and consolidation activity in the financial services industry. Future mergers or consolidations of financial institutions or other financial intermediaries could impact the number of existing or potential fund servicing clients. TERRORIST ACTIVITIES AND INTERNATIONAL HOSTILITIES The impact of terrorist activities and responses to such activities and of international hostilities cannot be predicted with respect to severity or duration, but may adversely affect the economy and financial and capital markets generally, or specific industries and us specifically. The impact could adversely affect us in a number of ways including, among others, an increase in delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults that could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets, net charge offs and provision for credit losses. 39 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND JUDGMENTS Our consolidated financial statements are prepared by applying certain accounting policies. Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report describes the most significant accounting policies that we use. Certain of these policies require us to make estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or be subject to variations that may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods. We must use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when financial assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on either quoted market prices or are provided by other independent third party sources, when available. When such third party information is not available, we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations. ALLOWANCES FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES AND UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT We maintain allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit at levels that we believe are sufficient to absorb estimated probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio. We determine the adequacy of the allowances based on periodic evaluations of the credit portfolio and other relevant factors. However, this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates, including, among others: Expected default probabilities, Loss given default, Exposure at default, Amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, Value of collateral, Estimated losses on consumer loans and residential mortgages, and General amounts for historical loss experience. Our process also considers economic conditions, uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the various credit portfolios. All of these factors may be susceptible to significant change. Also, we base the allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses to specific loan pools on historical loss trends and our judgment concerning those trends. Commercial loans are the largest category of credits and are the most sensitive to changes in assumptions and judgments underlying the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses. We have allocated approximately $503 million, or 83%, of the total allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2004 to the commercial loan category. This allocation also considers other relevant factors such as: Actual versus estimated losses, Regional and national economic conditions, Business segment and portfolio concentrations, Industry competition and consolidation, The impact of government regulations, and Risk of potential estimation or judgmental errors, including the accuracy of risk ratings. To the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates, additional provision for credit losses may be required that would reduce future earnings. See the following for additional information: Allowances For Loan And Lease Losses And Unfunded Loan Commitments And Letters Of Credit in the Credit Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report; and Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 12 Allowances For Loan And Lease Losses And Unfunded Loan Commitments And Letters of Credit in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements, and Allocation Of Allowance For Loan And Lease Losses in the Statistical Information section in Item 8 of this Report. PRIVATE EQUITY ASSET VALUATION At December 31, 2004, private equity investments carried at estimated fair value totaled $470 million compared with $531 million at December 31, 2003. We value private equity assets at each balance sheet date based primarily on either, in the case of limited partnership investments, the financial statements received from the general partner or, for direct investments, the estimated fair value of the investments. There is a time lag in our receipt of the financial information that is the primary basis for the valuation of our limited partnership interests. We recognized in the fourth quarter of 2004 valuation changes related to limited partnership investments that reflected the impact of third quarter 2004 market conditions and performance of the underlying companies. Due to the nature of the direct investments, we must make assumptions as to future performance, financial condition, liquidity, availability of capital, and market conditions, among others, to determine the estimated fair value of the investments. The valuation procedures that we apply to direct investments include techniques such as cash flow multiples for the entity, independent appraisals of the value of the entity or the pricing used to value the entity in a recent financing transaction. We value general partnership interests based on the underlying investments of the partnership utilizing procedures consistent with those applied to direct investments. We reflect changes in the value of equity management investments in our results of operations. Market conditions and actual performance of the companies that we invest in could differ from these assumptions, resulting in lower valuations that could reduce earnings in future periods. Accordingly, the valuations may not represent amounts that will ultimately be realized from these investments. 40 Table of Contents Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights Commercial mortgage servicing rights (MSR) are intangible assets that represent the value of rights that arise from the servicing of commercial loan contracts. While servicing is inherent in most financial assets, it becomes a distinct asset (a) when contractually separated from the underlying financial asset by sale or securitization of the asset with servicing retained or (b) through the separate purchase and assumption of the servicing. The value of our MSR asset (both originated and purchased) arises from estimates of future revenues from contractually specified servicing fees, interest income and other ancillary revenues, net of estimated operating expenses which are expected to provide an acceptable level of risk adjusted return for us as the servicer. We estimate the fair value of our MSR asset using a discounted cash flow methodology that calculates the net present value of future cash flows of the servicing portfolio over the estimated life of the asset based on various assumptions and market factors. The most significant assumptions and market factors include: Interest rates for escrow and deposit balance earnings, Discount rates, Estimated prepayment speeds, and Estimated servicing costs. We review the reasonableness of these factors based on expectations of the portfolio, market conditions, and loan characteristics. Our commercial loan servicing portfolio is subject to various risks, the most significant being interest rate risk, which subject our MSR asset to impairment risk. While our MSR asset is amortized over its estimated life in proportion to estimated net servicing income, it is also tested for impairment at a strata level on a quarterly basis. The impairment testing includes a positive and negative scenario for sensitivity characteristics. If the estimated fair value of the MSR is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss would be recognized in the current period; however, any fair value in excess of the cost basis would not be recognized as income. We include additional information in Note 1 Accounting Policies, Note 13 Goodwill And Other Intangible Assets and Note 15 Securitizations And Retained Interests in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. Lease Residuals We provide financing for various types of equipment, aircraft, energy and power systems, and rolling stock through a variety of lease arrangements. Leases are carried at the sum of lease payments and the estimated residual value of the leased property, less unearned income. Residual value insurance or guarantees by governmental entities cover a significant portion of the residual value. Residual values are subject to judgments as to the value of the underlying equipment that can be affected by changes in economic and market conditions and the financial viability of the residual guarantors and insurers. To the extent not guaranteed or assumed by a third party, or otherwise insured against, we bear the risk of ownership of the leased assets. This includes the risk that the actual value of the leased assets at the end of the lease term will be less than the residual value, which could result in an impairment charge and reduce earnings in the future. These residual values are reviewed for impairment no less than on an annual basis. See Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. Goodwill Goodwill arising from business acquisitions represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired. Most of our goodwill relates to value inherent in the fund servicing and banking businesses. The value of this goodwill is dependent upon our ability to provide quality, cost effective services in the face of competition from other market participants on a national and global basis. This ability in turn relies upon continuing investments in processing systems, the development of value added service features, and the ease of access to our services. As such, goodwill value is supported ultimately by earnings, which is driven by the volume of business transacted and, for certain businesses, the market value of assets under administration or for which processing services are provided. Lower earnings resulting from a lack of growth or our inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill, which could result in a charge and reduced earnings in the future. At least annually, management evaluates events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment in the carrying amount of goodwill. See Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 13 Goodwill And Other Intangible Assets in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. Revenue Recognition We derive net interest and noninterest income from various sources, including: Lending, Securities portfolio, Investment management and fund servicing, Customer deposits, Loan servicing, Brokerage services, Sale of loans and securities, Certain private equity activities, and Securities and derivatives trading activities including foreign exchange. We also earn fees and commissions from issuing loan commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, selling various insurance products, providing treasury management services and participating in certain capital market transactions. The timing and amount of revenue that we recognize in any period is dependent on estimates, judgments, assumptions, and interpretation of contractual terms. Changes in these factors can have a significant impact on revenue recognized 41 Table of Contents in any period due to changes in products, market conditions or industry norms. See Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. Income Taxes Because our ownership interest in BlackRock, as measured by value, is less than 80%, federal tax law requires us to file two consolidated federal income tax returns: one for PNC and subsidiaries excluding the consolidated results of BlackRock and its subsidiaries, and a second return solely for BlackRock and its subsidiaries. We and our subsidiaries also file state and local income tax returns in many jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, we and our subsidiaries enter into transactions for which the tax treatment is unclear or subject to varying interpretations. In addition, filing requirements, methods of filing and the calculation of taxable income in various state and local jurisdictions are subject to differing interpretations. We evaluate and assess the relative risks and merits of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions, filing positions, filing methods and taxable income calculation after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent, and other information, and maintain tax accruals consistent with our evaluation of these relative risks and merits. The result of our evaluation and assessment is by its nature an estimate. We and our subsidiaries are routinely subject to audit and challenges from taxing authorities. In the event we resolve a challenge for an amount different than amounts previously accrued, we will account for the difference in the period in which we resolve the matter. Our tax treatment of certain leasing transactions is currently being challenged by the IRS, as described in greater detail in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of Item 7 of this Report. Legal Contingencies We are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory proceedings and claims, including those described in Note 5 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report and others arising in the normal course of our business. We review these matters with internal and external legal counsel and accrue reserves when we determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly review these accruals and adjust the reserves as appropriate to reflect changes in the status of the proceedings and claims. The reserves that we establish for these types of contingencies are based upon our opinion of the likely future outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings and claims. The final resolution of legal and regulatory proceedings is frequently different, possibly significantly, from the resolution we anticipated. Also, we may not be able to reasonably estimate the loss from a proceeding even if some liability is probable or the actual loss may be different from an estimated loss. As a result, our ultimate financial exposure to legal and regulatory proceedings and claims may be substantially different from what is reflected in the related reserves. 2002 BLACKROCK LONG TERM RETENTION AND INCENTIVE PLAN See Note 22 Stock Based Compensation Plans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for a description of the BlackRock LTIP. Based on the price performance of its common shares, BlackRock management determined that full vesting of the LTIP awards was probable as of September 30, 2004, and as a result recorded a charge and a related liability in its third quarter 2004 results. This charge took into account the value of the awards granted through September 30, 2004 and the applicable service period. We reported a pretax charge totaling $96 million, including $89 million of compensation expense, $2 million of employee benefits expense and $5 million of Other noninterest expense in our Consolidated Statement Of Income. The after tax impact on our third quarter 2004 results after taking into account the adjustment for minority interests (we own approximately 71% of BlackRock) was $42 million, or $.15 per diluted share. This includes a pro rata share of the estimated dilution of our investment in BlackRock that is expected to occur in 2007 when we transfer shares of BlackRock stock to fund a portion of the LTIP Awards. Fourth quarter 2004 LTIP pretax charges reported by PNC totaled $14 million, comprised of $13 million of compensation expense and $1 million of Other noninterest expense. We expect to report additional pretax charges of approximately $15 million per quarter through December 2006 related to the remaining service period of the LTIP Awards granted to date, assuming the LTIP Awards vest or full vesting remains probable. Additional information on the third quarter 2004 LTIP charge is included in our and BlackRocks Current Reports on Form 8 K dated October 6, 2004. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on the following recent accounting pronouncements that are relevant to our business, including a description of each new pronouncement, the required date of adoption, our planned date of adoption and the expected impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued the following: SFAS 123 (Revised 2004), Share Based Payment, FASB Staff Position (FSP) 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provisions within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and SFAS 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions. 42 Table of Contents In May 2004, the FASB issued FSP 106 2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. In December 2003, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position 03 3, Accounting for Loans and Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 150. In November 2003, the FASB issued FSP 150 3, Effective Date, Disclosures, and Transition for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests under FASB Statement No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity. STATUS OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN We have a noncontributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan (plan or pension plan) covering eligible employees. Retirement benefits are derived from a cash balance formula based on compensation levels, age and length of service. Pension contributions are based on an actuarially determined amount necessary to fund total benefits payable to plan participants. Plan assets are currently approximately 60% invested in equity investments with most of the remainder invested in fixed income instruments. Plan fiduciaries determine and review the plans investment policy. We calculate the expense associated with the pension plan in accordance with SFAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and we use assumptions and methods that are compatible with the requirements of SFAS 87, including a policy of reflecting trust assets at their fair market value. On an annual basis, we review the actuarial assumptions related to the pension plan, including the discount rate, rate of compensation increase and the expected return on plan assets. Neither the discount rate nor the compensation increase assumptions significantly affect pension expense. However, the expected long term return on assets assumption does significantly affect pension expense. Actual investment returns also significantly affect expense, as each one percentage point difference in actual return compared with our expected return causes the following years expense to change by up to $3 million. Below are the effects of certain changes in assumptions, using 2005 estimated expense as a baseline. EstimatedIncrease toPensionExpense (In millions) .5% decrease in discount rate $1 .5% decrease in expected long term return on assets 7 .5% increase in compensation rate 1 We currently estimate a pretax $7 million benefit to pension expense in 2005 compared with pretax expense of $10 million in 2004. The primary reasons for the expected decrease in pension expense in 2005 are favorable returns on investment assets in 2004, which reduce amortization of actuarial losses and increase the asset used to calculate expected returns for 2005, and plan modifications relating to PFPC, as future retirement benefits will accrue only under a defined contribution plan. In accordance with SFAS 87 and SFAS 132 (Revised 2003), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, we may have to eliminate any prepaid pension asset and recognize a minimum pension liability if the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets at year end. We would recognize the corresponding charge as a component of other comprehensive income and it would reduce total shareholders equity, but it would not affect net income. At December 31, 2004, the fair value of plan assets was $1.492 billion, which exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation of $1.111 billion. The status at year end 2005 will depend primarily upon 2005 investment returns and the level of contributions, if any, made to the plan by us during 2005. Plan asset investment performance has the most impact on contribution requirements. However, contribution requirements are not particularly sensitive to actuarial assumptions. Investment performance will drive the amount of permitted contributions in future years. Also, current law sets limits as to both minimum and maximum contributions to the plan. In any event, any large near term contributions to the plan will be at our discretion, as we expect that the minimum required contributions under the law will be minimal or zero for several years. We maintain other defined benefit plans that have a less significant effect on financial results, including one qualified pension plan for United National employees and various nonqualified supplemental retirement plans for certain employees. On March 31, 2004, we merged into our plan one defined benefit plan covering some employees of United National. We merged the remaining United National plan into our plan during the fourth quarter of 2004. We contributed $11 million to the United National plans during the first quarter of 2004. Expense associated with the United National plans was minimal for 2004. See Note 21 Employee Benefit Plans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. RISK MANAGEMENT We encounter risk as part of the normal course of our business and we design risk management processes to help manage these risks. This Risk Management section first provides an overview of the risk measurement, control strategies, and monitoring aspects of our corporate level risk management processes. Following that discussion is an analysis of the risk management process for what we view as our primary areas of risk: credit, operational, liquidity, and market. The discussion of market risk is further 43 Table of Contents subdivided into interest rate, trading, and equity and other investment risk areas. Our use of financial derivatives as part of our overall asset and liability risk management process is also addressed within the Risk Management section of this Report. In appropriate places within this section, historical performance is also addressed. OVERVIEW As a financial services organization, we take a certain amount of risk in every business decision. For example, every time we open an account or approve a loan for a customer, process a payment, hire a new employee, or implement a new computer system, we incur a certain amount of risk. As an organization, we must balance revenue generation and profitability with the risks associated with our business activities. Risk management is not about eliminating risks, but about identifying and accepting risks and then effectively managing them so to optimize shareholder value. The key to effective risk management is to be proactive in identifying, measuring, evaluating, and monitoring risk on an ongoing basis. Risk management practices support decision making, improve the success rate for new initiatives, and strengthen the organization. CORPORATE LEVEL RISK MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW We support risk management through a governance structure involving the Board, senior management and a corporate risk management organization. Although our Board as a whole is responsible generally for oversight of risk management, committees of the Board provide oversight to specific areas of risk with respect to the level of risk and risk management structure. We use management level risk committees to help ensure that business decisions are executed within our desired risk profile. The Executive Risk Management Committee (ERMC), consisting of senior management executives, provides oversight for the establishment and implementation of new comprehensive risk management initiatives, reviews enterprise level risk profiles and discusses key risk issues. The corporate risk management organization has the following key roles: Facilitate the identification, assessment and monitoring of risk across PNC, Provide support and oversight to the businesses, and Identify and implement risk management best practices, as appropriate. RISK MEASUREMENT We conduct risk measurement activities specific to each area of risk. The primary vehicle for aggregation of enterprise wide risk is a comprehensive risk management methodology that is based on economic capital. This primary risk aggregation measure is supplemented with secondary measures of risk to arrive at an estimate of enterprise wide risk. The economic capital framework is a measure of potential losses above and beyond expected losses. Potential one year losses are capitalized to a level commensurate with a financial institution with an A rating by the credit rating agencies. Economic capital incorporates risk associated with potential credit losses (Credit Risk), fluctuations of the estimated market value of financial instruments (Market Risk), failure of people, processes or systems (Operational Risk), and income losses associated with declining volumes, margins and or fees, and the fixed cost structure of the business (Business Risk). We estimate credit and market risks at an exposure level while we estimate the remaining risk types at an institution or business segment level. We routinely compare the output of our economic capital model with industry benchmarks. RISK CONTROL STRATEGIES We centrally manage policy development and exception oversight through corporate level risk management. Corporate risk management is authorized to take action to either prevent or mitigate exceptions to policies and is responsible for monitoring compliance with risk management policies. The Corporate Audit function performs an independent analysis of the internal control environment. Corporate Audit plays a critical role in risk management, testing the operation of the internal control system and reporting findings to management and to the Audit Committee. RISK MONITORING Corporate risk management reports on a regular basis to our Board regarding the enterprise risk profile of the Corporation. These reports aggregate and present the level of risk by type of risk and communicate significant risk issues, including performance relative to risk tolerance limits. Both the Board and the ERMC provide guidance on actions to address key risk issues as identified in these reports. CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT Credit risk represents the possibility that a customer, counterparty or issuer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms. Credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from extending credit to customers, purchasing securities, and entering into financial derivative transactions. Credit risk is one of the most common risks in banking and is one of our most significant risks. Approved risk tolerances, in addition to credit policies and procedures, set portfolio objectives for the level of credit risk. We have established guidelines for acceptable levels of total borrower exposure, problem loans, and other credit measures. We seek to achieve our credit portfolio objectives by maintaining a customer base that is diverse in borrower exposure and industry types. We use loan participations with third parties, loan sales and syndications, and the purchase of credit derivatives to reduce risk concentrations. The credit granting businesses maintain direct responsibility for credit risk within PNC. The Corporate Credit Policy area provides independent oversight to the measurement, monitoring and reporting of PNCs credit risk and reports to the Chief Risk Officer. Credit Risk Review also provides an independent assessment of the credit risk profile and the findings from targeted reviews. 44 Table of Contents Nonperforming, Past Due And Potential Problem Assets Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructurings, nonaccrual loans held for sale or foreclosed, and other assets. In addition, certain performing assets have interest payments that are past due or have the potential for future repayment problems.

(b) Excludes nonperforming equity management assets carried at estimated fair value of $32 million at December 31, 2004 and $37 million at December 31, 2003 and included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These amounts include troubled debt restructured assets of $11 million at December 31, 2004 and $5 million at December 31, 2003. The decline in nonperforming loans held for sale at December 31, 2004 compared with December 31, 2003 reflected reductions in principal balances and sales of nonperforming loans during 2004. The foreclosed lease assets at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 primarily represent our repossession of collateral related to a single airline industry credit during the second quarter of 2003 that was previously classified as a nonaccrual loan. This asset is currently leased to a third party. The amount of nonperforming loans that was current as to principal and interest was $44 million at December 31, 2004 and $116 million at December 31, 2003. The amount of nonperforming loans held for sale that was current as to principal and interest was zero at December 31, 2004 and $4 million at December 31, 2003.

Approximately 82% of these loans are in the Wholesale Banking portfolio. Allowances For Loan And Lease Losses And Unfunded Loan Commitments And Letters Of Credit We maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses to absorb losses from the loan portfolio. We determine the allowance based on quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio. While we make allocations to specific loans and pools of loans, the total reserve is available for all loan losses. In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we maintain an allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. We report this allowance as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We determine this amount using estimates of the probability of the ultimate funding and losses related to those credit exposures. This methodology is similar to the methodology we use for determining the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses. 45 Table of Contents We establish specific allowances for loans considered impaired using a method prescribed by SFAS 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan. All nonperforming loans are considered impaired under SFAS 114. Specific allowances for individual loans over a set dollar threshold are determined by our Special Asset Committee based on an analysis of the present value of the loans expected future cash flows discounted at its effective interest rate, its observable market price, or the fair value of the underlying collateral. We establish a minimum specific allowance on all impaired loans at the applicable pool reserve allocation for similar loans. Allocations to non impaired commercial and commercial real estate loans (pool reserve allocations) are assigned to pools of loans as defined by our business structure and internal risk rating categories. Key elements of the pool reserve methodology include: Probability of default (PD), which is derived from historical default analyses and is a function of the borrowers risk rating grade and expected loan term; Loss given default (LGD), which is derived from historical loss data and is a function of the loans collateral value and other structural factors that may affect our ultimate ability to collect on the loan; and Exposure at default (EAD), which is derived from banking industry and our own exposure at default data. Our pool reserve methodology is sensitive to changes in key risk parameters such as PDs, LGDs and EADs. In general, a given change in any of the major risk parameters will have a corresponding change in the pool reserve allocations for non impaired commercial loans. Our commercial loans are the largest category of credits and are most sensitive to changes in the key risk parameters and pool reserve loss rates. To illustrate, if we increase the pool reserve loss rates by 5% for all categories of nonimpaired commercial loans, then the aggregate of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit would increase by $25 million. Additionally, other factors such as the rate of migration in the severity of problem loans or changes in the maturity distribution of the loans will contribute to the final pool reserve allocations. We make consumer (including residential mortgage) loan allocations at a total portfolio level by consumer product line based on historical loss experience. We compute a four quarter average loss rate from net charge offs for the prior four quarters as a percentage of the average loans outstanding in those quarters. We apply this loss rate to loans outstanding at the end of the current period to determine the consumer loan allocation. The final loan reserve allocations are based on this methodology and our judgment of other qualitative factors that may include, among others: Regional and national economic conditions, Business segment and portfolio concentrations, Historical versus estimated losses, Model risk, and Changes to the level of credit risk in the portfolio. We establish reserves to provide coverage for probable losses not considered in the specific, pool and consumer reserve methodologies, such as, but not limited to, potential judgment and data errors. Furthermore, events may have occurred as of the reserve evaluation date that are not yet reflected in the risk measures or characteristics of the portfolio due to inherent lags in information. Our evaluation of these factors and other relevant factors, such as the imprecision in estimating probable losses, determines the level of reserves established at the evaluation date. The total amount of reserves for these factors was $101 million at December 31, 2004 and $116 million at December 31, 2003 and were assigned in the tables below to loan categories and to business segments based on the relative specific and pool allocation amounts. This portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses represented 17% of the total allowance and .23% of total loans at December 31, 2004 and 18% of the total allowance and .32% of total loans at December 31, 2003.

The provision includes amounts for probable losses on loans and credit exposure related to unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. In addition, as described below, the allowance for loan and lease losses was impacted during 2004 by a change in our charge off policy for smaller nonperforming commercial loans that occurred during the first quarter of 2004.

Net charge offs for 2003 included $42 million related to a single Wholesale Banking loan to a wholesale goods/retail customer and $26 million related to a single airline industry credit for which a substantial reserve had been provided at December 31, 2002. The sale of the vehicle leasing business in 2004 also resulted in lower net charge offs in 2004 compared with the prior year. During the first quarter of 2004, we changed our policy for recognizing charge offs on smaller nonperforming commercial loans. As a result, we recognized an additional $24 million of gross charge offs for the first quarter of 2004. For the remaining nine months of 2004, this portion of the portfolio experienced a reduction in gross charge offs and an increase in recoveries from expected levels. The impact of this change in future periods is not expected to be significant. CREDIT RELATED INSTRUMENTS Credit Default Swaps Credit default swaps provide, for a fee, an assumption by a third party of a portion of the credit risk related to the underlying financial instruments. We use the contracts primarily to mitigate credit risk associated with commercial lending activities and convertible bond trading. At December 31, 2004, we used credit default swaps with $336 million in notional amount to reduce credit risk associated with commercial lending activities and $23 million in notional amount to reduce risk associated with convertible arbitrage trading. The comparable amount was $166 million at December 31, 2003 for commercial lending activities. Credit default swaps are included in the Free Standing Derivatives table in the Financial Derivatives section of Item 7 of this Report. We realized net losses in connection with credit default swaps of $4.4 million during 2004 and $4.6 million in 2003. Interest Rate Derivative Risk Participation Agreements We enter into risk participation agreements to share credit exposure with other financial counterparties related to interest rate derivative contracts or take on credit exposure to generate revenue. Risk participation agreements entered into subsequent to June 30, 2003 used by us to mitigate credit risk had a notional amount of $200 million at December 31, 2004 compared with $35 million at December 31, 2003. Risk participation agreements in which we assumed credit exposure had a notional amount of $30 million at December 31, 2004. There were none as of December 31, 2003. Agreements entered into prior to July 1, 2003 are considered to be financial guarantees and, therefore, are not included in the Financial Derivatives section of Item 7 of this Report. Risk participation agreements entered prior to July 1, 2003 used by us to mitigate credit risk had a notional amount of $36 million at December 31, 2004 compared with $32 million at December 31, 2003. Risk participation agreements entered into in which we assumed credit risk exposure had a total notional amount of $24 million at December 31, 2004 compared with $49 million at December 31, 2003. OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT Operational risk is defined as the risk of financial loss or other damage to us resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human factors, or from external events. Operational risk may occur in any of our business activities and manifests itself in various ways, including but not limited to the following: Errors related to transaction processing and systems, Breaches of the system of internal controls and compliance requirements, Business interruptions, and Execution of unauthorized transactions and fraud by employees or third parties. 47 Table of Contents Operational losses may arise from legal actions due to operating deficiencies or noncompliance with contracts, laws or regulations. To monitor and control operational risk, we maintain a comprehensive framework including policies and a system of internal controls that is designed to manage risk and to provide management with timely and accurate information about the operations of PNC. Management at each business unit is primarily responsible for its operational risk management program, given that operational risk management is integral to direct business management and most easily effected at the business unit level. Corporate Operational Risk Management, reporting to the Chief Risk Officer, oversees day to day operation risk management activities. Technology Risk The technology risk management program is a significant component of the operational risk framework. We have an integrated security and technology risk management framework designed to help ensure a secure, sound, and compliant infrastructure for information management. The technology risk management process is aligned with the strategic direction of the businesses and is integrated into the technology management culture, structure and practices. The application of this framework across the enterprise helps to support comprehensive and reliable internal controls. Our business resiliency program manages the organizations capabilities to provide services in the case of an event. Prioritization of investments in people, processes, technology and facilities are based on different types of events, business risk and criticality. Comprehensive testing validates our resiliency capabilities on an ongoing basis, and an integrated governance model is designed to help assure transparent management reporting. Insurance As a component of our risk management practices, we purchase insurance programs designed to protect us against accidental loss or losses which, in the aggregate, may significantly affect personnel, property, financial objectives, or our ability to continue to meet our responsibilities to our various stakeholder groups. PNC, through subsidiary companies, Alpine Indemnity Limited and PNC Insurance Corp., participates as a reinsurer for its general liability, automobile liability and workers compensation programs and as a direct writer for its property and certified domestic terrorism programs. PNCs risks associated with its participation as a reinsurer or direct writer for these programs are mitigated through policy limits, annual aggregate limits, umbrella/excess liability coverage and reinsurance ceded beyond per occurrence deductible limits. LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT Liquidity risk is the risk of potential loss if we were unable to meet our funding requirements at a reasonable cost. We manage liquidity risk to help ensure that we can obtain cost effective funding to meet current and future obligations under both normal business as usual and stressful circumstances. Asset and Liability Management (ALM), reporting to the Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, is accountable for managing the liquidity position within the limits and guidelines set forth in our risk management policies. Market Risk Management provides independent oversight for the measurement, monitoring and reporting of PNCs liquidity risk and reports to the Chief Risk Officer. We typically maintain our liquidity position through: A large and stable deposit base derived from our retail and wholesale banking activities, A portfolio of liquid investment securities, Diversified sources of short term and long term wholesale funding, and Significant unused borrowing capacity at both the Federal Home Loan Bank and the Federal Reserve discount window. Liquid assets consist of short term investments (federal funds sold and other short term investments) and securities available for sale. At December 31, 2004, our liquid assets totaled $18.6 billion, with $8.1 billion pledged as collateral for borrowings, trust, and other commitments. PNC Bank, N.A. is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank and as such has access to advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank secured generally by residential mortgages, other real estate related loans, and mortgage backed securities. At December 31, 2004, our total unused borrowing capacity from the Federal Home Loan Bank under current collateral requirements was $17.3 billion. We can also obtain funding through alternative forms of borrowing, including federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements, and short term and long term debt issuance. On July 30, 2004, PNC Bank, N.A. established a program to offer up to $20 billion in senior and subordinated unsecured debt obligations with maturities of more than nine months. As of December 31, 2004, PNC Bank, N.A. had issued $1 billion of debt under this program, including $500 million of 18 month floating rate notes, due March 2006 issued during the third quarter of 2004 with interest payable at the rate of 1 month LIBOR minus 6 basis points, and $500 million of 5.25% Subordinated Notes due 2017 issued during the fourth quarter of 2004. These notes are not redeemable or subject to repayment at the option of the holder prior to maturity. On December 2, 2004, PNC Bank, N.A. established a program to offer up to $3.0 billion of its commercial paper. As of December 31, 2004, no commercial paper had been issued under this program. On March 10, 2005, PNC issued two series of senior debt under PNCs effective shelf registration statements. The first series consisted of $350 million of 4.2% Senior Notes due 2008 and the second series consisted of $350 million of 4.5% Senior Notes due 2010. The Senior Notes due 2008 were issued at a price of 99.953%, resulting in proceeds to PNC of approximately $350 million. The Senior Notes due 2010 were issued at a price of 99.774%, resulting in proceeds to PNC of approximately $349 million. Neither series of Senior Notes is redeemable by PNC or subject to repayment at the option of the holder prior to maturity. 48 Table of Contents The parent companys routine funding needs consist primarily of the return of capital to shareholders (dividends and share repurchases), debt service and the funding of its non bank affiliates and acquisitions. Parent company liquidity guidelines are designed to help ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet these requirements over the succeeding twelve month period. In managing parent company liquidity we consider funding sources, such as expected dividends to be received from PNC Bank, N.A. and potential debt issuance, and discretionary funding uses, the most significant of which is the external dividend to be paid on PNCs stock. The principal source of parent company cash flow is the dividends it receives from PNC Bank, N.A., which may be impacted by the following: Capital needs, Laws and regulations, Corporate policies, Contractual restrictions, and Other factors. Also, there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of national banks to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to extend credit to the parent company or its non bank subsidiaries. We provide additional information on these limitations in Note 4 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report and include such information here by reference. The amount available for dividend payments to the parent company by PNC Bank, N.A. without prior regulatory approval was approximately $995 million at December 31, 2004. In addition to dividends from PNC Bank, N.A., other sources of parent company liquidity include cash and short term investments, as well as dividends and loan repayments from other subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2004, the parent company had approximately $796 million in funds available from its cash and short term investments. We can generate liquidity for the parent company and PNCs non bank subsidiaries through the issuance of securities in public or private markets. At December 31, 2004, we had unused capacity under effective shelf registration statements of approximately $2.7 billion of debt or equity securities (of which approximately $700 million was used for the senior notes issues in March 2005 referred to above) and $100 million of trust preferred capital securities. The parent company also had an unused non reciprocal credit facility of $200 million at December 31, 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2004, $600 million of parent company senior debt matured. As of December 31, 2004, there were no parent company contractual obligations with maturities less than one year. See Note 17 Borrowed Funds in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. 49 Table of Contents Commitments The following tables set forth contractual obligations and various commitments representing required and potential cash outflows as of December 31, 2004.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW Market risk is the risk of a loss in earnings or economic value due to adverse movements in market factors such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and equity prices. We are exposed to market risk primarily by our involvement in the following activities: Traditional banking activities of taking deposits and extending loans, Private equity and other investments and activities whose economic values are directly impacted by market factors, and Trading in fixed income products, equities, derivatives, and foreign exchange, as a result of customer activities, underwriting, and proprietary trading. We have established enterprise wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor, and report market risk. Market Risk Management provides independent oversight by monitoring compliance with these limits and guidelines, and reporting significant risks in the business to the Board Finance Committee and ERMC. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT INTEREST RATE RISK Interest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates, and consumer preferences, affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities. Because of repricing term mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these products, changes in market interest rates not only affect expected near term earnings, but the economic values of these assets and liabilities as well. ALM centrally manages interest rate risk. ALM is responsible for making investment and trading decisions within authorized limits and guidelines for both economic value of equity (EVE) and net interest income. In managing interest rate risk, we limit our reliance on a particular interest rate scenario and position the balance sheet to grow net interest income and net interest margin within our targeted risk profile. We use the following to achieve these objectives: Securities purchases and sales, Mix of short term and long term funding, Financial derivatives, and Other capital markets instruments. The activities of ALM are subject to interest rate risk limits and certain policies approved by ALCO and the Board Finance Committee. 50 Table of Contents Sensitivity results and market interest rate benchmarks for the years ended December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 follow: Interest Sensitivity Analysis Dec. 312004 Dec. 312003 Net Interest Income Sensitivity Simulation Effect on net interest income in first year from gradual interest rate change over following 12 months of: 100 basis point increase .6 % (.5 )% 100 basis point decrease (1.2 )% (.9 )% Effect on net interest income in second year from gradual interest rate change over the preceding 12 months of: 100 basis point increase 3.6 % 1.1 % 100 basis point decrease (6.6 )% (7.6 )% Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity Model Effect on value of on and off balance sheet positions as a percentage of economic value of equity from instantaneous change in interest rates of: 200 basis point increase .3 % (7.0 )% 200 basis point decrease (7.6 )% (.2 )% Key Period End Interest Rates One month LIBOR 2.40 % 1.12 % Three year swap 3.66 % 2.76 % In addition to measuring the effect on net interest income assuming parallel changes in current interest rates, we routinely simulate the effects of a number of nonparallel interest rate environments. The following Net Interest Income Sensitivity To Alternative Rate Scenarios table reflects the percentage change in net interest income over the next two 12 month periods assuming the PNC Economists most likely rate forecast, implied market forward rates and a lower/flatter rate scenario. We are inherently sensitive to a flatter yield curve. When forecasting net interest income, we make assumptions about interest rates and the shape of the yield curve, the volume and characteristics of new business, and the behavior of existing positions. These assumptions determine the future level of simulated net interest income in the base interest rate scenario and the other interest rate scenarios presented in the following table. These simulations assume that as assets and liabilities mature, they are replaced or repriced at market rates. All changes in forecasted net interest income are relative to results in a base rate scenario where current market rates are assumed to remain unchanged over the forecast horizon. Net Interest Income Sensitivity To Alternative Rate Scenarios (as of December 31, 2004) PNCEconomist MarketForward Low/Flat Change in forecasted net interest income: First year sensitivity 1.0 % (.5 )% (1.9 )% Second year sensitivity 2.0 % (4.9 )% The graph below presents the yield curves for the base rate scenario and each of the alternative scenarios one year forward. Over the last several years, we have taken steps to position our balance sheet to benefit from rising long term interest rates under the belief that the current environment, characterized by recently low rates, will not continue over the longer term. Going forward, we believe that we have the deposit funding base and flexibility to change our investment profile to take advantage of opportunities presented by a higher rate environment. 51 Table of Contents MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT TRADING RISK Our trading activities include the underwriting of fixed income and equity securities, as well as customer driven and proprietary trading in fixed income securities, equities, derivatives, and foreign exchange. Trading activities are confined to financial instruments and financial derivatives. For each trading group (e.g., fixed income, derivatives, foreign exchange), we have implemented a set of risk limits that govern that particular group. Our overall corporate trading risk policy governs the nature and allocation of these limits. We use a variety of statistical and non statistical measurements to assess the level of market risk arising from trading activities. We use value at risk (VaR) as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in trading activities. VaR offers a common measure to compare trading risk across portfolios with exposures to different types of market factors. As required under the Market Risk Amendment to the Basel Accord, we calculate risk weighted capital for trading activities, which is driven by average VaR usage. For internal risk management purposes, we also estimate the amount of economic capital required at a 99.9% level of confidence by trading activities over a one year horizon. This measure is driven by both average VaR usage and potential future usage based on portfolio VaR limits. An enterprise wide VaR limit on trading activities is established by the Board Finance Committee. VaR limits for individual business units are established by ALCO. The following table shows VaR usage for 2004 by product type: VaR Usage by Product Type In millions Min Max Avg Fixed Income $.6 $8.2 $5.0 Equity .1 .8 .4 Foreign Exchange .1 .4 .1 Total .9 9.0 $5.5 To help ensure the integrity of the models used to calculate VaR for each portfolio and enterprisewide, we use a process known as backtesting. The backtesting process consists of comparing actual observations of trading related gains or losses against the VaR levels that were calculated at the close of the prior day. We would expect a maximum of two to three instances a year in which actual losses exceeded the prior day VaR measure. During the full year of 2004, there were no such instances at the enterprise wide level. This indicates that PNC uses a conservative enterprise wide VaR measure. The following graph shows a comparison of enterprise wide trading related gains and losses against prior day VaR for the period. Total trading related revenue was $126 million in 2004, $125 million for 2003 and $90 million for 2002. Trading related revenue includes both net interest income and noninterest income from trading activities. Enterprise wide trading related losses occurred on 71 of the 253 business days in 2004. See Note 8 Trading Activities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENT RISK Equity investment risk is the risk of potential losses associated with investing in both private and public equity markets. In addition to extending credit, taking deposits, and underwriting and trading financial instruments, we make and manage direct investments in a variety of transactions, including management buyouts, recapitalizations, and later stage growth financings in a variety of industries. We have investments in non affiliated and affiliated funds that make similar private equity investments, although new investments in non affiliated funds will be minimal. The economic and or book value of these investments and other assets such as loan servicing rights are directly affected by changes in market factors. The primary risk measurement for equity and other investments is the concept of economic capital. The economic capital is a common measure of risk for credit, market and operational risk. It is the worst case value depreciation over one year within 99.9% confidence level. Given the illiquid nature of many of these types of investments, it can be a challenge to determine their fair values. Market Risk Management provides independent oversight of the valuation process. PNC Equity Management Corp. (PNC EMC) and other PNC business units manage our equity and other investment activities. The Board Finance Committee approves policies and capital limits related to investment activities across PNC. Our businesses are responsible for making investment decisions within the approved policy limits and guidelines. 52 Table of Contents Private Equity The private equity portfolio is comprised of investments that vary by industry, stage and type of investment. We continue to make private equity investments at a moderate pace, consistent with current market conditions. Private equity investments are reported at fair value. Changes in the values of private equity investments are reflected in our results of operations. Due to the nature of the direct investments, we must make assumptions as to future performance, financial condition, liquidity, availability of capital, and market conditions, among other factors, to determine the estimated fair value of the investments. Market conditions and actual performance of the investments could differ from these assumptions. Accordingly, lower valuations may occur that could adversely impact earnings in future periods. Also, the valuations may not represent amounts that will ultimately be realized from these investments. See Private Equity Asset Valuation in the Critical Accounting Policies And Judgments section of Item 7 of this Report for additional information. At December 31, 2004, private equity investments carried at estimated fair value totaled $470 million compared with $531 million at December 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 39% of the amount is invested directly in a variety of companies and approximately 61% is invested in various limited partnerships. Private equity unfunded commitments totaled $119 million at December 31, 2004 compared with $176 million at December 31, 2003. Other Investments We also make investments in affiliated and non affiliated funds with both traditional and alternative investment strategies. Such investments include investments in BlackRocks mutual funds, hedge funds, and CDOs. The economic values could be driven by either the fixed income market or the equity markets, or both. As of December 31, 2004, major investments of this type included low income housing tax credits and capitalized servicing rights for commercial mortgage loans. ECONOMIC CAPITAL Our Economic Capital Committee governs the measurement of economic capital. This Committee meets at least quarterly to review economic capital measurements and approve methodology changes. The economic capital framework is a measure of the potential losses above and beyond expected losses. Potential one year losses are capitalized to a level consistent with a financial institution with an A rating by the credit rating agencies. Economic capital incorporates risk associated with potential credit losses (Credit Risk), fluctuations of the estimated market value of financial instruments (Market Risk), failure of people, processes or systems (Operational Risk), and income losses associated with declining volumes, margins and or fees, and the fixed cost structure of the business (Business Risk). We estimate credit and market risks at an exposure level while we estimate the remaining risk types at an institution or business segment level. We routinely compare the output of our economic capital model with industry benchmarks. IMPACT OF INFLATION Our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. Accordingly, future changes in prices do not affect the obligations to pay or receive fixed and determinable amounts of money. During periods of inflation, monetary assets lose value in terms of purchasing power and monetary liabilities have corresponding purchasing power gains. The concept of purchasing power, however, is not an adequate indicator of the effect of inflation on banks because it does not take into account changes in interest rates, which are an important determinant of our earnings. FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES We use a variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage interest rate, market and credit risk inherent in our business activities. Substantially all such instruments are used to manage risk related to changes in interest rates. Interest rate and total return swaps, interest rate caps and floors and futures contracts are the primary instruments used by us for interest rate risk management. Financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, interest rate, market and credit risk. For interest rate swaps and total return swaps, caps and floors and futures contracts, only periodic cash payments and, with respect to caps and floors, premiums, are exchanged. Therefore, cash requirements and exposure to credit risk are significantly less than the notional amount. Not all elements of interest rate, market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial or other derivatives, and such instruments may be ineffective for their intended purposes due to unanticipated market characteristics, among other reasons. Accounting Hedges Fair Value Hedging Strategies We enter into interest rate and total return swaps, caps, floors and interest rate futures derivative contracts to hedge designated commercial mortgage loans held for sale, commercial loans, bank notes, senior debt and subordinated debt for changes in fair value primarily due to changes in interest rates. Adjustments related to the ineffective portion of fair value hedging instruments are recorded in interest income, interest expense or noninterest income depending on the hedged item. 53 Table of Contents Accounting Hedges Cash Flow Hedging Strategy We enter into interest rate swap contracts to modify the interest rate characteristics of designated commercial loans from variable to fixed in order to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on future interest income. The fair value of these derivatives is reported in other assets or other liabilities and offset in accumulated other comprehensive income for the effective portion of the derivatives. When the hedged transaction culminates, any unrealized gains or losses related to these swap contracts are removed from accumulated other comprehensive income and are included in interest income. Any ineffectiveness of the strategy, as defined by our documented policies and procedures, is reported in interest income. Free Standing Derivatives To accommodate customer needs, we also enter into financial derivative transactions primarily consisting of interest rate swaps, caps, floors and foreign exchange and equity contracts. We manage our market risk exposure from customer positions through transactions with third party dealers. The credit risk associated with derivatives executed with customers is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans and is subject to normal credit policies. We may obtain collateral based on our assessment of the customer. Also included in free standing derivatives are transactions that we enter into for risk management and proprietary purposes that are not designated as accounting hedges, primarily interest rate basis swaps, total return swaps, credit default swaps and certain interest rate lock loan origination commitments as well as commitments to buy or sell mortgage loans. Basis swaps are agreements involving the exchange of payments, based on notional amounts, of two floating rate financial instruments denominated in the same currency, one pegged to one reference rate and the other tied to a second reference rate (e.g., swapping payments tied to one month LIBOR for payments tied to three month LIBOR). We use these contracts to mitigate the impact on earnings of exposure to a certain referenced interest rate. Interest rate lock commitments for, as well as commitments to buy or sell, real estate mortgage loans that we intend to sell are considered free standing derivatives. Our interest rate exposure on the rate lock commitments is economically hedged with pay fixed interest rate swaps and forward sale commitments. These contracts mitigate the impact on earnings of exposure to a certain referenced rate. We purchase credit default swaps to mitigate the economic impact of credit losses on specifically identified existing lending relationships. These derivatives typically are based upon the change in value, due to changing credit spreads, of publicly issued bonds issued by our customer. We enter into risk participation agreements to share some of the credit exposure with other financial counterparties related to interest rate derivative contracts or to take on credit exposure to generate revenue. We will be required to make/receive payments under these guaranties if a customer defaults on its obligation to perform under certain credit agreements. Agreements entered into prior to July 1, 2003 are considered financial guarantees. Agreements entered into after June 30, 2003 are considered free standing derivatives. We occasionally purchase or originate financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative. At the inception of the financial instrument, we assess whether the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the financial instrument (host contract), whether the financial instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative and the host contract is measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings, and whether a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument would meet the definition of a derivative. If the embedded derivative does not meet these three conditions, the embedded derivative would qualify as a derivative instrument and be recorded apart from the host contract and carried at fair value with changes recorded in current earnings. Free standing derivatives also include positions we take based on market expectations or to benefit from price differentials between financial instruments and the market based upon stated risk management objectives. 54 Table of Contents The following tables provide the notional amount and fair value of financial derivatives used for risk management and designated as accounting hedges as well as free standing derivatives at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003. Weighted average interest rates presented are based on contractual terms, if fixed, or the implied forward yield curve at each respective date, if floating.

Results for 2003 included expenses totaling $87 million after taxes, or $.31 per diluted share, in connection with the DOJ agreement, including related legal and consulting costs. Net income for 2003 also included the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle that negatively impacted earnings by $28 million, or $.10 per diluted share. Results for 2002 included a net loss from discontinued operations of $16 million, or $.05 per diluted share. See Note 6 Discontinued Operations in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. Net Interest Income Net interest income was $1.996 billion for 2003 compared with $2.197 billion for 2002. Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis was $2.006 billion and the net interest margin was 3.64% for 2003, a decline of $204 million and 35 basis points compared with 2002. The low interest rate environment, decreases in commercial loans, prepayments in the residential mortgage loan portfolio, and sales and maturities of securities that were replaced at lower yields resulted in a decline in taxable equivalent net interest income compared with 2002. Provision For Credit Losses The provision for credit losses was $177 million for 2003 compared with $309 million for 2002. The decline compared with the prior year was primarily due to the overall improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio during 2003. The provision for 2002 reflected additions to reserves for Wholesale Banking and losses related to Market Street liquidity facilities. Net charge offs were $211 million, or .59% of average loans, for 2003 compared with $223 million, or .60%, of average loans, for 2002. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of $90 million of charge offs in 2002 related to Market Street that more than offset the impact of two significant charge offs in 2003. Net charge offs for 2003 included $42 million related to a single loan to a wholesale goods/retail customer and $26 million related to a single airline industry credit for which a substantial reserve had been provided at December 31, 2002. Noninterest Income Noninterest income was $3.257 billion for 2003 compared with $3.197 billion for 2002, an increase of $60 million, or 2%. Asset management fees totaled $861 million for 2003, an increase of $8 million compared with 2002. Consolidated assets under management were $354 billion at December 31, 2003 compared with $313 billion at December 31, 2002. Growth in fixed income assets at BlackRock was the primary factor in the increase in assets under management during 2003. Fund servicing fees decreased $54 million, to $762 million, in 2003 compared with the prior year. Fund servicing fees for 2002 included the favorable impact of $13 million of fees related to the renegotiation of a client contract at PFPC and an additional $15 million related to PFPCs retirement services business, which was sold effective June 30, 2003. Apart from these items, the positive impact of new sales of accounting/administration services and offshore growth in 2003 was more than offset by revenue declines resulting from client attrition and the impact of competitive market conditions on pricing. Service charges on deposits totaled $239 million for 2003 and $227 million for 2002. The increase for 2003 reflected higher volumes partially offset by lower monthly service charges due to higher sales and continued implementation of free checking. Brokerage fees were $184 million for 2003, down $11 million compared with 2002. The decrease compared with 2002 reflected the impact of lower trading volumes and lower annuity fees in 2003. While brokerage activity improved in the latter part of 2003, this did not compensate for the lower trading volumes earlier in the year. Consumer services revenue of $251 million for 2003 represented an increase of $12 million or 5% compared with 2002. Higher revenue in 2003 was primarily due to the impact of additional fees from debit card transactions related to higher transaction volumes and additional fees from ATM transactions. Corporate services revenue totaled $485 million for 2003 compared with $526 million for 2002. Net gains in excess of valuation adjustments related to the liquidation of institutional loans held for sale included in this line item totaled $69 million in 2003 and $147 million in 2002. Partially offsetting this decline were net gains on sales of commercial mortgages that totaled $52 million for 2003, an increase of $21 million compared with 2002. Cash management and letters of credit fees totaled $250 million, a $14 million increase compared with 2002. This increase also partially offset the decline in net gains in excess of valuation adjustments. Equity management (private equity activities) net losses on portfolio investments were $25 million in 2003 compared with net losses of $51 million in 2002. Net securities gains were $116 million in 2003 and $89 million for 2002. Net securities gains for 2003 included $25 million related to the liquidation in early 2003 of the three entities formed in 2001 in the PAGIC transactions. Other noninterest income totaled $384 million in 2003 compared with $303 million for 2002. Other noninterest income from investments held by certain VIEs totaled $19 57 Table of Contents million for 2003 due solely to our adoption of FIN 46 in 2003. Net trading income included in other noninterest income increased $35 million in 2003 compared with the prior year. Other noninterest income for 2002 included the impact of an additional $20 million benefit resulting from a reduction in the put option liability related to the 2002 National Bank of Canada asset acquisition and a $14 million gain on the sale of a real estate investment. Noninterest Expense Total noninterest expense was $3.476 billion for 2003, an increase of $249 million or 8% compared with 2002. The efficiency ratio was 66% for 2003 and 60% for 2002 on a continuing operations basis. Noninterest expense for 2003 included the following: $120 million recognized in connection with the DOJ agreement, including $5 million of related legal and consulting costs, $36 million due to our adoption of FIN 46, $29 million of costs paid in connection with the liquidation of the three entities formed in 2001 in the PAGIC transactions, the impact of which was mostly offset by related net securities gains included in noninterest income, and $25 million of facilities charges related to leased space consistent with the requirements of SFAS 146. The effect of these items in 2003 was partially offset by the impact of a $25 million benefit from the vehicle leasing settlement during the fourth quarter of 2003. Noninterest expense for 2002 included the following: $30 million of legal and consulting fees related to regulatory compliance and legal proceedings for matters arising in connection with regulatory agreements entered into in 2002 and related matters, and A $15 million adjustment related to incentive and retention arrangements in the form of co investment partnerships for certain equity management employees. Partially offsetting these items in 2002 was the benefit of a $19 million reduction in reserves at PFPC that were originally established in 2001 largely related to a previously reported plan to consolidate selected facilities. Apart from the items described above, noninterest expense for 2003 increased from 2002 as costs related to reinvestment in new business initiatives and higher pension, stock option, incentive compensation and marketing expenses more than offset a $100 million benefit from efficiency initiatives in 2003. CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET REVIEW Loans Loans were $36.3 billion at December 31, 2003 compared with $35.5 billion at December 31, 2002. Apart from the impact of the consolidation of the Market Street conduit at December 31, 2003, loans declined $1.4 billion from the prior year. The decline was primarily due to run off in the residential mortgage and vehicle lease portfolios, and a decline in commercial loans, partially offset by an increase in home equity loans. Securities Total securities at December 31, 2003 were $15.7 billion compared with $13.8 billion at December 31, 2002. Securities represented 23% of total assets at December 31, 2003 compared with 21% at December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2003, the securities available for sale balance included a net unrealized gain of $4 million, which represented the difference between fair value and amortized cost. The comparable amount at December 31, 2002 was a net unrealized gain of $274 million. The expected weighted average life of securities available for sale was 2 years and 11 months at December 31, 2003 compared with 2 years and 9 months at December 31, 2002. Securities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost. All securities classified as held to maturity at December 31, 2002 were assets of companies formed in 2001 in transactions with AIG that were consolidated in PNCs financial statements. In January 2003, these securities were sold and these companies were liquidated. The expected weighted average life of securities held to maturity was 2 years and 7 months at December 31, 2003 and 20 years and 2 months at December 31, 2002. Loans Held For Sale Loans held for sale totaled $1.4 billion at December 31, 2003, and $1.6 billion at December 31, 2002. The institutional lending held for sale portfolio declined $.2 billion during 2002 and was the primary reason for the decline in total loans held for sale. Asset Quality Nonperforming assets were $328 million at December 31, 2003, a decline of $90 million from the prior year end. The decline in nonperforming assets reflected the significant improvement in overall asset quality during 2003. The ratio of nonperforming assets to total loans, loans held for sale and foreclosed assets was .87% at December 31, 2003 compared with 1.13% at December 31, 2002. The allowance for loan and lease losses was $632 million and represented 1.74% of total loans and 238% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2003. The comparable amounts were $673 million, 1.90% and 218%, respectively, at December 31, 2002. 58 Table of Contents Funding Sources Total funding sources were $56.7 billion at December 31, 2003 and $54.1 billion at December 31, 2002, an increase of $2.6 billion. Total borrowed funds increased $2.3 billion from December 31, 2002. The increase reflected the recognition of the following: Commercial paper totaling $2.2 billion and other liabilities of certain VIEs due to our adoption of FIN 46, The recognition of junior subordinated debentures totaling $1.2 billion at December 31, 2003, $300 million of which was issued in December 2003, in connection with the deconsolidation of certain subsidiary trusts under FIN 46, and $600 million of 5.25% Subordinated Notes due November 2015 that we issued in the fourth quarter of 2003. The impact of these items was partially offset by bank notes, senior debt and subordinated debt maturities during 2003. Shareholders Equity Shareholders equity totaled $6.6 billion at December 31, 2003 compared with $6.9 billion at December 31, 2002. The decline in shareholders equity compared with the balance at December 31, 2002 reflected the impact of our repurchase of common stock during 2003 at a total cost of $508 million and a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income that more than offset an increase in retained earnings during this period. Regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2003 were 8.2% for leverage, 9.5% for tier 1 risk based and 13.8% for total risk based capital. The regulatory capital ratios were 8.1% for leverage, 8.8% for tier 1 risk based and 12.5% for total risk based capital at December 31, 2002. GLOSSARY OF TERMS Accounting/administration net fund assets Net domestic and foreign fund investment assets for which we provide accounting and administration services.

Adjusted average total assets Primarily comprised of total average quarterly assets plus (less) unrealized losses (gains) on available for sale debt securities, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets. Annualized Adjusted to reflect a full year of activity. Assets under management Assets over which we have sole or shared investment authority for our customers/clients. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Capital Represents the amount of resources that a business segment should hold to guard against potentially large losses that could cause insolvency. It is based on a measurement of economic risk, as opposed to risk as defined by regulatory bodies or generally accepted accounting principles. The economic capital measurement process involves converting a risk distribution to the capital that is required to support the risk, consistent with an institutions target credit rating. As such, economic risk serves as a common currency of risk that allows an institution to compare different risks on a similar basis. Charge off Process of removing a loan or portion of a loan from a banks balance sheet because the loan is considered uncollectible. A charge off is also recorded when a loan is transferred to held for sale and the loans market value is less than its carrying amount. Common shareholders equity to total assets Common shareholders equity divided by total assets. Common shareholders equity equals total shareholders equity less preferred stock and the portion of capital surplus and retained interest related to the preferred stock. Credit derivatives Contractual agreements that provide protection against a credit event of one or more referenced credits. The nature of a credit event is established by the protection buyer and protection seller at the inception of a transaction, and such events include bankruptcy, insolvency and failure to meet payment obligations when due. The buyer of the credit derivative pays a periodic fee in return for a payment by the protection seller upon the occurrence, if any, of a credit event. Custody assets All investment assets held on behalf of clients under safekeeping arrangements. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Investment assets held in custody at other institutions on our behalf are included in the appropriate asset categories on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as if physically held by us. Derivatives Financial contracts whose value is derived from publicly traded securities, interest rates, currency exchange rates or market indices. Derivatives cover a wide assortment of financial contracts, including forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Earning assets Assets that generate income, which include: short term investments; loans held for sale; loans, net of unearned income; securities; federal funds sold; resale agreements; and certain other assets. Economic value of equity (EVE) The present value of the expected cash flows of our existing assets less the present value of the expected cash flows of our existing liabilities, plus the present value of the net cash flows of our existing off balance sheet positions. Effective duration A measurement, expressed in years, that, when multiplied by a change in interest rates, would approximate the percentage change in value of on and off balance sheet positions. 59 Table of Contents Efficiency Noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income. Foreign exchange contracts Contracts that provide for the future receipt and delivery of foreign currency at previously agreed upon terms. Funds transfer pricing A management accounting methodology designed to recognize the net interest income effects of sources and uses of funds provided by the assets and liabilities of business segments. These assets and liabilities are assigned funding rates that represent the interest cost for us to raise/invest funds with similar maturity and repricing structures, using the least cost funding sources available. Futures and forward contracts Contracts in which the buyer agrees to purchase and the seller agrees to deliver a specific financial instrument at a predetermined price or yield. May be settled either in cash or by delivery of the underlying financial instrument. Institutional lending repositioning A 2001 PNC strategic action taken to build a more diverse and valuable business mix designed to create shareholder value over time by reducing lending leverage and improving the risk/return characteristics of the banking business. Interest rate floors and caps Interest rate protection instruments that involve payment from the seller to the buyer of an interest differential, which represents the difference between a short term rate (e.g., three month LIBOR) and an agreed upon rate (the strike rate) applied to a notional principal amount. Interest rate swap contracts Contracts that are entered into primarily as an asset/liability management strategy to reduce interest rate risk. Interest rate swap contracts are exchanges of interest rate payments, such as fixed rate payments for floating rate payments, based on notional principal amounts. Leverage ratio Tier 1 risk based capital divided by adjusted average total assets. Net interest margin Annualized taxable equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets. Nondiscretionary assets under administration Assets we hold for our customers/clients in a nondiscretionary, custodial capacity. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Noninterest income to total revenue Total noninterest income divided by total revenue. Total revenue includes total noninterest income plus net interest income. Nonperforming assets Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructured loans, nonaccrual loans held for sale, foreclosed assets and other assets. Interest income does not accrue on assets classified as nonperforming. Nonperforming loans Nonperforming loans include loans to commercial, lease financing, consumer, commercial real estate and residential mortgage customers as well as troubled debt restructured loans. Nonperforming loans do not include nonaccrual loans held for sale or foreclosed and other assets. Interest income does not accrue on loans classified as nonperforming. Notional amount A number of currency units, shares, or other units specified in a derivatives contract. Recovery Cash proceeds received on a loan that had previously been charged off. The amount received is credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses. Return on capital Annualized net income divided by average capital. Return on average assets Annualized net income divided by average assets. Return on average common equity Annualized net income divided by average common shareholders equity. Risk weighted assets Primarily computed by the assignment of specific risk weights (as defined by The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) to assets and off balance sheet instruments. Securitization The process of legally transforming financial assets into securities. Shareholders equity to total assets Period end total shareholders equity divided by total period end assets. Tangible common capital ratio Common shareholders equity less goodwill and other intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights) divided by total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights). Taxable equivalent interest The interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than a taxable investment. In order to provide accurate comparisons of yields and margins for all earning assets, the interest income earned on tax exempt assets is increased to make them fully equivalent to other taxable interest income investments. Tier 1 risk based capital Tier 1 capital equals: total shareholders equity, plus trust preferred capital securities, plus certain minority interests that are held by others; less goodwill and certain intangible assets, less equity investments in nonfinancial companies and less net unrealized holding losses on available for sale equity securities. Net unrealized holding gains on available for sale equity securities, net unrealized holding gains (losses) on available for sale debt securities and net unrealized holding gains (losses) on cash flow hedge derivatives are excluded from total shareholders equity for tier 1 capital purposes. 60 Table of Contents Tier 1 risk based capital ratio Tier 1 risk based capital divided by period end risk weighted assets. Total fund assets serviced Total domestic and foreign fund investment assets for which we provide related processing services. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Total deposits The sum of total transaction deposits, savings accounts, certificates of deposit, other time deposits and deposits in foreign offices. Total return swap A non traditional swap where one party agrees to pay the other the total return of a defined underlying asset (e.g., loan), usually in return for receiving a stream of LIBOR based cash flows. The total returns of the asset, including interest and any default shortfall, are passed through to the counterparty. The counterparty is therefore assuming the credit and economic risk of the underlying asset. Total risk based capital Tier 1 risk based capital plus qualifying senior and subordinated debt, other minority interest not qualified as tier 1, and the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to certain limitations. Total risk based capital ratio Total risk based capital divided by period end risk weighted assets. Transaction deposits The sum of money market and interest bearing demand deposits and demand and other noninterest bearing deposits. Yield curve (shape of the yield curve, flat yield curve) A graph showing the relationship between the yields on financial instruments or market indices of the same credit quality with different maturities. For example, a normal or positive yield curve exists when long term bonds have higher yields than short term bonds. A flat yield curve exists when yields are the same for short term and long term bonds. A steep yield curve exists when yields on long term bonds are significantly higher than on short term bonds.
