ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC. PNC is one of the largest diversified financial services companies in the United States, operating businesses engaged in retail banking, corporate and institutional banking, asset management and global fund processing services. We operate directly and through numerous subsidiaries, providing many of our products and services nationally and others in our primary geographic markets in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Ohio, Kentucky and the greater Washington, D.C. area. We also provide certain asset management and global fund processing services internationally. KEY STRATEGIC GOALS Our strategy to enhance shareholder value centers on achieving revenue growth in our various businesses underpinned by prudent management of risk, capital and expenses. In each of our business segments, the primary drivers of growth are the acquisition, expansion and retention of customer relationships. We strive to achieve such growth in our customer base by providing convenient banking options, leading technological systems and a broad range of asset management products and services. We also intend to grow through appropriate and targeted acquisitions and, in certain businesses, by expanding into new geographical markets. In recent years, we have managed our interest rate risk to achieve a moderate risk profile with limited exposure to earnings volatility resulting from interest rate fluctuations. Our actions have created a balance sheet characterized by strong asset quality and significant flexibility to take advantage, where appropriate, of changing interest rates and to adjust to changing market conditions. On February 15, 2006, we announced that BlackRock and Merrill Lynch had entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which Merrill Lynch will contribute its investment management business to BlackRock in exchange for newly issued BlackRock common and preferred stock. Upon the closing of this transaction, which we expect to occur on or around September 30, 2006, BlackRocks assets under management will increase to almost $1 trillion and Merrill Lynch will own an approximate 49% economic interest in BlackRock. We will continue to own approximately 44.5 million shares of BlackRock common stock, representing an ownership interest of approximately 34%. In addition, upon closing, our investment in BlackRock will increase resulting in an after tax gain of approximately $1.6 billion, subject to adjustments through closing. This gain will significantly improve our capital position. This transaction must be approved by BlackRock shareholders and is subject to obtaining appropriate regulatory and other approvals. We currently control more than 80% of the voting interest in BlackRock and will vote our interest in support of the transaction. Additional information on this transaction is included in Note 26 Subsequent Event in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, in our Current Reports on Form 8 K filed February 15, 2006 and February 22, 2006 and in BlackRocks Current Reports on Form 8 K filed February 15, 2006 and February 22, 2006. To the extent that statements we make in this Report about our expectations for future results include results from BlackRock, those expectations do not give any effect to the impact to PNC from the change in accounting for PNCs interest in BlackRock that would take place when BlackRock and Merrill Lynch close this transaction. On October 11, 2005, we acquired Harris Williams & Co. (Harris Williams), one of the nations largest firms focused on providing merger and acquisition advisory and related services to middle market companies, including private equity firms and private and public companies. This acquisition should provide opportunities for commercial lending as well as wealth management and capital markets business growth. In May 2005, we successfully completed our acquisition of Riggs National Corporation (Riggs), a Washington, D.C. based banking company. The transaction gives us a substantial presence on which to build a market leading franchise in the affluent Washington metropolitan area. We include additional information on Riggs, as well as the first quarter 2005 acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. (SSRM) by our majority owned subsidiary, BlackRock, Inc. (BlackRock), in Note 2 Acquisitions in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report and here by reference. We also note that the SSRM and Harris Williams transactions were accretive to earnings in 2005 and we expect that the Riggs acquisition will be accretive to earnings beginning in 2006. THE ONE PNC INITIATIVE The One PNC initiative, which began in January 2005, is an ongoing, company wide initiative with goals of moving closer to the customer, improving our overall efficiency and targeting resources to more value added activities. PNC expects to realize $400 million of total pretax earnings benefit by 2007 from this initiative. As a result of this intensive process, we have reorganized our banking businesses to streamline and to better serve our customer base. The initiative has resulted in a simplified and a more centrally managed organization. As further described in our Current Reports on Form 8 K dated September 30, 2005 and December 28, 2005, and in Note 21 Segment Reporting in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report, our banking businesses have been reorganized into two units, Retail Banking and Corporate & Institutional Banking, and we have aligned our reporting accordingly. PNC plans to achieve approximately $300 million of cost savings initiatives through a combination of workforce reduction and other efficiencies. Of the approximately 3,000 positions to be eliminated, approximately 1,800 had been eliminated as of December 31, 2005. We estimate that these changes will result in employee severance and other implementation costs of approximately $74 million, including $54 million recognized during the second half of 2005. We expect that the remaining charges will be 19 Table of Contents incurred in 2006 and early 2007. The initiatives implemented to date have required approximately $11 million lower costs than originally expected, and we expect to maintain that variance over the remainder of the One PNC program. In addition, PNC intends to achieve at least $100 million in net revenue growth through the implementation of various pricing and business growth enhancements driven by the One PNC initiative. Initiatives to achieve this growth are progressing according to plan. We realized a net pretax financial benefit from the One PNC program of approximately $90 million in 2005, primarily in the latter half of the year and primarily in our banking businesses, which was $55 million more than we had previously estimated. We achieved this benefit by accelerating some of the 2006 initiatives into 2005. We expect to capture approximately $265 million in value by the end of 2006 as originally planned. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE Our financial performance is substantially affected by several external factors outside of our control, including: General economic conditions, Loan demand and utilization of credit commitments, Interest rates, and the shape of the interest rate yield curve, The performance of the capital markets, and Customer demand for other products and services. In addition to changes in general economic conditions, including the direction, timing and magnitude of movement in interest rates and the performance of the capital markets, our success in 2006 will depend, among other things, upon: Further success in the acquisition, growth and retention of customers, Successful execution of the One PNC initiative, Revenue growth, A sustained focus on expense management and improved efficiency, Maintaining strong overall asset quality, and Prudent risk and capital management. SUMMARY FINANCIAL RESULTS Year ended December 31 In billions, except for per share data 2005 2004 Net income $ 1.325 $ 1.197 Diluted earnings per share $ 4.55 $ 4.21 Return on Average common shareholders equity 16.58 % 16.82 % Average assets 1.50 % 1.59 % Results for 2005 included the impact of the following items: Implementation costs totaling $35 million after tax, or $.12 per diluted share, related to the One PNC initiative; Integration costs of $20 million after tax, or $.07 per diluted share, comprised of provision for credit losses, noninterest expense and deferred taxes, related to the May 2005 acquisition of Riggs; The reversal of deferred tax liabilities that benefited earnings by $45 million, or $.16 per diluted share, in the first quarter related to our transfer of ownership in BlackRock from PNC Bank, National Association (PNC Bank, N.A.) to our intermediate bank holding company, PNC Bancorp, Inc., in January 2005; and The $34 million after tax benefit of a second quarter 2005 loan recovery. Results for 2004 reflected the impact of charges totaling $49 million after taxes, or $.17 per diluted share, related to the 2002 BlackRock Long Term Retention and Incentive Plan (LTIP). This LTIP is described under 2002 BlackRock Long Term Retention and Incentive Plan in Item 7 of this Report. Our performance in 2005 included the following accomplishments: Total taxable equivalent revenue for 2005 increased 14% compared with the prior year, driven by continued growth in fee based businesses and net interest income. Average deposits for the year increased $7.9 billion, or 16%, compared with 2004, driven by higher money market deposits, certificates of deposit and other time deposits as well as growth in demand deposit balances, including the impact of our expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area. Average loans for 2005 increased $6.4 billion, or 16%, compared with 2004, driven by consumer and commercial loan demand, as well as an increase in residential mortgages, and the impact of our expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area. We have begun to realize benefits from the One PNC initiative sooner than originally anticipated and we remain on track to capture $400 million in value from One PNC by 2007. PNC invested more than $1 billion in 2005 to build scale and expand its presence into attractive markets and products. These investments include: expanding into the greater Washington, D.C. area with our Riggs acquisition; BlackRocks acquisition of SSRM to build scale; and the addition of Harris Williams. Asset quality remained very strong. Although some ratios increased, all remained at low levels. The ratio of nonperforming assets to total loans, loans held for sale and foreclosed assets was .42% at December 31, 2005 compared with .39% at December 31, 2004. 20 Table of Contents See Note 21 Segment Reporting in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for a reconciliation of total business segment earnings to total PNC consolidated earnings as reported on a GAAP basis, and see Net Interest Income GAAP Reconciliation in the Consolidated Income Statement Review section of Item 7 of this Report for a reconciliation of net income as reported under GAAP to net interest income presented on a taxable equivalent basis. BALANCE SHEET HIGHLIGHTS Total average assets were $88.5 billion for 2005 compared with $75.3 billion for 2004. Average interest earning assets were $73.0 billion in 2005 compared with $61.8 billion in 2004, an increase of $11.2 billion or 18%. An increase of $6.4 billion in average loans was the primary factor for the increase in average interest earning assets. In addition, average total securities increased $3.4 billion in 2005 compared with 2004. In October 2005, Market Street Funding LLC (Market Street), formerly Market Street Funding Corporation, was restructured as a limited liability company and entered into a subordinated Note Purchase Agreement (Note) with an unrelated third party. As a result of the Note issuance, we reevaluated whether PNC continued to be the primary beneficiary of Market Street under the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46 (Revised 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R). Based on this analysis, we determined that we were no longer the primary beneficiary and deconsolidated Market Street from our Consolidated Balance Sheet effective October 17, 2005. You can find additional information on Market Street within the Off Balance Sheet Arrangements And VIEs section of Item 7 of this Report. Average total loans were $47.4 billion for 2005 and $40.9 billion in 2004. This increase was driven by continued improvements in market loan demand and targeted sales efforts across our banking businesses, as well as the impact of our expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area. The increase in average total loans reflected growth in commercial loans of approximately $2.4 billion, consumer loans of approximately $2.0 billion and residential mortgages of approximately $2.1 billion, partially offset by a $.5 billion decline in lease financing loans. We sold our vehicle leasing business in 2004 as described under the Aircraft and Vehicle Leasing Businesses section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of Item 7 of this Report. Loans represented 65% of average interest earning assets for 2005 and 66% for 2004. Average securities totaled $19.3 billion for 2005 and $15.9 billion for 2004. Of this $3.4 billion increase, $2.5 billion was attributable to increases in mortgage backed, asset backed and other debt securities. The increase in 2005 also reflected the impact of Riggs. Securities comprised 26% of average interest earning assets for 2005 and 2004. Average total deposits were $57.6 billion for 2005, an increase of $7.9 billion over 2004. The increase in average total deposits was driven primarily by the impact of higher certificates of deposit, money market account and noninterest bearing deposit balances, and by higher Eurodollar deposits. The increase in 2005 also reflected the impact of our expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area. Average total deposits represented 65% of total sources of funds for 2005 and 66% for 2004. Average transaction deposits were $39.5 billion for 2005 compared with $35.9 billion for 2004. Average borrowed funds were $16.2 billion for 2005 and $12.5 billion for 2004. The following contributed to this increase: Various issuances of senior and subordinated bank notes and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances throughout 2005, as further detailed within Capital and Funding Sources in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial Review, along with the comparative impact of $500 million of subordinated bank notes issued in December 2004 and $500 million of senior bank notes issued in September 2004, The assumption of approximately $345 million of subordinated debt in 2005 with the Riggs acquisition, BlackRocks issuance of $250 million of convertible debentures in February 2005, and An increase in short term borrowings to fund asset growth. These increases were partially offset by maturing FHLB advances, senior bank notes, and senior and subordinated debt in 2004 and 2005. Shareholders equity totaled $8.6 billion at December 31, 2005, compared with $7.5 billion at December 31, 2004. See the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of Item 7 of this Report for additional information. LINE OF BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS We refer you to Item 1 of this Report for an overview of our business segments in Review of Lines of Business. Total business segment earnings were $1.5 billion for 2005 and $1.3 billion for 2004. Retail Banking Retail Bankings earnings totaled $682 million for 2005, an increase of $72 million, or 12%, compared with 2004. Continued organic customer growth and the expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area drove a growing balance sheet and a corresponding revenue increase of 6%. A sustained focus on expense management and improving credit quality also contributed to the 12% earnings growth. 21 Table of Contents Corporate & Institutional Banking Earnings from Corporate & Institutional Banking were $480 million for 2005 and $443 million for 2004. The 8% increase in earnings compared with 2004 was driven by balance sheet growth, improved fee income despite significantly lower gains on sales of institutional loans held for sale, and a reduction in the provision for credit losses. Our acquisition of Harris Williams in October 2005 contributed to increases in both revenues and expenses. BlackRock BlackRock reported earnings of $234 million for 2005 and $143 million for 2004. Earnings growth in 2005 was primarily due to performance fees on equity hedge fund and real estate equity alternative products; higher assets under management primarily as a result of organic growth and the acquisition of SSRM; and an increase in BlackRock Solutions revenue. Earnings for 2005 included $59 million of pretax LTIP expenses and nonrecurring pretax expenses of $9 million associated with the SSRM acquisition. Results for 2004 included a $104 million pretax impact from the LTIP expenses. See the 2002 BlackRock Long Term Retention and Incentive Plan section of Item 7 of this Report for additional information regarding the BlackRock LTIP. BlackRocks assets under management totaled $453 billion at December 31, 2005, an increase of 32% compared with the prior year end level. The increase was attributable to the impact of the SSRM acquisition, net new subscriptions and market appreciation. PNC owns approximately 70% of BlackRock and we consolidate BlackRock into our financial statements. Accordingly, approximately 30% of BlackRocks earnings are recognized as minority interest expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. BlackRock financial information in Item 7 of this Report is presented on a stand alone basis. The market value of our BlackRock shares was approximately $4.8 billion at December 31, 2005, while the book value at that date was approximately $700 million. PFPC PFPC earned $104 million for 2005 and $70 million for 2004. The 49% increase in earnings in 2005 was attributable to improved operating leverage and strong performances from custody, securities lending, and managed account services operations, reduced intercompany debt financing costs, a gain related to the resolution of a client contract dispute in the first quarter of 2005, and tax benefits related to foreign dividends repatriation and changes in state income tax apportionment methods. PFPCs accounting/administration net fund assets increased 15% and custody fund assets increased 6% as of December 31, 2005 compared with the balances at December 31, 2004. The increases were driven by new business and asset inflows from existing customers, as well as comparatively favorable market conditions. Other The Other net loss for 2005 was $104 million compared with a net loss of $27 million for 2004. The following factors, on an after tax basis, contributed to the higher net loss in 2005 within Other: Net securities losses in 2005 of $27 million compared with net securities gains of $38 million in 2004; Implementation costs related to the One PNC initiative totaling $35 million in 2005; Riggs acquisition integration costs recognized in 2005 totaling $20 million; and The comparative impact of the first quarter 2004 gain of $22 million from the sale of our modified coinsurance contracts. Partially offsetting the factors above were the following, on an after tax basis: The first quarter 2005 benefit of the $45 million deferred tax liability reversal related to the internal transfer of our investment in BlackRock, as referred to above under Summary Financial Results; and The $19 million comparative increase in equity management gains in 2005. 22 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW NET INTEREST INCOME OVERVIEW Changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest earning assets and related yields, interest bearing liabilities and related rates paid, and noninterest bearing sources. See Statistical Information Analysis of Year To Year Changes in Net Interest Income and Average Consolidated Balance Sheet and Net Interest Analysis in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. NET INTEREST INCOME GAAP RECONCILIATION The interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than a taxable investment. To provide more meaningful comparisons of yields and margins for all earning assets, we also provide net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis by increasing the interest income earned on tax exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income on other taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP. A reconciliation of net interest income as reported in the Consolidated Income Statement (GAAP basis) to net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis follows (in millions): For the year ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Net interest income, GAAP basis $ 2,154 $ 1,969 $ 1,996 Taxable equivalent adjustment 33 20 10 Net interest income, taxable equivalent basis $ 2,187 $ 1,989 $ 2,006 Taxable equivalent net interest income increased $198 million in 2005 compared with 2004 due to strong growth in earning assets and deposits. Management expects net interest income to continue to grow and to be higher for full year 2006 compared with 2005. NET INTEREST MARGIN The net interest margin was 3.00% for 2005, a decline of 22 basis points compared with 2004. The following factors contributed to the decline in net interest margin in 2005: An increase in the average rate paid on deposits of 93 basis points for 2005 compared with 2004. The average rate paid on money market accounts, the largest single component of interest bearing deposits, increased 130 basis points, reflecting the increases in short term interest rates that began in mid 2004. An increase in the average rate paid on borrowed funds of 131 basis points for 2005 compared with 2004. By comparison, the yield on interest earning assets increased 68 basis points. Higher balances of interest earning trading assets for 2005, which negatively affected the overall yield on interest earning assets. The factors above were partially offset by the favorable impact on net interest margin in 2005 of an increase of 15 basis points related to noninterest bearing sources of funding. See Consolidated Income Statement Review under the 2004 Versus 2003 section of Item 7 of this Report for further information regarding 2003 taxable equivalent net interest income and margin. PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES The provision for credit losses decreased $31 million, to $21 million, for 2005 compared with 2004. The decline in the provision for credit losses was primarily due to the benefit of a $53 million loan recovery in the second quarter of 2005 resulting from a litigation settlement, in addition to continued strong asset quality. The favorable impact of these factors on the provision was partially offset by the impact of total average loan and loan commitments growth in 2005 compared with the prior year. We expect loan and loan commitment growth to continue to impact the provision during 2006. In addition, we do not expect to sustain asset quality at its current level and we expect a higher provision for credit losses in 2006. However, based on the assets we currently hold and current business trends and activities, we believe that overall asset quality will remain strong for at least the near term. See the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of Item 7 for additional information regarding factors impacting the provision for credit losses. Also see Allowances For Loan And Lease Losses And Unfunded Loan Commitments And Letters of Credit in that Credit Risk Management section for additional information regarding factors impacting the provision for credit losses. NONINTEREST INCOME Summary Noninterest income was $4.162 billion for 2005, an increase of $599 million compared with 2004. Higher asset management fees was the largest factor in the increase, driven largely by BlackRocks acquisition of SSRM in January 2005 and higher performance fees. In addition, noninterest income in 2005 reflected increases in all other major categories other than net securities losses in 2005 compared with net gains in 2004. We expect that the increase in our ownership in the Merchant Services business and the impact of the Harris Williams acquisition will have a positive impact on noninterest income in 2006. Additional analysis Combined asset management and fund servicing fees amounted to $2.313 billion for 2005 compared with $1.811 billion for 2004. The increase reflected the impact of the first quarter 2005 SSRM acquisition, higher performance fees at BlackRock, and other growth in assets managed and serviced. 23 Table of Contents Assets under management at December 31, 2005 totaled $494 billion compared with $383 billion at December 31, 2004. In addition to the impact of net new business during 2005, the acquisition of SSRM added $50 billion of assets under management during the first quarter of 2005. PFPC provided fund accounting/administration services for $830 billion of net fund assets and provided custody services for $476 billion of fund assets at December 31, 2005, compared with $721 billion and $451 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2004. These increases were driven by net new business and asset inflows from existing customers, as well as comparatively favorable market conditions. Service charges on deposits increased $21 million for 2005 compared with 2004. Although growth in service charges has been limited due to our offering of free checking in both the consumer and small business channels, free checking has positively impacted customer and demand deposit growth as well as other deposit related fees. Brokerage fees increased $6 million, to $225 million, for 2005 compared with the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher mutual fund related revenues in 2005. Consumer services fees increased $23 million, to $287 million, in 2005 compared with 2004. Higher fees reflected additional fees from debit card transactions, primarily due to higher volumes and the expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area. Corporate services revenue was $511 million for 2005, compared with $493 million in 2004. Corporate services revenue in 2005 benefited from the impact of higher net gains on commercial mortgage loan sales, higher fees related to commercial mortgage servicing activities, increased loan syndication fees and higher capital markets revenues, including revenues attributable to Harris Williams, compared with the prior year. These increases were partially offset by a $45 million decline in 2005 of net gains in excess of valuation adjustments related to our liquidation of institutional loans held for sale. Our liquidation of institutional loans held for sale is now complete. Equity management (private equity) net gains on portfolio investments totaled $96 million for 2005 and $67 million for 2004. Net securities losses amounted to $41 million for 2005 compared with net securities gains of $55 million in 2004. Our discussion under the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Item 7 provides additional information on the impact on net securities losses of actions taken during the second quarter of 2005 regarding our securities portfolio. Noninterest revenue from trading activities totaled $157 million for 2005 and $113 million for 2004. While customer activity represented the majority of trading revenue, the increase compared with 2004 was primarily the result of proprietary trading activities. We provide additional information on our trading activities under Market Risk Management Trading Risk in the Risk Management section of this Item 7. Other noninterest income increased $52 million, to $341 million, in 2005 compared with 2004. Other noninterest income typically fluctuates from period to period depending on the nature and magnitude of transactions completed. Other noninterest income for 2005 included the following pretax items: A $33 million gain related to contributions of BlackRock stock to the PNC Foundation, transactions that also impacted noninterest expense, and Income related to the 2005 SSRM and Riggs acquisitions. These factors more than offset the impact of the following pretax gains in 2004: A first quarter $34 million gain related to the sale of our modified coinsurance contracts, and A second quarter $13 million gain recognized in connection with BlackRocks sale of its interest in Trepp LLC, a provider of commercial mortgage backed security information, analytics and technology. PRODUCT REVENUE Corporate & Institutional Banking offers treasury management and capital markets related products and services, commercial loan servicing and equipment leasing products that are marketed by several businesses across PNC. Treasury management revenue, which includes fees as well as net interest revenue from customer deposit balances, totaled $410 million for 2005 and $373 million for 2004. The 10% increase in revenue reflected the longer term nature of treasury management deposits along with the rising interest rate environment, strong deposit growth, continued expansion and client utilization of commercial card services, and a steady increase in business to business processing volumes. The acquisition of Riggs also contributed to the revenue growth in 2005. Revenue from capital markets products and services was $175 million for 2005, compared with $140 million in 2004. The acquisition of Harris Williams and increases in loan syndication fees and other client related activity drove the 25% increase in capital markets revenue. Midland Loan Services offers servicing, real estate advisory and technology solutions for the commercial real estate finance industry. Midlands revenue, which includes fees and net interest income from servicing portfolio deposit balances, totaled $131 million for 2005 and $108 million for 24 Table of Contents 2004. The 21% revenue growth was primarily driven by growth in the commercial mortgage servicing portfolio and related services. Revenue from equipment leasing products was $69 million for 2005 and $84 million for 2004. The decline was primarily due to the interest cost of funding the potential tax exposure on the cross border leasing portfolio. The impact of cross border leasing is expected to continue to have a negative impact on leasing revenue in 2006. See Cross Border Leases and Related Tax and Accounting Matters in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Item 7 for further information. As a component of our advisory services to clients, we provide a select set of insurance products to fulfill specific customer financial needs. Primary insurance offerings include: Annuities, Life, Credit life, Health, Disability, and Commercial lines coverage. Client segments served by these insurance solutions include those in Retail Banking and Corporate & Institutional Banking. Insurance products are sold by PNC licensed insurance agents and through licensed third party arrangements. We recognized revenue from these products of $61 million in 2005 and $65 million in 2004. The decrease reflected a decline in annuity fee revenue driven primarily by the sale of our modified coinsurance contracts in 2004. PNC, through subsidiary companies, Alpine Indemnity Limited and PNC Insurance Corp., participates as a reinsurer for its general liability, automobile liability and workers compensation programs and as a direct writer for its property and certified domestic terrorism programs. In the normal course of business, PNC Insurance Corp. and Alpine Indemnity Limited maintain insurance reserves for reported claims and for claims incurred but not reported based on actuarial assessments. We believe these reserves were adequate at December 31, 2005. NONINTEREST EXPENSE Total noninterest expense was $4.333 billion for 2005, an increase of $598 million compared with 2004. The efficiency ratio was 69% for 2005 and 68% for 2004. We expect noninterest expense to be flat in 2006 compared with 2005 except for the increase in our ownership in the Merchant Services business and the impact of the Harris Williams acquisition. Noninterest expense for 2005 included the following: An increase of $325 million in BlackRock non LTIP operating expenses that reflected the impact of costs resulting from the first quarter 2005 SSRM acquisition and other investments to fund growth; Costs totaling approximately $132 million resulting from our Riggs acquisition, including approximately $16 million of integration costs; BlackRock LTIP charges of $64 million; Implementation costs totaling $53 million related to the One PNC initiative; Contributions of BlackRock stock to the PNC Foundation of $40 million; and Costs totaling $17 million related to the Harris Williams acquisition. The effect of these increases was partially offset by cost reductions of approximately $90 million realized in 2005 from the One PNC initiative. The impact of the Riggs integration and One PNC implementation costs was reflected in several noninterest expense items in the Consolidated Income Statement. Noninterest expense for 2004 included a $110 million charge associated with the BlackRock LTIP and conversion related and other nonrecurring costs totaling approximately $11 million related to our acquisition of United National Bancorp, Inc. Apart from the impact of these items, noninterest expense increased $178 million, or 5%, in 2005 compared with 2004. These higher expenses were driven by investments in our businesses and increased sales incentives. EFFECTIVE TAX RATE Our effective tax rate was 30.8% for both 2005 and 2004. Several factors contributed to a relatively low effective tax rate for each year. The low effective rate for 2005 was primarily attributable to the impact of the reversal of deferred tax liabilities in connection with the transfer of our ownership in BlackRock to our intermediate bank holding company. This transaction reduced our first quarter 2005 tax provision by $45 million, or $.16 per diluted share. See Note 2 Acquisitions in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. The following favorably impacted the effective tax rate for 2004: A reduced state and local tax expense due to tax benefits of $18 million recorded in connection with New York state and city audit findings, primarily associated with BlackRock, and A $14 million reduction in income tax expense following our determination that we no longer required an income tax reserve related to bank owned life insurance. We expect the effective tax rate in 2006 to be closer to the statutory tax rate. 25 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET REVIEW SUMMARIZED BALANCE SHEET DATA December 31 in millions 2005 2004 Assets Loans, net of unearned income $ 49,101 $ 43,495 Securities available for sale and held to maturity 20,710 16,761 Loans held for sale 2,449 1,670 Other 19,694 17,797 Total assets $ 91,954 $ 79,723 Liabilities Funding sources $ 77,172 $ 65,233 Other 5,629 6,513 Total liabilities 82,801 71,746 Minority and noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities 590 504 Total shareholders equity 8,563 7,473 Total liabilities, minority and noncontrolling interests, and shareholders equity $ 91,954 $ 79,723 The summarized balance sheet data above is based upon our Consolidated Balance Sheet in Item 8 of this Report. Higher total assets at December 31, 2005 compared with the prior year end were driven by loan growth resulting primarily from continued improvements in market loan demand, higher securities balances that reflected normal portfolio activity, purchases, and the impact of our expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area. An analysis of changes in selected balance sheet categories follows. LOANS, NET OF UNEARNED INCOME Loans increased $5.6 billion, or 13%, as of December 31, 2005 compared with December 31, 2004. Improvements in market loan demand, in addition to targeted sales efforts across our banking businesses, drove the increase in total loans compared with the prior year end. The impact of our Riggs acquisition added $2.7 billion of loans as of December 31, 2005. Loans at December 31, 2004 included $2.3 billion related to the Market Street conduit that we deconsolidated effective October 17, 2005. Details Of Loans December 31 in millions 2005 2004 Commercial Retail/wholesale $ 4,854 $ 4,961 Manufacturing 4,045 3,944 Other service providers 1,986 1,787 Real estate related 2,577 2,104 Financial services 1,438 1,145 Health care 616 560 Other 3,809 2,937 Total commercial 19,325 17,438 Commercial real estate Real estate projects 2,244 1,460 Mortgage 918 520 Total commercial real estate 3,162 1,980 Equipment lease financing 3,628 3,907 Total commercial lending 26,115 23,325 Consumer Home equity 13,790 12,734 Automobile 938 836 Other 1,445 2,036 Total consumer 16,173 15,606 Residential mortgage 7,307 4,772 Vehicle lease financing 189 Other 341 505 Unearned income (835 ) (902 ) Total, net of unearned income $ 49,101 $ 43,495 As the table above indicates, the loans that we hold continued to be diversified among numerous industries and types of businesses. The loans that we hold are also diversified across the geographic areas where we do business. See Note 7 Loans, Commitments To Extend Credit and Concentrations of Credit Risk in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. Commercial Lending Exposure (a) December 31 in millions 2005 2004 Investment grade or equivalent 46 % 47 % Non investment grade $50 million or greater 2 % 2 % All other non investment grade 52 % 51 % Total 100 % 100 % (a) Includes all commercial loans in the Retail Banking and Corporate & Institutional Banking business segments other than the loans of Market Street. We deconsolidated Market Street from our Consolidated Balance Sheet effective October 17, 2005. Cross Border Leases and Related Tax and Accounting Matters The equipment lease portfolio totaled $3.6 billion at December 31, 2005 and included approximately $1.7 billion of cross border leases. Cross border leases are primarily leveraged leases of equipment located in foreign countries, primarily in western Europe and Australia. We no longer enter into cross border lease transactions. 26 Table of Contents Aggregate residual value at risk on the total commercial lease portfolio at December 31, 2005 was $1.1 billion. We have taken steps to mitigate $.6 billion of this residual risk, including residual value insurance coverage with third parties, third party guarantees, and other actions. Upon completing examination of our 1998 2000 consolidated federal income tax returns, the IRS provided us with an examination report which proposed increases in our tax liability, principally arising from adjustments to several of our cross border lease transactions. The proposed adjustments would reverse the tax treatment of these transactions as we reported them on our filed tax returns. We believe the method we used to report these transactions is supported by appropriate tax law and have filed a protest and begun discussions of the IRS examination findings with the IRS appeals office. While we cannot predict with certainty the result of filing the protest and resultant discussions, any resolution would most likely involve a change in the timing of tax deductions which, in turn, depending on the exact resolution, could significantly impact the economics of these transactions. The IRS has begun an audit of our 2001 2003 consolidated federal income tax returns. We expect them to again make adjustments to the cross border lease transactions referred to above as well as to new cross border lease transactions entered into during those years. We believe our reserves for these exposures were adequate at December 31, 2005. In July 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a proposed staff position to consider whether any change in the timing of tax benefits associated with these types of transactions should result in a recalculation under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. (SFAS) 13, Accounting for Leases. The FASB has had further discussions on this proposal in 2006. The FASBs current position is that any cumulative adjustment will be recognized through opening retained earnings in the year of adoption under the provisions of SFAS 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. See Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on SFAS 154. Assuming that the FASB staff position becomes effective January 1, 2007, we believe that the cumulative adjustment from the recalculations would be in the range of approximately $140 million to $160 million after tax. Under the leveraged leasing accounting rules, any immediate or future reductions in earnings from the change in accounting would be recovered in subsequent years. In addition to the transactions referred to above, three lease to service contract transactions that we were party to were structured as partnerships for tax purposes. These partnerships are under audit by the IRS. However, we do not believe that our exposure from these transactions is material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position. Aircraft and Vehicle Leasing Businesses On September 1, 2004, we acquired the business of the Aviation Finance Group, LLC (AFG), an Idaho based company that specializes in loans to finance private aircraft. By combining the business of AFG with our existing business, we have increased our ability to offer a variety of loans and leasing products to corporate aircraft customers. See Note 2 Acquisitions in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. During the second quarter of 2004, we completed the sale of our subsidiary, PNC Vehicle Leasing LLC, and the related vehicle lease portfolio and other assets. In connection with this transaction, we also terminated our related residual insurance policies with our remaining residual insurance carrier. As a result of these actions, we have completed the exit of the consumer vehicle leasing business, including our related exposures to the used vehicle market and the payment of future residual insurance claims. We recognized a pretax net loss of $3 million related to this sale during the second quarter of 2004. Net Unfunded Credit Commitments December 31 in millions 2005 2004 Commercial $ 27,774 $ 20,969 Consumer 9,471 7,655 Commercial real estate 2,337 1,199 Other 596 483 Total $ 40,178 $ 30,306 Commitments to extend credit represent arrangements to lend funds or provide liquidity subject to specified contractual conditions. Commercial commitments are reported net of participations, assignments and syndications, primarily to financial institutions, totaling $6.7 billion at both December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004. As a result of deconsolidating Market Street in October 2005, amounts related to Market Street were considered third party unfunded commitments at December 31, 2005. These unfunded credit commitments totaled $4.6 billion at December 31, 2005 and are included in the preceding table primarily within the Commercial and Consumer categories. See the Off Balance Sheet Arrangements And Consolidated VIEs section of Item 7 and Note 3 Variable Interest Entities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for further information regarding Market Street. The remaining increase in consumer net unfunded commitments at December 31, 2005 compared with the balance at December 31, 2004 was primarily due to net unfunded commitments related to growth in open ended home equity loans. In addition to credit commitments, our net outstanding standby letters of credit totaled $4.2 billion at December 31, 2005 and $3.7 billion at December 31, 2004. Standby letters of credit commit us to make payments on behalf of our customers if specified future events occur. 27 Table of Contents SECURITIES Details Of Securities In millions AmortizedCost FairValue December 31, 2005 (a) SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE Debt securities U.S. Treasury and government agencies $ 3,816 $ 3,744 Mortgage backed 13,794 13,544 Commercial mortgage backed 1,955 1,919 Asset backed 1,073 1,063 State and municipal 159 158 Other debt 87 86 Corporate stocks and other 196 196 Total securities available for sale $ 21,080 $ 20,710 December 31, 2004 SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE Debt securities U.S. Treasury and government agencies $ 4,735 $ 4,722 Mortgage backed 8,506 8,433 Commercial mortgage backed 1,380 1,370 Asset backed 1,910 1,901 State and municipal 175 176 Other debt 33 33 Corporate stocks and other 123 125 Total securities available for sale $ 16,862 $ 16,760 SECURITIES HELD TO MATURITY Debt securities Asset backed $ 1 $ 1 Total securities held to maturity $ 1 $ 1 (a) Securities held to maturity at December 31, 2005 were less than $.5 million. Securities represented 23% of total assets at December 31, 2005 compared with 21% at December 31, 2004. The increase in total securities compared with December 31, 2004 was primarily due to the acquisition of Riggs and normal portfolio activity. At December 31, 2005, the securities available for sale balance included a net unrealized loss of $370 million, which represented the difference between fair value and amortized cost. The comparable amount at December 31, 2004 was a net unrealized loss of $102 million. The increase in the net unrealized loss at December 31, 2005 reflected the impact on bond prices of increases in interest rates during 2005 partially offset by the sales of securities during the second quarter of 2005 as discussed below. We evaluate our portfolio of securities available for sale in light of changing market conditions and other factors and, where appropriate, take steps intended to improve our overall positioning. In late April and early May 2005 we sold $2.1 billion of securities available for sale and terminated $1.0 billion of resale agreements that were most sensitive to extension risk due to rising short term interest rates. We also purchased $2.1 billion of securities with higher yields and lower extension risk. These transactions resulted in realized net securities and other losses of approximately $31 million, which are included in our results of operations for 2005. The fair value of securities available for sale decreases when interest rates increase and vice versa. Further increases in interest rates in 2006, if sustained, will adversely impact the fair value of securities available for sale going forward compared with the fair value at December 31, 2005. Net unrealized gains and losses in the securities available for sale portfolio are included in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax. The expected weighted average life of securities available for sale was 4 years and 1 month at December 31, 2005 compared with 2 years and 8 months at December 31, 2004. We estimate that at December 31, 2005 the effective duration of securities available for sale is 2.7 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel increase in interest rates and 2.4 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in interest rates. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2004 were 2.7 years and 2.3 years, respectively. LOANS HELD FOR SALE Education loans held for sale totaled $1.9 billion at December 31, 2005 and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2004 and represented the majority of our loans held for sale at each date. We classify substantially all of our education loans as loans held for sale. Generally, we sell education loans when the loans are placed into repayment status. Gains on sales of education loans totaled $19 million for 2005, $30 million for 2004 and $20 million for 2003. These gains are reflected in the other noninterest income line item in our Consolidated Income Statement and in the results of the Retail Banking segment. Our liquidation of institutional loans held for sale resulted in net gains in excess of valuation adjustments of $7 million in 2005, $52 million in 2004 and $69 million in 2003. These gains are reflected in the corporate services line item in our Consolidated Income Statement and in the results of the Corporate & Institutional Banking business segment. This liquidation has now been completed. OTHER ASSETS The increase of $1.9 billion in Assets Other in the preceding Summarized Balance Sheet Data table includes the impact of increases in goodwill and other intangible assets arising from three 2005 acquisitions along with an increase in accounts receivable. Goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in connection with the Riggs, SSRM and Harris Williams acquisitions totaled $1.0 billion in 2005. See Note 9 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for further information. In addition, accounts receivable included in other assets increased $.6 billion at December 31, 2005 compared with the prior year end, due in part to increases at PFPC and BlackRock. 28 Table of Contents CAPITAL AND FUNDING SOURCES DETAILS OF FUNDING SOURCES December 31 in millions 2005 2004 Deposits Money market $ 24,462 $ 21,250 Demand 17,157 15,996 Retail certificates of deposit 13,010 9,969 Savings 2,295 2,851 Other time 1,313 833 Time deposits in foreign offices 2,038 2,370 Total deposits 60,275 53,269 Borrowed funds Federal funds purchased 4,128 219 Repurchase agreements 1,691 1,376 Bank notes and senior debt 3,875 2,383 Subordinated debt 4,469 4,050 Commercial paper (a) 10 2,251 Other borrowed funds 2,724 1,685 Total borrowed funds 16,897 11,964 Total $ 77,172 $ 65,233 (a) Attributable primarily to Market Street, which was deconsolidated in October 2005. Various seasonal and other factors impact our period end deposit balances whereas average balances (discussed under the Balance Sheet Highlights section of this Item 7 above) are more indicative of underlying business trends. The increase in deposits as of December 31, 2005 reflected sales and retention efforts related to core deposits as well as the impact of our expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area. Higher borrowed funds at December 31, 2005 were driven in part by the following 2005 transactions: Senior bank note issuances of $350 million in March, $500 million in July and $75 million in August, Senior debt issuances of $700 million in March and $400 million in December and BlackRocks issuance of $250 million of convertible debentures in February, Subordinated bank debt issuance of $500 million in September and the assumption of $345 million of subordinated debt related to the Riggs transaction, $1 billion of FHLB advances issued in June, and Higher short term borrowings to fund asset growth. These factors were partially offset by maturities of $750 million of senior bank notes and $350 million of subordinated debt during 2005. Capital We manage our capital position by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing debt and equity instruments, making treasury stock transactions, maintaining dividend policies and retaining earnings. The increase of $1.1 billion in total shareholders equity at December 31, 2005 compared with December 31, 2004 primarily reflected the impact of retained earnings of $750 million and the issuance of $356 million of shares in connection with the Riggs acquisition. Common shares outstanding at December 31, 2005 were 292.9 million, an increase of 10.3 million over December 31, 2004. We issued approximately 6.6 million shares of common stock during the second quarter of 2005 in connection with the Riggs acquisition and approximately .7 million shares during the fourth quarter in connection with the Harris Williams acquisition. In February 2004, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 20 million shares of our common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions through February 2005. The 2004 repurchase authorization was a replacement and continuation of the prior repurchase program. Under these programs, we purchased 3.7 million common shares during 2004 at a total cost of $207 million. A new program to purchase up to 20 million shares was authorized as of February 16, 2005 and replaced the 2004 program, which was terminated. During 2005, we purchased .5 million common shares at a total cost of $26 million under both the 2005 and 2004 common stock repurchase programs, all of which occurred during the first quarter. The 2005 common stock repurchase program will remain in effect until fully utilized or until modified, superseded or terminated. The extent and timing of additional share repurchases under this program will depend on a number of factors including, among others, market and general economic conditions, economic and regulatory capital considerations, alternative uses of capital, and the potential impact on our credit rating. The impact on our capital of asset growth, including acquisitions, has restricted share repurchases and could continue to do so over the next several quarters although capital growth as a result of earnings and the anticipated consequences of the completion of BlackRocks acquisition of Merrill Lynchs investment management business would increase our flexibility in this area. 29 Table of Contents Risk Based Capital December 31 dollars in millions 2005 2004 Capital components Shareholders equity Common $ 8,555 $ 7,465 Preferred 8 8 Trust preferred capital securities 1,417 1,194 Minority interest 291 226 Goodwill and other intangibles (4,122 ) (3,112 ) Net unrealized securities losses 240 66 Net unrealized losses (gains) on cash flow hedge derivatives 26 (6 ) Equity investments in nonfinancial companies (40 ) (32 ) Other, net (11 ) (15 ) Tier 1 risk based capital 6,364 5,794 Subordinated debt 2,216 1,924 Eligible allowance for credit losses 697 683 Total risk based capital $ 9,277 $ 8,401 Assets Risk weighted assets, including off balance sheet instruments and market risk equivalent assets $ 76,673 $ 64,539 Adjusted average total assets 88,329 75,757 Capital ratios Tier 1 risk based 8.3 % 9.0 % Total risk based 12.1 13.0 Leverage 7.2 7.6 Tangible common 5.0 5.7 The access to, and cost of, funding new business initiatives including acquisitions, the ability to engage in expanded business activities, the ability to pay dividends, the level of deposit insurance costs, and the level and nature of regulatory oversight depend, in part, on a financial institutions capital strength. The declines in the capital ratios at December 31, 2005 compared with the ratios at December 31, 2004 were primarily caused by asset growth and the addition of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the Riggs, SSRM and Harris Williams transactions. At December 31, 2005, each of our banking subsidiaries was considered well capitalized based on regulatory capital ratio requirements. See the Supervision And Regulation section of Item 1 of this Report and Note 4 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. We believe our bank subsidiaries will continue to meet these requirements in 2006. 30 Table of Contents OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND VIES We engage in a variety of activities that involve unconsolidated entities or that are otherwise not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet that are generally referred to as off balance sheet arrangements. The following sections of this Report provide further information on these types of activities: Commitments, including contractual obligations and other commitments, included within the Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report, and Note 24 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. The following provides a summary of variable interest entities (VIEs), including those in which we hold a significant variable interest but have not consolidated and those that we have consolidated into our financial statements as of December 31, 2005 and 2004.

BlackRock engages in these transactions principally to address client needs through the launch of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and private investment funds. BlackRock has not been deemed the primary beneficiary of these entities. Additional information about BlackRock is available in its SEC filings, which can be found at www.sec.gov and on BlackRocks website, www.blackrock.com. Market Street is a multi seller asset backed commercial paper conduit that is owned by an independent third party. Market Streets activities are limited to the purchasing of assets or making of loans secured by interests primarily in pools of receivables from US corporations that desire access to the commercial paper market. Market Street funds the purchases or loans by issuing commercial paper which has been rated A1/P1 by Standard & Poors and Moodys, respectively, and is supported by pool specific credit enhancement, liquidity facilities and program level credit enhancement. PNC Bank, N.A. provides certain administrative services, a portion of the program level credit enhancement and the majority of liquidity facilities to Market Street in exchange for fees negotiated based on market rates. Credit enhancement is provided in part by PNC Bank, N.A. in the form of a cash collateral account that is funded by a loan facility that expires March 25, 2010. See Note 7 Loans, Commitments To Extend Credit and Concentrations of Credit Risk and Note 24 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. PNC views its credit exposure to Market Street transactions as 31 Table of Contents limited. All of Market Streets assets at December 31, 2005 and 2004 collateralize the commercial paper obligations. For the most part, PNC is not required to fund under the liquidity facilities if Market Streets assets are in default. Our obligations are secondary to the risk of first loss provided by the sellers or another third party. Neither creditors nor equity investors in Market Street have any recourse to our general credit. PNC received program administrator fees and commitment fees related to PNCs portion of the liquidity facilities of $9.5 million and $3 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2005. Under the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46), we consolidated Market Street effective July 1, 2003 as we were deemed the primary beneficiary of Market Street. In October 2005, Market Street was restructured as a limited liability company and entered into a subordinated Note Purchase Agreement (Note) with an unrelated third party. The principal amount of the Note was increased to $4.6 million by December 31, 2005 and has an original maturity of eight years. The Note bears interest at 18% with any penalty interest/fees charged by Market Street on specific transactions accruing to the benefit of the Note holder. Proceeds from the issuance of the Note were placed in a first loss reserve account that may be used to reimburse any losses incurred by Market Street, PNC Bank, N.A. or other providers under the liquidity facilities and the credit enhancement arrangements. As a result of the Note issuance, we reevaluated whether PNC continued to be the primary beneficiary of Market Street under the provisions of FIN 46R. Based on this analysis, we determined that we were no longer the primary beneficiary and deconsolidated Market Street from our Consolidated Balance Sheet effective October 17, 2005. We make certain equity investments in various limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects utilizing the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) pursuant to Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital, to facilitate the sale of additional affordable housing product offerings and to assist us in achieving goals associated with the Community Reinvestment Act. The primary activities of the limited partnerships include the identification, development and operation of multi family housing that is leased to qualifying residential tenants. Generally, these types of investments are funded through a combination of debt and equity, with equity typically comprising 30% to 60% of the total project capital. We consolidated those LIHTC investments in which we own a majority of the limited partnership interests. We also consolidated entities in which we, as a national syndicator of affordable housing equity, serve as the general partner (together with the aforementioned LIHTC investments), and no other entity owns a majority of the limited partnership interests. In these syndication transactions, we create funds in which our subsidiary is the general partner and sells limited partnership interests to third parties, and in some cases may also purchase a limited partnership interest in the fund. The funds limited partners can generally remove the general partner without cause at any time. The purpose of this business is to generate income from the syndication of these funds and to generate servicing fees by managing the funds. General partner activities include selecting, evaluating, structuring, negotiating, and closing the fund investments in operating limited partnerships, as well as oversight of the ongoing operations of the fund portfolio. The assets are primarily included in Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Neither creditors nor equity investors in the LIHTC investments have any recourse to our general credit. The consolidated aggregate assets and debt of these LIHTC investments are provided in the Consolidated VIEs PNC Is Primary Beneficiary table and reflected in the Corporate & Institutional Banking business segment. We have a significant variable interest in certain other limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects. We do not own a majority of the limited partnership interests in these entities and are not the primary beneficiary. We use the equity method to account for our investment in these entities. Information regarding these partnership interests is reflected in the Non Consolidated VIEs Significant Variable Interests table. We also have subsidiaries that invest in and act as the investment manager for a private equity fund that is organized as a limited partnership as part of our equity management activities. The fund invests in private equity investments to generate capital appreciation and profits. As permitted by FIN 46R, we have deferred applying the provisions of the interpretation for this entity pending further action by the FASB.

In connection with our One PNC initiative, during the third quarter of 2005 we reorganized our banking businesses into two units, Retail Banking and Corporate & Institutional Banking, and aligned our reporting accordingly. Our treasury management activities, which include cash and investment management, receivables management, disbursement services, funds transfer services, information reporting, and global trade services; capital markets products and services, which include foreign exchange, derivatives, loan syndications, securities underwriting, securities sales and trading, and mergers and acquisitions advisory and related services to middle market companies; commercial loan servicing, real estate advisory and technology solutions for the commercial real estate finance industry; and equipment leasing products are offered through Corporate & Institutional Banking and marketed by several businesses across PNC. Results of individual businesses are presented based on our management accounting practices and our operating structure. There is no comprehensive, authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to GAAP; therefore, the financial results of individual businesses are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company. We refine our methodologies from time to time as our management accounting practices are enhanced and our businesses and management structure change. Financial results are presented, to the extent practicable, as if each business operated on a stand alone basis. As permitted under GAAP, we have aggregated the business results for certain operating segments for financial reporting purposes. Our capital measurement methodology is based on the concept of economic capital. However, we have increased the capital assigned to certain business segments. Capital assigned to Retail Banking has been increased to 6% of funds to reflect the capital required for well capitalized banks and to approximate market comparables for this business. The capital for BlackRock and PFPC has been increased to reflect their legal entity shareholders equity. BlackRocks capital is consistent with its separate public company financial statement disclosures. We have allocated the allowance for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit based on our assessment of risk inherent in the loan portfolios. Our allocation of the costs incurred by operations and other support areas not directly aligned with the businesses is primarily based on the use of services. Total business segment financial results differ from total consolidated results. The impact of these differences is primarily reflected in minority interest in income of BlackRock and in the Other category in the Results of Businesses Summary table that follows. Other includes residual activities that do not meet the criteria for disclosure as a separate reportable business, such as asset and liability management activities, related net securities gains or losses, certain trading activities, equity management activities, differences between business segment performance reporting and financial statement reporting (GAAP), corporate overhead and intercompany eliminations.

The interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than a taxable investment. To provide more meaningful comparisons of yields and margins for all earning assets, we also provide revenue on a taxable equivalent basis by increasing the interest income earned on tax exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income on other taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP. The following is a reconciliation of total consolidated revenue on a book (GAAP) basis to total consolidated revenue on a taxable equivalent basis (in millions): Year endedDecember 31, 2005 Year endedDecember 31, 2004 Total consolidated revenue, book (GAAP) basis $ 6,316 $ 5,532 Taxable equivalent adjustment 33 20 Total consolidated revenue, taxable equivalent basis $ 6,349 $ 5,552 (b) Amounts for BlackRock and PFPC represent the sum of total operating revenue and nonoperating income (less debt financing costs for PFPC).

Continued organic customer growth and the expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area drove a growing balance sheet and a corresponding revenue increase of 6%. A sustained focus on expense management and improving credit quality also contributed to the 12% earnings growth. Highlights of Retail Bankings performance during 2005 include: Consumer and small business checking relationships increased by 172,000, or 10%, compared with December 31, 2004. Consumer related new checking relationships increased 10%, average consumer demand deposits increased 7% and home equity loans increased 15% compared with the comparable prior year amounts. The small business area continued its positive momentum with strong customer and balance sheet growth. Average small business loans increased 19% over 2004 on the strength of increased demand from both existing customers and new relationships. Small business deposits increased 6% over the same period and new checking relationships increased 8%. The wealth management business sustained solid growth over 2004 as asset management fees increased $20 million as a result of pricing enhancements, certain one time fees and the expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area. Assets under management totaled $49 billion at December 31, 2005 compared with $50 billion at December 31, 2004. Our expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area in the second quarter of 2005 has resulted in solid growth, with checking relationships increasing by 11% during the last six months of 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we completed the acquisition of an additional 20% interest in our Merchant Services business from First Data. This transaction gives us a 60% ownership interest and positions us to take advantage of the payment revenue sources from small business customers. Results of this business are now consolidated in our financial statements. Noninterest expense increased $44 million compared with 2004 and reflected the expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area. Retail Bankings efficiency ratio improved to 60% compared with 62% a year earlier. Credit quality remained strong and stable. Net charge offs as a percentage of average loan outstandings were .23% for 2005 compared with .32% in 2004. Total revenue for 2005 was $2.857 billion compared with $2.694 billion for the same period last year. Taxable equivalent net interest income of $1.582 billion increased $111 million, or 8%, compared with 2004 due to a 10% increase in average deposits and a 14% increase in average loan balances. The net interest income growth has been somewhat mitigated by a narrower spread between loan yields and deposit costs. Noninterest income increased $52 million, or 4%, compared with 2004 primarily driven by increased asset management revenue, service charges on deposits and consumer service fees. Growth in the latter two areas can be attributed mainly to a growing customer base. Increases in noninterest income were partially offset by: A decrease in gains from sales of education loans of $11 million compared with 2004; A $10 million pretax gain from the sale of certain investment consulting activities of Hawthorn recognized in 2004; and Lower ATM surcharge revenue in 2005 from changing customer behaviors and a strategic decision to reduce the out of footprint ATM network. The provision for credit losses declined $9 million in 2005 compared with 2004 primarily due to a one time impact in the first quarter of 2004 associated with the decision to change the charge off policy related to smaller nonperforming commercial loans. Overall credit quality remained strong as evidenced by the decline in nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans to .33% as of December 31, 2005 compared with .41% at the same time last year. We expect that the provision for credit losses will increase with loan growth. We have not been and we do not expect to be materially impacted by the recent changes in the federal bankruptcy laws. Noninterest expense in 2005 totaled $1.715 billion, an increase of $44 million, or 3%, compared with 2004. Retail Banking incurred approximately $74 million in operating costs as a result of the expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area in 2005 and recognized $11 million in nonrecurring costs in 2004 associated with the United National acquisition. Excluding the impact of these expenses, noninterest expense declined $19 million compared with 2004. This decline was reflected primarily in staff expense as a result of One PNC initiatives. Full time employees at December 31, 2005 totaled 11,703, a decline of 97 from December 31, 2004. The expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area accounted for an increase in full time employees of 621 at December 31, 2005. Excluding the impact of this expansion on full time employees, the number of Retail Banking full time employees at December 31, 2005 declined 6% compared with December 31, 2004. We have adopted a relationship based lending strategy to target specific customer sectors (homeowners, small businesses and auto dealerships) while seeking to maintain a moderate risk profile in the loan portfolio. Average home equity loans grew by $1.7 billion, or 15%, compared with 2004. The increase was attributable to $1.3 billion from organic loan growth, $.3 billion from expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area and $.1 billion from portfolio purchases. Consumer loan demand is starting to slow as a result of the rising rate environment. Average commercial loans grew 14% on the strength of increased loan demand from existing small business customers and the acquisition of new relationships through our sales efforts. New loan volume in the small business arena increased 16% over 2004. 35 Table of Contents Average residential mortgage loans increased $517 million, or 58%, primarily due to the addition of loans from the greater Washington, D.C. area acquisition. Payoffs in our existing portfolio, which will continue throughout 2006, reduced the impact of the additional loans acquired. Growing core checking deposits as a lower cost funding source and as the cornerstone product to build customer relationships are primary objectives of our deposit strategy. Average total deposits increased $3.9 billion, or 10%, compared with 2004. The deposit growth was driven by increases in the number of checking relationships (new customer acquisition and the expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area) and the recapture of consumer certificate of deposit balances as interest rates have risen. During this rising rate environment, we expect the rate of growth in demand deposit balances to be less than the rate of growth for customer checking relationships. Additionally, we expect to see customers shift their funds from lower interest bearing deposits to higher yielding deposits or investment products. The shift was evident during the second half of 2005 and impacted the level of average demand deposits in that period. Higher energy costs to consumers could also have a negative impact on demand deposit balance growth. Average demand deposit growth of $909 million, or 6%, was driven by a $229 million increase in the core business due to continued growth in total checking relationships and $680 million attributable to the expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area. Small business checking relationship retention has improved. Consumer checking relationship retention remains steady and strong due to increased penetration rates of debit card, online banking and online bill payment. Customer balances in other deposit products remained consistent while certificates of deposits increased $2.5 billion. This increase was attributable to the rising interest rate environment attracting customers back into this product. Assets under management of $49 billion at December 31, 2005 declined $1 billion compared with the balance at December 31, 2004. The effects of comparatively higher equity markets and the expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area were more than offset by net client asset outflows. Net client asset outflows are the result of ordinary course distributions from trust and investment management accounts and account closures exceeding investment additions from new and existing clients. The net outflows were primarily related to a few significant low margin clients. Nondiscretionary assets under administration of $84 billion at December 31, 2005 declined $9 billion compared with the balance at December 31, 2004. The decline primarily reflects the loss of two sizeable master custody accounts with minimal earnings impact.

(e) Includes nonperforming loans of $108 million at December 31, 2005 and $51 million at December 31, 2004. Earnings from Corporate & Institutional Banking for 2005 increased $37 million, or 8%, compared with the prior year. The increase in earnings compared with 2004 was driven by balance sheet growth and improved fee income. The impact of significantly lower net gains on sales of institutional loans held for sale was partially offset by a reduction in the provision for credit losses. While our acquisition of Harris Williams in October 2005 contributed to increases in both revenues and expenses in the fourth quarter, the impact on earnings for 2005 was not significant. Highlights for Corporate & Institutional Bankings 2005 results included: Average loan balances increased $2.1 billion, or 12%, over 2004, including the impact of the deconsolidation of the Market Street conduit. While usage has remained relatively constant year over year, growth was driven by continued strong customer demand and PNCs expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area. Growth in all loan categories fueled the increase in outstandings. Average deposits increased $1.9 billion, or 25%, compared with 2004, driven by sales of treasury management products, growth in our commercial mortgage servicing portfolio and related deposits, and continued strong liquidity positions within our customer base. Total revenue increased $71 million, or 6%, compared with 2004 due to higher taxable equivalent net interest income and strong growth in noninterest income despite a $45 million decline in net gains on institutional loans held for sale. Noninterest expense increased $51 million, or 8%, compared with the prior year primarily due to expenses related to acquisition activity and customer growth, as well as an increase in expenses associated with consolidated LIHTC investments. Operating leverage improved in 2005 driven by the growth in revenue and a focus on controlling costs. Taxable equivalent net interest income for 2005 increased $34 million, or 5%, compared with 2004 primarily as a result of higher loan balances funded mainly by higher deposits. The impact of the deconsolidation of Market Street effective October 17, 2005, the interest cost of funding the potential tax exposure on the cross border leasing portfolio, and a refined method of accounting for loan origination fees and costs partially offset these factors. Based on market conditions, we expect a slower rate of loan growth in future periods. We also expect growth in deposits to continue in the near term. The provision for credit losses was a $30 million credit in 2005 compared with a $5 million provision for 2004. The negative provision for 2005 resulted primarily from a $53 million loan recovery in the second quarter of 2005. The increase in nonperforming assets over prior year end is attributable primarily to an increase in nonaccrual asset based loans. Based on the assets we currently hold and current business trends and activities, we believe that overall asset quality will remain strong at least for the near term. However, we anticipate that the provision for credit losses will increase in future quarters. 37 Table of Contents Noninterest income for 2005 increased $37 million, or 6%, compared with 2004 primarily due to higher fees from our commercial mortgage servicing, treasury management, and capital markets products and services, including Harris Williams services, and higher net gains on commercial mortgage loans sales. These increases were partially offset by a $45 million decrease in net gains on institutional loans held for sale. The liquidation of institutional loans held for sale is complete. Noninterest expense for 2005 increased 8% compared with 2004 primarily as a result of higher staff and related expenses. Higher expenses were associated with the Harris Williams acquisition, our expansion into the greater Washington, D.C. area, higher compensation costs associated with customer and revenue growth and a 20% increase in expenses associated with consolidated LIHTC investments.

(b) Includes BlackRock Funds, BlackRock Liquidity Funds, BlackRock Closed End Funds, Short Term Investment Fund and BlackRock Global Series Funds. Earnings at BlackRock increased $91 million in 2005 compared with 2004. Earnings growth in 2005 was primarily due to higher assets under management primarily as a result of organic growth and the acquisition of SSRM; performance fees on equity hedge funds and real estate alternative products acquired in the SSRM acquisition; and an increase in BlackRock Solutions&reg; revenue. Earnings for 2005 included $59 million of pretax LTIP expenses and nonrecurring pretax expenses of $9 million associated with the SSRM acquisition. Results for 2004 included a $104 million pretax impact from the LTIP expenses. Results for 2004 also included the sale of BlackRocks equity interest in Trepp LLC and the impact of $18 million of income tax benefits resulting from the resolution of New York state and city tax audit findings. Total operating revenue increased 64% compared with 2004 primarily due to a $385 million increase in investment advisory and administrative fees driven by increased assets under management totaling $453 billion at December 31, 2005, including $50 billion assumed in the SSRM acquisition. Total expense increased 52% in 2005 compared with the prior year primarily as a result of higher staffing levels following the SSRM acquisition, higher incentive compensation expense and higher general and administration expense. General and administration expense rose in the comparison primarily due to an increase in marketing and promotional costs, a rise in occupancy expense with the assumption of additional office space through the SSRM acquisition, and an increase in portfolio services costs related to supporting higher asset under management levels and increased trading activities. Assets under management at December 31, 2005 increased $111 billion, or 32%, compared with December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to net new business and the SSRM acquisition. Apart from the impact of the SSRM acquisition, the increase in assets under management in 2005 reflected net new subscriptions of $50 billion and market appreciation of $11 billion. BlackRock continued to operate in a global marketplace characterized by substantial volatility during 2005. Increasing short term interest rates, a flattening of the yield curve and volatility in global equity and commodities markets created challenging conditions across BlackRocks asset classes. On February 15, 2006, we announced that BlackRock and Merrill Lynch had entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which Merrill Lynch will contribute its investment management business to BlackRock in exchange for newly issued BlackRock common and preferred stock. Upon the closing of this transaction, which we expect to occur on or around September 30, 2006, BlackRocks assets under management will increase to almost $1 trillion and Merrill Lynch will own an approximate 49% economic interest in BlackRock. We will continue to own approximately 44.5 million shares of BlackRock common stock, representing an ownership interest of approximately 34%. This transaction must be approved by BlackRock shareholders and is subject to obtaining appropriate regulatory and other approvals. We currently control more than 80% of the voting interest in BlackRock and will vote our interest in support of the transaction. Additional information on this transaction is included in Note 26 Subsequent Event in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, in our Current Reports on Form 8 K filed February 15, 2006 and February 22, 2006, and in BlackRocks Current Reports on Form 8 K filed February 15, 2006 and February 22, 2006. BlackRock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BLK.

PFPC earnings for 2005 increased $34 million, or 49%, compared with 2004. The higher earnings for 2005 were attributable to overall improved operating leverage and strong contributions to operating income from custody, securities lending, and managed account services operations, reduced intercompany debt financing costs, a gain related to the resolution of a client contract dispute in the first quarter of 2005, and tax benefits related to both foreign dividends repatriation and changes in state income tax apportionment methods. Highlights of PFPCs performance in 2005 include: Managed account services continued to grow its client base as assets increased 74%, to $51 billion, compared with 2004. Alternative investment net assets serviced were $78 billion at December 31, 2005, a 74% increase from 2004, reflecting continued success in pursuing hedge fund and other alternative investment business. Offshore revenues increased 25% and assets serviced offshore increased 26% compared with 2004 reflecting continued strong offshore sales performance. Operating revenue increased $75 million, or 9%, over the prior year reflecting continued business expansion of our existing clients, new business wins, and comparatively favorable equity market conditions. Increases related to out of pocket and pass through items of $11 million had no impact on earnings. In January 2005 PFPC accepted approximately $10 million to resolve a client contract dispute, which is reflected as other revenue in the table. Operating expense increased 4% in 2005 compared with 2004 and reflected a sustained focus on managing expenses to achieve improved operating margins in an increasingly competitive environment. Of this increase, $11 million represented out of pocket and pass through items referred to above. Operating income for 2004 benefited from accretion of $11 million related to a single discounted client contract liability which ended during the second quarter of 2004. Earnings for 2005 benefited from a reduction in pretax financing costs of $16 million, attributable to the debt refinancing discussed below and the retirement of debt during 2004 totaling $115 million. PFPC repaid another $160 million in intercompany debt during 2005 and anticipates continued debt reductions in 2006. Effective January 2005, PFPC restructured its remaining intercompany term debt obligations given the comparatively favorable interest rate environment at that time. PFPC recorded debt prepayment penalties totaling $8 million on a pretax basis in the first quarter of 2005 to effect the restructuring, which was more than offset by resulting interest expense savings. This cost is reflected as nonoperating expense in the table above. Increases in both accounting/administration and custody fund assets at December 31, 2005 compared with December 31, 2004 resulted primarily from new business and asset inflows from existing customers. Subaccounting shareholder accounts serviced by PFPC increased over the year earlier period due to net new business and growth in existing client accounts. Transfer agency shareholder accounts declined compared with the balance at December 31, 2004 primarily resulting from lost business due to client consolidations. Total fund assets serviced by PFPC amounted to $1.9 trillion at December 31, 2005 compared with $1.8 trillion at December 31, 2004. 40 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND JUDGMENTS Our consolidated financial statements are prepared by applying certain accounting policies. Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report describes the most significant accounting policies that we use. Certain of these policies require us to make estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or be subject to variations that may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods. We must use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when financial assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on either quoted market prices or are provided by other independent third party sources, when available. When such third party information is not available, we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations. Allowances For Loan And Lease Losses And Unfunded Loan Commitments And Letters Of Credit We maintain allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit at levels that we believe to be adequate to absorb estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. We determine the adequacy of the allowances based on periodic evaluations of the loan and lease portfolios and other relevant factors. However, this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates, all of which may be susceptible to significant change, including, among others: Expected default probabilities, Exposure at default, Loss given default, Amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, Value of collateral, Estimated losses on consumer loans and residential mortgages, and Amounts for changes in economic conditions and potential estimation or judgmental errors. In determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses, we make specific allocations to impaired loans, to pools of watchlist and nonwatchlist loans and to consumer and residential mortgage loans. We also allocate reserves to provide coverage for probable losses not covered in specific, pool and consumer reserve methodologies related to qualitative and measurement factors. While allocations are made to specific loans and pools of loans, the total reserve is available for all credit losses. Commercial loans are the largest category of credits and are the most sensitive to changes in assumptions and judgments underlying the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses. We have allocated approximately $489 million, or 82%, of the total allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2005 to the commercial loan category. Consumer and residential mortgage loan allocations are made at a total portfolio level based on historical loss experience adjusted for portfolio activity. Approximately $31 million, or 5.2%, of the total allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2005 have been allocated to these loans. The remainder of the allowance is allocated primarily to commercial real estate and lease financing loans. To the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates, additional provision for credit losses may be required that would reduce future earnings. See the following for additional information: Allowances For Loan And Lease Losses And Unfunded Loan Commitments And Letters Of Credit in the Credit Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report, Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 8 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements, and Allocation Of Allowance For Loan And Lease Losses in the Statistical Information section in Item 8 of this Report. Private Equity Asset Valuation At December 31, 2005, private equity investments carried at estimated fair value totaled $449 million compared with $470 million at December 31, 2004. We value private equity assets at each balance sheet date based primarily on either, in the case of limited partnership investments, the financial statements received from the general partner or, for direct investments, the estimated fair value of the investments. There is a time lag in our receipt of the financial information that is the primary basis for the valuation of our limited partnership interests. We recognized in the fourth quarter of 2005 valuation changes related to limited partnership investments that reflected the impact of third quarter 2005 market conditions and performance of the underlying companies. Due to the nature of the direct investments, we must make assumptions as to future performance, financial condition, liquidity, availability of capital, and market conditions, among others, to determine the estimated fair value of the investments. The valuation procedures that we apply to direct investments include techniques such as cash flow multiples for the entity, independent appraisals of the value of the entity or the pricing used to value the entity in a recent financing transaction. We value affiliated partnership interests based on the underlying investments of the partnership utilizing procedures consistent with those applied to direct investments. 41 Table of Contents We reflect changes in the value of equity management investments in our results of operations. Market conditions and actual performance of the companies that we invest in could differ from these assumptions, resulting in lower valuations that could reduce earnings in future periods. Accordingly, the valuations may not represent amounts that will ultimately be realized from these investments. Lease Residuals We provide financing for various types of equipment, aircraft, energy and power systems, and rolling stock through a variety of lease arrangements. Direct financing leases are carried at the sum of lease payments and the estimated residual value of the leased property, less unearned income. Residual value insurance or guarantees by governmental entities cover a significant portion of the residual value. Residual values are subject to judgments as to the value of the underlying equipment that can be affected by changes in economic and market conditions and the financial viability of the residual guarantors and insurers. To the extent not guaranteed or assumed by a third party, or otherwise insured against, we bear the risk of ownership of the leased assets. This includes the risk that the actual value of the leased assets at the end of the lease term will be less than the residual value, which could result in an impairment charge and reduce earnings in the future. These residual values are reviewed for impairment no less than on an annual basis. See Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. Goodwill Goodwill arising from business acquisitions represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired. Most of our goodwill relates to value inherent in the fund servicing, Retail Banking and Corporate & Institutional Banking businesses. The value of this goodwill is dependent upon our ability to provide quality, cost effective services in the face of competition from other market participants on a national and international basis. We also rely upon continuing investments in processing systems, the development of value added service features, and the ease of access to our services. As such, goodwill value is supported ultimately by earnings, which is driven by the volume of business transacted and, for certain businesses, the market value of assets under administration or for which processing services are provided. Lower earnings resulting from a lack of growth or our inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill, which could result in a charge and reduced earnings in the future. At least annually, management evaluates events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment in the carrying amount of goodwill. See Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 9 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. Revenue Recognition We derive net interest and noninterest income from various sources, including: Lending, Securities portfolio, Investment management and fund servicing, Customer deposits, Loan servicing, Brokerage services, Sale of loans and securities, Certain private equity activities, and Securities and derivatives trading activities including foreign exchange. We also earn fees and commissions from issuing loan commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, selling various insurance products, providing treasury management services and mergers and acquisitions advisory and related services and participating in certain capital markets transactions. The timing and amount of revenue that we recognize in any period is dependent on estimates, judgments, assumptions, and interpretation of contractual terms. Changes in these factors can have a significant impact on revenue recognized in any period due to changes in products, market conditions or industry norms. See Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. Income Taxes Because our ownership interest in BlackRock, as measured by value, is less than 80%, federal tax law requires us to file two consolidated federal income tax returns: one for PNC and subsidiaries excluding the consolidated results of BlackRock and its subsidiaries, and a second return solely for BlackRock and its subsidiaries. We and our subsidiaries also file state and local income tax returns in many jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, we and our subsidiaries enter into transactions for which the tax treatment is unclear or subject to varying interpretations. In addition, filing requirements, methods of filing and the calculation of taxable income in various state and local jurisdictions are subject to differing interpretations. We evaluate and assess the relative risks and merits of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions, filing positions, filing methods and taxable income calculations after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent, and other information, and maintain tax accruals consistent with our evaluation of these relative risks and merits. The result of our evaluation and assessment is by its nature an estimate. We and our subsidiaries are routinely subject to audit and challenges from taxing authorities. In the event we resolve a challenge for an amount different than amounts previously accrued, we will account for the difference in the period in which we resolve the matter. Our tax treatment of certain leasing transactions is currently being challenged by the IRS, as described in greater detail in Cross Border Leases and Related Tax and Accounting Matters in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of Item 7 of this Report. Legal Contingencies We are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory proceedings and claims, including those described in Note 5 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report and others arising in the normal course of our business. We review these matters with internal and external legal counsel and establish reserves when we determine that it is probable that a 42 Table of Contents liability has been incurred and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly review and adjust the reserves as appropriate to reflect changes in the status of the proceedings and claims. The reserves that we establish for these types of contingencies are based upon our opinion regarding the future outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings and claims at the time. The final resolution of legal and regulatory proceedings and claims is frequently different, possibly significantly, from the resolution we anticipated. Also, we may not be able to reasonably estimate a potential loss from a proceeding even if some liability is probable and an actual loss is later incurred. As a result, our ultimate financial exposure to legal and regulatory proceedings and claims may be substantially different from what is reflected in the related reserves. 2002 BLACKROCK LONG TERM RETENTION AND INCENTIVE PLAN See Note 18 Stock Based Compensation Plans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for a description of BlackRocks LTIP. Under the BlackRock LTIP, awards vest at the end of any three month period beginning on or after January 1, 2005 and ending on or prior to March 30, 2007 during which the average closing price of BlackRocks common stock is at least $62 per share. During the first quarter of 2005, BlackRocks average closing stock price exceeded the $62 threshold and the stock price provision was met. In addition to the stock price threshold, the vesting of awards is contingent on the participants continued employment with BlackRock for periods ranging from two to five years through the payment date in early 2007. We reported pretax charges in 2004 totaling $110 million in connection with the LTIP, including $96 million in the third quarter, based upon managements determination during the third quarter of 2004 that the likelihood of vesting of the LTIP awards was probable of reaching the stock price threshold. These amounts included a pro rata share of the estimated dilution of our investment in BlackRock that is expected to occur in 2007 when we transfer shares of BlackRock stock owned by PNC to fund a portion of the LTIP awards. We reported pretax expense of $64 million in 2005, including $16 million during the fourth quarter, related to the LTIP awards. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on the following recent accounting pronouncements that are relevant to our business, including a description of each new pronouncement, the required date of adoption, our planned date of adoption and the expected impact on our consolidated financial statements. All of the following pronouncements were issued by the FASB unless otherwise noted. Issued in February 2006: SFAS 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140. Issued in November 2005: FASB Staff Position No. (FSP) 115 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. In June 2005, the FASBs Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued EITF Issue 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights. Issued in May 2005: SFAS 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. Issued in December 2004: SFAS 123 (Revised), Share Based Payment, FSP 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and SFAS 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions. Issued in May 2004: FSP 106 2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. In December 2003, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position 03 3, Accounting for Loans and Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer. 43 Table of Contents STATUS OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN We have a noncontributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan (plan or pension plan) covering eligible employees. Retirement benefits are derived from a cash balance formula based on compensation levels, age and length of service. Pension contributions are based on an actuarially determined amount necessary to fund total benefits payable to plan participants. Plan assets are currently approximately 60% invested in equity investments with most of the remainder invested in fixed income instruments. Plan fiduciaries determine and review the plans investment policy. We calculate the expense associated with the pension plan in accordance with SFAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and we use assumptions and methods that are compatible with the requirements of SFAS 87, including a policy of reflecting trust assets at their fair market value. On an annual basis, we review the actuarial assumptions related to the pension plan, including the discount rate, rate of compensation increase and the expected return on plan assets. Neither the discount rate nor the compensation increase assumptions significantly affect pension expense. The expected long term return on assets assumption does significantly affect pension expense. We intend to decrease the expected long term return on plan assets assumption from the 8.5% used for 2005 to 8.25% for determining net periodic cost for 2006. Also, under current accounting rules, the difference between expected long term returns and actual returns are accumulated and amortized to pension expense over future periods. Each one percentage point difference in actual return compared with our expected return causes expense in the following year to change by up to $3 million. The table below reflects the estimated effects on pension expense of certain changes in assumptions, using 2006 estimated expense as a baseline. Change in Assumption EstimatedIncrease to 2006Pension Expense (In millions) .5% decrease in discount rate $ 2 .5% decrease in expected long term return on assets 8 .5% increase in compensation rate 1 We currently estimate a pretax pension benefit of $1 million in 2006 compared with a pretax benefit of $8 million in 2005. In accordance with SFAS 87 and SFAS 132 (Revised 2003), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, we may have to eliminate any prepaid pension asset and recognize a minimum pension liability if the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets at year end. We would recognize the corresponding charge as a component of other comprehensive income and it would reduce total shareholders equity, but it would not affect net income. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of plan assets was $1.627 billion, which exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation of $1.232 billion. The status at year end 2006 will depend primarily upon 2006 investment returns and the level of contributions, if any, we make to the plan during 2006. Plan asset investment performance has the most impact on contribution requirements. However, contribution requirements are not particularly sensitive to actuarial assumptions. Investment performance will drive the amount of permitted contributions in future years. Also, current law sets limits as to both minimum and maximum contributions to the plan. In any event, any large near term contributions to the plan will be at our discretion, as we expect that the minimum required contributions under the law will be minimal or zero for several years. During the second quarter of 2005, we acquired a frozen defined benefit pension plan as a result of the Riggs acquisition. Plan assets and projected benefit obligations of the Riggs plan were approximately $107 million and $116 million, respectively, at acquisition date. The $9 million funding deficit was recognized as part of the Riggs acquisition purchase price allocation. For determining contribution amounts to the plan, deficits are calculated using ERISA mandated rules, and on this basis we contributed approximately $16 million to the Riggs plan during the third quarter of 2005. We integrated the Riggs plan into the PNC plan on December 30, 2005. We maintain other defined benefit plans that have a less significant effect on financial results, including various nonqualified supplemental retirement plans for certain employees. See Note 17 Employee Benefit Plans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. RISK MANAGEMENT We encounter risk as part of the normal course of our business and we design risk management processes to help manage these risks. This Risk Management section first provides an overview of the risk measurement, control strategies, and monitoring aspects of our corporate level risk management processes. Following that discussion is an analysis of the risk management process for what we view as our primary areas of risk: credit, operational, liquidity, and market. The discussion of market risk is further subdivided into interest rate, trading, and equity and other investment risk areas. Our use of financial derivatives as part of our overall asset and liability risk management process is also addressed within the Risk Management section of this Item 7. In appropriate places within this section, historical performance is also addressed. OVERVIEW As a financial services organization, we take a certain amount of risk in every business decision. For example, every time we open an account or approve a loan for a customer, process a payment, hire a new employee, or implement a new computer system, we incur a certain amount of risk. As an organization, we must balance revenue generation and profitability with the risks associated with our business activities. Risk management is not about eliminating risks, but about identifying and accepting risks and then effectively managing them so to optimize shareholder value. 44 Table of Contents The key to effective risk management is to be proactive in identifying, measuring, evaluating, and monitoring risk on an ongoing basis. Risk management practices support decision making, improve the success rate for new initiatives, and strengthen the organization. CORPORATE LEVEL RISK MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW We support risk management through a governance structure involving the Board, senior management and a corporate risk management organization. Although our Board as a whole is responsible generally for oversight of risk management, committees of the Board provide oversight to specific areas of risk with respect to the level of risk and risk management structure. We use management level risk committees to help ensure that business decisions are executed within our desired risk profile. The Executive Risk Management Committee (ERMC), consisting of senior management executives, provides oversight for the establishment and implementation of new comprehensive risk management initiatives, reviews enterprise level risk profiles and discusses key risk issues. The corporate risk management organization has the following key roles: Facilitate the identification, assessment and monitoring of risk across PNC, Provide support and oversight to the businesses, and Identify and implement risk management best practices, as appropriate. Risk Measurement We conduct risk measurement activities specific to each area of risk. The primary vehicle for aggregation of enterprise wide risk is a comprehensive risk management methodology that is based on economic capital. This primary risk aggregation measure is supplemented with secondary measures of risk to arrive at an estimate of enterprise wide risk. The economic capital framework is a measure of potential losses above and beyond expected losses. Potential one year losses are capitalized to a level commensurate with a financial institution with an A rating by the credit rating agencies. Economic capital incorporates risk associated with potential credit losses (Credit Risk), fluctuations of the estimated market value of financial instruments (Market Risk), failure of people, processes or systems (Operational Risk), and income losses associated with declining volumes, margins and or fees, and the fixed cost structure of the business (Business Risk). We estimate credit and market risks at an exposure level while we estimate the remaining risk types at an institution or business segment level. We routinely compare the output of our economic capital model with industry benchmarks. Risk Control Strategies We centrally manage policy development and exception oversight through corporate level risk management. Corporate risk management is authorized to take action to either prevent or mitigate exceptions to policies and is responsible for monitoring compliance with risk management policies. The Corporate Audit function performs an independent assessment of the internal control environment. Corporate Audit plays a critical role in risk management, testing the operation of the internal control system and reporting findings to management and to the Audit Committee of the Board. Risk Monitoring Corporate risk management reports on a regular basis to our Board regarding the enterprise risk profile of the Corporation. These reports aggregate and present the level of risk by type of risk and communicate significant risk issues, including performance relative to risk tolerance limits. Both the Board and the ERMC provide guidance on actions to address key risk issues as identified in these reports. CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT Credit risk represents the possibility that a customer, counterparty or issuer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms. Credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from extending credit to customers, purchasing securities, and entering into financial derivative transactions. Credit risk is one of the most common risks in banking and is one of our most significant risks. Approved risk tolerances, in addition to credit policies and procedures, set portfolio objectives for the level of credit risk. We have established guidelines for acceptable levels of total borrower exposure, problem loans, and other credit measures. We seek to achieve our credit portfolio objectives by maintaining a customer base that is diverse in borrower exposure and industry types. We use loan participations with third parties, loan sales and syndications, and the purchase of credit derivatives to reduce risk concentrations. The credit granting businesses maintain direct responsibility for monitoring credit risk within PNC. The Corporate Credit Policy area provides independent oversight to the measurement, monitoring and reporting of our credit risk and reports to the Chief Risk Officer. Corporate Audit also provides an independent assessment of the effectiveness of the credit risk management process and adequacy of credit risk profile. 45 Table of Contents Nonperforming, Past Due And Potential Problem Assets See the Nonperforming Assets And Related Information table in the Statistical Information section of Item 8 of this Report and included here by reference for details of the types of nonperforming assets that we held at December 31, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002 and 2001. In addition, certain performing assets have interest payments that are past due or have the potential for future repayment problems. Total nonperforming assets at December 31, 2005 increased $41 million, to $216 million, compared with the prior year end primarily due to an increase in nonaccrual asset based loans. Foreclosed lease assets at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 primarily represent our repossession of collateral related to a single airline industry credit. This repossessed collateral is currently leased to a third party. The amount of nonperforming loans that was current as to principal and interest was $115 million at December 31, 2005 and $44 million at December 31, 2004. We anticipate an increase in nonperforming loans going forward as we do not expect to sustain asset quality at its current level. However, based on the assets we currently hold and current business trends and activities, we believe that overall asset quality will remain strong at least for the near term. Nonperforming Assets By Business In millions December 312005 December 312004 Retail Banking $ 90 $ 100 Corporate & Institutional Banking 124 71 Other 2 4 Total nonperforming assets $ 216 $ 175 Change In Nonperforming Assets In millions 2005 2004 January 1 $ 175 $ 328 Purchases 12 Transferred from accrual 340 213 Returned to performing (10 ) (17 ) Principal reductions and payoffs (183 ) (211 ) Asset sales (16 ) (60 ) Charge offs and valuation adjustments (90 ) (90 ) December 31 $ 216 $ 175 Accruing Loans And Loans Held For Sale Past Due 90 Days Or More Amount Percent of TotalOutstandings Dollars in millions Dec. 31 2005 Dec. 31 2004 Dec. 312005 Dec. 31 2004 Commercial $ 12 $ 15 .06 % .09 % Commercial real estate 2 2 .06 .10 Consumer 22 18 .14 .12 Residential mortgage 10 14 .14 .29 Total loans 46 49 .09 .11 Loans held for sale 47 9 1.92 .54 Total loans and loans held for sale $ 93 $ 58 .18 % .13 % Loans and loans held for sale that are not included in nonperforming or past due categories but cause us to be uncertain about the borrowers ability to comply with existing repayment terms over the next six months totaled $67 million and zero, respectively, at December 31, 2005, compared with $65 million and zero, respectively, at December 31, 2004. Approximately 89% of these loans are in the Corporate & Institutional Banking portfolio. Allowances For Loan And Lease Losses And Unfunded Loan Commitments And Letters Of Credit We maintain the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level we believe to be adequate to absorb estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. We determine the allowance based on quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio. While we make allocations to specific loans and pools of loans, the total reserve is available for all loan and lease losses. In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we maintain an allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. We report this allowance as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We determine this amount using estimates of the probability of the ultimate funding and losses related to those credit exposures. This methodology is similar to the methodology we use for determining the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses. We refer you to Note 8 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report regarding changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses and the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit, and to the Allocation Of Allowance For Loan And Lease Losses table in the Statistical Information section of Item 8 of this Report for additional information included herein by reference. We establish specific allowances for loans considered impaired using a method prescribed by SFAS 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan. All nonperforming loans are considered impaired under SFAS 114. Specific allowances for individual loans over a set dollar threshold are determined by our Special Asset Committee based on an analysis of the present value of expected future cash flows from the loans discounted at their effective interest rate, observable market price, or the fair value of the underlying collateral. We establish specific allowance on all other impaired loans based on the loss given default credit risk rating. Allocations to non impaired commercial and commercial real estate loans (pool reserve allocations) are assigned to pools of loans as defined by our business structure and are based on internal probability of default and loss given default credit risk ratings. Key elements of the pool reserve methodology include: Probability of default (PD), which is based on historical default analyses and is derived from the borrowers internal PD credit risk rating and expected loan term; Exposure at default (EAD), which is derived from historical default data; and Loss given default (LGD), which is based on historical loss data, collateral value and other structural factors that may affect our ultimate ability to collect on the loan and is derived from the loans internal LGD credit risk rating. 46 Table of Contents Our pool reserve methodology is sensitive to changes in key risk parameters such as PDs, LGDs and EADs. In general, a given change in any of the major risk parameters will have a corresponding change in the pool reserve allocations for non impaired commercial loans. Our commercial loans are the largest category of credits and are most sensitive to changes in the key risk parameters and pool reserve loss rates. To illustrate, if we increase the pool reserve loss rates by 5% for all categories of non impaired commercial loans, then the aggregate of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit would increase by $29 million. Additionally, other factors such as the rate of migration in the severity of problem loans or changes in the maturity distribution of the loans will contribute to the final pool reserve allocations. We make consumer (including residential mortgage) loan allocations at a total portfolio level by consumer product line based on historical loss experience. We compute a four quarter average loss rate from net charge offs for the prior four quarters as a percentage of the average loans outstanding in those quarters. We apply this loss rate to loans outstanding at the end of the current period to determine the consumer loan allocation. We establish reserves to provide coverage for probable losses not considered in the specific, pool and consumer reserve methodologies, such as, but not limited to, industry concentrations and conditions, credit quality trends, recent loss experience in particular sectors of the portfolio, experience, ability and depth of lending management, changes in risk selection and underwriting standards and the timing of available information. The amount of reserves for these qualitative factors is assigned to loan categories and to business segments based on the relative specific and pool allocation amounts. Enhancements to the reserve methodology in the third quarter of 2005 resulted in more precise modeling of pool allocations and reduced the amount of reserve allocated for qualitative factors. This portion represented 9.9% of the total allowance and .12% of total loans at December 31, 2005.

(b) During the first quarter of 2004, we changed our policy for recognizing charge offs on smaller nonperforming commercial loans. This change resulted in the recognition of an additional $24 million of gross charge offs for the first quarter of 2004. Apart from the impact of the items described in footnotes (a) and (b) above, commercial net charge offs declined $35 million in 2005 compared with the prior year primarily due to an improvement in the overall credit quality of the commercial loan portfolio. The increase in equipment lease financing net charge offs in 2005 compared with the prior year reflected an additional charge off in the fourth quarter of 2005 related to a single leasing customer. Aside from the impact of the $53 million loan recovery in 2005, increases in the provision for credit losses compared with 2004 and the allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit as of December 31, 2005 reflected growth in loans and loan commitments and additional provisions related to a leasing customer. The provision includes amounts for probable losses on loans and credit exposure related to unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. We do not expect to sustain asset quality at its current level. However, based on the assets we currently hold and current business trends and activities, we believe that overall asset quality will remain strong at least for the near term. This outlook, combined with expected loan growth, may result in an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses in future periods. CREDIT RELATED INSTRUMENTS Credit Default Swaps Credit default swaps provide, for a fee, an assumption by a third party of a portion of the credit risk related to the underlying financial instruments. We use the contracts to mitigate credit risk associated with commercial lending activities as well as proprietary derivative and convertible bond trading. Credit default swaps are included in the Free Standing Derivatives table in the Financial Derivatives section of this Risk Management discussion. We realized minimal net gains in connection with credit default swaps during 2005 and a net loss of $4.4 million in 2004. Interest Rate Derivative Risk Participation Agreements We enter into risk participation agreements to share credit exposure with other financial counterparties related to interest rate derivative contracts or take on credit exposure to generate revenue. Risk participation agreements are included in the Free Standing Derivatives table in the Financial Derivatives section of this Risk Management discussion. Agreements entered into prior to July 1, 2003 are considered to be financial guarantees and, therefore, are not included in the Financial Derivatives section of this Risk Management discussion. Risk participation agreements entered into prior to July 1, 2003 used by us to mitigate credit risk had a notional amount of $3 million at December 31, 2005 compared with $36 million at December 31, 2004. Risk participation agreements entered into in which we assumed credit risk exposure had a total notional amount of $18 million at December 31, 2005 compared with $24 million at December 31, 2004. 47 Table of Contents OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT Operational risk is defined as the risk of financial loss or other damage to us resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human factors, or from external events. Operational risk may occur in any of our business activities and manifests itself in various ways, including but not limited to the following: Errors related to transaction processing and systems, Breaches of the system of internal controls and compliance requirements, and Business interruptions and execution of unauthorized transactions and fraud by employees or third parties. Operational losses may arise from legal actions due to operating deficiencies or noncompliance with contracts, laws or regulations. To monitor and control operational risk, we maintain a comprehensive framework including policies and a system of internal controls that is designed to manage risk and to provide management with timely and accurate information about the operations of PNC. Management at each business unit is primarily responsible for its operational risk management program, given that operational risk management is integral to direct business management and most easily effected at the business unit level. Corporate Operational Risk Management, reporting to the Chief Risk Officer, oversees day to day operation risk management activities. Technology Risk The technology risk management program is a significant component of the operational risk framework. We have an integrated security and technology risk management framework designed to help ensure a secure, sound, and compliant infrastructure for information management. The technology risk management process is aligned with the strategic direction of the businesses and is integrated into the technology management culture, structure and practices. The application of this framework across the enterprise helps to support comprehensive and reliable internal controls. Our business resiliency program manages the organizations capabilities to provide services in the case of an event that results in material disruption of business activities. Prioritization of investments in people, processes, technology and facilities are based on different types of events, business risk and criticality. Comprehensive testing validates our resiliency capabilities on an ongoing basis, and an integrated governance model is designed to help assure transparent management reporting. Insurance As a component of our risk management practices, we purchase insurance programs designed to protect us against accidental loss or losses which, in the aggregate, may significantly affect personnel, property, financial objectives, or our ability to continue to meet our responsibilities to our various stakeholder groups. PNC, through subsidiary companies, Alpine Indemnity Limited and PNC Insurance Corp., participates as a reinsurer for its general liability, automobile liability and workers compensation programs and as a direct writer for its property and certified domestic terrorism programs. PNCs risks associated with its participation as a reinsurer or direct writer for these programs are mitigated through policy limits, annual aggregate limits, umbrella/excess liability coverage and reinsurance ceded beyond per occurrence deductible limits. LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT Liquidity risk is the risk of potential loss if we were unable to meet our funding requirements at a reasonable cost. We manage liquidity risk to help ensure that we can obtain cost effective funding to meet current and future obligations under both normal business as usual and stressful circumstances. Asset and Liability Management (ALM) is accountable for managing the liquidity position within the limits and guidelines set forth in our risk management policies. Market Risk Management provides independent oversight for the measurement, monitoring and reporting of PNCs liquidity risk. We typically maintain our liquidity position through: A large and stable deposit base derived from our retail and wholesale banking activities, A portfolio of liquid investment securities, Diversified sources of short term and long term wholesale funding, and Significant unused borrowing capacity at both the FHLB and the Federal Reserve discount window. Liquid assets consist of short term investments (federal funds sold, resale agreements and other short term investments) and securities available for sale. At December 31, 2005, our liquid assets totaled $23.6 billion, with $10.8 billion pledged as collateral for borrowings, trust, and other commitments. PNC Bank, N.A. is a member of the FHLB and as such has access to advances from the FHLB secured generally by residential mortgages, other real estate related loans, and mortgage backed securities. At December 31, 2005, our total unused borrowing capacity from the FHLB under current collateral requirements was $23.3 billion. We can also obtain funding through alternative forms of borrowing, including federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements, and short term and long term debt issuances. In July 2004, PNC Bank, N.A. established a program to offer up to $20 billion in senior and subordinated unsecured debt obligations with maturities of more than nine months. As of December 31, 2005, PNC Bank, N.A. had issued $2.4 billion of debt under this program, including the following 2005 issuances: $350 million of floating rate notes were issued in March 2005 and mature in April 2006 with interest payable monthly at the rate of 1 month LIBOR minus 3.5 basis points. Senior bank notes totaling $500 million were issued in July 2005 and $75 million were issued in 48 Table of Contents August 2005. These issuances mature in January 2007 and February 2007, respectively. Interest will be reset monthly to 1 month LIBOR minus 3 basis points and will be paid monthly on each issuance. $500 million of subordinated bank notes were issued in September 2005 and mature in September 2017. These notes pay interest semiannually at a fixed annual rate of 4.875%. None of the 2005 issuances outlined above are redeemable or subject to repayment at the option of the holder prior to maturity. In December 2004, PNC Bank, N.A. established a program to offer up to $3.0 billion of its commercial paper. As of December 31, 2005, $10 million of commercial paper was outstanding under this program. Our parent companys routine funding needs consist primarily of dividends to PNC shareholders, share repurchases, debt service, the funding of non bank affiliates, and acquisitions. Parent company liquidity guidelines are designed to help ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet these requirements over the succeeding 12 month period. In managing parent company liquidity we consider funding sources, such as expected dividends to be received from PNC Bank, N.A. and potential debt issuance, and discretionary funding uses, the most significant of which is the external dividend to be paid on PNCs stock. The principal source of parent company cash flow is the dividends it receives from PNC Bank, N.A., which may be impacted by the following: Capital needs, Laws and regulations, Corporate policies, Contractual restrictions, and Other factors. Also, there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of national banks to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to extend credit to the parent company or its non bank subsidiaries. We provide additional information on these limitations in Note 4 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report and include such information here by reference. Dividends may also be impacted by the banks capital needs and by contractual restrictions. The amount available for dividend payments to the parent company by PNC Bank, N.A. without prior regulatory approval was approximately $567 million at December 31, 2005. In addition to dividends from PNC Bank, N.A., other sources of parent company liquidity include cash and short term investments, as well as dividends and loan repayments from other subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2005, the parent company had approximately $1.4 billion in funds available from its cash and short term investments. We can also generate liquidity for the parent company and PNCs non bank subsidiaries through the issuance of securities in public or private markets. BlackRock, one of our majority owned non bank subsidiaries, also has access to public and private financing. In March 2005, PNC issued two series of senior debt under PNCs effective shelf registration statements. The first series consisted of $350 million of 4.2% Senior Notes due 2008 and the second series consisted of $350 million of 4.5% Senior Notes due 2010. The Senior Notes due 2008 were issued at a price of 99.953%, resulting in proceeds to PNC of approximately $350 million. The Senior Notes due 2010 were issued at a price of 99.774%, resulting in proceeds to PNC of approximately $349 million. PNC issued $400 million of senior notes in December 2005 that mature in December 2010. These notes pay interest semiannually at a fixed rate of 5.125%. None of the 2005 issuances outlined above are redeemable or subject to repayment at the option of the holder prior to maturity. At December 31, 2005, we had unused capacity under effective shelf registration statements of approximately $1.6 billion of debt or equity securities. During the fourth quarter of 2005, no parent company senior debt matured. As of December 31, 2005, there were $1.1 billion of parent company contractual obligations with maturities of less than one year. See Note 13 Borrowed Funds in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. 49 Table of Contents Commitments The following tables set forth contractual obligations and various commitments representing required and potential cash outflows as of December 31, 2005.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW Market risk is the risk of a loss in earnings or economic value due to adverse movements in market factors such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and equity prices. We are exposed to market risk primarily by our involvement in the following activities, among others: Traditional banking activities of taking deposits and extending loans, Private equity and other investments and activities whose economic values are directly impacted by market factors, and Trading in fixed income products, equities, derivatives, and foreign exchange, as a result of customer activities, underwriting, and proprietary trading. We have established enterprise wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor, and report market risk. Market Risk Management provides independent oversight by monitoring compliance with these limits and guidelines, and reporting significant risks in the business to the Risk Committee of the Board. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT INTEREST RATE RISK Interest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates, and consumer preferences, affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities. Because of repricing term mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these products, changes in market interest rates not only affect expected near term earnings, but the economic values of these assets and liabilities as well. ALM centrally manages interest rate risk subject to interest rate risk limits and certain policies approved by the Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) and the Risk Committee of the Board. Sensitivity results and market interest rate benchmarks for the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 follow: 50 Table of Contents Interest Sensitivity Analysis Dec. 312005 Dec. 312004 Net Interest Income Sensitivity Simulation Effect on net interest income in first year from gradual interest rate change over following 12 months of: 100 basis point increase (.5 )% .6 % 100 basis point decrease .2 % (1.2 )% Effect on net interest income in second year from gradual interest rate change over the preceding 12 months of: 100 basis point increase (1.2 )% 3.6 % 100 basis point decrease (1.1 )% (6.6 )% Duration of Equity Model Base case duration of equity (in years): .3 (1.5 ) Key Period End Interest Rates One month LIBOR 4.39 % 2.40 % Three year swap 4.84 % 3.66 % In addition to measuring the effect on net interest income assuming parallel changes in current interest rates, we routinely simulate the effects of a number of nonparallel interest rate environments. The following Net Interest Income Sensitivity To Alternative Rate Scenarios table reflects the percentage change in net interest income over the next two 12 month periods assuming either the PNC Economists most likely rate forecast or implied market forward rates which result in a flatter rate scenario. We are inherently sensitive to lower rates, combined with a flatter yield curve. Net Interest Income Sensitivity To Alternative Rate Scenarios (as of December 31, 2005) PNCEconomist MarketForward First year sensitivity .1 % (.1 )% Second year sensitivity 2.7 % When forecasting net interest income, we make assumptions about interest rates and the shape of the yield curve, the volume and characteristics of new business, and the behavior of existing positions. These assumptions determine the future level of simulated net interest income in the base interest rate scenario and the other interest rate scenarios presented in the following table. These simulations assume that as assets and liabilities mature, they are replaced or repriced at market rates. All changes in forecasted net interest income are relative to results in a base rate scenario where current market rates are assumed to remain unchanged over the forecast horizon. The graph below presents the yield curves for the base rate scenario and each of the alternative scenarios one year forward. Over the last several years, we have taken steps to position our balance sheet to benefit from rising long term interest rates. As a result of this program, we closed the year in an essentially rate neutral position. Going forward, we believe that we have the deposit funding base and flexibility to change our investment profile to take advantage, where appropriate, of changing interest rates and to adjust to changing market conditions. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT TRADING RISK Our trading activities include the underwriting of fixed income and equity securities, as well as customer driven and proprietary trading in fixed income securities, equities, derivatives, and foreign exchange contracts. For each trading group (e.g., fixed income, derivatives, foreign exchange), we have implemented a set of risk limits that govern that particular group. Our overall corporate trading risk policy governs the nature and allocation of these limits. We use a variety of statistical and non statistical measurements to assess the level of market risk arising from trading activities. We use value at risk (VaR) as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in trading activities. VaR offers a common measure to compare trading risk across portfolios with exposures to different types of market factors. As required under the Market Risk Amendment to the Basel Accord, we calculate risk weighted capital for trading activities, which is driven by average VaR usage. For internal risk management purposes, we also estimate the amount of economic capital required by trading activities at a 99.9% level of confidence over a three month horizon. This measure is driven by both average VaR usage and potential future usage based on portfolio VaR limits. The Risk Committee of the Board establishes an enterprise wide VaR limit on trading activities. VaR limits for individual business units are established by ALCO. 51 Table of Contents The following table shows VaR usage for 2005 by product type: VaR Usage by Product Type In millions Min. Max. Avg. Fixed Income $ 4.1 $ 9.4 $ 6.4 Equity .6 1.8 1.0 Foreign Exchange .5 .2 Total 5.1 10.6 $ 7.6 To help ensure the integrity of the models used to calculate VaR for each portfolio and enterprise wide, we use a process known as backtesting. The backtesting process consists of comparing actual observations of trading related gains or losses against the VaR levels that were calculated at the close of the prior day. We would expect a maximum of two to three instances a year in which actual losses exceeded the prior day VaR measure. During the full year of 2005, there were no such instances at the enterprise wide level. The following graph shows a comparison of enterprise wide trading related gains and losses against prior day VaR for the period. Total trading revenue for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was as follows: Year end December 31 in millions 2005 2004 2003 Net interest income (expense) $ 9 $ 13 $ (2 ) Noninterest income 157 113 127 Total trading revenue $ 166 $ 126 $ 125 Securities underwriting and trading $ 19 $ 60 $ 82 Foreign exchange 39 31 25 Financial derivatives 108 35 18 Total trading revenue $ 166 $ 126 $ 125 Average trading assets and liabilities consisted of the following: Year ended in millions December 31 2005 December 312004 December 312003 Assets Securities (a) $ 1,850 $ 871 $ 152 Resale agreements (b) 663 166 70 Financial derivatives (c) 772 605 914 Total assets $ 3,285 $ 1,642 $ 1,136 Liabilities Securities sold short (d) $ 993 $ 275 $ 120 Repurchase agreements and other borrowings (e) 1,044 249 249 Financial derivatives (f) 825 594 545 Total liabilities $ 2,862 $ 1,118 $ 914 (a) Included in Interest earning assets Other on the Average Consolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest Analysis.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENT RISK Equity investment risk is the risk of potential losses associated with investing in both private and public equity markets. In addition to extending credit, taking deposits, and underwriting and trading financial instruments, we make and manage direct investments in a variety of transactions, including management buyouts, recapitalizations, and later stage growth financings in a variety of industries. We have investments in affiliated and non affiliated funds that make similar private equity investments. In addition, we have investments in non affiliated funds that invest in early stage and technology companies. New commitments to all non affiliated private equity funds will continue to be minimal. The economic and or book value of these investments and other assets such as loan servicing rights are directly affected by changes in market factors. The primary risk measurement for equity and other investments is economic capital. Economic capital is a common measure of risk for credit, market and operational risk. It is the worst case value depreciation over one year within a 99.9% confidence level. Given the illiquid nature of many of these types of investments, it can be a challenge to determine their fair values. Market Risk Management provides independent oversight of the valuation process. Various PNC business units manage our private equity and other investment activities. Our businesses are responsible for making investment decisions within the approved policy limits and associated guidelines. Private Equity The private equity portfolio is comprised of investments that vary by industry, stage and type of investment. 52 Table of Contents Private equity investments are reported at fair value. Changes in the values of private equity investments are reflected in our results of operations. Due to the nature of the direct investments, we must make assumptions as to future performance, financial condition, liquidity, availability of capital, and market conditions, among other factors, to determine the estimated fair value of the investments. Market conditions and actual performance of the investments could differ from these assumptions. Accordingly, lower valuations may occur that could adversely impact earnings in future periods. Also, the valuations may not represent amounts that will ultimately be realized from these investments. See Private Equity Asset Valuation in the Critical Accounting Policies And Judgments section of Item 7 of this Report for additional information. At December 31, 2005, private equity investments carried at estimated fair value totaled $449 million compared with $470 million at December 31, 2004. As of December 31, 2005, approximately 38% of the amount is invested directly in a variety of companies and approximately 62% is invested in various limited partnerships. Private equity unfunded commitments totaled $78 million at December 31, 2005 compared with $119 million at December 31, 2004. Additionally, in October 2005, we committed $200 million to PNC Mezzanine Partners III, L.P., a $350 million mezzanine fund, that will invest principally in subordinated debt securities with an equity component. Funding of this investment is expected to occur over a five year period. The limited partnership will be consolidated for financial reporting purposes as PNC will have a 57% ownership interest. Other Investments We also make investments in affiliated and non affiliated funds with both traditional and alternative investment strategies. As of December 31, 2005, major investments of this type included low income housing tax credits and capitalized servicing rights for commercial mortgage loans. Other investments include BlackRocks mutual funds, hedge funds, and CDOs for which the economic values could be driven by either the fixed income market or the equity markets, or both. IMPACT OF INFLATION Our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. Accordingly, future changes in prices do not affect the obligations to pay or receive fixed and determinable amounts of money. During periods of inflation, monetary assets lose value in terms of purchasing power and monetary liabilities have corresponding purchasing power gains. The concept of purchasing power, however, is not an adequate indicator of the effect of inflation on banks because it does not take into account changes in interest rates, which are an important determinant of our earnings. FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES We use a variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage interest rate, market and credit risk inherent in our business activities. Substantially all such instruments are used to manage risk related to changes in interest rates. Interest rate and total return swaps, interest rate caps and floors and futures contracts are the primary instruments used by us for interest rate risk management. Financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, interest rate, market and credit risk. For interest rate swaps and total return swaps, options and futures contracts, only periodic cash payments and, with respect to options, premiums, are exchanged. Therefore, cash requirements and exposure to credit risk are significantly less than the notional amount on these instruments. Not all elements of interest rate, market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial or other derivatives, and such instruments may be ineffective for their intended purposes due to unanticipated market characteristics, among other reasons. Accounting Hedges Fair Value Hedging Strategies We enter into interest rate and total return swaps, interest rate caps, floors and futures derivative contracts to hedge designated commercial mortgage loans held for sale, commercial loans, bank notes, senior debt and subordinated debt for changes in fair value primarily due to changes in interest rates. Adjustments related to the ineffective portion of fair value hedging instruments are recorded in interest income, interest expense or noninterest income depending on the hedged item. Accounting Hedges Cash Flow Hedging Strategy We enter into interest rate swap contracts to modify the interest rate characteristics of designated commercial loans from variable to fixed in order to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on future interest income. The fair value of these derivatives is reported in other assets or other liabilities and offset in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the effective portion of the derivatives. When the hedged transaction culminates, any unrealized gains or losses related to these swap contracts are removed from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are included in interest income. Any ineffectiveness of the strategy, as defined by our documented policies and procedures, is reported in interest income. Free Standing Derivatives To accommodate customer needs, we also enter into financial derivative transactions primarily consisting of interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, futures, swaptions, and foreign exchange and equity contracts. We manage our market risk exposure from customer positions through transactions with third party dealers. The credit risk associated with derivatives executed with customers is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans and is subject to normal credit policies. We may obtain collateral based on our assessment of the customer. For derivatives not designated as an accounting hedge, the gain or loss is recognized in trading noninterest income. 53 Table of Contents Also included in free standing derivatives are transactions that we enter into for risk management and proprietary purposes that are not designated as accounting hedges, primarily interest rate and basis swaps, interest rate caps and floors, credit default swaps, option contracts and certain interest rate locked loan origination commitments as well as commitments to buy or sell mortgage loans. Basis swaps are agreements involving the exchange of payments, based on notional amounts, of two floating rate financial instruments denominated in the same currency, one pegged to one reference rate and the other tied to a second reference rate (e.g., swapping payments tied to one month LIBOR for payments tied to three month LIBOR). We use these contracts to mitigate the impact on earnings of exposure to a certain referenced interest rate. Interest rate lock commitments for, as well as commitments to buy or sell, mortgage loans that we intend to sell are considered free standing derivatives. Our interest rate exposure on certain commercial mortgage interest rate lock commitments is economically hedged with pay fixed interest rate swaps and forward sales agreements. These contracts mitigate the impact on earnings of exposure to a certain referenced rate. We purchase and sell credit default swaps to mitigate the economic impact of credit losses on specifically identified existing lending relationships or to generate revenue from proprietary trading activities. These derivatives typically are based upon the change in value, due to changing credit spreads, of publicly issued bonds. We enter into risk participation agreements to share some of the credit exposure with other financial counterparties related to interest rate derivative contracts or to take on credit exposure to generate revenue. We will make/receive payments under these guarantees if a customer defaults on its obligation to perform under certain credit agreements. Agreements entered into prior to July 1, 2003 are considered financial guarantees. Agreements entered into after June 30, 2003 are considered free standing derivatives. We occasionally purchase or originate financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative. At the inception of the financial instrument, we assess whether the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the financial instrument (host contract), whether the financial instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative and the host contract is measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings, and whether a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument would not meet the definition of a derivative. If the embedded derivative does not meet these three conditions, the embedded derivative would qualify as a derivative instrument and be recorded apart from the host contract and carried at fair value with changes recorded in current earnings. Free standing derivatives also include positions we take based on market expectations or to benefit from price differentials between financial instruments and the market based upon stated risk management objectives. 54 Table of Contents The following tables provide the notional amount and fair value of financial derivatives used for risk management and designated as accounting hedges as well as free standing derivatives at December 31, 2005 and 2004. Weighted average interest rates presented are based on contractual terms, if fixed, or the implied forward yield curve at each respective date, if floating. The credit risk amounts of these derivatives as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 are presented in Note 16 Financial Derivatives in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

Results for 2004 reflected the impact of charges totaling $49 million after taxes, or $.17 per diluted share, related to the BlackRock LTIP as described under 2002 BlackRock Long Term Retention and Incentive Plan in Item 7 of this Report. Results for 2003 included expenses totaling $87 million after taxes, or $.31 per diluted share, in connection with the agreement with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), including related legal and consulting costs. Net income for 2003 also included the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle that negatively impacted earnings by $28 million, or $.10 per diluted share. Net Interest Income Net interest income was $1.969 billion for 2004 compared with $1.996 billion for 2003. Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis was $1.989 billion in 2004, a decline of $17 million, or 1%, compared with 2003. The net interest margin was 3.22% for 2004, a decline of 42 basis points compared with 2003. The continued low interest rate environment, a decline in loan yields that significantly exceeded the decrease in average rates paid on deposits, and sales and maturities of securities that were replaced at lower yields all contributed to a lower net interest margin compared with 2003. The impact of the United National acquisition in the first quarter of 2004 partially offset these factors. Provision For Credit Losses The provision for credit losses was $52 million for 2004 compared with $177 million for 2003. The significant decline in the provision for credit losses compared with 2003 was primarily due to the overall improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio during 2004. This improved credit quality reflected a 46% decline in nonperforming loans since December 31, 2003 and a reduction in problems related to performing credits. The favorable impact of these factors on the provision was partially offset by the impact of overall loan growth in 2004. Noninterest Income Noninterest income was $3.563 billion for 2004 compared with $3.257 billion for 2003, an increase of $306 million, or 9%. Higher noninterest income in 2004 reflected the following: An increase of $188 million, or 12%, in asset management and fund servicing fees combined, Equity management (private equity activities) net gains of $67 million in 2004 compared with net losses of $25 million in the prior year, Pretax gains totaling $47 million from two sale transactions that occurred during the first half of 2004 as described in the analysis of other noninterest income below, and The impact of the addition of United Nationals business, which contributed approximately $21 million of noninterest income during 2004. Lower net securities gains, lower trading revenue and lower gains from loan sales partially offset the impact of these positive factors in the comparison with 2003. Additional Analysis Combined asset management and fund servicing fees totaled $1.811 billion for 2004, an increase of $188 million compared with 2003. This increase reflected growth in assets managed and serviced, partially due to improved equity market conditions that began in 2003 and continued into 2004. Consolidated assets under management were $383 billion at December 31, 2004, an increase of $29 billion from December 31, 2003, primarily due to growth in assets managed by BlackRock. PFPC provided fund accounting/administration services for $721 billion of net fund assets at December 31, 2004 compared with $654 billion at December 31, 2003. PFPC also provided custody services for $451 billion of fund assets at December 31, 2004, an increase of $50 billion from the prior year end. Net new business, comparatively improved equity market conditions and asset inflows from existing clients all contributed to the increases in the PFPC statistics. Service charges on deposits totaled $252 million for 2004, an increase of $13 million or 5% compared with 2003. Additional checking relationships, which increased 8% as of December 31, 2004, drove the improvement in this area. Brokerage fees totaled $219 million for 2004 and $184 million for 2003. The 19% increase compared with 2003 reflected higher non trading, fee based brokerage revenue. Consumer services fees grew 5% in 2004, to $264 million, compared with the prior year. Higher fees for 2004 were partially due to additional fees from debit card transactions that reflected higher volumes, including the impact of United National customers, partially offset by the impact of the sale of certain out of footprint ATMs. Visa settled litigation in 2003 with major retailers regarding pricing and usage of customer debit cards. The settlement effectively lowered prices paid by merchants to Visa and its member banks beginning August 1, 2003. Although PNC was not a defendant in the litigation, the settlement lowered future revenue from certain types of debit card transactions. The lost revenue impact to PNC in 2004 was approximately $10 million and for 2003 was approximately $6 million. Corporate services revenue was $493 million for 2004, a decline of $13 million or 3% compared with 2003. Net gains in excess of valuation adjustments related to our liquidation of institutional loans held for sale are reflected in this line item and totaled $52 million for 2004 compared with $69 million for 2003. Higher fees related to an increase in commercial mortgage servicing activities and higher letters of credit fees 57 Table of Contents partially offset the decline in net gains on institutional loans held for sale compared with the prior year. Equity management net gains on portfolio investments totaled $67 million for 2004 compared with net losses of $25 million for 2003. Net securities gains were $55 million in 2004 compared with $116 million in 2003. Net securities gains for 2003 included $25 million related to the liquidation that year of the three entities formed in 2001 in the PAGIC transactions. Noninterest revenue from trading activities totaled $113 million for 2004 and $127 million for 2003. We provide additional information on our trading activities under Market Risk Management Trading Risk in the Risk Management section of this Item 7. Other noninterest income totaled $289 million for 2004, an increase of $53 million or 22% compared with 2003. Other noninterest income typically fluctuates from year to year depending on the nature and magnitude of transactions completed. Other noninterest income for 2004 included the following: A $34 million pretax gain related to the sale of our modified coinsurance contracts as described under DIG B36 Impact on 2003 Results and 2004 Sale of Modified Coinsurance Contracts below, and A $13 million pretax gain recognized during the second quarter of 2004 in connection with BlackRocks sale of its interest in Trepp LLC. In addition to these items, the increase in other noninterest income for 2004 compared with the prior year included the recognition of $25 million of private equity dividends in 2004 and the comparative impact of $12 million related to the mid 2003 adoption of FIN 46. Partially offsetting the impact of these items on other noninterest income was a $7 million decline in leasing revenue resulting from the 2004 sale of our vehicle leasing. DIG B36 IMPACT ON 2003 RESULTS AND 2004 SALE OF MODIFIED COINSURANCE CONTRACTS As required by the FASB, effective October 1, 2003 we adopted the provisions of Derivatives Implementation Group Statement 133 Implementation Issue No. B36, Embedded Derivatives: Modified Coinsurance Arrangements and Debt Instruments That Incorporate Credit Risk Exposures That Are Unrelated or Only Partially Related to the Creditworthiness of the Obligor under Those Instruments (DIG B36), for our annuity coinsurance agreements. Our initial adoption of the provisions of DIG B36 to existing coinsurance agreements as of October 1, 2003 was reported in our Consolidated Income Statement as the cumulative effect of an accounting change and reduced both fourth quarter and full year 2003 net income by $28 million, or $.10 per diluted share. Subsequent to initial adoption, other noninterest income increased by $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 as a result of DIG B36. During the first quarter of 2004, we recognized a $34 million pretax gain on the sale of our modified coinsurance contracts. We continue to sell various annuity products from which we earn commission income as further described under Product Revenue in Item 7 of this Report. Noninterest Expense Total noninterest expense was $3.735 billion for 2004, an increase of $259 million or 7% compared with $3.476 billion in 2003. The efficiency ratio was 68% for 2004 and 66% for 2003. Noninterest expense for 2004 included the following: Pretax charges totaling $110 million, including $96 million recorded in the third quarter, associated with the BlackRock LTIP; Costs totaling approximately $78 million resulting from the United National acquisition, including approximately $11 million of conversion related and other nonrecurring costs; and A $22 million reduction in the benefit of accretion related to a discounted PFPC client contract liability that ended during the second quarter of 2004. In addition to these items, the increase in noninterest expense for 2004 compared with 2003 included the impact of the following items, which had no effect on 2004 consolidated net income: An increase of $30 million related to the mid 2003 adoption of FIN 46, and An increase of $22 million in PFPC out of pocket and pass through expenses which are offset in noninterest income. Noninterest expense for 2003 included the impact of the following items: Expenses totaling $120 million recognized in connection with a subsidiarys second quarter 2003 agreement with the DOJ, including $5 million of related legal and consulting costs; Costs totaling $29 million paid in connection with our 2003 liquidation of the three entities formed in 2001 in the PAGIC transactions. The impact of these costs was mostly offset by related net securities gains included in noninterest income; Distributions on capital securities totaling $28 million; Facilities charges totaling $25 million related to leased space consistent with the requirements of SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities; and A $25 million benefit from the vehicle leasing settlement during the fourth quarter of 2003. Apart from the items described above, noninterest expense for 2004 increased $174 million compared with 2003. Higher expenses in 2004 were primarily attributable to higher sales based compensation, stock based incentive compensation and marketing costs. These charges more than offset the benefit of lower pension expense in the comparison and an $87 million incremental benefit in 2004 from efficiency initiatives. 58 Table of Contents Effective Tax Rate Our effective tax rate for 2004 was 30.8% compared with 33.7% for 2003. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2004 was primarily attributable to the following: A reduced state and local tax expense due to tax benefits of $18 million recorded in connection with New York state and city audits, principally associated with BlackRock, and A $14 million reduction in income tax expense following our determination in the third quarter of 2004 that we no longer required an income tax reserve related to bank owned life insurance. CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET REVIEW Loans Loans increased $7.2 billion, or 20%, as of December 31, 2004 compared with December 31, 2003. The increase in total loans reflected the following: Home equity loans increased $2.9 billion, reflecting organic growth and the purchase of approximately $660 million of home equity loans in early 2004, Demand for commercial loans grew during the year, reflected in the $2.4 billion increase in this loan category, and Automobile and other consumer loans combined increased $.8 billion. The favorable impact of these factors on our loan balances was partially offset by the effect of the sale of the vehicle leasing portfolio in 2004. We added $1.9 billion of loans with the United National acquisition in 2004, as reflected in various loan categories. Securities Total securities at December 31, 2004 were $16.8 billion compared with $15.7 billion at December 31, 2003. Securities represented 21% of total assets at December 31, 2004 compared with 23% at December 31, 2003. The increase in total securities compared with December 31, 2003 was primarily due to increases in U.S. Treasury and government agencies and mortgage backed securities, partially offset by declines in commercial mortgage backed and asset backed securities. At December 31, 2004, the securities available for sale balance included a net unrealized loss of $102 million, which represented the difference between fair value and amortized cost. The comparable amount at December 31, 2003 was a net unrealized gain of $4 million. The impact on bond prices of increases in interest rates during 2004 was reflected in the net unrealized loss position at December 31, 2004. The expected weighted average life of securities available for sale was 2 years and 8 months at December 31, 2004 compared with 2 years and 11 months at December 31, 2003. Loans Held For Sale Education loans held for sale totaled $1.1 billion at December 31, 2004, and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2003 and represented the majority of our loans held for sale at each date. Loans held for sale remaining from our 2001 institutional lending repositioning totaled $5 million at December 31, 2004 and $70 million at December 31, 2003. Asset Quality Nonperforming assets were $175 million at December 31, 2004, a decline of $153 million from December 31, 2003. The decline in nonperforming assets reflected the significant improvement in overall asset quality during 2004. The ratio of nonperforming assets to total loans, loans held for sale and foreclosed assets was .39% at December 31, 2004 compared with .87% at December 31, 2003. The allowance for loan and lease losses was $607 million and represented 1.40% of total loans and 424% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2004. The comparable amounts were $632 million, 1.74% and 238%, respectively, at December 31, 2003. Funding Sources Total funding sources were $65.2 billion at December 31, 2004 and $56.7 billion at December 31, 2003, an increase of $8.5 billion. This increase reflected the impact of the following 2004 developments: Our United National acquisition, An 8% increase in checking relationships, An increase in time deposits in foreign offices that reflected our increased use of Eurodollar deposits as a short term funding mechanism, The issuance of $500 million of 18 month, floating rate bank notes in September 2004 and $500 million of 5.25% subordinated bank notes due 2017 in December 2004, and An increase in other short term borrowings to fund asset growth. These increases were partially offset by debt maturities of $2.4 billion during 2004. Shareholders Equity The increase of $.8 billion, to $7.5 billion, in total shareholders equity at December 31, 2004 compared with the prior year end was primarily attributable to $360 million of common stock issued as part of the January 2004 United National acquisition and a higher retention of earnings through 2004 in anticipation of the SSRM acquisition by BlackRock and the pending acquisition of Riggs. Partially offsetting this increase was a decline in the fair value of securities available for sale and cash flow hedge derivatives due to the impact of rising interest rates that began during the second quarter of 2004 and continued into the latter half of the year. These fair value changes are captured in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of shareholders equity. 59 Table of Contents Regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2004 were 7.6% for leverage, 9.0% for tier 1 risk based and 13.0% for total risk based capital. The regulatory capital ratios were 8.2% for leverage, 9.5% for tier 1 risk based and 13.8% for total risk based capital at December 31, 2003. Glossary of Terms Accounting/administration net fund assets Net domestic and foreign fund investment assets for which we provide accounting and administration services. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Adjusted average total assets Primarily comprised of total average quarterly (or annual) assets plus (less) unrealized losses (gains) on available for sale debt securities, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets. Annualized Adjusted to reflect a full year of activity. Assets under management Assets over which we have sole or shared investment authority for our customers/clients. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Basis point One hundredth of a percentage point. Charge off Process of removing a loan or portion of a loan from a banks balance sheet because the loan is considered uncollectible. A charge off is also recorded when a loan is transferred to held for sale and the loans market value is less than its carrying amount. Common shareholders equity to total assets Common shareholders equity divided by total assets. Common shareholders equity equals total shareholders equity less the liquidation value of preferred stock. Credit derivatives Contractual agreements that provide protection against a credit event of one or more referenced credits. The nature of a credit event is established by the protection buyer and protection seller at the inception of a transaction, and such events include bankruptcy, insolvency and failure to meet payment obligations when due. The buyer of the credit derivative pays a periodic fee in return for a payment by the protection seller upon the occurrence, if any, of a credit event. Custody assets All investment assets held on behalf of clients under safekeeping arrangements. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Investment assets held in custody at other institutions on our behalf are included in the appropriate asset categories on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as if physically held by us. Derivatives Financial contracts whose value is derived from publicly traded securities, interest rates, currency exchange rates or market indices. Derivatives cover a wide assortment of financial contracts, including forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Duration of equity An estimate of the rate sensitivity of a firms economic value of equity. A negative duration of equity is associated with asset sensitivity (i.e., positioned for rising interest rates), while a positive value implies liability sensitivity (i.e., vulnerable to rising rates). For example, if the duration is +1.5 years, the economic value of equity declines by 1.5% for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates. Earning assets Assets that generate income, which include: federal funds sold; resale agreements; other short term investments, including trading securities; loans held for sale; loans, net of unearned income; securities; and certain other assets. Economic capital Represents the amount of resources that a business segment should hold to guard against potentially large losses that could cause insolvency. It is based on a measurement of economic risk, as opposed to risk as defined by regulatory bodies. The economic capital measurement process involves converting a risk distribution to the capital that is required to support the risk, consistent with an institutions target credit rating. As such, economic risk serves as a common currency of risk that allows an institution to compare different risks on a similar basis. Economic value of equity (EVE) The present value of the expected cash flows of our existing assets less the present value of the expected cash flows of our existing liabilities, plus the present value of the net cash flows of our existing off balance sheet positions. Effective duration A measurement, expressed in years, that, when multiplied by a change in interest rates, would approximate the percentage change in value of on and off balance sheet positions. Efficiency Noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income. Foreign exchange contracts Contracts that provide for the future receipt and delivery of foreign currency at previously agreed upon terms. Funds transfer pricing A management accounting methodology designed to recognize the net interest income effects of sources and uses of funds provided by the assets and liabilities of business segments. These balances are assigned funding rates that represent the interest cost for us to raise/invest funds with similar maturity and repricing structures, using the least cost funding sources available. 60 Table of Contents Futures and forward contracts Contracts in which the buyer agrees to purchase and the seller agrees to deliver a specific financial instrument at a predetermined price or yield. May be settled either in cash or by delivery of the underlying financial instrument. GAAP Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Interest rate floors and caps Interest rate protection instruments that involve payment from the seller to the buyer of an interest differential, which represents the difference between a short term rate (e.g., three month LIBOR) and an agreed upon rate (the strike rate) applied to a notional principal amount. Interest rate swap contracts Contracts that are entered into primarily as an asset/liability management strategy to reduce interest rate risk. Interest rate swap contracts are exchanges of interest rate payments, such as fixed rate payments for floating rate payments, based on notional principal amounts. Leverage ratio Tier 1 risk based capital divided by adjusted average total assets. Net interest margin Annualized taxable equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets. Nondiscretionary assets under administration Assets we hold for our customers/clients in a non discretionary, custodial capacity. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Noninterest income to total revenue Noninterest income divided by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income. Nonperforming assets Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructured loans, nonaccrual loans held for sale, and foreclosed assets and other assets. Interest income does not accrue on assets classified as nonperforming. Nonperforming loans Nonperforming loans include loans to commercial, lease financing, consumer, commercial real estate and residential mortgage customers as well as troubled debt restructured loans. Nonperforming loans do not include nonaccrual loans held for sale or foreclosed and other assets. Interest income does not accrue on loans classified as nonperforming. Notional amount A number of currency units, shares, or other units specified in a derivatives contract. Operating leverage The period to period percentage change in total revenue less the percentage change in noninterest expense. A positive percentage indicates that revenue growth exceeded expense growth (i.e., positive operating leverage) while a negative percentage implies expense growth exceeded revenue growth (i.e., negative operating leverage). Options Contracts that grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right, but not the obligation, to either purchase or sell the associated financial instrument at a set price during a period or at a specified date in the future. Recovery Cash proceeds received on a loan that had previously been charged off. The amount received is credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses. Return on average capital Annualized net income divided by average capital. Return on average assets Annualized net income divided by average assets. Return on average common equity Annualized net income divided by average common shareholders equity. Risk weighted assets Primarily computed by the assignment of specific risk weights (as defined by The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) to assets and off balance sheet instruments. Securitization The process of legally transforming financial assets into securities. Swaptions Contracts that grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right, but not the obligation, to enter into an interest rate swap agreement during a period or at a specified date in the future. Tangible common capital ratio Common shareholders equity less goodwill and other intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights) divided by assets less goodwill and other intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights). Taxable equivalent interest The interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than a taxable investment. To provide more meaningful comparisons of yields and margins for all interest earning assets, the interest income earned on tax exempt assets is increased to make it fully equivalent to interest income on other taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated Income Statement. Tier 1 risk based capital Tier 1 risk based capital equals: total shareholders equity, plus trust preferred capital securities, plus certain minority interests that are held by others; less goodwill and certain other intangible assets, less equity investments in nonfinancial companies and less net unrealized holding losses on available for sale equity securities. Net unrealized holding gains on available for sale equity securities, net unrealized holding gains (losses) on available for sale debt securities and net unrealized holding gains (losses) on cash flow hedge derivatives are excluded from total shareholders equity for tier 1 risk based capital purposes. Tier 1 risk based capital ratio Tier 1 risk based capital divided by period end risk weighted assets. 61 Table of Contents Total fund assets serviced Total domestic and offshore fund investment assets for which we provide related processing services. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Total return swap A non traditional swap where one party agrees to pay the other the total return of a defined underlying asset (e.g., loan), usually in return for receiving a stream of LIBOR based cash flows. The total returns of the asset, including interest and any default shortfall, are passed through to the counterparty. The counterparty is therefore assuming the credit and economic risk of the underlying asset. Total risk based capital Tier 1 risk based capital plus qualifying senior and subordinated debt, other minority interest not qualified as tier 1, and the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to certain limitations. Total risk based capital ratio Total risk based capital divided by period end risk weighted assets. Transaction deposits The sum of money market and interest bearing demand deposits and demand and other noninterest bearing deposits. Yield curve (shape of the yield curve, flat yield curve) A graph showing the relationship between the yields on financial instruments or market indices of the same credit quality with different maturities. For example, a normal or positive yield curve exists when long term bonds have higher yields than short term bonds. A flat yield curve exists when yields are the same for short term and long term bonds. A steep yield curve exists when yields on long term bonds are significantly higher than on short term bonds. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION We make statements in this Report, and we may from time to time make other statements, regarding our outlook or expectations for earnings, revenues, expenses and or other matters regarding or affecting PNC that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.

Actual results or future events could differ, possibly materially, from those that we anticipated in our forward looking statements, and future results could differ materially from our historical performance. Our forward looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties. We provide greater detail regarding these factors elsewhere in this Report, including in the Risk Factors and Risk Management sections. Our forward looking statements may also be subject to other risks and uncertainties including those discussed elsewhere in this Report or in our other filings with the SEC. Our business and operating results are affected by business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we do business. We are affected by changes in our customers financial performance, as well as changes in customer preferences and behavior, including as a result of changing economic conditions. The value of our assets and liabilities, as well as our overall financial performance, are affected by changes in interest rates or in valuations in the debt and equity markets. Actions by the Federal Reserve and other government agencies, including those that impact money supply and market interest rates, can affect our activities and financial results. Competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention, as well as on our credit spreads and product pricing, which can affect market share, deposits and revenues. 62 Table of Contents Our ability to implement our One PNC initiative, as well as other business initiatives and strategies we may pursue, could affect our financial performance over the next several years. Our ability to grow successfully through acquisitions is impacted by a number of risks and uncertainties related both to the acquisition transactions themselves and to the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC after closing. These uncertainties are present in transactions such as the pending acquisition by BlackRock of Merrill Lynchs investment management business and continue to be present with respect to the integration of Riggs National Corporation. Legal and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses or our financial condition or results of operations or our competitive position or reputation. Reputational impacts, in turn, could affect matters such as business generation and retention, our ability to attract and retain management, liquidity and funding. These developments could include (a) the resolution of legal proceedings or regulatory and other governmental inquiries; (b) increased litigation risk from recent regulatory and other governmental developments; (c) the results of the regulatory examination process, our failure to satisfy the requirements of agreements with governmental agencies, and regulators future use of supervisory and enforcement tools; (d) legislative and regulatory reforms, including changes to laws and regulations involving tax, pension and the protection of confidential customer information; and (e) changes in accounting policies and principles. Our business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where appropriate, through the effective use of third party insurance and capital management techniques. Our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can have an impact on our ability to respond to customer needs and to meet competitive demands. The adequacy of our intellectual property protection, and the extent of any costs associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others, can also impact our business and operating results. Our business and operating results can be affected by widespread natural disasters, terrorist activities or international hostilities, either as a result of the impact on the economy and financial and capital markets generally or on us or on our customers, suppliers or other counterparties specifically. Also, risks and uncertainties that could affect the results anticipated in forward looking statements or from historical performance relating to our majority owned subsidiary BlackRock, Inc. are discussed in more detail in BlackRocks filings with the SEC, accessible on the SECs website and on or through BlackRocks website at www.blackrock.com.
