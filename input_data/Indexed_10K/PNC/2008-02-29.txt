ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC. PNC is one of the largest diversified financial services companies in the United States based on assets, with businesses engaged in retail banking, corporate and institutional banking, asset management, and global fund processing services. We provide many of our products and services nationally and others in our primary geographic markets located in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Washington, DC, Maryland, Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky and Delaware. We also provide certain global fund processing services internationally. KEY STRATEGIC GOALS Our strategy to enhance shareholder value centers on driving positive operating leverage by achieving growth in revenue from our diverse business mix that exceeds growth in expenses as a result of disciplined cost management. In each of our business segments, the primary drivers of revenue growth are the acquisition, expansion and retention of customer relationships. We strive to expand our customer base by providing convenient banking options and leading technology systems, providing a broad range of fee based products and services, focusing on customer service, and through a significantly enhanced branding initiative. We may also grow revenue through appropriate and targeted acquisitions and, in certain businesses, by expanding into new geographical markets. We have maintained a moderate risk profile characterized by strong credit quality and limited exposure to earnings volatility resulting from interest rate fluctuations and the shape of the interest rate yield curve. Our actions have created a strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and investment flexibility to adjust, where appropriate, to changing interest rates and market conditions. We continue to be disciplined in investing capital in our businesses while returning a portion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases when appropriate. ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURE ACTIVITY A summary of pending and recently completed acquisitions and divestitures is included under Item 1 and in Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE Our financial performance is substantially affected by several external factors outside of our control, including: General economic conditions, Loan demand, utilization of credit commitments and standby letters of credit, and asset quality Customer demand for other products and services, Movement of customer deposits from lower to higher rate accounts or to investment alternatives, The level of, direction, timing and magnitude of movement in interest rates, and the shape of the interest rate yield curve, and The functioning and other performance of, and availability of liquidity in, the capital and other financial markets. The impact of credit spreads on valuations of commercial mortgage loans held for sale and the market for securitization and sale of these assets. Starting in the middle of 2007, and continuing at present, there has been significant turmoil and volatility in worldwide financial markets, accompanied by uncertain prospects for the overall economy. Our performance in 2008 will be impacted by developments in these areas. In addition, our success in 2008 will depend, among other things, upon: Further success in the acquisition, growth and retention of customers, The successful integration of Yardville and progress toward closing and integrating the Sterling acquisition, Completing the divestiture of Hilliard Lyons, Continued development of the Mercantile franchise, including full deployment of our product offerings, Revenue growth, A sustained focus on expense management and creating positive operating leverage, Maintaining strong overall asset quality, Prudent risk and capital management, and Actions we take within the capital and other financial markets. SUMMARY FINANCIAL RESULTS Year ended December 31 In billions, except for per share data 2007 2006 Net income $1.467 $2.595 Diluted earnings per share $4.35 $8.73 Return on Average commonshareholders equity 10.53 % 27.97 % Average assets 1.19 % 2.73 % We refer you to the Consolidated Income Statement Review portion of the 2006 Versus 2005 section of this Item 7 for significant items which collectively increased net income for 2006 by $1.1 billion, or $3.67 per diluted share. Our performance in 2007 included the following accomplishments: Our total assets at December 31, 2007 reached a record level of $139 billion, as further detailed in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Item 7. We achieved growth by expanding our footprint, growing and deepening customer relationships, and enhancing product capabilities. We differentiated ourselves with a diverse revenue mix of both interest and noninterest 19 income. Noninterest income represented 57% of total revenue for 2007. Overall asset quality remained strong, reflecting our commitment to maintain a moderate risk profile. While nonperforming assets increased in 2007 compared with 2006, the coverage ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses to nonperforming loans was 190% and the allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans increased to 1.21% at December 31, 2007. PNC continued to be well capitalized and maintained a strong liquidity position. At December 31, 2007, our investment in BlackRock was $4.1 billion and, based upon the closing price of BlackRocks common stock on that date, we had an additional $5.3 billion of pretax value that was not recognized. BALANCE SHEET HIGHLIGHTS Total assets were $138.9 billion at December 31, 2007 compared with $101.8 billion at December 31, 2006. The increase compared with December 31, 2006 was primarily due to the addition of approximately $21 billion of assets related to the Mercantile acquisition, growth in loans and higher securities available for sale. Total average assets were $123.4 billion for 2007 compared with $95.0 billion for 2006. This increase reflected a $20.3 billion increase in average interest earning assets and an increase in average other noninterest earning assets. An increase of $12.9 billion in loans and a $5.2 billion increase in securities available for sale were the primary factors for the increase in average interest earning assets. The increase in average other noninterest earning assets for 2007 reflected our equity investment in BlackRock, which averaged $3.8 billion for 2007 and which had been consolidated for the first nine months of 2006, and an increase in average goodwill of $3.6 billion primarily related to the Mercantile and Yardville acquisitions. Average total loans were $62.5 billion for 2007 and $49.6 billion for 2006. The increase in average total loans included the effect of the Mercantile acquisition for 10 months of 2007 and higher commercial loans. The increase in average total loans included growth in commercial loans of $5.3 billion and growth in commercial real estate loans of $4.5 billion. Loans represented 64% of average interest earning assets for both 2007 and 2006. Average securities available for sale totaled $26.5 billion for 2007 and $21.3 billion for 2006. The 10 month impact of Mercantile contributed to the increase in average securities for the 2007 period, along with overall balance sheet growth. Securities available for sale comprised 27% of average interest earning assets for both 2007 and 2006. Average total deposits were $76.8 billion for 2007, an increase of $13.5 billion over 2006. Average deposits grew from the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in money market, noninterest bearing demand deposits and retail certificates of deposit. These increases reflected the 10 month impact of the Mercantile acquisition and growth in deposits in Corporate & Institutional Banking. Average total deposits represented 62% of average total assets for 2007 and 67% for 2006. Average transaction deposits were $50.7 billion for 2007 compared with $42.3 billion for 2006. Average borrowed funds were $23.0 billion for 2007 and $15.0 billion for 2006. Increases of $3.2 billion in bank notes and senior debt, $2.5 billion in federal funds purchased and $1.5 billion in Federal Home Loan bank borrowings drove the increase in average borrowed funds compared with 2006. Shareholders equity totaled $14.9 billion at December 31, 2007, compared with $10.8 billion at December 31, 2006. The increase resulted primarily from the Mercantile and Yardville acquisitions. See the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Item 7 for additional information. LINE OF BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS We refer you to Item 1 of this Report under the captions Business Overview and Review of Lines of Business for an overview of our business segments and to the Business Segments Review section of this Item 7 for a Results Of Businesses Summary table and further analysis of business segment results for 2007 and 2006, including presentation differences from Note 26. Total business segment earnings were $1.7 billion for 2007 and $1.5 billion for 2006. We provide a reconciliation of total business segment earnings to total PNC consolidated net income as reported on a GAAP basis in Note 26 Segment Reporting in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. Retail Banking Retail Bankings 2007 earnings increased $128 million, to $893 million, up 17% compared with 2006. The increase in earnings over the prior year was driven by acquisitions and strong fee income and customer growth, partially offset by increases in the provision for credit losses and continued investments in the business. Corporate & Institutional Banking Corporate & Institutional Banking earned $432 million in 2007 compared with $454 million in 2006. While total revenue increased more than noninterest expense, earnings declined due to an increase in the provision for credit losses. Market related declines in commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) securitization activities and non customer related trading revenue resulted in a year over year reduction in noninterest income. 20 BlackRock Our BlackRock business segment earned $253 million in 2007 and $187 million in 2006. Subsequent to the September 29, 2006 deconsolidation of BlackRock, these business segment earnings are determined primarily by taking our proportionate share of BlackRocks earnings. Also, for this business segment presentation, after tax BlackRock/MLIM transaction integration costs totaling $3 million and $65 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, have been reclassified from BlackRock to Other. PFPC PFPC earned $128 million for 2007 compared with $124 million in 2006. Results for 2006 benefited from the impact of a $14 million reversal of deferred taxes related to earnings from foreign subsidiaries following managements determination that the earnings would be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. Apart from the impact of this item, the earnings increase of $18 million in 2007 reflected the successful conversion of net new business, organic growth and market appreciation. Other Other incurred a loss of $239 million in 2007 compared with earnings for 2006 of $1.1 billion. Other for 2007 included the after tax impact of the following: Integration costs totaling $99 million after taxes, A net after tax charge of $83 million representing the net mark to market adjustment on our remaining BlackRock LTIP shares obligation partially offset by the gain recognized in connection with PNCs first quarter transfer of BlackRock shares to satisfy a portion of our BlackRock LTIP shares obligation, and A $53 million after tax charge for an indemnification obligation related to certain Visa litigation. Other earnings for 2006 included the $1.3 billion after tax gain on the BlackRock/MLIM transaction recorded in the third quarter of 2006, partially offset by the after tax impact of charges related to our third quarter 2006 balance sheet repositioning activities and BlackRock/MLIM integration costs. Further information regarding the BlackRock/MLIM transaction is included in Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures included in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. 21 CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW NET INTEREST INCOME OVERVIEW Changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest earning assets and related yields, interest bearing liabilities and related rates paid, and noninterest bearing sources of funding. See Statistical Information Analysis of Year To Year Changes In Net Interest Income and Average Consolidated Balance Sheet and Net Interest Analysis in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. NET INTEREST INCOME GAAP RECONCILIATION The interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than a taxable investment. To provide more meaningful comparisons of yields and margins for all interest earning assets, we also provide net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis by increasing the interest income earned on tax exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on other taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP in the Consolidated Income Statement. A reconciliation of net interest income as reported in the Consolidated Income Statement (GAAP basis) to net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis follows (in millions): For the year ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Net interest income, GAAP basis $ 2,915 $ 2,245 $ 2,154 Taxable equivalent adjustment 27 25 33 Net interest income, taxable equivalent basis $ 2,942 $ 2,270 $ 2,187 Taxable equivalent net interest income increased $672 million, or 30%, in 2007 compared with 2006. This increase was consistent with the $20.3 billion, or 26%, increase in average interest earning assets during 2007 compared with 2006. The reasons driving the higher interest earning assets in 2007 are further discussed in the Balance Sheet Highlights portion of the Executive Summary section of this Item 7. We expect net interest income to be higher in 2008 compared with 2007, assuming our current expectations for interest rates and economic conditions. Our forward looking statements are based on our current expectations that interest rates will remain low through most of 2008 and that economic conditions, although showing slower growth than in recent years, will avoid a recession. NET INTEREST MARGIN The net interest margin was 3.00% for 2007 and 2.92% for 2006. The following factors impacted the comparison: The Mercantile acquisition. The yield on interest earning assets increased 35 basis points. The yield on loans, the single largest component, increased 31 basis points. These factors were partially offset by an increase in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities of 25 basis points. The rate paid on interest bearing deposits, the single largest component, increased 22 basis points. The impact of noninterest bearing sources of funding decreased 2 basis points in 2007 compared with the prior year. Comparing yields and rates paid to the broader market, the average federal funds rate was 5.03% during 2007 compared with 4.96% for 2006. We believe that net interest margins for our industry will continue to be impacted by competition for high quality loans and deposits and customer migration from lower to higher rate deposit or other products. We expect our net interest margin to improve slightly in 2008 compared with 2007, assuming our current expectations for interest rates and economic conditions. PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES The provision for credit losses totaled $315 million for 2007 and $124 million for 2006. Of the total 2007 provision, $188 million was recorded in the fourth quarter, including approximately $45 million related to our Yardville acquisition. The higher provision in 2007 was also impacted by an increase in our real estate portfolio, including residential real estate development exposure, and growth in total credit exposure. Total residential real estate development outstandings were approximately $2.1 billion at December 31, 2007. We do not expect to sustain asset quality at its current level. Given our projections for loan growth and continued credit deterioration, we expect nonperforming assets and the provision for credit losses will be higher in 2008 compared with 2007. Also, we expect that the level of provision for credit losses in the first quarter of 2008 will be modestly lower than the amount reported for the fourth quarter of 2007. The Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Item 7 includes additional information regarding factors impacting the provision for credit losses. NONINTEREST INCOME Summary Noninterest income was $3.790 billion for 2007 and $6.327 billion for 2006. Noninterest income for 2007 included the impact of $83 million gain recognized in connection with our transfer of BlackRock shares to satisfy a portion of PNCs LTIP obligation and a $210 million net loss representing the mark to market adjustment on our LTIP obligation. 22 Noninterest income for 2006 included the impact of the following items: The gain on the BlackRock/MLIM transaction, which totaled $2.078 billion, The effects of our third quarter 2006 balance sheet repositioning activities that resulted in charges totaling $244 million, and PNC consolidated BlackRock in its results for the first nine months of 2006 but accounted for BlackRock on the equity method for the fourth quarter of 2006 and all of 2007. Had our BlackRock investment been on the equity method for all of 2006, BlackRocks noninterest income reported by us would have been lower by $943 million for that year. Apart from the impact of these items, noninterest income increased $367 million, or 10%, in 2007 compared with 2006 largely as a result of the Mercantile acquisition and growth in several fee income categories. We expect that net interest income and noninterest income will increase in 2008 compared with 2007. We also believe that PNC will create positive operating leverage in 2008 with a percentage growth in total revenue relative to 2007 that will exceed the percentage growth in noninterest expense from 2007. Additional analysis Asset management fees totaled $784 million for 2007 and $1.420 billion for 2006. Our equity income from BlackRock has been included in asset management fees beginning with the fourth quarter of 2006. Asset management fees were higher in 2006 as the first nine months of 2006 reflected the impact of BlackRocks revenue on a consolidated basis. Assets managed at December 31, 2007 totaled $73 billion compared with $54 billion at December 31, 2006. This increase resulted primarily from the Mercantile acquisition. We refer you to the Retail Banking section of the Business Segments Review section of this Item 7 for further discussion of assets under management. Fund servicing fees declined $58 million in 2007, to $835 million, compared with $893 million in the prior year. Amounts for 2006 included $117 million of distribution fee revenue at PFPC. Effective January 1, 2007, we refined our accounting and reporting of PFPCs distribution fee revenue and related expense amounts and present these amounts net on a prospective basis. Prior to 2007, the distribution amounts were shown on a gross basis within fund servicing fees and within other noninterest expense and offset each other entirely with no impact on earnings. Apart from the impact of the distribution fee revenue included in the 2006 amounts, fund servicing fees increased $59 million in 2007 compared with the prior year. Higher revenue from offshore operations, transfer agency, managed accounts and alternative investments contributed to the increase in 2007, reflecting net new business and growth from existing clients. The PFPC section of the Business Segments Review section of this Item 7 includes information on net fund assets and custody fund assets serviced. Service charges on deposits increased $35 million, or 11%, to $348 million for 2007 compared with 2006. The increase was primarily due to the impact of Mercantile. Brokerage fees increased $32 million, or 13%, to $278 million for 2007 compared with the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher mutual fund related revenues, continued growth in our fee based fund advisory business and higher annuity income. Consumer services fees increased $49 million, or 13%, to $414 million in 2007 compared with 2006. The increase reflected the impact of Mercantile, higher debit card revenues resulting from higher transaction volumes, and fees from the credit card business that began in the latter part of 2006. Corporate services revenue was $713 million for 2007, an increase of $87 million, or 14%, over 2006. Higher revenue from commercial mortgage servicing including the impact of the ARCS acquisition, treasury management, third party consumer loan servicing activities and the Mercantile acquisition contributed to the increase in 2007 over the prior year. Equity management (private equity) net gains on portfolio investments totaled $102 million in 2007 and $107 million in 2006. Based on the nature of private equity activities, net gains or losses may fluctuate from period to period. Net securities losses totaled $5 million in 2007 and $207 million in 2006. We took actions during the third quarter of 2006 that resulted in the sale of approximately $6 billion of securities available for sale at an aggregate pretax loss of $196 million during that quarter. Noninterest revenue from trading activities totaled $104 million in 2007 compared with $183 million in 2006. While customer trading income increased in comparison, total trading revenue declined in 2007 largely due to the lower economic hedging gains associated with commercial mortgage loan activity and economic hedging losses associated with structured resale agreements. We provide additional information on our trading activities under Market Risk Management Trading Risk in the Risk Management section of this Item 7. Net losses related to our BlackRock investment amounted to $127 million in 2007, representing the net of the mark to market adjustment on our LTIP obligation and gain recognized in connection with our transfer of shares to satisfy a portion of our LTIP obligation, compared with a net gain of $2.066 billion in 2006. The 2006 amount included the $2.078 billion gain on the BlackRock/MLIM transaction. See the BlackRock portion of the Business Segments Review section of Item 7 of this Report for further information. 23 Other noninterest income increased $29 million, to $344 million, in 2007 compared with 2006. Other noninterest income for 2007 included the negative impact in the fourth quarter of a $26 million valuation adjustment for commercial mortgage loans held for sale. In early 2008, spreads have been widening and there has been limited activity in the CMBS securitization market. We value our commercial mortgage loans held for sale based on securitization prices. Therefore, if these conditions continue, additional losses will be incurred that will be significantly higher than the losses incurred during the fourth quarter of 2007. However, we do not expect the impact to be significant to our capital position. Currently, these valuation losses are unrealized (non cash) and all of the loans in this portfolio are performing. Other noninterest income for 2006 included a $48 million loss incurred in the third quarter in connection with the rebalancing of our residential mortgage portfolio. Other noninterest income typically fluctuates from period to period depending on the nature and magnitude of transactions completed and market price fluctuations. PRODUCT REVENUE In addition to credit products to commercial customers, Corporate & Institutional Banking offers other services, including treasury management and capital markets related products and services, commercial loan servicing and insurance products that are marketed by several businesses across PNC. Treasury management revenue, which includes fees as well as net interest income from customer deposit balances, increased 14% to $476 million for 2007 compared with $418 million for 2006. The higher revenue reflected continued expansion and client utilization of commercial payment card services, strong revenue growth in investment products and in various electronic payment and information services. Revenue from capital markets related products and services totaled $290 million for 2007 compared with $283 million in 2006. This increase was driven primarily by merger and acquisition advisory and related services. Midland Loan Services offers servicing, real estate advisory and technology solutions for the commercial real estate finance industry. Midlands revenue, which includes servicing fees and net interest income from servicing portfolio deposit balances, totaled $220 million for 2007 and $184 million for 2006, an increase of 20%. The revenue growth was primarily driven by growth in the commercial mortgage servicing portfolio and related services. As a component of our advisory services to clients, we provide a select set of insurance products to fulfill specific customer financial needs. Primary insurance offerings include annuities, life, credit life, health, and disability. Revenue from these products increased 4% to $74 million for 2007 compared with $71 million for 2006. PNC, through subsidiary company Alpine Indemnity Limited, participates as a direct writer for its general liability, automobile liability, workers compensation, property and terrorism insurance programs. In the normal course of business, Alpine Indemnity Limited maintains insurance reserves for reported claims and for claims incurred but not reported based on actuarial assessments. We believe these reserves were adequate at December 31, 2007. NONINTEREST EXPENSE Total noninterest expense was $4.296 billion for 2007, a decrease of $147 million compared with $4.443 billion for 2006. Item 6 of this Report includes our efficiency ratios for 2007 and 2006, along with information regarding certain significant items impacting noninterest income and expense in 2006. Noninterest expense for 2007 included the following: Acquisition integration costs of $102 million, and A charge of $82 million for an indemnification obligation related to certain Visa litigation. Noninterest expense for 2006 included the following: The first nine months of 2006 included $765 million of expenses related to BlackRock, which was still consolidated during that time, and BlackRock/MLIM transaction integration costs totaling $91 million. Apart from the impact of these items, noninterest expense increased $525 million, or 15%, in 2007 compared with 2006. These increases were largely a result of the acquisition of Mercantile. Investments in growth initiatives were mitigated by disciplined expense management. We expect to incur pretax integration costs of approximately $70 million in 2008 primarily related to our planned acquisition of Sterling and additional costs related to the Yardville and Albridge acquisitions. EFFECTIVE TAX RATE Our effective tax rate was 29.9% for 2007 and 34% for 2006. The lower effective tax rate in 2007 compared with the prior year reflected the impact of the following matters: An increase in income taxes related to the gain from, and a $57 million cumulative adjustment to increase deferred income taxes in connection with, the BlackRock/MLIM transaction in 2006, and Lower pretax income for the fourth quarter of 2007 had the impact of reducing the effective tax rate for the full year. Our effective tax rate is sensitive to levels of pretax income as certain income tax credits and items not subject to income tax remain relatively constant. Based upon current projections, we believe that the effective tax rate will be approximately 31% in 2008, before considering the impact of the pending sale of Hilliard Lyons. 24 CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET REVIEW SUMMARIZED BALANCE SHEET DATA December 31 in millions 2007 2006 Assets Loans, net of unearned income $68,319 $50,105 Securities available for sale 30,225 23,191 Loans held for sale 3,927 2,366 Equity investments 6,045 5,330 Goodwill and other intangible assets 9,551 4,043 Other 20,853 16,785 Total assets $138,920 $101,820 Liabilities Funding sources $113,627 $81,329 Other 8,785 8,818 Total liabilities 122,412 90,147 Minority and noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities 1,654 885 Total shareholders equity 14,854 10,788 Total liabilities, minority and noncontrolling interests, and shareholders equity $138,920 $101,820 The summarized balance sheet data above is based upon our Consolidated Balance Sheet in Item 8 of this Report. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2007 reflects the addition of approximately $21 billion of assets resulting from our Mercantile acquisition and approximately $3 billion of assets related to our Yardville acquisition. Various seasonal and other factors impact our period end balances whereas average balances (discussed under the Balance Sheet Highlights section of this Item 7 and included in the Statistical Information section of Item 8 of this Report) are more indicative of underlying business trends. An analysis of changes in selected balance sheet categories follows. LOANS, NET OF UNEARNED INCOME Loans increased $18.2 billion, or 36%, as of December 31, 2007 compared with December 31, 2006. Our Mercantile acquisition added $12.4 billion of loans including $4.9 billion of commercial, $4.8 billion of commercial real estate, $1.6 billion of consumer and $1.1 billion of residential mortgage loans. Our Yardville acquisition added $1.9 billion of loans. Details Of Loans December 31 in millions 2007 2006 Commercial Retail/wholesale $6,653 $5,301 Manufacturing 4,563 4,189 Other service providers 3,014 2,186 Real estate related (a) 5,730 2,825 Financial services 1,226 1,324 Health care 1,260 707 Other 6,161 4,052 Total commercial 28,607 20,584 Commercial real estate Real estate projects 6,114 2,716 Mortgage 2,792 816 Total commercial real estate 8,906 3,532 Lease financing 3,500 3,556 Total commercial lending 41,013 27,672 Consumer Home equity 14,447 13,749 Automobile 1,513 1,135 Other 2,366 1,631 Total consumer 18,326 16,515 Residential mortgage 9,557 6,337 Other 413 376 Unearned income (990 ) (795 ) Total, net of unearned income $68,319 $50,105 (a) Includes loans related to customers in the real estate, rental, leasing and construction industries. Our loan portfolio continued to be diversified among numerous industries and types of businesses. The loans that we hold are also concentrated in, and diversified across, our principal geographic markets. See Note 5 Loans, Commitments To Extend Credit and Concentrations of Credit Risk in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. Commercial lending outstandings in the table above are the largest category and are the most sensitive to changes in assumptions and judgments underlying the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses. We have allocated $713 million, or 86%, of the total allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2007 to these loans. We allocated $68 million, or 8%, of the remaining allowance at that date to consumer loans and $49 million, or 6%, to all other loans. This allocation also considers other relevant factors such as: Actual versus estimated losses, Regional and national economic conditions, Business segment and portfolio concentrations, Industry conditions, The impact of government regulations, and Risk of potential estimation or judgmental errors, including the accuracy of risk ratings. 25 Net Unfunded Credit Commitments December 31 in millions 2007 2006 Commercial $ 39,171 $ 32,265 Consumer 10,875 9,239 Commercial real estate 2,734 2,752 Other 567 579 Total $ 53,347 $ 44,835 Unfunded commitments are concentrated in our primary geographic markets. Commitments to extend credit represent arrangements to lend funds or provide liquidity subject to specified contractual conditions. Commercial commitments are reported net of participations, assignments and syndications, primarily to financial institutions, totaling $8.9 billion at December 31, 2007 and $8.3 billion at December 31, 2006. Consumer home equity lines of credit accounted for 80% of consumer unfunded credit commitments. Unfunded liquidity facility commitments and standby bond purchase agreements totaled $9.4 billion at December 31, 2007 and $6.0 billion at December 31, 2006 and are included in the preceding table primarily within the Commercial and Consumer categories. In addition to credit commitments, our net outstanding standby letters of credit totaled $4.8 billion at December 31, 2007 and $4.4 billion at December 31, 2006. Standby letters of credit commit us to make payments on behalf of our customers if specified future events occur. At December 31, 2007, the largest industry concentration was for general medical and surgical hospitals, which accounted for approximately 5% of the total letters of credit and bankers acceptances. Leases and Related Tax Matters The lease portfolio totaled $3.5 billion at December 31, 2007. Aggregate residual value at risk on the lease portfolio at December 31, 2007 was $1.1 billion. We have taken steps to mitigate $.6 billion of this residual risk, including residual value insurance coverage with third parties, third party guarantees, and other actions. The portfolio included approximately $1.7 billion of cross border leases at December 31, 2007. Cross border leases are leveraged leases of equipment located in foreign countries, primarily in western Europe and Australia. We have not entered into cross border lease transactions since 2003. We have reached a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regarding our tax liability related to cross border lease transactions, principally arising from adjustments to the timing of income tax deductions in connection with IRS examinations of our 1998 2003 consolidated Federal income tax returns. The impact of the final settlement was included in results of operations for 2007 and was not material. See Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report regarding our adoption of FSP FAS 13 2, Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction. SECURITIES Details of Securities In millions AmortizedCost Fair Value December 31, 2007 SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE Debt securities Residential mortgage backed $ 21,147 $ 20,952 Commercial mortgage backed 5,227 5,264 Asset backed 2,878 2,770 U.S. Treasury and government agencies 151 155 State and municipal 340 336 Other debt 85 84 Corporate stocks and other 662 664 Total securities available for sale $ 30,490 $ 30,225 December 31, 2006 SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE Debt securities Residential mortgage backed $ 17,325 $ 17,208 Commercial mortgage backed 3,231 3,219 Asset backed 1,615 1,609 U.S. Treasury and government agencies 611 608 State and municipal 140 139 Other debt 90 87 Corporate stocks and other 321 321 Total securities available for sale $ 23,333 $ 23,191 Securities represented 22% of total assets at December 31, 2007 and 23% of total assets at December 31, 2006. Our acquisition of Mercantile included approximately $2 billion of securities classified as available for sale. The increase in total securities compared with December 31, 2006 was primarily due to higher balances in residential mortgage backed, commercial mortgage backed and asset backed securities. We evaluate our portfolio of securities available for sale in light of changing market conditions and other factors and, where appropriate, take steps intended to improve our overall positioning. At December 31, 2007, the securities available for sale balance included a net unrealized loss of $265 million, which represented the difference between fair value and amortized cost. The comparable amount at December 31, 2006 was a net unrealized loss of $142 million. Net unrealized gains and losses in the securities available for sale portfolio are included in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax. The fair value of securities available for sale generally decreases when interest rates increase and vice versa. The expected weighted average life of securities available for sale (excluding corporate stocks and other) was 3 years and 6 months at December 31, 2007 and 3 years and 8 months at December 31, 2006. 26 We estimate that at December 31, 2007 the effective duration of securities available for sale was 2.8 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel increase in interest rates and 2.5 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in interest rates. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2006 were 2.6 years and 2.2 years, respectively. LOANS HELD FOR SALE Loans held for sale totaled $3.9 billion at December 31, 2007 compared with $2.4 billion a year ago. Loans held for sale included commercial mortgage loans intended for securitization totaling $2.1 billion at December 31, 2007 and $.9 billion at December 31, 2006. The balance at December 31, 2007 increased as market conditions were not conducive to completing securitization transactions during the fourth quarter of 2007. We also reduced our origination activity in early 2008. During the fourth quarter of 2007, a lower of cost or fair value adjustment was recorded of $26 million. This loss was reflected in the other noninterest income line item in our Consolidated Income Statement and in the results of the Corporate & Institutional Banking business segment. In early 2008, spreads have been widening and there has been limited activity in the CMBS securitization market. We value our commercial mortgage loans held for sale based on securitization prices. Therefore, if these conditions continue, additional losses will be incurred that will be significantly higher than the losses incurred during the fourth quarter of 2007. However, we do not expect the impact to be significant to our capital position. Currently, these valuation losses are unrealized (non cash) and all of the loans in this portfolio are performing. Loans held for sale also included education loans held for sale of $1.5 billion at December 31, 2007 and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2006. Historically, we classified substantially all of our education loans as loans held for sale. Gains on sales of education loans totaled $24 million in 2007, $33 million for 2006 and $19 million for 2005. These gains are reflected in the other noninterest income line item in our Consolidated Income Statement and in the results of the Retail Banking business segment. In the past, we have sold education loans to issuers of asset backed paper when the loans are placed into repayment status. Recently, the secondary markets for education loans have been impacted by liquidity issues similar to other asset classes. As a result, we believe the ability to sell education loans and generate related gains will be limited in 2008. Given this outlook and the economic and customer relationship value inherent in this product, in February 2008, we transferred the loans at lower of cost or market value from held for sale to the loan portfolio. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS The sum of goodwill and other intangible assets increased $5.5 billion at December 31, 2007 compared with the prior year end, to $9.6 billion. We added $4.7 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the Mercantile acquisition. In addition, our acquisitions of ARCS, Yardville and Albridge collectively added $.9 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets during 2007. Additional information is included in Note 7 Goodwill And Other Intangible Assets in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Report. OTHER ASSETS The increase of $4.1 billion in Assets Other in the preceding Summarized Balance Sheet Data table included the impact of a $1.0 billion increase in Federal funds sold and resale agreements and a $1.0 billion increase in other short term investments, including trading securities. 27 FUNDING AND CAPITAL SOURCES Details Of Funding Sources December 31 in millions 2007 2006 Deposits Money market $32,785 $28,580 Demand 20,861 16,833 Retail certificates of deposit 16,939 14,725 Savings 2,648 1,864 Other time 2,088 1,326 Time deposits in foreign offices 7,375 2,973 Total deposits 82,696 66,301 Borrowed funds Federal funds purchased 7,037 2,711 Repurchase agreements 2,737 2,051 Federal Home Loan Bank borrowing 7,065 42 Bank notes and senior debt 6,821 3,633 Subordinated debt 4,506 3,962 Other 2,765 2,629 Total borrowed funds 30,931 15,028 Total $113,627 $81,329 Total funding sources increased $32.3 billion at December 31, 2007 compared with the balance at December 31, 2006, as total deposits increased $16.4 billion and total borrowed funds increased $15.9 billion. Our acquisition of Mercantile added $12.5 billion of deposits and $2.1 billion of borrowed funds. The Yardville acquisition resulted in $2.0 billion of deposits. During the first quarter of 2007 we issued borrowings to fund the $2.1 billion cash portion of the Mercantile acquisition. The remaining increase in borrowed funds was the result of growth in loans and securities and the need to fund other net changes in our balance sheet. During the second half of 2007 we substantially increased Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, which provided us with additional liquidity at relatively attractive rates. The Liquidity Risk Management section of this Item 7 contains further details regarding actions we have taken which impacted our borrowed funds balances during 2007 and early 2008. Capital We manage our capital position by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing debt, equity or hybrid instruments, executing treasury stock transactions, managing dividend policies and retaining earnings. Total shareholders equity increased $4.1 billion, to $14.9 billion, at December 31, 2007 compared with December 31, 2006. In addition to the net impact of earnings and dividends in 2007, this increase reflected a $2.5 billion reduction in treasury stock and a $1.0 billion increase in capital surplus, largely due to the issuance of PNC common shares for the Mercantile and Yardville acquisitions. Common shares outstanding were 341 million at December 31, 2007 and 293 million at December 31, 2006. The increase in shares during 2007 reflected the issuance of approximately 53 million shares in connection with the Mercantile acquisition and approximately 3 million shares in connection with the Yardville acquisition. In October 2007, our Board of Directors terminated the prior program and approved a new stock repurchase program to purchase up to 25 million shares of PNC common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. This new program will remain in effect until fully utilized or until modified, superseded or terminated. During 2007, we purchased 11 million common shares under our new and prior common stock repurchase programs at a total cost of approximately $800 million. The extent and timing of additional share repurchases under the new program will depend on a number of factors including, among others, market and general economic conditions, economic and regulatory capital considerations, alternative uses of capital, regulatory limitations resulting from merger activity, and the potential impact on our credit rating. We do not expect to actively engage in share repurchase activity for the foreseeable future. 28 Risk Based Capital December 31 dollars in millions 2007 2006 Capital components Shareholders equity Common $14,847 $10,781 Preferred 7 7 Trust preferred capital securities 572 965 Minority interest 985 494 Goodwill and other intangibles (8,853 ) (3,566 ) Eligible deferred income taxes on intangible assets 119 26 Pension, other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan adjustments 177 148 Net unrealized securities losses, after tax 167 91 Net unrealized losses (gains) on cash flow hedge derivatives, after tax (175 ) 13 Equity investments in nonfinancial companies (31 ) (30 ) Other, net (5 ) Tier 1 risk based capital 7,815 8,924 Subordinated debt 3,024 1,954 Eligible allowance for credit losses 964 681 Total risk based capital $11,803 $11,559 Assets Risk weighted assets, including off balance sheet instruments and market risk equivalent assets $115,132 $85,539 Adjusted average total assets 126,139 95,590 Capital ratios Tier 1 risk based 6.8 % 10.4 % Total risk based 10.3 13.5 Leverage 6.2 9.3 Tangible capital Common shareholders equity $14,847 $10,781 Goodwill and other intangibles (8,853 ) (3,566 ) Eligible deferred income taxes on intangible assets 119 26 Tangible capital $6,113 $7,241 Total assets excluding goodwill and other intangible assets, net of eligible deferred income taxes $130,185 $98,280 Tangible common equity 4.7 % 7.4 % The declines in capital ratios from December 31, 2006 were primarily due to the impact of acquisitions, which increased risk weighted assets and goodwill, common share repurchases and organic balance sheet growth. The access to, and cost of, funding new business initiatives including acquisitions, the ability to engage in expanded business activities, the ability to pay dividends, the level of deposit insurance costs, and the level and nature of regulatory oversight depend, in part, on a financial institutions capital strength. At December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, each of our domestic bank subsidiaries was considered well capitalized based on US regulatory capital ratio requirements. See the Supervision And Regulation section of Item 1 of this Report and Note 22 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. We believe our bank subsidiaries will continue to meet these requirements in 2008. We refer you to the Perpetual Trust Securities and PNC Capital Trust E Trust Preferred Securities portions of the Off Balance Sheet Arrangements And VIEs section of this Item 7 for a discussion of two February 2008 hybrid capital securities issuances totaling $825 million that qualify as Tier 1 regulatory capital. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND VIES We engage in a variety of activities that involve unconsolidated entities or that are otherwise not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet that are generally referred to as off balance sheet arrangements. The following sections of this Report provide further information on these types of activities: Commitments, including contractual obligations and other commitments, included within the Risk Management section of this Item 7, and Note 24 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. The following provides a summary of variable interest entities (VIEs), including those in which we hold a significant variable interest but have not consolidated and those that we have consolidated into our financial statements as of December 31, 2007 and 2006.

The comparable amounts at December 31, 2006 were $5.6 billion and $.6 billion, respectively. These liquidity commitments are included in the Net Unfunded Credit Commitments table in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Report. 29 Market Street Market Street Funding LLC (Market Street) is a multi seller asset backed commercial paper conduit that is owned by an independent third party. Market Streets activities primarily involve purchasing assets or making loans secured by interests in pools of receivables from US corporations that desire access to the commercial paper market. Market Street funds the purchases of assets or loans by issuing commercial paper which has been rated A1/P1 by Standard & Poors and Moodys, respectively, and is supported by pool specific credit enhancements, liquidity facilities and program level credit enhancement. Generally, Market Street mitigates its potential interest rate risk by entering into agreements with its borrowers that reflect interest rates based upon its weighted average commercial paper cost of funds. During 2007 and 2006, Market Street met all of its funding needs through the issuance of commercial paper. At December 31, 2007 Market Street commercial paper outstanding was $5.1 billion compared with $3.9 billion for the prior year end. The weighted average maturity of the commercial paper was 32 days at December 31, 2007 compared with 23 days at December 31, 2006. In the ordinary course of business during 2007, PNC Capital Markets, acting as a placement agent for Market Street, held a maximum daily position in Market Street commercial paper of $113 million with an average of $27 million and a year end position of less than $1 million. This compares with a maximum daily position of $105 million with an average of $12 million during 2006. PNC Capital Markets did not own any Market Street commercial paper at December 31, 2006. PNC made no other purchases of Market Street commercial paper during 2007 or 2006. PNC Bank, N.A. provides certain administrative services, a portion of the program level credit enhancement and 99% of liquidity facilities to Market Street in exchange for fees negotiated based on market rates. PNC recognized program administrator fees and commitments fees related to PNCs portion of the liquidity facilities of $12.6 million and $4.1 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2007. PNC views its credit exposure for the Market Street transactions as limited. Neither creditors nor investors in Market Street have any recourse to our general credit. The commercial paper obligations at December 31, 2007 and 2006 were effectively collateralized by Market Streets assets. While PNC may be obligated to fund under liquidity facilities for events such as commercial paper market disruptions, borrower bankruptcies, collateral deficiencies or covenant violations, our credit risk under the liquidity facilities is secondary to the risk of first loss provided by the borrower or another third party in the form of deal specific credit enhancement for example, by the over collateralization of the assets. Deal specific credit enhancement that supports the commercial paper issued by Market Street is generally structured to cover a multiple of expected losses for the pool of assets and is sized to generally meet rating agency standards for comparably structured transactions. Of the $8.8 billion of liquidity facilities provided by PNC at December 31, 2007, only $2.8 billion required PNC to fund if the assets are in default. Program level credit enhancement in the amount of 10% of commitments, excluding explicitly rated AAA/Aaa facilities, is provided by PNC and Ambac, a monoline insurer. PNC provides 25% of the enhancement in the form of a cash collateral account funded by a loan facility. This facility expires on March 23, 2012. See Note 5 Loans, Commitments To Extend Credit and Concentrations of Credit Risk and Note 24 Commitments and Guarantees included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. The monoline insurer provides the remaining 75% of the enhancement in the form of a surety bond. The cash collateral account is subordinate to the surety bond. Market Street was restructured as a limited liability company in October 2005 and entered into a Subordinated Note Purchase Agreement (Note) with an unrelated third party. The Note provides first loss coverage whereby the investor absorbs losses up to the amount of the Note, which was $8.6 million as of December 31, 2007. Proceeds from the issuance of the Note are held by Market Street in a first loss reserve account that will be used to reimburse any losses incurred by Market Street, PNC Bank, N.A. or other providers under the liquidity facilities and the credit enhancement arrangements.

Facilities are structured to meet rating agency standards for comparably structured transactions. As a result of the Note issuance, we reevaluated the design of Market Street, its capital structure and relationships among the variable interest holders under the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46, (Revised 2003) Consolidation of Variable Interest entities (FIN 46R). Based on this analysis, we determined that we were no longer the primary beneficiary as defined by FIN 46R and deconsolidated Market Street from our Consolidated Balance Sheet effective October 17, 2005. PNC considers changes to the variable interest holders (such as new expected loss note investors and changes to program level credit enhancement providers), terms of expected loss notes, and new types of risks (such as foreign currency or interest rate) in Market Street as reconsideration events. PNC reviews the activities of Market Street on at least a quarterly basis to determine if a reconsideration event has occurred. As indicated earlier, 75% of the program level credit enhancement is provided by Ambac in the form of a surety bond. PNC Bank, N.A., in the role of program administrator, is closely following market developments relative to the rating agency outlooks of monoline insurers. Ambac is currently rated AAA by two of the three major rating agencies and AA by the other agency. This rating change has not impacted the Market Street commercial paper ratings of A1/P1. Various alternatives to the program level enhancement are under consideration if future rating changes impact either the ratings of Market Street commercial paper or its financial results. Based on current accounting guidance and market conditions, we do not have to consolidate Market Street into our consolidated financial statements. However, if PNC would be determined to be the primary beneficiary under FIN 46R, we would consolidate the conduit at that time. To the extent that the par value of the assets in Market Street exceeded the fair value of the assets upon consolidation, the difference would be recognized by PNC as a loss in our Consolidated Income Statement in that period. Based on the fair value of the assets held by Market Street at December 31, 2007, this reduction in earnings would not have had a material impact on our risk based capital ratios, credit ratings or debt covenants.

Low Income Housing Projects We make certain equity investments in various limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects utilizing the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) pursuant to Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital, to facilitate the sale of additional affordable housing product offerings and to assist us in achieving goals associated with the Community Reinvestment Act. The primary activities of the limited partnerships include the identification, development and operation of multi family housing that is leased to qualifying residential tenants. Generally, these types of investments are funded through a combination of debt and equity, with equity typically comprising 30% to 60% of the total project capital. We consolidated those LIHTC investments in which we own a majority of the limited partnership interests and are deemed to be primary beneficiary. We also consolidated entities in which we, as a national syndicator of affordable housing equity, serve as the general partner, and no other entity owns a majority of the limited partnership interests (together with the investments described above, the LIHTC investments). In these syndication transactions, we create funds in which our subsidiary is the general partner and sells limited partnership interests to third parties, and in some cases may also purchase a limited partnership interest in the fund. The funds limited partners can generally remove the general partner without cause at any time. The purpose of this business is to generate income from the syndication of these funds and to generate servicing fees by managing the funds. General partner activities include selecting, evaluating, structuring, negotiating, and closing the fund investments in operating limited partnerships, as well as oversight of the ongoing operations of the fund portfolio. The assets are primarily included in Equity Investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Neither creditors nor equity investors in the LIHTC investments have any recourse to our general credit. The consolidated aggregate assets and debt of these LIHTC investments are provided in the Consolidated VIEs PNC Is Primary Beneficiary table and reflected in the Other business segment. We have a significant variable interest in certain other limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects. We do not own a majority of the limited partnership interests in these entities and are not the primary beneficiary. We use the equity method to account for our investment in these entities. 31 Information regarding these partnership interests is reflected in the Non Consolidated VIEs Significant Variable Interests table. Perpetual Trust Securities We issue certain hybrid capital vehicles that qualify as capital for regulatory and rating agency purposes. In December 2006, one of our indirect subsidiaries, PNC REIT Corp., sold $500 million of 6.517% Fixed to Floating Rate Non Cumulative Exchangeable Perpetual Trust Securities (the Trust Securities) of PNC Preferred Funding Trust I (Trust I) in a private placement. PNC REIT Corp. had previously acquired the Trust Securities from the trust in exchange for an equivalent amount of Fixed to Floating Rate Non Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Securities (the LLC Preferred Securities), of PNC Preferred Funding LLC (the LLC), held by PNC REIT Corp. The LLCs initial material assets consist of indirect interests in mortgages and mortgage related assets previously owned by PNC REIT Corp. In March 2007, PNC Preferred Funding LLC sold $500 million of 6.113% Fixed to Floating Rate Non Cumulative Exchangeable Perpetual Trust Securities of PNC Preferred Funding Trust II (Trust II), in a private placement. In connection with the private placement, Trust II acquired $500 million of LLC Preferred Securities. In February 2008, PNC Preferred Funding LLC sold $375 million of 8.700% Fixed to Floating Rate Non Cumulative Exchangeable Perpetual Trust Securities of PNC Preferred Funding Trust III (Trust III) in a private placement. In connection with the private placement, Trust III acquired $375 million of LLC Preferred Securities. PNC REIT Corp. owns 100% of the LLCs common voting securities. As a result, the LLC is an indirect subsidiary of PNC and is consolidated on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Trust I, Trust II and Trust IIIs investment in the LLC Preferred Securities is characterized as a minority interest on our Consolidated Balance Sheet since we are not the primary beneficiary of Trust I, Trust II or Trust III. This minority interest totaled approximately $980 million at December 31, 2007 (excluding Trust III, which was not yet formed). Each Trust I Security is automatically exchangeable into a share of Series F Non Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of PNC Bank, N.A. (the PNC Bank Preferred Stock), each Trust II Security is automatically exchangeable into a share of Series I Non Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of PNC (the Series I Preferred Stock), and each Trust III Security is automatically exchangeable into a share of Series J Non Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of PNC, in each case under certain conditions relating to the capitalization or the financial condition of PNC Bank, N.A. and upon the direction of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. We entered into a replacement capital covenant in connection with each of the closing of the Trust Securities sale (the Trust Covenant) and the closing of the Trust II Securities sale (the Trust II Covenant), in each case for the benefit of holders of a specified series of our long term indebtedness (the Covered Debt). As of December 31, 2007, Covered Debt consists of our $200 million Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Notes issued on June 9, 1998. We agreed in the Trust Covenant that neither we nor our subsidiaries (other than PNC Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries) would purchase the Trust Securities, the LLC Preferred Securities or the PNC Bank Preferred Stock (collectively, the Trust Covered Securities) unless: (i) we have received the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, if such approval is then required under the Federal Reserve Boards capital guidelines applicable to bank holding companies and (ii) during the 180 day period prior to the date of purchase, we or our subsidiaries, as applicable, have received proceeds from the sale of Qualifying Securities in the amounts specified in the Trust Covenant (which amounts will vary based on the type of securities sold). The Trust Covenant does not apply to redemptions of the Trust Covered Securities by the issuers of those securities. We agreed in the Trust II Covenant that until March 29, 2017, neither we nor our subsidiaries would purchase or redeem the Trust II Securities, the LLC Preferred Securities or the Series I Preferred Stock (collectively, the Trust II Covered Securities), unless: (i) we have received the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, if such approval is then required under the Federal Reserve Boards capital guidelines applicable to bank holding companies and (ii) during the 180 day period prior to the date of purchase, PNC, PNC Bank, N.A. or PNC Bank N.A.s subsidiaries, as applicable, have received proceeds from the sale of Qualifying Securities in the amounts specified in the Trust II Covenant (which amounts will vary based on the type of securities sold). Qualifying Securities means debt and equity securities having terms and provisions that are specified in the Trust Covenant or the Trust II Covenant, as applicable and that, generally described, are intended to contribute to our capital base in a manner that is similar to the contribution to our capital base made by the Trust Covered Securities or the Trust II Covered Securities, as applicable. We filed a copy of each of the Trust Covenant and the Trust II Covenant with the SEC as Exhibit 99.1 to PNCs Form 8 K filed on December 8, 2006 and as Exhibit 99.1 to PNCs Form 8 K filed on March 30, 2007, respectively. PNC Bank, N.A. has contractually committed to Trust I that if full dividends are not paid in a dividend period on the Trust Securities, LLC Preferred Securities or any other parity equity securities issued by the LLC, neither PNC Bank, N.A. nor its subsidiaries will declare or pay dividends or other distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase or acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its equity capital securities during the next succeeding period (other than to holders of the LLC Preferred Securities and any parity equity securities issued by the LLC) except: (i) in the case of 32 dividends payable to subsidiaries of PNC Bank, N.A., to PNC Bank, N.A. or another wholly owned subsidiary of PNC Bank, N.A. or (ii) in the case of dividends payable to persons that are not subsidiaries of PNC Bank, N.A., to such persons only if, (A) in the case of a cash dividend, PNC has first irrevocably committed to contribute amounts at least equal to such cash dividend or (B) in the case of in kind dividends payable by PNC REIT Corp., PNC has committed to purchase such in kind dividend from the applicable PNC REIT Corp. holders in exchange for a cash payment representing the market value of such in kind dividend, and PNC has committed to contribute such in kind dividend to PNC Bank, N.A. PNC has contractually committed to each of Trust II and Trust III that if full dividends are not paid in a dividend period on the Trust II Securities or the Trust III Securities, as applicable, or the LLC Preferred Securities held by Trust II or Trust III, as applicable, PNC will not declare or pay dividends with respect to, or redeem, purchase or acquire, any of its equity capital securities during the next succeeding dividend period, other than: (i) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of capital stock of PNC in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or consultants, (ii) purchases of shares of common stock of PNC pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to buy stock existing prior to the commencement of the extension period, including under a contractually binding stock repurchase plan, (iii) any dividend in connection with the implementation of a shareholders rights plan, or the redemption or repurchase of any rights under any such plan, (iv) as a result of an exchange or conversion of any class or series of PNCs capital stock for any other class or series of PNCs capital stock, (v) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of PNC capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such stock or the security being converted or exchanged or (vi) any stock dividends paid by PNC where the dividend stock is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid. We filed a copy of the Exchange Agreements containing those dividend restrictions with the SEC as Exhibit 4.16 to PNCs Form 8 K filed on March 30, 2007 and as Exhibit 99.1 to PNCs Form 8 K filed on February 19, 2008, respectively. PNC Capital Trust E Trust Preferred Securities In February 2008, PNC Capital Trust E issued $450 million of 7 3/4% Trust Preferred Securities due March 15, 2068 (the Trust E Securities). PNC Capital Trust Es only assets are $450 million of 7 3/4% Junior Subordinated Notes due March 15, 2068 and issued by PNC (the JSNs). The Trust E Securities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by PNC. We may, at our option, redeem the JSNs at 100% of their principal amount on or after March 15, 2013. We have agreed to redeem the JSNs on March 15, 2038, but only out of net proceeds from the sale of certain replacement capital securities described in the JSN indenture. The Trust E Securities will be redeemed at the time of the JSN redemption. If we defer interest on the JSNs and either pay current interest or the fifth anniversary of the deferral passes, we are obligated to issue certain qualifying securities defined in the JSN indenture to raise proceeds to fund the payment of accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, we have entered into a replacement capital covenant (the Trust E Covenant) for the benefit of holders of a specified series of our long term indebtedness (the Trust E Covered Debt). As of February 13, 2008, the Trust E Covered Debt consists of our $300 million 6.125% Junior Subordinated Notes issued in December 2003. We agreed in the Trust E Covenant that neither PNC nor its subsidiaries will repay, redeem or purchase the JSNs or the Trust E Securities on or after March 15, 2038 unless: (i) we have obtained the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, if such approval is then required by the Federal Reserve Board; and (ii) subject to certain limitations, during the 180 day period prior to the date of repayment, redemption or purchase, we have received proceeds from the sale of Trust E Qualifying Securities in the amounts specified in the Trust E Covenant (which amounts will vary based on the redemption date and the type of securities sold). Trust E Qualifying Securities means debt and equity securities having terms and provisions that are specified in the Trust E Covenant and that, generally described, are intended to contribute to our capital base in a manner that is similar to the contribution to our capital base made by the Trust E Covered Securities. The Trust E Covenant will terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) March 15, 2048, (ii) the date on which the JSNs are otherwise redeemed in full, (iii) the date on which the holders of a majority of the principal amount of the Trust E Covered Debt agree to terminate the Trust E Covenant, (iv) the date on which we no longer have outstanding any indebtedness eligible to qualify as covered debt or (v) the occurrence of an event of default and acceleration of the JSNs under the related indenture. We filed a copy of the Trust E Covenant with the SEC as Exhibit 99.1 to PNCs Form 8 K filed February 13, 2008. In connection with the closing of the Trust E Securities sale, we agreed that, if we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments on the JSNs or a related deferral period is continuing, then PNC would be subject during such period to restrictions on dividends and other provisions protecting the status of the JSN debenture holder similar to or in some ways more restrictive than those potentially imposed under the Exchange Agreements with Trust II and Trust III, as described above. Acquired Entity Trust Preferred Securities As a result of the Mercantile and Yardville acquisitions, we assumed obligations with respect to $73 million in principal amount of junior subordinated debentures issued by the acquired entities. Under the terms of these debentures, if there is an event of default under the debentures or PNC exercises its right to defer payments on the related trust preferred securities issued by the statutory trusts or there is a default under PNCs guarantee of such payment obligations, PNC 33 would be subject during the period of such default or deferral to restrictions on dividends and other provisions protecting the status of the debenture holders similar to or in some ways more restrictive than those potentially imposed under the Exchange Agreements with Trust II and Trust III, as described above. BUSINESS SEGMENTS REVIEW We have four major businesses engaged in providing banking, asset management and global fund processing products and services. Business segment results, including inter segment revenues, and a description of each business are included in Note 26 Segment Reporting included in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Report. Certain revenue and expense amounts included in this Business Segments Review differ from the amounts shown in Note 26 due to the presentation in this Business Segments Review of business revenue on a taxable equivalent basis, the inclusion of BlackRock/MLIM transaction integration costs in the Other category, and income statement classification differences related to PFPC. Also, the presentation of BlackRock results for the 2006 period have been modified in this Business Segments Review as described on page 41 to conform with our current period presentation. Results of individual businesses are presented based on our management accounting practices and our management structure. There is no comprehensive, authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to GAAP; therefore, the financial results of individual businesses are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company. We refine our methodologies from time to time as our management accounting practices are enhanced and our businesses and management structure change. Financial results are presented, to the extent practicable, as if each business, with the exception of our BlackRock segment, operated on a stand alone basis. As permitted under GAAP, we have aggregated the business results for certain operating segments for financial reporting purposes. Assets receive a funding charge and liabilities and capital receive a funding credit based on a transfer pricing methodology that incorporates product maturities, duration and other factors. Capital is intended to cover unexpected losses and is assigned to the banking and processing businesses using our risk based economic capital model. We have assigned capital equal to 6% of funds to Retail Banking to reflect the capital required for well capitalized domestic banks and to approximate market comparables for this business. The capital assigned for PFPC reflects its legal entity shareholders equity. BlackRock business segment results for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 reflected our majority ownership in BlackRock during that period. Subsequent to the September 29, 2006 BlackRock/MLIM transaction closing, our ownership interest was reduced to approximately 34%. Since that date, our investment in BlackRock has been accounted for under the equity method but continues to be a separate reportable business segment of PNC. We describe our presentation method for the BlackRock segment for this Business Segments Review and our Line of Business Highlights on page 41. We have allocated the allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit based on our assessment of risk inherent in the loan portfolios. Our allocation of the costs incurred by operations and other support areas not directly aligned with the businesses is primarily based on the use of services. Total business segment financial results differ from total consolidated results. The impact of these differences is reflected in the Other category. Other for purposes of this Item 7 Financial Review includes residual activities that do not meet the criteria for disclosure as a separate reportable business, such as gains or losses related to BlackRock transactions including LTIP share distributions and obligations, BlackRock/MLIM transaction and acquisition integration costs, asset and liability management activities, net securities gains or losses, certain trading activities and equity management activities, differences between business segment performance reporting and financial statement reporting (GAAP), intercompany eliminations, and most corporate overhead. Employee data as reported by each business segment in the tables that follow reflect staff directly employed by the respective businesses and excludes corporate and shared services employees. Prior period employee statistics generally are not restated for organizational changes. 34 Results Of Businesses Summary Earnings Revenue (a) Average Assets (b) Year ended December 31 dollars in millions 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 Retail Banking $893 $765 $3,801 $3,125 $42,424 $29,248 Corporate & Institutional Banking 432 454 1,538 1,455 29,052 24,822 BlackRock (c)(d) 253 187 338 1,170 4,259 3,937 PFPC (e) 128 124 831 762 2,476 2,204 Total business segments 1,706 1,530 6,508 6,512 78,211 60,211 Other (c )(f) (g) (239 ) 1,065 224 2,085 45,207 34,801 Total consolidated $1,467 $2,595 $6,732 $8,597 $123,418 $95,012 (a) Business segment revenue is presented on a taxable equivalent basis. The interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than a taxable investment. To provide more meaningful comparisons of yields and margins for all interest earning assets, we also provide revenue on a taxable equivalent basis by increasing the interest income earned on tax exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on other taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP. The following is a reconciliation of total consolidated revenue on a book (GAAP) basis to total consolidated revenue on a taxable equivalent basis: Year ended December 31 dollars in millions 2007 2006 Total consolidated revenue, book (GAAP) basis $ 6,705 $ 8,572 Taxable equivalent adjustment 27 25 Total consolidated revenue, taxable equivalent basis $ 6,732 $ 8,597 (b) Period end balances for BlackRock and PFPC. (c) For our segment reporting presentation in this Business Segments Review and our Line of Business Highlights, after tax BlackRock/MLIM transaction integration costs totaling $3 million and $65 million for 2007 and 2006 have been reclassified from BlackRock to Other. Other for 2007 also includes $96 million of after tax acquisition integration costs and $53 million of after tax Visa indemnification costs. (d) For full year 2007 and the fourth quarter of 2006, revenue represents our equity income from BlackRock. For the first nine months of 2006, revenue represents the sum of total operating revenue and nonoperating income. (e) PFPC revenue represents the sum of servicing revenue and nonoperating income (expense) less debt financing costs. Servicing revenue amounts for 2006 have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. (f) Other for 2006 included the $2.1 billion pretax, or $1.3 billion after tax, gain on the BlackRock/MLIM transaction. (g) Other average assets are comprised primarily of securities available for sale and residential mortgage loans associated with asset and liability management activities. The average total balance increased in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to acquisitions and purchases of securities. 35 RETAIL BANKING Year ended December 31 Taxable equivalent basis Dollars in millions 2007 2006 INCOME STATEMENT Net interest income $2,065 $1,678 Noninterest income Asset management 466 352 Service charges on deposits 339 304 Brokerage 269 236 Consumer services 399 348 Other 263 207 Total noninterest income 1,736 1,447 Total revenue 3,801 3,125 Provision for credit losses 138 81 Noninterest expense 2,239 1,827 Pretax earnings 1,424 1,217 Income taxes 531 452 Earnings $893 $765 AVERAGE BALANCE SHEET Loans Consumer Home equity $14,209 $13,813 Indirect 1,897 1,052 Other consumer 1,597 1,248 Total consumer 17,703 16,113 Commercial and commercial real estate 12,534 5,721 Floor plan 978 910 Residential mortgage 1,992 1,440 Other 230 242 Total loans 33,437 24,426 Goodwill and other intangible assets 5,061 1,581 Loans held for sale 1,564 1,607 Other assets 2,362 1,634 Total assets $42,424 $29,248 Deposits Noninterest bearing demand $10,513 $7,841 Interest bearing demand 8,876 7,906 Money market 16,786 14,750 Total transaction deposits 36,175 30,497 Savings 2,678 2,035 Certificates of deposit 16,637 13,861 Total deposits 55,490 46,393 Other liabilities 621 553 Capital 3,558 2,986 Total funds $59,669 $49,932 PERFORMANCE RATIOS Return on average capital 25 % 26 % Noninterest income to total revenue 46 46 Efficiency 59 58 OTHER INFORMATION (a) Credit related statistics: Nonperforming assets (b) $225 $106 Net charge offs $131 $85 Net charge off ratio .39 % .35 % Home equity portfolio credit statistics: (c) % of first lien positions 39 % 43 % Weighted average loan to value ratios 73 % 70 % Weighted average FICO scores 727 728 Loans 90 days past due .37 % .24 % Checking related statistics: (c) Retail Banking checking relationships 2,272,000 1,954,000 Consumer DDA households usingonline banking 1,091,000 938,000 % of consumer DDA householdsusing online banking 54 % 53 % Year ended December 31 Taxable equivalent basis Dollars in millions 2007 2006 Checking related statistics: (c) (continued) Consumer DDA households usingonline bill payment 667,000 404,000 % of consumer DDA householdsusing online bill payment 33 % 23 % Small business loans and managed deposits: (c) Small business loans $13,049 $5,116 Managed deposits: On balance sheet Noninterest bearing demand $5,994 $4,383 Interest bearing demand 1,873 1,649 Money market 3,152 2,592 Certificates of deposit 1,068 802 Off balance sheet (d) Small business sweep checking 2,780 1,733 Total managed deposits $14,867 $11,159 Brokerage statistics: Margin loans $151 $163 Financial consultants (e) 769 758 Full service brokerage offices 100 99 Brokerage account assets (billions) $48 $46 Other statistics: Gains on sales of education loans (f) $24 $33 Full time employees 12,036 9,549 Part time employees 2,309 1,829 ATMs 3,900 3,581 Branches (g) 1,109 852 ASSETS UNDER ADMINISTRATION(in billions) (h) Assets under management Personal $53 $44 Institutional 20 10 Total $73 $54 Asset Type Equity $42 $34 Fixed income 18 12 Liquidity/other 13 8 Total $73 $54 Nondiscretionary assets under administration Personal $30 $25 Institutional 83 61 Total $113 $86 Asset Type Equity $49 $33 Fixed income 28 24 Liquidity/other 36 29 Total $113 $86 (a) Presented as of December 31 except for net charge offs, net charge off ratio, and gains on sales of education loans.

The increase in earnings over the prior year was driven by acquisitions and strong fee income and customer growth, partially offset by increases in the provision for credit losses and continued investments in the business. Retail Bankings performance during 2007 included the following: The Mercantile acquisition added approximately $10.3 billion of loans and $12.0 billion of deposits to Retail Banking. The acquisition also: Added 235 branches and 256 ATMs, Significantly increased our presence in Maryland, Added to our presence in Delaware, Virginia and the Washington, DC area, Significantly increased the size of our small business banking franchise by adding approximately $7.7 billion of commercial and commercial real estate loans, Expanded our customer base with the addition of approximately 286,000 checking relationships, and Expanded our wealth management business with the addition of $22 billion in assets under management. The Yardville acquisition has resulted in a leading deposit share in several wealthy counties in central New Jersey and added 35 branches and 39 ATMs. The pending acquisition of Sterling, which did not impact 2007, is expected to result in a leading deposit share in the Central Pennsylvania footprint and enhance our presence in surrounding markets. Customer service and customer retention continues to be our focus. In 2007, we partnered with the Gallup organization to help evaluate and improve customer and employee satisfaction. Consumer and small business checking relationships increased 318,000 during 2007, not including the impact of Yardville. Our investment in online banking capabilities continues to pay off. Since December 31, 2006, the percentage of consumer checking households using online bill payment increased from 23% to 33%. In September 2006, we launched our PNC branded credit card product. As of December 31, 2007, more than 155,000 cards have been issued and we have $244 million in receivable balances. The results to date have exceeded our expectations. In addition to the acquisitions, we opened 21 new branches and consolidated 34 branches in 2007 for a total of 1,109 branches at December 31, 2007. We continue to optimize our network by opening new branches in high growth areas, relocating branches to areas of higher market opportunity, and consolidating branches in areas of declining opportunity. Our wealth management and brokerage businesses have benefited from acquisitions, market conditions and strong business development in 2007. Asset management and brokerage fees increased $147 million, or 25%, over 2006. Total revenue for 2007 was $3.801 billion compared with $3.125 billion last year. Taxable equivalent net interest income of $2.065 billion increased $387 million, or 23%, compared with 2006 due to a 20% increase in average deposits and a 37% increase in average loan balances. Net interest income growth was the result of acquisitions and core business growth, although this growth has stabilized in recent quarters. In the current interest rate environment, Retail Banking deposits will be less valuable, and are expected to result in lower net interest income for this business segment in 2008 compared with 2007. Noninterest income increased $289 million, to $1.736 billion, up 20% compared with 2006. This growth can be attributed primarily to the following: The acquisitions, Comparatively favorable equity markets, Increased brokerage revenue and volumes, Increased volume related consumer fees, Increased third party loan servicing activities, New PNC branded credit card product, and Customer growth. In the past, we have sold education loans to issuers of asset backed paper when the loans are placed into repayment status. Recently, the secondary markets for education loans have been impacted by liquidity issues similar to other asset classes. As a result, we believe the ability to sell education loans and generate related gains will be limited in 2008. Given this outlook and the economic and customer relationship value inherent in this product, in February 2008, we transferred the loans at lower of cost or market value from held for sale to the loan portfolio. The provision for credit losses increased $57 million in 2007, to $138 million, compared with 2006. Net charge offs were $131 million in 2007, an increase of $46 million compared with 2006. The increases in provision and net charge offs were primarily a result of residential real estate development exposure, continued growth in our commercial loan portfolio and charge offs returning to a more normal level given the current credit conditions. Charge offs over the last few years have been low compared with historical averages. Given the current environment, we believe provision levels and nonperforming assets will continue to increase in 2008. Noninterest expense in 2007 totaled $2.239 billion, an increase of $412 million, or 23%, compared with 2006. Increases were primarily attributable to acquisitions (77% of the increase), higher volume related expenses tied to noninterest income growth, continued investment in new branches, and investments in various initiatives such as the new PNC branded credit card. 37 Full time employees at December 31, 2007 totaled 12,036, an increase of 2,487 over the prior year. The acquisitions added approximately 2,300 full time Retail Banking employees. Part time employees have increased by 480 since December 31, 2006. The increase in part time employees is a result of acquisitions and various customer service enhancement and efficiency initiatives. These initiatives include utilizing more part time customer facing employees rather than full time employees during peak business hours. Growing core checking deposits as a lower cost funding source and as the cornerstone product to build customer relationships is the primary objective of our deposit strategy. Furthermore, core checking accounts are critical to our strategy of expanding our payments business. Average total deposits increased $9.1 billion, or 20%, compared with 2006. Certificates of deposits increased $2.8 billion and money market deposits increased $2.0 billion. These increases were primarily attributable to acquisitions. The deposit strategy of Retail Banking is to remain disciplined on pricing, target specific markets for growth, and focus on the retention and growth of balances for relationship customers. Average demand deposit growth of $3.6 billion, or 23%, was almost solely due to acquisitions as the core growth was impacted by customers shifting funds into higher yielding deposits in the first part of 2007, small business sweep checking products, and investment products. Small business and consumer related checking relationships retention remained strong and stable. Consumer related checking relationship retention has benefited from improved penetration rates of debit cards, online banking and online bill payment. Currently, we are focused on a relationship based lending strategy that targets specific customer sectors (homeowners, small businesses and auto dealerships) while seeking to maintain a moderate risk profile in the loan portfolio. Average commercial and commercial real estate loans grew $6.8 billion, or 119%, compared with 2006. The increase is attributable to acquisitions and organic loan growth on the strength of increased small business loan demand from existing customers and the acquisition of new relationships through our sales efforts. At December 31, 2007, commercial and commercial real estate loans totaled $14.4 billion. This portfolio included $3.6 billion of commercial real estate loans, the majority of which were added with the Mercantile acquisition. Average home equity loans grew $396 million, or 3%, compared with 2006 primarily due to acquisitions. Consumer loan demand has slowed as a result of the current rate and economic environment. Our home equity loan portfolio is relationship based, with 93% of the portfolio attributable to borrowers in our primary geographic footprint. We monitor this portfolio closely and the charge offs and delinquencies that we have experienced are within our expectations given current market conditions. Average indirect loans grew $845 million, or 80%, compared with 2006. The increase is attributable to acquisitions and growth in our core portfolio that has benefited from increased sales and marketing efforts. Average residential mortgage loans increased $552 million, or 38%, primarily due to the addition of loans from the acquisitions. In general, the only meaningful growth in our mortgage portfolio is a result of acquisitions. Assets under management of $73 billion at December 31, 2007 increased $19 billion compared with the balance at December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to the Mercantile acquisition and core organic business growth, partially offset by other declines such as the divestiture of a Mercantile asset management subsidiary during the fourth quarter. The remaining portfolio growth was a result of positive client net asset flows. Client net asset flows are the result of investment additions from new and existing clients offset by ordinary course distributions from trust and investment management accounts and account closures. Nondiscretionary assets under administration of $113 billion at December 31, 2007 increased $27 billion compared with the balance at December 31, 2006, primarily due to the impact of Mercantile. See Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report regarding our planned sale of Hilliard Lyons during the first half of 2008. 38 CORPORATE & INSTITUTIONAL BANKING Year ended December 31 Taxable equivalent basis Dollars in millions except as noted 2007 2006 INCOME STATEMENT Net interest income $818 $703 Noninterest income Corporate service fees 564 526 Other 156 226 Noninterest income 720 752 Total revenue 1,538 1,455 Provision for credit losses 125 42 Noninterest expense 818 746 Pretax earnings 595 667 Income taxes 163 213 Earnings $432 $454 AVERAGE BALANCE SHEET Loans Corporate (a) $9,519 $8,633 Commercial real estate 3,590 2,876 Commercial real estate related 3,580 2,433 Asset based lending 4,634 4,467 Total loans 21,323 18,409 Goodwill and other intangible assets 1,919 1,352 Loans held for sale 1,319 893 Other assets 4,491 4,168 Total assets $29,052 $24,822 Deposits Noninterest bearing demand $7,301 $6,771 Money market 4,784 2,654 Other 1,325 907 Total deposits 13,410 10,332 Other liabilities 3,347 2,863 Capital 2,152 1,838 Total funds $18,909 $15,033 PERFORMANCE RATIOS Return on average capital 20 % 25 % Noninterest income to total revenue 47 52 Efficiency 53 51 COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE SERVICING PORTFOLIO (in billions) Beginning of period $200 $136 Acquisitions/additions 88 102 Repayments/transfers (45 ) (38 ) End of period $243 $200 OTHER INFORMATION Consolidated revenue from (b): Treasury management $476 $418 Capital markets $290 $283 Midland Loan Services $220 $184 Total loans (c) $23,861 $18,957 Nonperforming assets (c) (d) $243 $63 Net charge offs $70 $54 Full time employees (c) 2,290 1,936 Net gains on commercial mortgage loan sales $39 $55 Commercial mortgage loans held for sale (c) $2,100 $871 Valuation adjustment on commercial mortgage loans held for sale $(26) Net carrying amount of commercial mortgage servicing rights (c) $694 $471 (a) Includes lease financing. (b) Represents consolidated PNC amounts. (c) Presented as of period end. (d) Includes nonperforming loans of $222 million at December 31, 2007 and $50 million at December 31, 2006. Corporate & Institutional Banking earned $432 million in 2007 compared with $454 million in 2006. While total revenue increased more than noninterest expense, earnings declined due to an increase in the provision for credit losses. Market related declines in CMBS securitization activities and non customer related trading revenue resulted in a year over year reduction in noninterest income. Treasury management, commercial mortgage servicing, and capital markets revenues led by merger and acquisition advisory services showed growth over 2006. Highlights during 2007 for Corporate & Institutional Banking included: Total revenue increased $83 million, or 6%, to $1.5 billion for 2007 compared with 2006. The increase was driven by higher taxable equivalent net interest income related to increases in loans and noninterest bearing deposits. Corporate service fees were higher due to increased sales of treasury management products and services, commercial mortgage servicing, and fees generated by Harris Williams. Partially offsetting these increases were declines in other noninterest income from commercial mortgage loan sale gains and related economic hedging activities and lower non customer related trading revenue resulting from recent volatility in the financial markets. Other noninterest income also reflected a $26 million negative valuation adjustment on our commercial mortgage loans held for sale in the fourth quarter of 2007. In early 2008, spreads have been widening and there has been limited activity in the CMBS securitization market. We value our commercial mortgage loans held for sale based on securitization prices. Therefore, if these conditions continue, additional losses will be incurred that will be significantly higher than the losses incurred during the fourth quarter of 2007. Currently, these valuation losses are unrealized (non cash) and all of the loans in this portfolio are performing. On July 2, 2007, PNC acquired ARCS, a leading originator and servicer of agency multifamily permanent financing products, which added a commercial mortgage servicing portfolio of $13 billion. Commercial mortgage servicing related revenue, which includes fees and net interest income, totaled $233 million for 2007 compared with $184 million for 2006. The 27% increase was primarily driven by growth in the commercial mortgage servicing portfolio. The total servicing portfolio increased to $243 billion at December 31, 2007. The related increase in deposits drove the increase in the net interest income portion of this revenue. 39 Average total loan balances increased $2.9 billion or 16%, to $21.3 billion in 2007 compared with 2006. The Mercantile acquisition accounted for a large part of this increase and fueled growth in all loan categories. Continuing customer demand was also a factor in the increase in corporate loans. Commercial mortgage loans held for sale totaled $2.1 billion at December 31, 2007, driven by origination volumes along with an increase in the holding period during the second half of 2007 due to adverse market conditions. Subject to market conditions, our plan is for held for sale loans to decline as a result of placing loans in CMBS securitizations and reducing origination activity in the first half of 2008. Beginning in 2008, we elected to identify commercial mortgage loans held for sale that we intend to securitize as instruments to be accounted for at fair value under the provisions of SFAS 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS 159. This change will result in the difference between the cost and fair value of these instruments being recognized in other noninterest income, where we also report the change in fair value of related economic hedging activities. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 159, under lower of cost or market accounting, gains were recognized when loans were sold and securitized. Losses were recognized either upon sale and securitization or at quarter end if cost was greater than fair value. The provision for credit losses increased $83 million, to $125 million, in 2007 compared with 2006. This increase was due to growth in total credit exposure and credit quality migration primarily related to commercial real estate exposures. Nonperforming assets increased $180 million at December 31, 2007 compared with December 31, 2006. Higher nonaccrual loans, the largest component of nonperforming assets, were driven by increases in commercial real estate and commercial real estate related loans. Of this increase, $102 million occurred during the fourth quarter of 2007. Included in the December 31, 2007 amount was $103 million of nonperforming assets associated with the Mercantile portfolio. Given the current environment, we believe provision levels and nonperforming assets will continue to rise in 2008. Average deposit balances for 2007 increased $3.1 billion, or 30%, to $13.4 billion in 2007 compared with 2006. The increase in corporate money market deposits reflected PNCs action to avail itself of the opportunity to obtain funding from alternative sources. Growth in noninterest bearing deposits was attributable primarily to our commercial mortgage servicing portfolio. In the current interest rate environment, deposits in this business segment will be less valuable and we expect the percentage growth in net interest income in 2008 to be less than it was in 2007. Noninterest expense increased by $72 million, or 10%, to $818 million in 2007 compared with 2006. This increase reflected the impact of acquisitions as well as expenses associated with other growth and fee based initiatives and customer growth. In addition, the noninterest expense increases reflected our business of originating transactions whose returns are heavily dependent on tax credits, whereby losses are taken through noninterest expense and the associated benefits result in a lower provision for income taxes. These losses were $25 million higher in 2007 compared with 2006. See the additional revenue discussion regarding treasury management and capital markets related products and Midland Loan Services on page 24.  40 BLACKROCK Our BlackRock business segment earned $253 million in 2007 and $187 million in 2006. Subsequent to the September 29, 2006 deconsolidation of BlackRock, these business segment earnings are determined by taking our proportionate share of BlackRocks earnings and subtracting our additional income taxes recorded on our share of BlackRocks earnings. Also, for this business segment presentation, after tax BlackRock/MLIM transaction integration costs totaling $3 million and $65 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, have been reclassified from BlackRock to Other. In addition, the 2006 business segment earnings have been reduced by minority interest in income of BlackRock, excluding MLIM transaction integration costs, totaling $65 million and additional income taxes recorded on our share of BlackRocks earnings totaling $7 million. PNCs investment in BlackRock was $4.1 billion at December 31, 2007 and $3.9 billion at December 31, 2006. Based upon BlackRocks closing market price of $216.80 per common share at December 31, 2007, the market value of our investment in BlackRock was $9.4 billion at that date. As such, an additional $5.3 billion of pretax value was not recognized in our equity investment account at that date. On October 1, 2007, BlackRock acquired the fund of funds business of Quellos Group, LLC (Quellos). The combined fund of funds platform operates under the name BlackRock Alternative Advisors and is comprised one of the largest fund of funds platforms in the world, with over $25 billion in assets under management. In connection with the acquisition, BlackRock paid $562 million in cash to Quellos and placed 1.2 million shares of BlackRock common stock into an escrow account. The shares of BlackRock common stock will be held in the escrow account for up to three years and will be available to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of Quellos under the acquisition agreement. Therefore, any gain to be recognized by PNC resulting from the issuance of these shares and corresponding increase in PNCs investment in BlackRock will be deferred pending the release of shares from the escrow account. In addition, Quellos may receive up to an additional $969 million in cash and BlackRock common stock through December 31, 2010 contingent on certain measures. BLACKROCK/MLIM TRANSACTION On September 29, 2006 Merrill Lynch contributed its investment management business (MLIM) to BlackRock in exchange for 65 million shares of newly issued BlackRock common and preferred stock. BlackRock accounted for the MLIM transaction under the purchase method of accounting. Further information regarding this transaction is included in Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures included in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. BLACKROCK LTIP PROGRAMS BlackRock adopted the 2002 LTIP program to help attract and retain qualified professionals. At that time, PNC agreed to transfer up to four million of the shares of BlackRock common stock then held by us to help fund the 2002 LTIP and future programs approved by BlackRocks board of directors, subject to certain conditions and limitations. Prior to 2006, BlackRock granted awards of approximately $233 million under the 2002 LTIP program, of which approximately $208 million were paid on January 30, 2007. The award payments were funded by 17% in cash from BlackRock and one million shares of BlackRock common stock transferred by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. We recognized a pretax gain of $82 million in the first quarter of 2007 from the transfer of BlackRock shares. The gain was included in noninterest income and reflected the excess of market value over book value of the one million shares transferred in January 2007. PNCs noninterest income in 2007 also included a $209 million pretax charge related to our commitment to fund additional BlackRock LTIP programs. This charge represents the mark to market adjustment related to our remaining BlackRock LTIP shares obligation as of December 31, 2007 and resulted from the increase in the market value of BlackRock common shares during 2007. We recognized a similar charge for $12 million in 2006. BlackRock granted additional restricted stock unit awards in January 2007, all of which are subject to achieving earnings performance goals prior to the vesting date of September 29, 2011. Of the shares of BlackRock common stock that we have agreed to transfer to fund their LTIP programs, approximately 1.6 million shares have been committed to fund the restricted stock unit awards vesting in 2011 and the amount remaining would then be available for future awards. We may continue to see volatility in earnings as we mark to market our LTIP shares obligation each quarter end. However, additional gains based on the difference between the market value and the book value of the committed BlackRock common shares will generally not be recognized until the shares are distributed to LTIP participants. 41 PFPC Year ended December 31 Dollars in millions except as noted 2007 2006 INCOME STATEMENT Servicing revenue (a) $863 $800 Operating expense (a) 637 586 Operating income 226 214 Debt financing 38 42 Nonoperating income (b) 6 4 Pretax earnings 194 176 Income taxes 66 52 Earnings $128 $124 PERIOD END BALANCE SHEET Goodwill and other intangible assets $1,315 $1,012 Other assets 1,161 1,192 Total assets $2,476 $2,204 Debt financing $989 $792 Other liabilities 865 917 Shareholders equity 622 495 Total funds $2,476 $2,204 PERFORMANCE RATIOS Return on average equity 23 % 29 % Operating margin (c) 26 27 SERVICING STATISTICS (at December 31) Accounting/administration net fund assets (in billions) (d) Domestic $869 $746 Offshore 121 91 Total $990 $837 Asset type (in billions) Money market $373 $281 Equity 390 354 Fixed income 123 117 Other 104 85 Total $990 $837 Custody fund assets (in billions) $500 $427 Shareholder accounts (in millions) Transfer agency 19 18 Subaccounting 53 50 Total 72 68 OTHER INFORMATION Full time employees (at December 31) 4,784 4,381 (a) Certain out of pocket expense items which are then client billable are included in both servicing revenue and operating expense above, but offset each other entirely and therefore have no effect on operating income. Distribution revenue and expenses which related to 12b 1 fees that PFPC receives from certain fund clients for the payment of marketing, sales and service expenses also entirely offset each other, but are netted for presentation purposes above. Amounts for 2006 have been reclassified to conform with the 2007 presentation. (b) Net of nonoperating expense. (c) Total operating income divided by total servicing revenue. (d) Includes alternative investment net assets serviced. PFPC earned $128 million for 2007 compared with $124 million in 2006. Results for 2006 benefited from the impact of a $14 million reversal of deferred taxes related to earnings from foreign subsidiaries following managements determination that the earnings would be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. Apart from the impact of this item, earnings increased $18 million in 2007 reflecting the successful conversion of net new business, organic growth and market appreciation. Highlights of PFPCs performance in 2007 included: Acquisitions of Albridge and Coates Analytics in December 2007 which will allow PFPC to add analytical information tools to its current product offerings. Expansion in Europe included the approval of a banking license in Ireland and a branch in Luxembourg, which will allow PFPC to provide depositary services in Europes leading domicile for traditional investment funds and the second largest worldwide domicile after the United States. The opening of a new sales office in London will enhance efforts to expand global business development efforts afforded by these approvals. Increases in total fund assets serviced from $2.2 trillion to $2.5 trillion, or 14%, and in total shareholder accounts serviced from 68 million to 72 million, or 6%, during the past year reflected the successful conversion of new business as well as organic growth from existing customers. Combined revenue growth of 21% from managed accounts, offshore operations, and alternative investments, all targeted growth businesses, over the past year resulted from increased assets. Offshore and managed account assets serviced each exceeded $100 billion. Servicing revenue for 2007 increased by $63 million, or 8%, over 2006, to $863 million. Increases in offshore operations, transfer agency, managed accounts, and alternative investments drove the higher servicing revenue. Operating expense increased $51 million, or 9%, to $637 million in 2007 compared with 2006. The majority of this increase is attributable to increased headcount and technology costs to support new business achieved over the past year, as well as costs related to the 2007 acquisitions. The discussions of PFPC under Item 1 and the Executive Summary portion of Item 7 of this Report include additional information regarding the Albridge and Coates Analytics acquisitions. 42 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND JUDGMENTS Our consolidated financial statements are prepared by applying certain accounting policies. Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report describes the most significant accounting policies that we use. Certain of these policies require us to make estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or be subject to variations that may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods. We must use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when financial assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on either quoted market prices or are provided by other independent third party sources, when available. When such third party information is not available, we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations. Allowances For Loan And Lease Losses And Unfunded Loan Commitments And Letters Of Credit We maintain allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit at levels that we believe to be adequate to absorb estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. We determine the adequacy of the allowances based on periodic evaluations of the loan and lease portfolios and other relevant factors. However, this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates, all of which may be susceptible to significant change, including, among others: Probability of default, Loss given default, Exposure at date of default, Amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, Value of collateral, Historical loss exposure on consumer loans, residential mortgages and commercial lending, and Amounts for changes in economic conditions and potential estimation or judgmental imprecision. In determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses, we make specific allocations to impaired loans, allocations to pools of watchlist and non watchlist loans, and allocations to consumer and residential mortgage loans. We also allocate reserves to provide coverage for probable losses not covered in specific, pool and consumer reserve methodologies related to qualitative factors. While allocations are made to specific loans and pools of loans, the total reserve is available for all credit losses. Commercial loans are the largest category of credits and are the most sensitive to changes in assumptions and judgments underlying the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses. We have allocated approximately $560 million, or 67%, of the allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2007 to the commercial loan category. Consumer and residential mortgage loan allocations are made at a total portfolio level based on historical loss experience adjusted for portfolio activity. Approximately $77 million, or 9.3%, of the allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2007 have been allocated to these loans. The remainder of the allowance is allocated primarily to commercial real estate and lease financing loans. To the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates, additional provision for credit losses may be required that would reduce future earnings. See the following for additional information: Allowances For Loan And Lease Losses And Unfunded Loan Commitments And Letters Of Credit in the Credit Risk Management section of this Item 7 (which includes an illustration of the estimated impact on the aggregate of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit assuming we increased pool reserve loss rates for certain loan categories), and In Item 8 of this Report, Note 6 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements, and Allocation Of Allowance For Loan And Lease Losses in the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section. Private Equity Asset Valuation At December 31, 2007, private equity investments carried at estimated fair value totaled $561 million compared with $463 million at December 31, 2006. We value private equity assets at each balance sheet date based primarily on either, in the case of limited partnership investments, the financial statements received from the general partner which reflect fair value or, for direct investments, the estimated fair value of the investments. There is a time lag in our receipt of the financial information that is the primary basis for the valuation of our limited partnership interests. As a result, we recognized in the fourth quarter of 2007 valuation changes related to limited partnership investments that reflected the impact of third quarter 2007 market conditions and performance of the underlying companies. Due to the nature of the direct investments, we must make assumptions as to future performance, financial condition, liquidity, availability of capital, and market conditions, among others, to determine the estimated fair value of the investments. The valuation procedures that we apply to direct investments include techniques such as multiples of adjusted earnings for the entity, independent appraisals of the entity or the pricing used to value the entity in a recent financing transaction. We value affiliated partnership interests based on the underlying investments of the partnership utilizing procedures consistent with those applied to direct investments. 43 We reflect changes in the value of private equity investments in our results of operations. Market conditions and actual performance of the companies could differ from these assumptions, resulting in lower valuations that could reduce earnings in future periods. Accordingly, the valuations may not represent amounts that will ultimately be realized from these investments. Lease Residuals We provide financing for various types of equipment, aircraft, energy and power systems, and rolling stock through a variety of lease arrangements. Direct financing leases are carried at the sum of lease payments and the estimated residual value of the leased property, less unearned income. Residual value insurance or guarantees by governmental entities provide support for a significant portion of the residual value. Residual values are subject to judgments as to the value of the underlying equipment that can be affected by changes in economic and market conditions and the financial viability of the residual guarantors and insurers. To the extent not guaranteed or assumed by a third party, or otherwise insured against, we bear the risk of ownership of the leased assets. This includes the risk that the actual value of the leased assets at the end of the lease term will be less than the residual value, which could result in an impairment charge and reduce earnings in the future. Residual values are reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis. Goodwill Goodwill arising from business acquisitions represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired. Most of our goodwill relates to value inherent in the fund servicing, Retail Banking and Corporate & Institutional Banking businesses. The value of this goodwill is dependent upon our ability to provide quality, cost effective services in the face of competition from other market participants on a national and international basis. We also rely upon continuing investments in processing systems, the development of value added service features, and the ease of access by customers to our services. As such, the value of goodwill is ultimately supported by earnings, which is driven by transaction volume and, for certain businesses, the market value of assets under administration or for which processing services are provided. Lower earnings resulting from a lack of growth or our inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill, which could result in a current period charge to earnings. At least annually, management reviews the current operating environment and strategic direction of each reporting unit taking into consideration any events or changes in circumstances that may have an effect on the unit. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. This input is then used to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, which is compared to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then the goodwill of that reporting unit is not considered impaired. Based on the results of our analysis, there have been no impairment charges related to goodwill for the years 2007, 2006, and 2005. See Note 7 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. Revenue Recognition We derive net interest and noninterest income from various sources, including: Lending, Securities portfolio, Asset management and fund servicing, Customer deposits, Loan servicing, Brokerage services, Merger and acquisition advisory services, Sale of loans and securities, Certain private equity activities, and Securities and derivatives trading activities including foreign exchange. We also earn fees and commissions from issuing loan commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, selling various insurance products, providing treasury management services and participating in certain capital markets transactions. The timing and amount of revenue that we recognize in any period is dependent on estimates, judgments, assumptions, and interpretation of contractual terms. Changes in these factors can have a significant impact on revenue recognized in any period due to changes in products, market conditions or industry norms. Income Taxes In the normal course of business, we and our subsidiaries enter into transactions for which the tax treatment is unclear or subject to varying interpretations. In addition, filing requirements, methods of filing and the calculation of taxable income in various state and local jurisdictions are subject to differing interpretations. We evaluate and assess the relative risks and merits of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions, filing positions, filing methods and taxable income calculations after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent, and other information, and maintain tax accruals consistent with our evaluation of these relative risks and merits. The result of our evaluation and assessment is by its nature an estimate. We and our subsidiaries are routinely subject to audit and challenges from taxing authorities. In the event we resolve a challenge for an amount different than amounts previously accrued, we will account for the difference in the period in which we resolve the matter. We resolved disputed issues for our 1998 2000 and 2001 2003 consolidated federal income tax returns with the IRS appeals division, as described in the Leases and Related Tax and Accounting Matters in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Item 7. 44 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on the following recent accounting pronouncements that are relevant to our business, including a description of each new pronouncement, the required date of adoption, our planned date of adoption, and the expected impact on our consolidated financial statements. All of the following pronouncements were issued by the FASB unless otherwise noted. The following were issued in 2007: SFAS 141(R), Business Combinations SFAS 160, Accounting and Reporting of Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of ARB No. 51 In November 2007, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 109, In June 2007, the AICPA issued Statement of Position 07 1, Clarification of the Scope of the Audit and Accounting Guide Investment Companies and Accounting by Parent Companies and Equity Method Investors for Investments in Investment Companies. The FASB issued a final FSP in February 2008 which indefinitely delays the effective date of AICPA SOP 07 1. FASB Staff Position No. (FSP) FIN 46(R) 7, Application of FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) to Investment Companies FSP FIN 48 1, Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48 SFAS 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 The following were issued during 2006: SFAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)(SFAS 158) SFAS 157, Fair Value Measurements FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 FSP FAS 13 2, Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction SFAS 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 SFAS 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140 The Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) of the FASB issued EITF Issue 06 4, Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements STATUS OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN We have a noncontributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan (plan or pension plan) covering eligible employees. Benefits are derived from a cash balance formula based on compensation levels, age and length of service. Pension contributions are based on an actuarially determined amount necessary to fund total benefits payable to plan participants. Consistent with our investment strategy, plan assets are currently approximately 60% invested in equity investments with most of the remainder invested in fixed income instruments. Plan fiduciaries determine and review the plans investment policy. We calculate the expense associated with the pension plan in accordance with SFAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and we use assumptions and methods that are compatible with the requirements of SFAS 87, including a policy of reflecting trust assets at their fair market value. On an annual basis, we review the actuarial assumptions related to the pension plan, including the discount rate, the rate of compensation increase and the expected return on plan assets. Neither the discount rate nor the compensation increase assumptions significantly affects pension expense. The expected long term return on assets assumption does significantly affect pension expense. The expected long term return on plan assets for determining net periodic pension cost for 2007 was 8.25%, unchanged from 2006. Under current accounting rules, the difference between expected long term returns and actual returns is accumulated and amortized to pension expense over future periods. Each one percentage point difference in actual return compared with our expected return causes expense in subsequent years to change by up to $4 million as the impact is amortized into results of operations. The table below reflects the estimated effects on pension expense of certain changes in assumptions, using 2008 estimated expense as a baseline. Change in Assumption EstimatedIncrease to 2008PensionExpense (In millions) .5% decrease in discount rate $1 .5% decrease in expected long term return on assets $10 .5% increase in compensation rate $2 We currently estimate a pretax pension benefit of $26 million in 2008 compared with a pretax benefit of $30 million in 45 2007. The 2008 values and sensitivities shown above include the qualified defined benefit plan maintained by Mercantile that we integrated into the PNC plan as of December 31, 2007. SFAS 158 was effective for PNC as of December 31, 2006. This statement affects the accounting and reporting for our qualified pension plan, our nonqualified retirement plans, our postretirement welfare benefit plans, and our postemployment benefit plans. See Note 1 Accounting Policies for further information regarding our adoption of SFAS 158. Our pension plan contribution requirements are not particularly sensitive to actuarial assumptions. Investment performance has the most impact on contribution requirements and will drive the amount of permitted contributions in future years. Also, current law, including the provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, sets limits as to both minimum and maximum contributions to the plan. In any event, any contributions to the plan in the near term will be at our discretion, as we expect that the minimum required contributions under the law will be minimal or zero for several years. We maintain other defined benefit plans that have a less significant effect on financial results, including various nonqualified supplemental retirement plans for certain employees. See Note 17 Employee Benefit Plans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. RISK MANAGEMENT We encounter risk as part of the normal course of our business and we design risk management processes to help manage these risks. This Risk Management section first provides an overview of the risk measurement, control strategies, and monitoring aspects of our corporate level risk management processes. Following that discussion is an analysis of the risk management process for what we view as our primary areas of risk: credit, operational, liquidity, and market. The discussion of market risk is further subdivided into interest rate, trading, and equity and other investment risk areas. Our use of financial derivatives as part of our overall asset and liability risk management process is also addressed within the Risk Management section of this Item 7. In appropriate places within this section, historical performance is also addressed. OVERVIEW As a financial services organization, we take a certain amount of risk in every business decision. For example, every time we open an account or approve a loan for a customer, process a payment, hire a new employee, or implement a new computer system, we incur a certain amount of risk. As an organization, we must balance revenue generation and profitability with the risks associated with our business activities. Risk management is not about eliminating risks, but about identifying and accepting risks and then effectively managing them so as to optimize shareholder value. The key to effective risk management is to be proactive in identifying, measuring, evaluating, and monitoring risk on an ongoing basis. Risk management practices support decision making, improve the success rate for new initiatives, and strengthen the markets confidence in an organization. Corporate Level Risk Management Overview We support risk management through a governance structure involving the Board, senior management and a corporate risk management organization. Although our Board as a whole is responsible generally for oversight of risk management, committees of the Board provide oversight to specific areas of risk with respect to the level of risk and risk management structure. We use management level risk committees to help ensure that business decisions are executed within our desired risk profile. The Executive Risk Management Committee (ERMC), consisting of senior management executives, provides oversight for the establishment and implementation of new comprehensive risk management initiatives, reviews enterprise level risk profiles and discusses key risk issues. The corporate risk management organization has the following key roles: Facilitate the identification, assessment and monitoring of risk across PNC, Provide support and oversight to the businesses, and Identify and implement risk management best practices, as appropriate. Risk Measurement We conduct risk measurement activities specific to each area of risk. The primary vehicle for aggregation of enterprise wide risk is a comprehensive risk management methodology that is based on economic capital. This primary risk aggregation measure is supplemented with secondary measures of risk to arrive at an estimate of enterprise wide risk. The economic capital framework is a measure of potential losses above and beyond expected losses. Potential one year losses are capitalized to a level commensurate with a financial institution with an A rating by the credit rating agencies. Economic capital incorporates risk associated with potential credit losses (Credit Risk), fluctuations of the estimated market value of financial instruments (Market Risk), failure of people, processes or systems (Operational Risk), and income losses associated with declining volumes, margins and or fees, and the fixed cost structure of the business (Business Risk). We estimate credit and market risks at an exposure level while we estimate the remaining risk types at an institution or business segment level. We routinely compare the output of our economic capital model with industry benchmarks. 46 Risk Control Strategies We centrally manage policy development and exception oversight through corporate level risk management. Corporate risk management is authorized to take action to either prevent or mitigate exceptions to policies and is responsible for monitoring compliance with risk management policies. The Corporate Audit function performs an independent assessment of the internal control environment. Corporate Audit plays a critical role in risk management, testing the operation of the internal control system and reporting findings to management and to the Audit Committee of the Board. Risk Monitoring Corporate risk management reports on a regular basis to our Board regarding the enterprise risk profile of the Corporation. These reports aggregate and present the level of risk by type of risk and communicate significant risk issues, including performance relative to risk tolerance limits. Both the Board and the ERMC provide guidance on actions to address key risk issues as identified in these reports. CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT Credit risk represents the possibility that a customer, counterparty or issuer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms. Credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from extending credit to customers, purchasing securities, and entering into financial derivative transactions. Credit risk is one of our most significant risks. Approved risk tolerances, in addition to credit policies and procedures, set portfolio objectives for the level of credit risk. We have established guidelines for problem loans, acceptable levels of total borrower exposure, and other credit measures. We seek to achieve our credit portfolio objectives by maintaining a customer base that is diverse in borrower exposure and industry types. We use loan participations with third parties, loan sales and syndications, and the purchase of credit derivatives to reduce risk concentrations. The credit granting businesses maintain direct responsibility for monitoring credit risk within PNC. The Corporate Credit Policy area provides independent oversight to the measurement, monitoring and reporting of our credit risk and reports to the Chief Administrative Officer. Corporate Audit also provides an independent assessment of the effectiveness of the credit risk management process. Nonperforming, Past Due And Potential Problem Assets See the Nonperforming Assets And Related Information table in the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section of Item 8 of this Report and included here by reference for details of the types of nonperforming assets that we held at December 31 of each of the past five years. In addition, certain performing assets have interest payments that are past due or have the potential for future repayment problems. Total nonperforming assets at December 31, 2007 increased $307 million, to $478 million, compared with the prior year end. Nonperforming loans, the largest component of nonperforming assets, increased $290 million, to $437 million, at December 31, 2007 compared with December 31, 2006. Of this increase in nonperforming loans, $190 million occurred during the fourth quarter of 2007. The increase was primarily due to higher nonaccrual commercial real estate loans primarily related to residential real estate development exposure. At December 31, 2007, our largest nonperforming asset was approximately $20 million and our average nonperforming loan associated with commercial lending was approximately $0.5 million. We expect nonperforming assets to increase in 2008, although at a slower pace than we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2007. The ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets rose to .34% at December 31, 2007 compared with .17% at December 31, 2006. The amount of nonperforming loans that was current as to principal and interest was $178 million at December 31, 2007 and $59 million at December 31, 2006.

Allowances For Loan And Lease Losses And Unfunded Loan Commitments And Letters Of Credit We maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses to absorb losses from the loan portfolio. We determine the allowance based on quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio. While we make allocations to specific loans and pools of loans, the total reserve is available for all loan and lease losses. In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we maintain an allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. We report this allowance as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We determine this amount using estimates of the probability of the ultimate funding and losses related to those credit exposures. This methodology is similar to the one we use for determining the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses. We refer you to Note 6 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report regarding changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses and in the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. Also see the Allocation Of Allowance For Loan And Lease Losses table in the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section of Item 8 of this Report for additional information included herein by reference. We establish specific allowances for loans considered impaired using a method prescribed by SFAS 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan. All impaired loans except leases and large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans which may include but are not limited to credit card, residential mortgage, and consumer installment loans are subject to SFAS 114 analysis. Specific allowances for individual loans over a set dollar threshold are determined by our Special Asset Committee based on an analysis of the present value of expected future cash flows from the loans discounted at their effective interest rate, observable market price, or the fair value of the underlying collateral. We establish specific allowance on all other impaired loans based on the loss given default credit risk rating. Allocations to non impaired commercial and commercial real estate loans (pool reserve allocations) are assigned to pools of loans as defined by our business structure and are based on internal probability of default and loss given default credit risk ratings. Key elements of the pool reserve methodology include: Probability of default (PD), which is primarily based on historical default analyses and is derived from the borrowers internal PD credit risk rating; Exposure at default (EAD), which is derived from historical default data; and Loss given default (LGD), which is based on historical loss data, collateral value and other structural factors that may affect our ultimate ability to collect on the loan and is derived from the loans internal LGD credit risk rating. Our pool reserve methodology is sensitive to changes in key risk parameters such as PDs, LGDs and EADs. In general, a given change in any of the major risk parameters will have a corresponding change in the pool reserve allocations for non impaired commercial loans. Our commercial loans are the largest category of credits and are most sensitive to changes in the key risk parameters and pool reserve loss rates. To illustrate, if we increase the pool reserve loss rates by 5% for all categories of non impaired commercial loans, then the aggregate of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit would increase by $39 million. Additionally, other factors such as the rate of migration in the severity of problem loans will contribute to the final pool reserve allocations. We make consumer (including residential mortgage) loan allocations at a total portfolio level by consumer product line based on historical loss experience. We compute a four quarter average loss rate from net charge offs for the prior four quarters as a percentage of the average loans outstanding in those quarters. We apply this loss rate to loans outstanding at the end of the current period and make certain qualitative adjustments to determine the consumer loan allocation. Charge Offs And Recoveries Year ended December 31 Dollars in millions Charge offs Recoveries Net Charge offs Percent ofAverage Loans 2007 Commercial $156 $30 $126 .49 % Commercial real estate 16 1 15 .20 Consumer 73 14 59 .33 Total $245 $45 $200 .32 2006 Commercial $108 $19 $89 .44 % Commercial real estate 3 1 2 .06 Consumer 52 15 37 .23 Residential mortgage 3 3 .04 Lease financing 14 5 9 .32 Total $180 $40 $140 .28 We establish reserves to provide coverage for probable losses not considered in the specific, pool and consumer reserve methodologies, such as, but not limited to, industry concentrations and conditions, credit quality trends, recent loss experience in particular sectors of the portfolio, ability and depth of lending management, changes in risk selection and underwriting standards and the timing of available information. The amount of reserves for these qualitative factors is assigned to loan categories and to business segments 48 primarily based on the relative specific and pool allocation amounts. The amount of reserve allocated for qualitative factors represented 4.6% of the total allowance and .1% of total loans at December 31, 2007. The provision for credit losses totaled $315 million for 2007 and $124 million for 2006. Of the total 2007 provision, $188 million was recorded in the fourth quarter, including approximately $45 million related to our Yardville acquisition. The higher provision in 2007 was also impacted by our real estate portfolio, including residential real estate development exposure, and growth in total credit exposure. See the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Item 7 for further information. In addition, the provision for credit losses for 2007 and the evaluation of the allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit as of December 31, 2007 reflected loan and total credit exposure growth, changes in loan portfolio composition, and other changes in asset quality. The provision includes amounts for probable losses on loans and credit exposure related to unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. We do not expect to sustain asset quality at its current level. Given our projections for loan growth and continued credit deterioration, we expect nonperforming assets and the provision for credit losses will be higher in 2008 compared with 2007. Also, we expect that the level of provision for credit losses in the first quarter of 2008 will be modestly lower than the amount reported for the fourth quarter of 2007. The allowance as a percent of nonperforming loans was 190% and as a percent of total loans was 1.21% at December 31, 2007. The comparable percentages at December 31, 2006 were 381% and 1.12%. CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS From a credit risk management perspective, we buy and sell credit loss protection via the use of credit derivatives. When we buy loss protection by purchasing a credit default swap (CDS), we pay a fee to the seller, or CDS counterparty, in return for the right to receive a payment if a specified credit event occurs for a particular obligor or reference entity. We purchase CDSs to mitigate the risk of economic loss on a portion of our loan exposures. For credit protection, we use only traditional credit derivative instruments and do not purchase instruments such as total return swaps. We also sell loss protection to mitigate the net premium cost and the impact of mark to market accounting on the CDS in cases where we buy protection to hedge the loan portfolio and to take proprietary trading positions. These activities represent additional risk positions rather than hedges of risk. We approve counterparty credit lines for all of our trading activities, including CDSs. Counterparty credit lines are approved based on a review of credit quality in accordance with our traditional credit quality standards and credit policies. The credit risk of our counterparties is monitored in the normal course of business. In addition, all counterparty credit lines are subject to collateral thresholds and exposures above these thresholds are secured. Credit default swaps are included in the Free Standing Derivatives table in the Financial Derivatives section of this Risk Management discussion. Net gains from credit default swaps, reflected in the Trading line item on our Consolidated Income Statement, totaled $38 million for 2007 compared to net losses of $17 million for 2006. OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT Operational risk is defined as the risk of financial loss or other damage to us resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human factors, or from external events. Operational risk may occur in any of our business activities and manifests itself in various ways, including but not limited to the following: Errors related to transaction processing and systems, Breaches of the system of internal controls and compliance requirements, and Business interruptions and execution of unauthorized transactions and fraud by employees or third parties. Operational losses may arise from legal actions due to operating deficiencies or noncompliance with contracts, laws or regulations. To monitor and control operational risk, we maintain a comprehensive framework including policies and a system of internal controls that is designed to manage risk and to provide management with timely and accurate information about the operations of PNC. Management at each business unit is primarily responsible for its operational risk management program, given that operational risk management is integral to direct business management and most easily effected at the business unit level. Corporate Operational Risk Management oversees day to day operational risk management activities. Technology Risk The technology risk management program is a significant component of the operational risk framework. We have an integrated security and technology risk management framework designed to help ensure a secure, sound, and compliant infrastructure for information management. The technology risk management process is aligned with the strategic direction of the businesses and is integrated into the technology management culture, structure and practices. The application of this framework across the enterprise helps to support comprehensive and reliable internal controls. Our business resiliency program manages the organizations capabilities to provide services in the case of an event that results in material disruption of business activities. Prioritization of investments in people, processes, technology and facilities are based on different types of events, business 49 risk and criticality. Comprehensive testing validates our resiliency capabilities on an ongoing basis, and an integrated governance model is designed to help assure transparent management reporting. Insurance As a component of our risk management practices, we purchase insurance designed to protect us against accidental loss or losses which, in the aggregate, may significantly affect personnel, property, financial objectives, or our ability to continue to meet our responsibilities to our various stakeholder groups. PNC, through a subsidiary company, Alpine Indemnity Limited, participates as a direct writer for its general liability, automobile liability, workers compensation, property and terrorism programs. PNCs risks associated with its participation as a direct writer for these programs are mitigated through policy limits and annual aggregate limits. Risks in excess of Alpine policy limits and annual aggregates are mitigated through the purchase of direct coverage provided by various insurers up to limits established by PNCs Corporate Insurance Committee. LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT Liquidity risk is the risk of potential loss if we were unable to meet our funding requirements at a reasonable cost. We manage liquidity risk to help ensure that we can obtain cost effective funding to meet current and future obligations under both normal business as usual and stressful circumstances. Our largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is the deposit base that comes from our retail and corporate and institutional banking activities. Other borrowed funds come from a diverse mix of short and long term funding sources. Liquid assets and unused borrowing capacity from a number of sources are also available to maintain our liquidity position. Liquid assets consist of short term investments (federal funds sold, resale agreements and other short term investments, including trading securities) and securities available for sale. At December 31, 2007, our liquid assets totaled $37.1 billion, with $24.2 billion pledged as collateral for borrowings, trust, and other commitments. Bank Level Liquidity PNC Bank, N.A. can borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of Clevelands discount window to meet short term liquidity requirements. These borrowings are secured by securities and commercial loans. PNC Bank, N.A. is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) Pittsburgh and as such has access to advances from FHLB Pittsburgh secured generally by residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2007, we maintained significant unused borrowing capacity from the Federal Reserve Bank of Clevelands discount window and FHLB Pittsburgh under current collateral requirements. During the second half of 2007 we substantially increased FHLB borrowings, which provided us with additional liquidity at relatively attractive rates. Total FHLB borrowings were $7.1 billion at December 31, 2007 compared with $42 million at December 31, 2006. We can also obtain funding through traditional forms of borrowing, including federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements, and short and long term debt issuances. In July 2004, PNC Bank, N.A. established a program to offer up to $20 billion in senior and subordinated unsecured debt obligations with maturities of more than nine months. Through December 31, 2007, PNC Bank, N.A. had issued $5.8 billion of debt under this program, including the following 2007 issuances: In April 2007, $500 million of senior bank notes were issued that mature on October 3, 2008. Interest will be reset monthly to 1 month LIBOR minus 6 basis points and will be paid monthly. In May 2007, $1 billion of senior bank notes were issued that mature June 17, 2008. Interest will be reset monthly to 1 month LIBOR minus 5 basis points and will be paid monthly. In June 2007, $1 billion of senior bank notes were issued that mature on December 29, 2008. Interest will be reset monthly to 1 month LIBOR minus 4 basis points and will be paid monthly. In December 2007, $350 million of subordinated bank notes were issued that mature on December 7, 2017. These notes pay interest semiannually at a fixed rate of 6.0%. In January 2008, $50 million of senior bank notes were issued that mature on January 25, 2011. Interest will be reset quarterly to 3 month LIBOR plus 55 basis points and will be paid quarterly. In January 2008, $100 million of senior bank notes were issued that mature on January 25, 2010. Interest will be reset quarterly to 3 month LIBOR plus 45 basis points and will be paid quarterly. In February 2008, $175 million of senior bank notes were issued that mature on February 1, 2010. Interest will be reset quarterly to 3 month LIBOR plus 45 basis points and will be paid quarterly. In February 2008, $500 million of senior bank notes were issued that mature on August 5, 2009. Interest will be reset quarterly to 3 month LIBOR plus 40 basis points and will be paid quarterly. None of the 2007 or 2008 issuances described above are redeemable by us or the holders prior to maturity. We have the ability to issue additional trust preferred securities out of our PNC Preferred Funding structure, subject to certain contractual restrictions. In February 2008, PNC Preferred Funding Trust III issued $375 million of 8.700% Fixed to Floating Rate Non Cumulative Exchangeable Perpetual Trust Securities. See Perpetual Trust Securities in the Off Balance Sheet Arrangements And VIEs section of this Item 7. 50 PNC Bank, N.A. established a program in December 2004 to offer up to $3.0 billion of its commercial paper. As of December 31, 2007, there were no issuances outstanding under this program. As of December 31, 2007, there were $5.0 billion of PNC Bank, N.A. short and long term debt issuances with maturities of less than one year. Parent Company Liquidity Our parent companys routine funding needs consist primarily of dividends to PNC shareholders, share repurchases, debt service, the funding of non bank affiliates, and acquisitions. Parent company liquidity guidelines are designed to help ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet these requirements over the succeeding 12 month period. In managing parent company liquidity we consider funding sources, such as expected dividends to be received from PNC Bank, N.A. and potential debt issuance, and discretionary funding uses, the most significant of which is the external dividend to be paid on PNCs stock. The principal source of parent company cash flow is the dividends it receives from PNC Bank, N.A., which may be impacted by the following: Capital needs, Laws and regulations, Corporate policies, Contractual restrictions, and Other factors. Also, there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of national banks to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to extend credit to the parent company or its non bank subsidiaries. We provide additional information on these limitations in Note 22 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report and include such information here by reference. Dividends may also be impacted by the banks capital needs and by contractual restrictions. We provide additional information on certain contractual restrictions under the Perpetual Trust Securities. PNC Capital Trust E Trust Preferred Securities, and Acquired Entity Trust Preferred Securities sections of the Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and VIEs section of this Item 7. The amount available for dividend payments to the parent company by PNC Bank, N.A. without prior regulatory approval was approximately $655 million at December 31, 2007. In addition to dividends from PNC Bank, N.A., other sources of parent company liquidity include cash and short term investments, as well as dividends and loan repayments from other subsidiaries and dividends or distributions from equity investments. As of December 31, 2007, the parent company had approximately $118 million in funds available from its cash and short term investments. During 2007, $1.0 billion of parent company senior debt was redeemed by the holders, all during the fourth quarter. We can also generate liquidity for the parent company and PNCs non bank subsidiaries through the issuance of securities in public or private markets. In February 2007, we issued $775 million of floating rate senior notes due January 2012. Interest will be reset quarterly to 3 month LIBOR plus 14 basis points and interest will be paid quarterly. Also in February 2007, we issued $500 million of floating rate senior notes due January 2014. Interest will be reset quarterly to 3 month LIBOR plus 20 basis points and will be paid quarterly. In February 2007, we issued $600 million of subordinated notes due February 2017. These notes pay interest semiannually at a fixed rate of 5.625%. In June 2007, we issued $500 million of Senior Notes that mature on June 12, 2009. Interest will be reset monthly to 1 month LIBOR plus 2 basis points. These notes are not redeemable by us or the holders prior to maturity. In September 2007, we issued $250 million of senior notes that mature on September 28, 2012. These notes pay interest semiannually at a fixed rate of 5.50%. None of the 2007 issuances described above are redeemable by us or the holders prior to maturity. In February 2008, PNC Capital Trust E was formed and issued $450 million of Capital Securities. Proceeds from the issuance were used to purchase $450 million of junior subordinated notes issued by PNC that mature on March 15, 2068 and are redeemable on or after March 15, 2013 at par. These notes pay interest quarterly at a fixed rate of 7.75%. We used the February 2007 issuances described above to fund a substantial portion of the cash portion of our Mercantile acquisition. In the first half of 2007, we elected to redeem all of the underlying Capital Securities related to the following trusts, totaling $516 million: UNB Capital Trust I ($16 million), Riggs Capital Trust II ($200 million), and PNC Institutional Capital Trust B ($300 million). In July 2006, PNC Funding Corp established a program to offer up to $3.0 billion of commercial paper to provide the parent company with additional liquidity. As of December 31, 2007, $458 million of commercial paper was outstanding under this program. As of December 31, 2007, there were $1.4 billion of parent company contractual obligations, including commercial paper, with maturities of less than one year. We have effective shelf registration statements which enable us to issue additional debt and equity securities, including certain hybrid capital instruments. 51 Commitments The following tables set forth contractual obligations and various other commitments representing required and potential cash outflows as of December 31, 2007.

(c) Includes private equity funding commitments related to equity management, low income housing projects and other investments. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW Market risk is the risk of a loss in earnings or economic value due to adverse movements in market factors such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and equity prices. We are exposed to market risk primarily by our involvement in the following activities, among others: Traditional banking activities of taking deposits and extending loans, Private equity and other investments and activities whose economic values are directly impacted by market factors, and Trading in fixed income products, equities, derivatives, and foreign exchange, as a result of customer activities, underwriting, and proprietary trading. We have established enterprise wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor, and report market risk. Market Risk Management provides independent oversight by monitoring compliance with these limits and guidelines, and reporting significant risks in the business to the Joint Risk Committee of the Board. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT INTEREST RATE RISK Interest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates, and consumer preferences, affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities and the level of our noninterest bearing funding sources. Due to the repricing term mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these products, changes in market interest rates not only affect expected near term earnings, but also the economic values of these assets and liabilities. Asset and Liability Management centrally manages interest rate risk within limits and guidelines set forth in our risk management policies approved by the Asset and Liability Committee and the Risk Committee of the Board. 52 Sensitivity results and market interest rate benchmarks for the fourth quarters of 2007 and 2006 follow: Interest Sensitivity Analysis FourthQuarter 2007 FourthQuarter 2006 Net Interest Income Sensitivity Simulation Effect on net interest income in first year from gradual interest rate change over following 12 months of: 100 basis point increase (2.8 )% (2.6 )% 100 basis point decrease 2.9 % 2.5 % Effect on net interest income in second year from gradual interest rate change over the preceding 12 months of: 100 basis point increase (6.4 )% (5.5 )% 100 basis point decrease 4.4 % 3.7 % Duration of Equity Model Base case duration of equity (in years): 2.1 1.5 Key Period End Interest Rates One month LIBOR 4.60 % 5.32 % Three year swap 3.91 % 5.10 % In addition to measuring the effect on net interest income assuming parallel changes in current interest rates, we routinely simulate the effects of a number of nonparallel interest rate environments. The following Net Interest Income Sensitivity To Alternative Rate Scenarios table reflects the percentage change in net interest income over the next two 12 month periods assuming (i) the PNC Economists most likely rate forecast, (ii) implied market forward rates, and (iii) a Two Ten Inversion (a 200 basis point inversion between two year and ten year rates superimposed on current base rates) scenario. We are inherently sensitive to a flatter or inverted yield curve. Net Interest Income Sensitivity To Alternative Rate Scenarios (Fourth Quarter 2007) PNC Economist MarketForward Two TenInversion First year sensitivity 6.4 % 6.1 % (8.7 )% Second year sensitivity 9.5 % 11.0 % (7.7 )% All changes in forecasted net interest income are relative to results in a base rate scenario where current market rates are assumed to remain unchanged over the forecast horizon. When forecasting net interest income, we make assumptions about interest rates and the shape of the yield curve, the volume and characteristics of new business, and the behavior of existing on and off balance sheet positions. These assumptions determine the future level of simulated net interest income in the base interest rate scenario and the other interest rate scenarios presented in the following table. These simulations assume that as assets and liabilities mature, they are replaced or repriced at market rates. The graph below presents the yield curves for the base rate scenario and each of the alternate scenarios one year forward. Our risk position is currently liability sensitive which was the objective of our recent balance sheet management strategies. We believe that we have the deposit funding base and balance sheet flexibility to adjust, where appropriate, to changing interest rates and market conditions. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT TRADING RISK Our trading activities primarily include customer driven trading in fixed income securities, equities, derivatives, and foreign exchange contracts. They also include the underwriting of fixed income and equity securities and proprietary trading. We use value at risk (VaR) as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in trading activities. The Risk Committee of the Board establishes an enterprise wide VaR limit on our trading activities. During 2007, our VaR ranged between $6.1 million and $12.8 million, averaging $8.5 million. This range reflected an increase in market volatility. To help ensure the integrity of the models used to calculate VaR for each portfolio and enterprise wide, we use a process known as backtesting. The backtesting process consists of comparing actual observations of trading related gains or losses against the VaR levels that were calculated at the close of the prior day. We would expect a maximum of two to three instances a year in which actual losses exceeded the prior day VaR measure. During 2007, there were two such instances at the enterprise wide level. 53 The following graph shows a comparison of enterprise wide trading related gains and losses against prior day VaR for the period. Total trading revenue for the past three years was as follows: Year end December 31 in millions 2007 2006 2005 Net interest income (expense) $7 $(6) $9 Noninterest income 104 183 157 Total trading revenue $111 $177 $166 Securities underwriting and trading (a) $41 $38 $47 Foreign exchange 58 55 39 Financial derivatives 12 84 80 Total trading revenue $111 $177 $166 (a) Includes changes in fair value for certain loans accounted for at fair value.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENT RISK Equity investment risk is the risk of potential losses associated with investing in both private and public equity markets. In addition to extending credit, taking deposits, and underwriting and trading financial instruments, we make and manage direct investments in a variety of transactions, including management buyouts, recapitalizations, and later stage growth financings in a variety of industries. We also have investments in affiliated and non affiliated funds that make similar investments in private equity and in debt and equity oriented hedge funds. The economic and or book value of these investments and other assets such as loan servicing rights are directly affected by changes in market factors. The primary risk measurement for equity and other investments is economic capital. Economic capital is a common measure of risk for credit, market and operational risk. It is an estimate of the worst case value depreciation over one year within a 99.9% confidence level. Given the illiquid nature of many of these types of investments, it can be a challenge to determine their fair values. Market Risk Management and Finance provide independent oversight of the valuation process. Various PNC business units manage our private equity and other investment activities. Our businesses are responsible for making investment decisions within the approved policy limits and associated guidelines. BlackRock PNC owns approximately 43 million shares of BlackRock common stock, accounted for under the equity method. Our total investment in BlackRock was $4.1 billion at December 31, 2007 compared with $3.9 billion at December 31, 2006. The market value of our investment in BlackRock was $9.4 billion at December 31, 2007. The primary risk measurement, similar to other equity investments, is economic capital. Low Income Housing Projects And Historic Tax Credits Included in our equity investments are limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects. At December 31, 2007 these investments, consisting of partnerships accounted for under the equity method as well as equity investments held by consolidated partnerships, totaled $1.0 billion. The comparable amount at December 31, 2006 was $708 million. PNCs equity investment at risk was $188 million at December 31, 2007 compared with $134 million at year end 2006. We also had commitments to make additional equity investments in affordable housing limited partnerships of $98 million at December 31, 2007 compared with $71 million at December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2007 historic tax credit investments totaled $13 million with unfunded commitments related to these investments of $26 million. 54 Private Equity The private equity portfolio is comprised of equity and mezzanine investments that vary by industry, stage and type of investment. Private equity investments are reported at fair value. Changes in the values of private equity investments are reflected in our results of operations. Due to the nature of the investments, the valuations incorporate assumptions as to future performance, financial condition, liquidity, availability of capital, and market conditions, among other factors, to determine the estimated fair value of the investments. Market conditions and actual performance of the investments could differ from these assumptions. Accordingly, lower valuations may occur that could adversely impact earnings in future periods. Also, the valuations may not represent amounts that will ultimately be realized from these investments. See Private Equity Asset Valuation in the Critical Accounting Policies And Judgments section of this Item 7 for additional information. At December 31, 2007, private equity investments carried at estimated fair value totaled $561 million compared with $463 million at December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2007, approximately 47% of the amount was invested directly in a variety of companies and approximately 53% was invested in various limited partnerships. Our unfunded commitments related to private equity totaled $270 million at December 31, 2007 compared with $283 million at December 31, 2006. Other Investments We also make investments in affiliated and non affiliated funds with both traditional and alternative investment strategies. The economic values could be driven by either the fixed income market or the equity markets, or both. At December 31, 2007, other investments totaled $389 million compared with $269 million at December 31, 2006. Our unfunded commitments related to other investments totaled $79 million at December 31, 2007 compared with $16 million at December 31, 2006. The amounts of other investments and related unfunded commitments at December 31, 2007 included those related to Steel City Capital Funding LLC as further described in Note 24 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. IMPACT OF INFLATION Our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. Accordingly, future changes in prices do not affect the obligations to pay or receive fixed and determinable amounts of money. During periods of inflation, monetary assets lose value in terms of purchasing power and monetary liabilities have corresponding purchasing power gains. The concept of purchasing power, however, is not an adequate indicator of the effect of inflation on banks because it does not take into account changes in interest rates, which are an important determinant of our earnings. FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES We use a variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage interest rate, market and credit risk inherent in our business activities. Substantially all such instruments are used to manage risk related to changes in interest rates. Interest rate and total return swaps, interest rate caps and floors and futures contracts are the primary instruments we use for interest rate risk management. Financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, interest rate, market and credit risk. For interest rate swaps and total return swaps, options and futures contracts, only periodic cash payments and, with respect to options, premiums are exchanged. Therefore, cash requirements and exposure to credit risk are significantly less than the notional amount on these instruments. Further information on our financial derivatives is presented in Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 15 Financial Derivatives in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. Not all elements of interest rate, market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial or other derivatives, and such instruments may be ineffective for their intended purposes due to unanticipated market characteristics, among other reasons. 55 The following tables provide the notional or contractual amounts and estimated net fair value of financial derivatives used for risk management and designated as accounting hedges as well as free standing derivatives at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Weighted average interest rates presented are based on contractual terms, if fixed, or the implied forward yield curve at each respective date, if floating.

Net income for 2006 included the after tax impact of the following items: The third quarter gain on the BlackRock/MLIM transaction of $1.3 billion, or $4.36 per diluted share; The third quarter securities portfolio rebalancing loss of $127 million, or $.43 per diluted share; BlackRock/MLIM transaction integration costs of $47 million, or $.16 per diluted share, and The third quarter mortgage loan portfolio repositioning loss of $31 million, or $.10 per diluted share. The aggregate impact of these items increased 2006 net income by $1.1 billion, or $3.67 per diluted share. Results for 2005 included the impact of the following items: The reversal of deferred tax liabilities that benefited earnings by $45 million, or $.16 per diluted share, in the first quarter related to our transfer of ownership in BlackRock from PNC Bank, N.A. to our intermediate bank holding company, PNC Bancorp, Inc.; Implementation costs totaling $35 million after tax, or $.12 per diluted share, related to the One PNC initiative; The $34 million after tax benefit of a second quarter 2005 loan recovery; and Integration costs of $20 million after tax, or $.07 per diluted share, comprised of provision for credit losses, noninterest expense and deferred taxes, related to the May 2005 acquisition of Riggs. Net Interest Income Net interest income was $2.245 billion for 2006 and $2.154 billion for 2005. Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis was $2.270 billion for 2006 compared with $2.187 billion for 2005, an increase of $83 million, or 4%. The increase reflected the impact of the 6% increase in average interest earning assets during 2006 partially offset by a decline in the net interest margin. The net interest margin was 2.92% for 2006, a decline of 8 basis points compared with 2005. Provision For Credit Losses The provision for credit losses was $124 million for 2006 compared with $21 million for 2005. The provision for credit losses for 2005 included the benefit of a $53 million loan recovery in the second quarter of that year resulting from a litigation settlement. In addition to this item, the increase in the provision for credit losses in 2006 reflected the following factors: The impact of overall loan growth, as average total loans increased $2.2 billion in 2006 compared with the prior year; The effect of a single large overdraft situation that occurred during the second quarter of 2006, and Growth in unfunded commitments. Noninterest Income Summary Noninterest income was $6.327 billion for 2006 and $4.173 billion for 2005. Noninterest income for 2006 included the impact of the gain on the BlackRock/MLIM transaction, which totaled $2.078 billion, partially offset by the effects of our third quarter 2006 balance sheet repositioning activities that resulted in charges totaling $244 million. Additional analysis Asset management fees amounted to $1.420 billion for 2006 and $1.443 billion for 2005, a decline of $23 million. Our equity income from BlackRock was included in asset management fees beginning with the fourth quarter of 2006. Asset management fees for 2005 and the first nine months of 2006 reflected the impact of BlackRocks revenue on a consolidated basis. Assets managed at December 31, 2006 totaled $54 billion compared with $494 billion at December 31, 2005 and reflected the deconsolidation of BlackRock effective September 29, 2006. Fund servicing fees increased $23 million in 2006, to $893 million, compared with $870 million in the prior year. Included in these amounts were distribution/out of pocket revenue amounts at PFPC totaling $170 million in 2006 and $147 million in 2005, the impacts of which were offset by expenses in the same amounts in each year. PFPC provided fund accounting/administration services for $837 billion of net fund assets and provided custody services for $427 billion of fund assets at December 31, 2006, compared with $835 billion and $476 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2005. The decrease in custody fund assets at December 31, 2006 compared with December 31, 2005 resulted primarily from the deconversion of a major client during the first quarter of 2006, which was partially offset by new business, asset inflows from existing customers, and equity market appreciation. Service charges on deposits increased $40 million, to $313 million, for 2006 compared with 2005. Customer growth, 58 expansion of the branch network, including our expansion into the greater Washington, DC area that began in May 2005, and various pricing actions resulting from the One PNC initiative all contributed to the increase in 2006. Brokerage fees increased $21 million, to $246 million, for 2006 compared with the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher annuity income and mutual fund related revenues, including favorable production from the fee based fund advisory business. Consumer services fees increased $72 million, to $365 million, in 2006 compared with 2005. Higher fees reflected the impact of consolidating our merchant services activities in the fourth quarter of 2005 as a result of our increased ownership interest in the merchant services business. The increase was also due to higher debit card revenues resulting from higher transaction volumes, our expansion into the greater Washington, DC area, and pricing actions related to the One PNC initiative. These factors were partially offset by lower ATM surcharge revenue in 2006 resulting from changing customer behavior and a strategic decision to reduce the out of footprint ATM network. Corporate services revenue was $626 million for 2006, compared with $485 million in 2005. The increase in corporate services revenue compared with the prior year was primarily due to the full year benefit in 2006 of our October 2005 acquisition of Harris Williams. Equity management (private equity) net gains on portfolio investments totaled $107 million in 2006 and $96 million for 2005. Based on the nature of private equity activities, net gains or losses may be volatile from period to period. Net securities losses totaled $207 million in 2006 and $41 million in 2005. We took actions during the third quarter of 2006 that resulted in the sale of approximately $6 billion of securities available for sale at an aggregate pretax loss of $196 million during that quarter. Noninterest revenue from trading activities, which is primarily customer related, totaled $183 million in 2006 compared with $157 million for 2005. We provide additional information on our trading activities under Market Risk Management Trading Risk in the Risk Management section of this Item 7. Net gains related to our BlackRock investment were $2.066 billion in 2006, comprised of the $2.078 billion gain on the BlackRock/MLIM transaction partially offset by a fourth quarter mark to market adjustment of $12 million on our BlackRock LTIP obligation. See the BlackRock portion of the Business Segments Review section of this Item 7 for further information. Other noninterest income decreased $57 million, to $315 million, in 2006 compared with 2005. Other noninterest income for 2006 included the impact of a $48 million pretax loss incurred in the third quarter of 2006 in connection with the rebalancing of our residential mortgage portfolio. Noninterest Expense Total noninterest expense was $4.443 billion for 2006, an increase of $137 million compared with 2005. Item 6 of this Report includes our efficiency ratios for 2006 and 2005 and information regarding certain significant items impacting noninterest income and expense in 2006. Noninterest expense for 2006 included the following: Our share of integration costs related to the BlackRock/MLIM transaction totaling $91 million, which were almost entirely offset by a decrease in other BlackRock expenses of $87 million due to our deconsolidation of BlackRock effective September 29, 2006, An increase of $71 million of expenses related to Harris Williams, which we acquired in October 2005, An increase of $60 million related to the consolidation of our merchant services activities in the fourth quarter of 2005, and An increase of $23 million in PFPCs distribution/out of pocket expenses, the increase of which was entirely offset in noninterest income and which had no impact on our earnings. Apart from the impact of these items, noninterest expense for 2006 decreased $21 million compared with 2005 as the benefit of the One PNC initiative more than offset the impact of our expansion into the greater Washington, DC area and other investments in the business. EFFECTIVE TAX RATE Our effective tax rate was 34% for 2006 and 30.2% for 2005. The Consolidated Income Statement Review section of this Item 7 outlines the factors that contributed to the 2006 effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for 2005 reflected the benefit in that year of a reversal of deferred tax liabilities in connection with the transfer of our ownership in BlackRock to our intermediate bank holding company. This transaction reduced our first quarter 2005 tax provision by $45 million, or $.16 per diluted share. CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET REVIEW Loans Loans increased $1.0 billion, or 2%, as of December 31, 2006 compared with December 31, 2005. Increases in total commercial lending and consumer loans, driven by targeted sales efforts across our banking businesses, more than offset the decline in residential mortgage loans that resulted primarily from our third quarter 2006 mortgage loan repositioning. Securities Total securities at December 31, 2006 were $23.2 billion compared with $20.7 billion at December 31, 2005. Securities 59 represented 23% of total assets as of both dates. The increase in total securities compared with December 31, 2005 was primarily due to higher balances of mortgage backed and commercial mortgage backed securities, which more than offset the decline in US Treasury and government agencies securities. At December 31, 2006, the securities available for sale balance included a net unrealized loss of $142 million, which represented the difference between fair value and amortized cost. The comparable amount at December 31, 2005 was a net unrealized loss of $370 million. The impact on bond prices of increases in interest rates during 2005 was reflected in the net unrealized loss position at December 31, 2005. The expected weighted average life of securities available for sale was 3 years and 8 months at December 31, 2006 compared with 4 years and 1 month at December 31, 2005. Equity Investments The increase in equity investments from $1.3 billion at December 31, 2005 to $5.3 billion at December 31, 2006 reflected BlackRock reported as an equity investment at December 31, 2006. BlackRocks assets and liabilities were consolidated on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2005. Loans Held For Sale Education loans held for sale totaled $1.3 billion at December 31, 2006, and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2005 and represented the majority of our loans held for sale at each date. Gains on sales of education loans totaled $33 million for 2006 and $19 million for 2005. These gains are reflected in the other noninterest income line item in our Consolidated Income Statement. Asset Quality Nonperforming assets were $171 million at December 31, 2006, a decrease of $44 million from December 31, 2005. Nonperforming loans declined $43 million in the comparison. The ratio of nonperforming assets to total loans and foreclosed assets was .34% at December 31, 2006 compared with .42% at December 31, 2005. The allowance for loan and lease losses was $560 million and represented 1.12% of total loans and 381% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2006. The comparable amounts were $596 million, 1.21% and 314%, respectively, at December 31, 2005. Funding Sources Total funding sources were $81.3 billion at December 31, 2006 and $77.2 billion at December 31, 2005. The $4.1 billion increase in total funding sources was comprised of a $6.0 billion increase in total deposits partially offset by a $1.9 billion decrease in total borrowed funds. The increase in deposits as of December 31, 2006 was driven primarily by the impact of higher money market and certificates of deposit balances. In addition to growth in retail deposit balances, growth in deposits from commercial mortgage loan servicing activities also contributed to the increase compared with the prior year end. The decline in borrowed funds compared with the balance at December 31, 2005 reflected a decrease in federal funds purchased, maturities of $2.0 billion of bank notes and senior debt during 2006, a decline in subordinated debt in connection with our December 2006 redemption of $453 million of Capital Securities, and the deconsolidation of BlackRocks $250 million of convertible debentures. These factors were partially offset by issuances of $1.5 billion of senior debt and $500 million of bank notes in 2006. Shareholders Equity The increase of $2.2 billion in total shareholders equity at December 31, 2006 compared with December 31, 2005 reflected the impact of 2006 net income on retained earnings and an increase in capital surplus in connection with the BlackRock/MLIM transaction. Regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2006 were 9.3% for leverage, 10.4% for tier 1 risk based and 13.5% for total risk based capital. At December 31, 2005, the regulatory capital ratios were 7.2% for leverage, 8.3% for tier 1 risk based and 12.1% for total risk based capital. Glossary of Terms Accounting/administration net fund assets Net domestic and foreign fund investment assets for which we provide accounting and administration services. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Adjusted average total assets Primarily comprised of total average quarterly (or annual) assets plus (less) unrealized losses (gains) on available for sale debt securities, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (net of eligible deferred taxes). Annualized Adjusted to reflect a full year of activity. Assets under management Assets over which we have sole or shared investment authority for our customers/clients. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Basis point One hundredth of a percentage point. Charge off Process of removing a loan or portion of a loan from our balance sheet because it is considered uncollectible. We also record a charge off when a loan is transferred to held for sale by reducing the carrying amount by the allowance for loan losses associated with such loan or if the market value is less than its carrying amount. Common shareholders equity to total assets Common shareholders equity divided by total assets. Common shareholders equity equals total shareholders equity less the liquidation value of preferred stock. 60 Credit derivatives Contractual agreements, primarily credit default swaps, that provide protection against a credit event of one or more referenced credits. The nature of a credit event is established by the protection buyer and protection seller at the inception of a transaction, and such events include bankruptcy, insolvency and failure to meet payment obligations when due. The buyer of the credit derivative pays a periodic fee in return for a payment by the protection seller upon the occurrence, if any, of a credit event. Credit spread The difference in yield between debt issues of similar maturity. The excess of yield attributable to credit spread is often used as a measure of relative creditworthiness, with a reduction in the credit spread reflecting an improvement in the borrowers perceived creditworthiness. Custody assets Investment assets held on behalf of clients under safekeeping arrangements. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Investment assets held in custody at other institutions on our behalf are included in the appropriate asset categories on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as if physically held by us. Derivatives Financial contracts whose value is derived from publicly traded securities, interest rates, currency exchange rates or market indices. Derivatives cover a wide assortment of financial contracts, including forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Duration of equity An estimate of the rate sensitivity of our economic value of equity. A negative duration of equity is associated with asset sensitivity (i.e., positioned for rising interest rates), while a positive value implies liability sensitivity (i.e., positioned for declining interest rates). For example, if the duration of equity is +1.5 years, the economic value of equity declines by 1.5% for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates. Earning assets Assets that generate income, which include: federal funds sold; resale agreements; other short term investments, including trading securities; loans held for sale; loans, net of unearned income; securities; and certain other assets. Economic capital Represents the amount of resources that a business segment should hold to guard against potentially large losses that could cause insolvency. It is based on a measurement of economic risk, as opposed to risk as defined by regulatory bodies. The economic capital measurement process involves converting a risk distribution to the capital that is required to support the risk, consistent with our target credit rating. As such, economic risk serves as a common currency of risk that allows us to compare different risks on a similar basis. Effective duration A measurement, expressed in years, that, when multiplied by a change in interest rates, would approximate the percentage change in value of on and off balance sheet positions. Efficiency Noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income (GAAP basis) and noninterest income. Foreign exchange contracts Contracts that provide for the future receipt and delivery of foreign currency at previously agreed upon terms. Funds transfer pricing A management accounting methodology designed to recognize the net interest income effects of sources and uses of funds provided by the assets and liabilities of a business segment. We assign these balances LIBOR based funding rates at origination that represent the interest cost for us to raise/invest funds with similar maturity and repricing structures. Futures and forward contracts Contracts in which the buyer agrees to purchase and the seller agrees to deliver a specific financial instrument at a predetermined price or yield. May be settled either in cash or by delivery of the underlying financial instrument. GAAP Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Interest rate floors and caps Interest rate protection instruments that involve payment from the protection seller to the protection buyer of an interest differential, which represents the difference between a short term rate (e.g., three month LIBOR) and an agreed upon rate (the strike rate) applied to a notional principal amount. Interest rate swap contracts Contracts that are entered into primarily as an asset/liability management strategy to reduce interest rate risk. Interest rate swap contracts are exchanges of interest rate payments, such as fixed rate payments for floating rate payments, based on notional principal amounts. Intrinsic value The amount by which the fair value of an underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of an option on that stock. Leverage ratio Tier 1 risk based capital divided by adjusted average total assets. Net interest income from loans and deposits A management accounting assessment, using funds transfer pricing methodology, of the net interest contribution from loans and deposits. Net interest margin Annualized taxable equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets. Nondiscretionary assets under administration Assets we hold for our customers/clients in a non discretionary, custodial 61 capacity. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Noninterest income to total revenue Noninterest income divided by the sum of net interest income (GAAP basis) and noninterest income. Nonperforming assets Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructured loans, foreclosed assets and other assets. We do not accrue interest income on assets classified as nonperforming. Nonperforming loans Nonperforming loans include loans to commercial, commercial real estate, equipment lease financing, consumer, and residential mortgage customers as well as troubled debt restructured loans. Nonperforming loans do not include loans held for sale or foreclosed and other assets. We do not accrue interest income on loans classified as nonperforming. Notional amount A number of currency units, shares, or other units specified in a derivatives contract. Operating leverage The period to period percentage change in total revenue (GAAP basis) less the percentage change in noninterest expense. A positive percentage indicates that revenue growth exceeded expense growth (i.e., positive operating leverage) while a negative percentage implies expense growth exceeded revenue growth (i.e., negative operating leverage). Options Contracts that grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right, but not the obligation, to either purchase or sell the associated financial instrument at a set price during a period or at a specified date in the future. Recovery Cash proceeds received on a loan that we had previously charged off. We credit the amount received to the allowance for loan and lease losses. Return on average capital Annualized net income divided by average capital. Return on average assets Annualized net income divided by average assets. Return on average common equity Annualized net income divided by average common shareholders equity. Risk weighted assets Primarily computed by the assignment of specific risk weights (as defined by The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) to assets and off balance sheet instruments. Securitization The process of legally transforming financial assets into securities. Swaptions Contracts that grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right, but not the obligation, to enter into an interest rate swap agreement during a period or at a specified date in the future. Tangible common equity ratio Period end common shareholders equity less goodwill and other intangible assets (net of eligible deferred taxes), and excluding loan servicing rights, divided by period end assets less goodwill and other intangible assets (net of eligible deferred taxes), and excluding loan servicing rights. Taxable equivalent interest The interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of yields and margins for all interest earning assets, we also provide revenue on a taxable equivalent basis by increasing the interest income earned on tax exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on other taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated Income Statement. Tier 1 risk based capital Tier 1 risk based capital equals: total shareholders equity, plus trust preferred capital securities, plus certain minority interests that are held by others; less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (net of eligible deferred taxes), less equity investments in nonfinancial companies and less net unrealized holding losses on available for sale equity securities. Net unrealized holding gains on available for sale equity securities, net unrealized holding gains (losses) on available for sale debt securities and net unrealized holding gains (losses) on cash flow hedge derivatives are excluded from total shareholders equity for Tier 1 risk based capital purposes. Tier 1 risk based capital ratio Tier 1 risk based capital divided by period end risk weighted assets. Total fund assets serviced Total domestic and offshore fund investment assets for which we provide related processing services. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Total return swap A non traditional swap where one party agrees to pay the other the total return of a defined underlying asset (e.g., a loan), usually in return for receiving a stream of LIBOR based cash flows. The total returns of the asset, including interest and any default shortfall, are passed through to the counterparty. The counterparty is therefore assuming the credit and economic risk of the underlying asset. Total risk based capital Tier 1 risk based capital plus qualifying subordinated debt and trust preferred securities, other minority interest not qualified as Tier 1, and the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to certain limitations. Total risk based capital ratio Total risk based capital divided by period end risk weighted assets. 62 Transaction deposits The sum of money market and interest bearing demand deposits and demand and other noninterest bearing deposits. Value at risk (VaR) A statistically based measure of risk which describes the amount of potential loss which may be incurred due to severe and adverse market movements. The measure is of the maximum loss which should not be exceeded on 99 out of 100 days. Yield curve A graph showing the relationship between the yields on financial instruments or market indices of the same credit quality with different maturities. For example, a normal or positive yield curve exists when long term bonds have higher yields than short term bonds. A flat yield curve exists when yields are the same for short term and long term bonds. A steep yield curve exists when yields on long term bonds are significantly higher than on short term bonds. An inverted or negative yield curve exists when short term bonds have higher yields than long term bonds. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION We make statements in this Report, and we may from time to time make other statements, regarding our outlook or expectations for earnings, revenues, expenses and or other matters regarding or affecting PNC that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward looking statements are typically identified by words such as believe, expect, anticipate, intend, outlook, estimate, forecast, will, project and other similar words and expressions. Forward looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. We do not assume any duty and do not undertake to update our forward looking statements. Actual results or future events could differ, possibly materially, from those that we anticipated in our forward looking statements, and future results could differ materially from our historical performance. Our forward looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties. We provide greater detail regarding some of these factors elsewhere in this Report, including in the Risk Factors and Risk Management sections. Our forward looking statements may also be subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those discussed elsewhere in this Report or in our other filings with the SEC. Our businesses and financial results are affected by business and economic conditions, both generally and specifically in the principal markets in which we operate. In particular, our businesses and financial results may be impacted by: Changes in interest rates and valuations in the debt, equity and other financial markets. Disruptions in the liquidity and other functioning of financial markets, including such disruptions in the markets for real estate and other assets commonly securing financial products. Actions by the Federal Reserve and other government agencies, including those that impact money supply and market interest rates. Changes in our customers, suppliers and other counterparties performance in general and their creditworthiness in particular. Changes in customer preferences and behavior, whether as a result of changing business and economic conditions or other factors. A continuation of recent turbulence in significant portions of the global financial markets could impact our performance, both directly by affecting our revenues and the value of our assets and liabilities and indirectly by affecting the economy generally. Given current economic and financial market conditions, our forward looking financial statements are subject to the risk that these conditions will be substantially different than we are currently expecting. These statements are based on our current expectations that interest rates will remain low through most of 2008 and that economic conditions, although showing slower growth than in recent years, will avoid a recession. Our operating results are affected by our liability to provide shares of BlackRock common stock to help fund certain BlackRock long term incentive plan (LTIP) programs, as our LTIP liability is adjusted quarterly (marked to market) based on changes in BlackRocks common stock price and the number of remaining committed shares, and we recognize gain or loss on such shares at such times as shares are transferred for payouts under the LTIP programs. Legal and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses or our financial condition or results of operations or our competitive position or reputation. Reputational impacts, in turn, could affect matters such as business generation and retention, our ability to attract and retain management, liquidity, and funding. These legal and regulatory developments could include: (a) the unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or regulatory and other governmental inquiries; (b) increased litigation risk from recent regulatory and other governmental developments; (c) the results of the regulatory examination process, our failure to satisfy the requirements of agreements with governmental agencies, and regulators future use of supervisory and enforcement tools; (d) legislative and 63 regulatory reforms, including changes to laws and regulations involving tax, pension, education lending, and the protection of confidential customer information; and (e) changes in accounting policies and principles. Our business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where appropriate, through the effective use of third party insurance, derivatives, and capital management techniques. The adequacy of our intellectual property protection, and the extent of any costs associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others, can impact our business and operating results. Our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can have an impact on our ability to respond to customer needs and to meet competitive demands. Our ability to implement our business initiatives and strategies could affect our financial performance over the next several years. Competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention, as well as on our credit spreads and product pricing, which can affect market share, deposits and revenues. Our business and operating results can also be affected by widespread natural disasters, terrorist activities or international hostilities, either as a result of the impact on the economy and capital and other financial markets generally or on us or on our customers, suppliers or other counterparties specifically. Also, risks and uncertainties that could affect the results anticipated in forward looking statements or from historical performance relating to our equity interest in BlackRock, Inc. are discussed in more detail in BlackRocks filings with the SEC, including in the Risk Factors sections of BlackRocks reports. BlackRocks SEC filings are accessible on the SECs website and on or through BlackRocks website at www.blackrock.com. We grow our business from time to time by acquiring other financial services companies, including our pending Sterling Financial Corporation acquisition. Acquisitions in general present us with risks in addition to those presented by the nature of the business acquired. In particular, acquisitions may be substantially more expensive to complete (including as a result of costs incurred in connection with the integration of the acquired company) and the anticipated benefits (including anticipated cost savings and strategic gains) may be significantly harder or take longer to achieve than expected. In some cases, acquisitions involve our entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets, and these situations also present risks resulting from our inexperience in these new areas. As a regulated financial institution, our pursuit of attractive acquisition opportunities could be negatively impacted due to regulatory delays or other regulatory issues. Regulatory and or legal issues related to the pre acquisition operations of an acquired business may cause reputational harm to PNC following the acquisition and integration of the acquired business into ours and may result in additional future costs arising as a result of those issues.
