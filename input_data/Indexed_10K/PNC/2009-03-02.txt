ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC. PNC is one of the largest diversified financial services companies in the United States based on assets and is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. As described further below, on December 31, 2008, PNC acquired National City Corporation (National City), nearly doubling our assets to a total of $291 billion and expanding our total consolidated deposits to $193 billion. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet includes the impact of National City as of December 31, 2008. Prior to the acquisition, PNC had businesses engaged in retail banking, corporate and institutional banking, asset management, and global investment servicing, providing many of its products and services nationally and others in PNCs primary geographic markets located in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Washington, DC, Maryland, Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky and Delaware. PNC also provided certain investment servicing internationally. National Citys primary businesses prior to its acquisition by PNC included commercial and retail banking, mortgage financing and servicing, consumer finance and asset management, operating through an extensive network in Ohio, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. National City also conducted selected consumer lending businesses and other financial services on a nationwide basis. PNC is now in the process of integrating the business and operations of National City with those of PNC. KEY STRATEGIC GOALS We manage our company for the long term and are focused on returning to a moderate risk profile while maintaining strong capital and liquidity positions, investing in our markets and products, and embracing our corporate responsibility to the communities where we do business. Our strategy to enhance shareholder value centers on driving positive operating leverage by achieving growth in revenue from our balance sheet and diverse business mix that exceeds growth in expenses controlled through disciplined cost management. In each of our current business segments, the primary drivers of revenue growth are the acquisition, expansion and retention of customer relationships. We strive to expand our customer base by offering convenient banking options and leading technology solutions, providing a broad range of fee based and credit products and services, focusing on customer service, and through a significantly enhanced branding initiative. We may also grow revenue through appropriate and targeted acquisitions and, in certain businesses, by expanding into new geographical markets. We are focused on our strategies for quality growth. We are committed to returning to a moderate risk profile characterized by disciplined credit management and limited exposure to earnings volatility resulting from interest rate fluctuations and the shape of the interest rate yield curve. Our actions have created a well positioned and strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and investment flexibility to adjust, where appropriate and permissible, to changing interest rates and market conditions. We continue to be disciplined in investing capital in our businesses while returning a portion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases when appropriate and permissible. See the Funding and Capital Sources section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section and the Liquidity Risk Management section of this Financial Review regarding certain restrictions on dividends and common share repurchases resulting from PNCs participation in the US Treasurys Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) Capital Purchase Program and dividend capacity. On March 1, 2009, the Board decided to reduce PNCs quarterly common stock dividend from $0.66 to $0.10 per share. The next dividend is expected to be declared in early April 2009. Our Board recognizes the importance of the dividend to our shareholders. While our overall capital and liquidity positions are strong, extreme economic and market deterioration and the changing regulatory environment drove this difficult but prudent decision. This proactive measure will help us build capital, further strengthen our balance sheet and continue to serve our customers. ACQUISITION OF NATIONAL CITY CORPORATION On December 31, 2008, we acquired National City for approximately $6.1 billion. The total consideration included approximately $5.6 billion of PNC common stock, $150 million of preferred stock, and cash paid to warrant holders by National City. We completed the acquisition primarily by issuing approximately 95 million shares of PNC common stock. In accordance with purchase accounting methodologies, National City Banks balance sheet was adjusted to fair value at which time the bank was under capitalized from a regulatory perspective. However, PNCs Consolidated Balance Sheet remained well capitalized and liquid. Following the closing, PNC received $7.6 billion from the US Department of the Treasury under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 in exchange for the issuance of preferred stock and a warrant. These proceeds were used to enhance National City Banks regulatory capital position to well capitalized in order to continue serving the credit and deposit needs of existing and new customers. On a consolidated basis, these proceeds resulted in further improvement to our capital and liquidity positions.  23 Table of Contents National City, based in Cleveland, Ohio, was one of the nations largest commercial banking organizations based on assets. We expect to incur total merger and integration costs of approximately $1.2 billion in connection with the acquisition of National City, including $575 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008. The transaction is expected to result in the reduction of approximately $1.2 billion of combined company annualized noninterest expense through the elimination of operational and administrative redundancies. Other than the merger and integration costs discussed above, our acquisition of National City did not impact our 2008 Consolidated Income Statement, nor did it impact our 2008 Average Consolidated Balance Sheet. Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures included in our Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements within Item 8 of this Report and our Current Reports on Form 8 K filed October 24, 2008, October 30, 2008, December 23, 2008, and January 2, 2009 provide additional information regarding our acquisition of National City. RECENT MARKET AND INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENTS Starting in the middle of 2007 and with a heightened level of activity during the second half of 2008 and into early 2009, there has been unprecedented turmoil, volatility and illiquidity in worldwide financial markets, accompanied by uncertain prospects for the overall national economy, which is currently in the midst of a severe recession. In addition, there have been dramatic changes in the competitive landscape of the financial services industry during this time. Recent efforts by the Federal government, including the US Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, to stabilize and restore confidence in the financial services industry have impacted and will likely continue to impact PNC and our stakeholders. These efforts, which will continue to evolve, include the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and other legislative, administrative and regulatory initiatives, including the US Treasurys TARP and TARP Capital Purchase Program, the FDICs Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) and the Federal Reserves Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF). Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, PNC participated in several of these programs as further described below: TARP CAPITAL PURCHASE PROGRAM The TARP Capital Purchase Program encourages US financial institutions to build capital through the sale to the US Treasury of senior preferred shares of stock to increase the flow of financing to US businesses and consumers and to support the US economy. On December 31, 2008, PNC issued to the US Treasury $7.6 billion of preferred stock together with a related warrant to purchase shares of common stock of PNC, in accordance with the terms of the TARP Capital Purchase Program. Funds from this sale count as Tier 1 capital and the warrant qualifies as tangible common equity. Holders of this preferred stock are entitled to a cumulative cash dividend at the annual rate per share of 5% of the liquidation preference per year for the first five years after the closing date. Afterward, the annual dividend rate will increase, to 9% per year. PNCs intent is to redeem this preferred stock prior to the escalation of the dividend rate. Note 19 Shareholders Equity included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements within Item 8 of this Report includes additional information regarding the preferred stock and the related warrant that we issued under this program. FDIC TEMPORARY LIQUIDITY GUARANTEE PROGRAM The FDICs TLGP is designed to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by: Guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of eligible institutions, including FDIC insured banks and thrifts, as well as certain holding companies (TLGP Debt Guarantee Program), and Providing full deposit insurance coverage for non interest bearing transaction accounts in FDIC insured institutions, regardless of the dollar amount (TLGP Transaction Account Guarantee Program). In December 2008, PNC Funding Corp issued at the holding company level fixed and floating rate senior notes totaling $2.9 billion under the FDICs TLGP Debt Guarantee Program as more fully described within the Liquidity Risk Management section of this Item 7. Each of these series of senior notes is guaranteed by the FDIC and is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States through June 30, 2012. As of October 14, 2008, PNC Bank, N.A. and National City Bank have been participating in the TLGP Transaction Account Guarantee Program. Under this program, through December 31, 2009, all non interest bearing transaction accounts are fully guaranteed by the FDIC for the entire amount in the account. Coverage under this program is in addition to, and separate from, the coverage available under the FDICs general deposit insurance rules. COMMERCIAL PAPER FUNDING FACILITY The Federal Reserve established the CPFF to provide a liquidity backstop to US issuers of commercial paper and thereby improve liquidity in short term funding markets and thus increase the availability of credit for businesses and households. Effective October 28, 2008, Market Street Funding LLC (Market Street) was approved to participate in the Federal Reserves CPFF. The CPFF commitment to purchase up to $5.4 billion of three month Market Street commercial paper expires on October 30, 2009. As of December 31, 2008, Market Streets participation in this 24 Table of Contents program totaled $445 million. These trades matured at the end of January 2009 and were replaced with commercial paper sold to investors. **** It is also possible that the US Congress and federal banking agencies, as part of their efforts to provide economic stimulus and financial market stability, to enhance the liquidity and solvency of financial institutions and markets, and to enhance the regulation of financial institutions and markets, will announce additional legislation, regulations or programs. These additional actions may take the form of changes in or additions to the statutes or regulations related to existing programs, including those described above. It is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate impact of these actions on PNCs business plans and strategies. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE Our financial performance is substantially affected by several external factors outside of our control including the following, some of which may be affected by legislative, regulatory and administrative initiatives of the Federal government outlined above: General economic conditions, including the length and severity of the current recession, The level of, and direction, timing and magnitude of movement in interest rates, and the shape of the interest rate yield curve, The functioning and other performance of, and availability of liquidity in, the capital and other financial markets, Loan demand, utilization of credit commitments and standby letters of credit, and asset quality, Customer demand for other products and services, Changes in the competitive landscape and in counterparty creditworthiness and performance as the financial services industry restructures in the current environment, Movement of customer deposits from lower to higher rate accounts or to investment alternatives, and The impact of market credit spreads on asset valuations. In addition, our success will depend, among other things, upon: Further success in the acquisition, growth and retention of customers, Progress toward integrating the National City acquisition, Continued development of the markets related to our recent acquisitions, including full deployment of our product offerings, Revenue growth, A sustained focus on expense management, including achieving our cost savings targets associated with our National City integration, and creating positive operating leverage, Managing the distressed assets portfolio, Maintaining solid overall asset quality, Continuing to maintain our solid deposit base, Prudent risk and capital management leading to a return to our desired moderate risk profile, and Actions we take within the capital and other financial markets.

OTHER 2008 ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURE ACTIVITY On April 4, 2008, we acquired Lancaster, Pennsylvania based Sterling Financial Corporation (Sterling) for approximately 4.6 million shares of PNC common stock and $224 million in cash. Sterling was a banking and financial services company with approximately $3.2 billion in assets, $2.7 billion in deposits, and 65 branches in south central Pennsylvania, northern Maryland and northern Delaware. The Sterling technology systems and bank charter conversions were completed during the third quarter of 2008 and we realized the anticipated cost savings related to these activities. On March 31, 2008, we sold J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons, LLC (Hilliard Lyons), a Louisville, Kentucky based wholly owned subsidiary of PNC and a full service brokerage and financial services provider, to Houchens Industries, Inc. We recognized an after tax gain of $23 million in the first quarter of 2008 in connection with this divestiture. Business segment information for the periods presented in this Item 7 reflects the reclassification of results for Hilliard Lyons, including the gain on the sale of this business, from the Retail Banking business segment to Other. Summary Financial Results Year ended December 31 In millions, except per share data 2008 2007 Net income $ 882 $ 1,467 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.46 $ 4.35 Return on Average common shareholders equity 6.28 % 10.53 % Average assets .62 % 1.19 % Our earnings and related per share amounts for 2008 do not include the impact of National City, which we acquired effective December 31, 2008, other than a conforming adjustment to our provision for credit losses of $504 million and other integration costs of $71 million, both of which were recognized in the fourth quarter. Our performance in 2008 included the following: At December 31, 2008 we had total assets of $291 billion, including loans of $175 billion, and total deposits of $193 billion, reflecting the acquisition of National City. We significantly strengthened capital. The Tier 1 risk based capital ratio was 9.7% at December 31, 25 Table of Contents 2008 compared with 6.8% at December 31, 2007. We issued $7.6 billion of preferred stock and a common stock warrant to the US Department of the Treasury under the TARP Capital Purchase Program on December 31, 2008, which qualified as Tier 1 capital. Our tangible common equity ratio was 2.9% at December 31, 2008. We expect our tangible common equity ratio to be less sensitive to the impact of widening credit spreads on accumulated other comprehensive loss going forward primarily due to the composition of the securities available for sale portfolio acquired from National City and a substantially higher level of tangible common equity in the combined company. We maintained a strong liquidity position and continued to generate deposits. The loan to deposit ratio was 91% at December 31, 2008, reflecting the acquisition of National City. Average deposits for 2008 increased 10% compared with 2007. Credit quality migration reflected a rapidly weakening economy, but remained manageable as PNC was able to maintain a strong capital position and generate positive operating leverage. The allowance for loan and lease losses increased to $3.9 billion at December 31, 2008 from $830 million at December 31, 2007 primarily as a result of the National City acquisition and related conforming credit adjustment. The ratio of allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans was strengthened to 2.23% at December 31, 2008 compared with 1.21% at December 31, 2007. This ratio excluding the impact of the National City acquisition was 1.77% at December 31, 2008. We provide a reconciliation of this ratio excluding the National City impact to the GAAP basis ratio in the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section in Item 8 of this Report. Average loans for 2008 increased 16% over 2007. We are committed to supporting the objectives of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. To that end, we are continuing to make credit available to qualified borrowers including enhanced calling efforts on small businesses and corporations, promotions offered with special financing rates and responding to increased loan demand for first mortgages. We have reaffirmed and renewed loans and lines of credit, focused on early identification of loan modification candidates and are working closely where appropriate with customers who are experiencing financial hardship to set up new repayment schedules, loan modifications and forbearance programs. We plan to enhance these efforts over time to improve the effectiveness of our broad reaching initiatives. Investment securities were $43.5 billion at December 31, 2008, or 15% of total assets. The portfolio was primarily comprised of well diversified, high quality securities with US government agency residential mortgage backed securities representing 53% of the portfolio. Of the remaining portfolio, approximately 80% of the securities had AAA equivalent ratings. PNC created positive operating leverage for the year of 4%, or $351 million. Total revenue for 2008 grew 7% compared with 2007, driven by growth in net interest income, and exceeded year over year noninterest expense growth of 3%. With the acquisition of National City, our retail banks now serve over 6 million consumer and business customers. Comprehensive two year integration plans are being implemented with a goal of eliminating $1.2 billion of annualized expenses, including the reduction of approximately 5,800 positions across the combined 59,595 employee base by 2011. The first regional branch conversion is planned for the second half of 2009. Our Consolidated Income Statement Review section of this Item 7 describes in greater detail the various items that impacted our results for 2008 and 2007. BALANCE SHEET HIGHLIGHTS Total assets were $291.1 billion at December 31, 2008 compared with $138.9 billion at December 31, 2007. Total assets at December 31, 2008 included $133.7 billion related to National City. Our acquisition of National City did not impact our 2008 Average Consolidated Balance Sheet. Total average assets were $142.0 billion for 2008 compared with $123.4 billion for 2007. This increase reflected a $16.5 billion increase in average interest earning assets and a $2.1 billion increase in average noninterest earning assets. An increase of $10.2 billion in loans and a $6.2 billion increase in investment securities were the primary factors for the increase in average interest earning assets. The increase in average noninterest earning assets for 2008 reflected an increase in average goodwill of $1.6 billion primarily related to the acquisition of Sterling on April 4, 2008, Yardville National Bancorp (Yardville) on October 26, 2007 and Mercantile Bankshares Corporation (Mercantile) on March 2, 2007. The impact of the Sterling, Yardville and Mercantile acquisitions is also reflected in our year over year increases in average total loans, average securities available for sale and average total deposits as described further below. Average total loans were $72.7 billion for 2008 and $62.5 billion for 2007. The increase in average total loans included growth in commercial loans of $5.5 billion, consumer loans of $2.8 billion, commercial real estate loans of $1.7 billion and residential mortgage loans of $.5 billion. Loans represented 64% of average interest earning assets for both 2008 and 2007. 26 Table of Contents Average investment securities totaled $32.7 billion for 2008 and $26.5 billion for 2007. Average residential and commercial mortgage backed securities increased $4.5 billion on a combined basis in the comparison. Average investment securities for 2008 included $.4 billion of held to maturity securities that we transferred from available for sale status during the fourth quarter of 2008. Investment securities comprised 29% of average interest earning assets for 2008 and 27% for 2007. Average total deposits were $84.5 billion for 2008, an increase of $7.7 billion over 2007. Average deposits grew from the prior year period primarily as a result of increases in money market balances and other time deposits. Average total deposits represented 60% of average total assets for 2008 and 62% for 2007. Average transaction deposits were $55.7 billion for 2008 compared with $50.7 billion for 2007. Average borrowed funds were $31.3 billion for 2008 and $23.0 billion for 2007. Increases of $7.1 billion in Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings and $1.4 billion in other borrowed funds drove the increase compared with 2007. Shareholders equity totaled $25.4 billion at December 31, 2008 compared with $14.9 billion at December 31, 2007 and reflected the issuance of securities under the TARP Capital Purchase Program and the impact of National City. See the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Item 7 for additional information. LINE OF BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS We refer you to Item 1 of this Report under the captions Business Overview and Review of Lines of Business for an overview of our business segments and to the Business Segments Review section of this Item 7 for a Results Of Businesses Summary table and further analysis of business segment results for 2008 and 2007, including presentation differences from Note 27 Segment Reporting in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. Total business segment earnings were $983 million for 2008 and $1.7 billion for 2007. We provide a reconciliation of total business segment earnings to total PNC consolidated net income as reported on a GAAP basis in Note 27. Retail Banking Retail Bankings earnings were $429 million for 2008 compared with $876 million for 2007. The decline in earnings over the prior year was primarily driven by increases in the provision for credit losses and noninterest expense. The 2008 revenue growth was negatively impacted by a lower interest credit attributed to deposits in the declining rate environment and was therefore not reflective of the solid growth in customers and deposits. Corporate & Institutional Banking Corporate & Institutional Banking earned $225 million in 2008 compared with $432 million in 2007. The 48% decline in earnings over 2007 was primarily driven by an increase in the provision for credit losses and by higher valuation losses on commercial mortgage loans held for sale, net of hedges. BlackRock Our BlackRock business segment earned $207 million in 2008 and $253 million in 2007. These results reflect our approximately 33% share of BlackRocks reported GAAP earnings during both periods and the additional income taxes on these earnings incurred by PNC. Global Investment Servicing Global Investment Servicing earned $122 million for 2008 and $128 million for 2007. Results for 2008 were negatively impacted by declines in asset values and fund redemptions as a result of severe deterioration of the financial markets during the fourth quarter. Other Other incurred a loss of $101 million in 2008 and a loss of $222 million in 2007. Other for 2008 included the impact of integration costs, including the National City conforming provision for credit losses, totaling $422 million after taxes, of which $380 million after taxes were recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, net securities losses in 2008 totaled $134 million after taxes. These factors were partially offset by strong growth in net interest income related to asset and liability management activities in 2008, and the after tax impact of the following: After tax gains totaling $160 million from PNCs remaining BlackRock long term incentive plan programs (LTIP) shares obligation, The $23 million after tax gain on the sale of Hilliard Lyons in the first quarter, The $40 million after tax third quarter reversal of a legal contingency reserve established in connection with an acquisition due to a settlement, and The $30 million after tax partial reversal of the Visa indemnification liability. Other for 2007 included the after tax impact of the following: Integration costs totaling $99 million after taxes, A net after tax charge of $83 million representing the net mark to market adjustment on our remaining BlackRock LTIP shares obligation partially offset by the gain recognized in connection with PNCs first quarter transfer of BlackRock shares to satisfy a portion of our BlackRock LTIP shares obligation, and A $53 million after tax charge for an indemnification obligation related to certain Visa litigation. 27 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW Our Consolidated Income Statement is presented in Item 8 of this Report. Net income for 2008 was $882 million and for 2007 was $1.467 billion. Total revenue for 2008 increased 7% compared with 2007. We created positive operating leverage in the year to date comparison as total noninterest expense increased 3% in the comparison. NET INTEREST INCOME AND NET INTEREST MARGIN Year ended December 31 Dollars in millions 2008 2007 Net interest income $ 3,823 $ 2,915 Net interest margin 3.37 % 3.00 % Changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest earning assets and related yields, interest bearing liabilities and related rates paid, and noninterest bearing sources of funding. See Statistical Information Analysis Of Year To Year Changes In Net Interest (Unaudited) Income And Average Consolidated Balance Sheet and Net Interest Analysis in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. The 31% increase in net interest income for 2008 compared with 2007 was favorably impacted by the $16.5 billion, or 17%, increase in average interest earning assets and a decrease in funding costs. The 2008 net interest margin was positively affected by declining rates paid on deposits and borrowings compared with the prior year. The reasons driving the higher interest earning assets in these comparisons are further discussed in the Balance Sheet Highlights portion of the Executive Summary section of this Item 7. The net interest margin was 3.37% for 2008 and 3.00% for 2007. The following factors impacted the comparison: A decrease in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities of 140 basis points. The rate paid on interest bearing deposits, the single largest component, decreased 123 basis points. These factors were partially offset by a 77 basis point decrease in the yield on interest earning assets. The yield on loans, the single largest component, decreased 109 basis points. In addition, the impact of noninterest bearing sources of funding decreased 26 basis points due to lower interest rates and a lower proportion of noninterest bearing sources of funding to interest earning assets. For comparing to the broader market, during 2008 the average federal funds rate was 1.94% compared with 5.03% for 2007. We expect our full year 2009 net interest income to benefit from the impact of interest accretion of discounts resulting from purchase accounting marks and deposit pricing alignment related to our National City acquisition. We also currently expect our 2009 net interest margin to improve on a year over year basis. NONINTEREST INCOME Summary Noninterest income was $3.367 billion for 2008 and $3.790 billion for 2007. Noninterest income for 2008 included the following: Gains of $246 million related to the mark to market adjustment on our BlackRock LTIP shares obligation, Losses related to our commercial mortgage loans held for sale of $197 million, net of hedges, Impairment and other losses related to alternative investments of $179 million, Income from Hilliard Lyons totaling $164 million, including the first quarter gain of $114 million from the sale of this business, Net securities losses of $206 million, A first quarter gain of $95 million related to the redemption of a portion of our Visa Class B common shares related to Visas March 2008 initial public offering, A third quarter $61 million reversal of a legal contingency reserve established in connection with an acquisition due to a settlement, Trading losses of $55 million, A $35 million impairment charge on commercial mortgage servicing rights, and Equity management losses of $24 million. Noninterest income for 2007 included the following: The impact of $82 million gain recognized in connection with our transfer of BlackRock shares to satisfy a portion of PNCs LTIP obligation and a $209 million net loss on our LTIP shares obligation, Income from Hilliard Lyons totaling $227 million, Trading income of $104 million, Equity management gains of $102 million, and Gains related to our commercial mortgage loans held for sale of $3 million, net of hedges. Apart from the impact of these items, noninterest income increased $16 million in 2008 compared with 2007. Additional analysis Fund servicing fees increased $69 million in 2008, to $904 million, compared with $835 million in 2007. The impact of the December 2007 acquisition of Albridge Solutions Inc. (Albridge Solutions) and growth in Global Investment Servicings offshore operations were the primary drivers of this increase. Global Investment Servicing provided fund accounting/ administration services for $839 billion of net fund investment assets and provided custody services for $379 billion of fund 28 Table of Contents investment assets at December 31, 2008, compared with $990 billion and $500 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2007. The decrease in assets serviced was due to declines in asset values and fund outflows resulting primarily from market conditions in the second half of 2008. Asset management fees totaled $686 million in 2008, a decline of $98 million compared with 2007. The effect on fees of lower equity earnings from BlackRock, a $12 billion decrease in assets managed due to equity values related to wealth management, and the Hilliard Lyons divestiture were reflected in the decline compared with 2007. Excluding $53 billion of assets acquired on December 31, 2008 resulting from our acquisition of National City, assets managed at December 31, 2008 totaled $57 billion compared with $74 billion at December 31, 2007. The Hilliard Lyons sale and the impact of comparatively lower equity markets in 2008 drove the decline in assets managed. The Retail Banking section of the Business Segments Review section of this Item 7 includes further discussion of assets under management. Consumer services fees declined $69 million, to $623 million, for 2008 compared with 2007. The sale of Hilliard Lyons more than offset the benefits of increased volume related fees, including debit card, credit card, bank brokerage and merchant revenues. Corporate services revenue totaled $704 million in 2008 compared with $713 million in 2007. Higher revenue from treasury management and other fees were more than offset by lower merger and acquisition advisory fees and commercial mortgage servicing fees, net of amortization. Service charges on deposits grew $24 million, to $372 million, in 2008 compared with 2007. The impact of our expansion into new markets contributed to the increase during 2008. Net securities losses totaled $206 million in 2008 compared with net securities losses of $5 million in 2007. Losses for 2008 included other than temporary impairment charges of $312 million, including $74 million on our investment in preferred stock of FHLMC and FNMA that were partially offset by securities gains. Other noninterest income totaled $284 million for 2008 compared with $423 million for 2007. Other noninterest income for 2008 included gains of $246 million related to our BlackRock LTIP shares adjustment, the $114 million gain from the sale of Hilliard Lyons, the $95 million gain from the redemption of a portion of our investment in Visa related to its March 2008 initial public offering, and the $61 million reversal of a legal contingency reserve referred to above. The impact of these items was partially offset by losses related to our commercial mortgage loans held for sale of $197 million, net of hedges, trading losses of $55 million and equity management losses of $24 million. Other noninterest income for 2007 included a net loss related to our BlackRock investment of $127 million (the net of the two items described within the Summary section above), trading income of $104 million, equity management gains of $102 million and gains related to our commercial mortgage loans held for sale, net of hedges, of $3 million. See the BlackRock portion of the Business Segments Review section of Item 7 of this Report for further information regarding LTIP. Additional information regarding our transactions related to Visa is included in Note 25 Commitments And Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Further details regarding our trading activities are included in the Market Risk Management Trading Risk portion of the Risk Management section of this Item 7 and information regarding equity management are included in the Market Risk Management Equity and Other Investment Risk section. Other noninterest income typically fluctuates from period to period depending on the nature and magnitude of transactions completed. We expect noninterest income in 2009 to reflect customer growth, offset by softening consumer fees and by ongoing volatility of the more market related categories. PRODUCT REVENUE In addition to credit and deposit products for commercial customers, Corporate & Institutional Banking offers other services, including treasury management and capital markets related products and services and commercial mortgage loan servicing, that are marketed by several businesses to commercial and retail customers across PNC. Treasury management revenue, which includes fees as well as net interest income from customer deposit balances, increased 14% to $545 million in 2008 compared with $476 million in 2007. The increase was primarily related to the impact of our expansion into new markets and strong growth in commercial payment card services and in cash and liquidity management products. Revenue from capital markets related products and services totaled $336 million in 2008 compared with $290 million in 2007. This increase was primarily driven by strong customer interest rate derivative and foreign exchange activity partially offset by a decline in merger and acquisition advisory fees. Commercial mortgage banking activities include revenue derived from loan originations, commercial mortgage servicing (including net interest income and noninterest income from loan servicing and ancillary services), gains from loan sales, valuation adjustments, net interest income on loans held for sale, and related commitments and hedges. 29 Table of Contents Commercial mortgage banking activities resulted in revenue of $65 million in 2008 compared with $252 million in 2007. Revenue for 2008 reflected losses of $197 million on commercial mortgage loans held for sale, net of hedges, due to the impact of an illiquid market during most of 2008. The comparable amount for 2007 was a gain of $3 million. Revenue for 2007 also reflected significant securitization activity. In addition, commercial mortgage servicing revenue declined $53 million primarily due to a $35 million impairment charge on commercial mortgage servicing rights while net interest income from commercial mortgage loans held for sale increased $61 million in 2008 compared with 2007 due to higher loans held for sale balances. PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES The provision for credit losses totaled $1.517 billion for 2008 compared with $315 million for 2007. Of the total 2008 provision, $990 million was recorded in the fourth quarter, including $504 million of additional provision recorded on December 31, 2008 to conform the National City loan reserving methodology with ours. The differences in methodology include granularity of loss computations, statistical and quantitative factors rather than qualitative assessment, and the extent of current appraisals and risk assessments. In addition to the impact of National City, the higher provision in 2008 compared with the prior year was driven by general credit quality migration, including residential real estate development and commercial real estate exposure, an increase in net charge offs, and growth in nonperforming loans. Growth in our total credit exposure also contributed to the higher provision amounts in both comparisons. With a deteriorating economy, we expect credit migration will continue throughout 2009 as credit quality improvements will lag any economic turnaround. The Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Item 7 includes additional information regarding factors impacting the provision for credit losses. See also Item 1A Risk Factors and the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information section of Item 7 of this Report. NONINTEREST EXPENSE Total noninterest expense was $4.430 billion for 2008 and $4.296 billion for 2007, an increase of $134 million, or 3%. Higher noninterest expense in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily resulted from investments in growth initiatives, including acquisitions, partially offset by the impact of the sale of Hilliard Lyons and disciplined expense management. Integration costs included in noninterest expense totaled $122 million for 2008, including $81 million in the fourth quarter, and $102 million for 2007. Integration costs for the fourth quarter of 2008 included $71 million related to our National City acquisition. Noninterest expense for 2008 included the benefit of the reversal of $46 million of the $82 million Visa indemnification liability that we established in the fourth quarter of 2007. Additional information regarding our transactions related to Visa is included in Note 25 Commitments And Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Expense management will be a key driver in 2009 as we intend to maintain our focus on continuous improvement and to achieve cost savings targets associated with our National City integration. We currently expect FDIC deposit insurance costs to increase significantly in 2009. EFFECTIVE TAX RATE Our effective tax rate was 29.1% for 2008 and 29.9% for 2007. 30 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET REVIEW SUMMARIZED BALANCE SHEET DATA December 31 in millions 2008 2007 Assets Loans $ 175,489 $ 68,319 Investment securities 43,473 30,225 Cash and short term investments 23,936 10,425 Loans held for sale 4,366 3,927 Equity investments 8,554 6,045 Goodwill 8,868 8,405 Other intangible assets 2,820 1,146 Other 23,575 10,428 Total assets $ 291,081 $ 138,920 Liabilities Deposits $ 192,865 $ 82,696 Borrowed funds 52,240 30,931 Other 18,328 8,785 Total liabilities 263,433 122,412 Minority and noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities 2,226 1,654 Total shareholders equity 25,422 14,854 Total liabilities, minority and noncontrolling interests, and shareholders equity $ 291,081 $ 138,920 The summarized balance sheet data above is based upon our Consolidated Balance Sheet in Item 8 of this Report. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2008 included National Citys assets and liabilities at estimated fair value as of that date. This acquisition added approximately $134 billion of assets, including $99.7 billion of loans, after giving effect to purchase accounting adjustments, eliminations and reclassifications. Various seasonal and other factors impact our period end balances whereas average balances (discussed under the Balance Sheet Highlights section of this Item 7 and included in the Statistical Information section of Item 8 of this Report) are generally more indicative of underlying business trends apart from the impact of recent acquisitions. An analysis of changes in selected balance sheet categories follows. LOANS A summary of the major categories of loans outstanding is shown in the following table. Outstanding loan balances reflect unearned income, unamortized discount and premium, and purchase discounts and premiums totaling $4.1 billion and $990 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Loans increased $107.2 billion as of December 31, 2008 compared with December 31, 2007. Our National City acquisition added $99.7 billion of loans, including $34.3 billion of commercial, $16.0 billion of commercial real estate, $30.5 billion of consumer and $10.6 billion of residential mortgage loans. In February 2008, we transferred the education loans in our held for sale portfolio to the loan portfolio as further described in the Loans Held For Sale section of this Consolidated Balance Sheet Review.

Our loan portfolio continued to be diversified among numerous industries and types of businesses. The loans that we hold are also concentrated in, and diversified across, our principal geographic markets.

Our home equity loan outstandings totaled $38.3 billion at December 31, 2008. In this portfolio, we consider the higher risk loans to be those with a recent FICO credit score of less than or equal to 660 and a loan to value ratio greater than or equal to 90%. We had $1.2 billion or approximately 3% of the total portfolio in this grouping at December 31, 2008. In our $18.8 billion residential mortgage portfolio, loans with a recent FICO credit score of less than or equal to 660 and a loan to value ratio greater than 90% totaled $2.5 billion and comprised approximately 14% of this portfolio at December 31, 2008. Commercial lending outstandings are the largest category and are the most sensitive to changes in assumptions and judgments underlying the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses. We have allocated $2.6 billion, or 67%, of the total allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2008 to these loans. We allocated $1.2 billion, or 32%, of the remaining allowance at that date to consumer lending outstandings and $47 million, or 1%, to all other loans. This allocation also considers other relevant factors such as: Actual versus estimated losses, Regional and national economic conditions, Business segment and portfolio concentrations, Industry conditions, The impact of government regulations, and Risk of potential estimation or judgmental errors, including the accuracy of risk ratings. 32 Table of Contents Included in total loans at December 31, 2008 were $27.2 billion of distressed loans. These loans include residential real estate development loans, cross border leases, subprime residential mortgage loans, brokered home equity loans and certain other residential real estate loans. These loans require special servicing and management oversight given current market conditions or, in the case of cross border leases, are tax and yield challenged. The majority of the distressed loans were from acquisitions, including $24.6 billion from National City. An allowance for loan and lease losses of $927 million was allocated to the distressed loans at December 31, 2008. A total of $537 million of the distressed loans were classified as nonperforming at that date. Details of distressed loans follow: Details of Distressed Loan Portfolio In millions Dec. 31, 2008 Commercial $28 Commercial real estate Real estate projects 2,847 Commercial mortgage 510 Total commercial real estate 3,357 Equipment lease financing 858 TOTAL COMMERCIAL LENDING 4,243 Consumer Home equity Lines of credit 5,474 Installment 2,877 Total home equity 8,351 Residential real estate Residential mortgage 10,198 Residential construction 2,603 Total residential real estate 12,801 TOTAL CONSUMER LENDING 21,152 Other 1,761 Total (a) $ 27,156 (a) Includes impaired loans attributable to National City totaling $10.3 billion, net of valuation adjustments. The pre adjusted principal balance was $15.3 billion and represented the majority of the total $19.3 billion principal balance of total impaired loans included in the National City Loan Portfolio Assessment table on page 32. Net unfunded credit commitments are comprised of the following: Net Unfunded Credit Commitments December 31 in millions 2008 (a) 2007 Commercial and commercial real estate $ 59,982 $ 42,021 Home equity lines of credit 23,195 8,680 Consumer credit card lines 19,028 969 Other 2,683 1,677 Total $ 104,888 $ 53,347 (a) Includes $53.9 billion related to National City. Unfunded commitments are concentrated in our primary geographic markets. Commitments to extend credit represent arrangements to lend funds or provide liquidity subject to specified contractual conditions. Commercial commitments are reported net of participations, assignments and syndications, primarily to financial institutions, totaling $8.6 billion at December 31, 2008 and $8.9 billion at December 31, 2007. Unfunded liquidity facility commitments and standby bond purchase agreements totaled $7.0 billion at December 31, 2008 and $9.4 billion at December 31, 2007 and are included in the preceding table primarily within the Commercial and Consumer categories. The decrease from December 31, 2007 was due to a $2.5 billion decline in Market Street commitments. In addition to credit commitments, our net outstanding standby letters of credit totaled $10.3 billion at December 31, 2008 and $4.8 billion at December 31, 2007. Standby letters of credit commit us to make payments on behalf of our customers if specified future events occur.

Securities represented 15% of total assets at December 31, 2008 and 22% of total assets at December 31, 2007. We evaluate our portfolio of investment securities in light of changing market conditions and other factors and, where appropriate, take steps intended to improve our overall positioning. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we transferred $3.2 billion of securities available for sale to securities held to maturity status and transferred $599 million of proprietary trading securities to the available for sale portfolio. The transfer of available for sale securities to held to maturity involved short duration, high quality securities where managements intent to hold changed. In reassessing the classification of these securities, management also considered the current and ongoing illiquidity in the capital markets and that securities prices are under increasing downward pressure, even where there is no indication of credit impairment. The transfer of trading securities to available for sale occurred against the backdrop of events occurring in the market that management determined to be unusual and highly unlikely to recur in the near term. As a result of these events, which included the unprecedented market illiquidity and related volatility, PNCs economic hedges associated with these trading positions become increasingly ineffective, resulting in increasing and unexpected earnings volatility. Coincident with the transfer of trading securities to available for sale, all hedging instruments were terminated. At December 31, 2008, the investment securities balance included a net unrealized loss of $5.4 billion, which represented the difference between fair value and amortized cost. The comparable amount at December 31, 2007 was a net unrealized loss of $265 million. The fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, and market volatility and illiquidity. We believe that a substantial portion of the decline in value of these securities is attributable to changes in market credit spreads and market illiquidity and not from deterioration in the credit quality of individual securities or underlying collateral, where applicable. The net unrealized losses at December 31, 2008 did not reflect credit quality concerns of any significance with the underlying assets, which represented an overall well diversified, high quality portfolio. US government agency residential mortgage backed securities represented 53% of the investment securities portfolio at December 31, 2008. During 2008, we recorded other than temporary impairment charges totaling $312 million, of which $151 million related to residential mortgage backed securities, $87 million related to asset backed securities collateralized by first and second lien residential mortgage loans and $74 million related to our investment in preferred securities of FHLMC and FNMA. At least quarterly we conduct a comprehensive security level impairment assessment. Our process and methods have evolved as market conditions have deteriorated and as more research and other analyses have become available. We expect that our process and methods will continue to evolve. Our assessment considers the security structure, recent security collateral performance metrics, our judgment and expectations of future performance, and relevant industry research and analysis. We also consider the magnitude of the impairment and the amount of time that the security has been impaired in our assessment. Results of the periodic assessment are reviewed by a cross functional senior management team representing Asset & Liability Management, Finance, Balance Sheet Risk Management, and Credit Policy. The senior management team considers the results of the assessments, as well as other factors, in determining whether the impairment is other than temporary. One of the key inputs into our impairment assessment process is the level of delinquencies (i.e., 60 days and more) for any given security. In February 2009, we received updated delinquency information through January 31, 2009 for our residential mortgage backed and asset backed securities positions collateralized by first and second lien residential mortgage loans. Delinquencies have generally increased in the January 2009 versus December 2008 month over month comparison and, based upon our evaluation of these updated delinquency statistics, we currently expect that we will record additional other than temporary impairment charges in the first quarter of 2009. We currently do not expect that these charges will be material to our capital position. If the current issues affecting the US housing market were to continue for the foreseeable future or worsen, or if market volatility and illiquidity were to continue or worsen, or if market interest rates were to increase appreciably, the valuation of our available for sale securities portfolio could continue to be adversely affected. See Note 7 Investment Securities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. Net unrealized gains and losses in the securities available for sale portfolio are included in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax. The fair value of investment securities generally decreases when interest rates increase and vice versa. In addition, the fair value generally decreases when credit spreads widen and vice versa. The expected weighted average life of investment securities (excluding corporate stocks and other) was 3 years and 1 month at December 31, 2008 and 3 years and 6 months at December 31, 2007. We estimate that at December 31, 2008 the effective duration of investment securities was 3.7 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel increase in interest rates and 3.1 years for 34 Table of Contents an immediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in interest rates. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2007 were 2.8 years and 2.5 years, respectively. Loans Held For Sale December 31 in millions 2008 2007 Commercial mortgage $ 2,158 $ 2,116 Residential mortgage 1,962 117 Education 1,525 Other 246 169 Total $ 4,366 $ 3,927 The acquisition of National City added approximately $2.2 billion of loans held for sale, primarily 1 4 family conforming residential mortgages. The residential mortgage loans held for sale will be accounted for at fair value. PNC adopted SFAS 159 beginning January 1, 2008 and elected to account for certain commercial mortgage loans held for sale at fair value. The balance of these assets was $1.4 billion at December 31, 2008. We stopped originating these types of loans during the first quarter of 2008. We intend to continue pursuing opportunities to reduce our commercial mortgage loans held for sale position at appropriate prices. We sold and or securitized $.6 billion of commercial mortgage loans held for sale carried at fair value in 2008. Losses of $197 million on commercial mortgage loans held for sale, net of hedges, were included in other noninterest income for 2008 compared with gains of $3 million in 2007. Net interest income on commercial mortgage loans held for sale was $76 million in 2008 compared with $15 million in 2007. The non cash losses reflected illiquid market conditions which began in the latter part of 2007. We previously classified substantially all of our education loans as loans held for sale as we sold education loans to issuers of asset backed paper when the loans were placed into repayment status. During 2008, the secondary markets for education loans have been impacted by liquidity issues similar to those for other asset classes. In February 2008, given this outlook and the economic and customer relationship value inherent in this product, we transferred these loans at lower of cost or market value from held for sale to the loan portfolio. We did not sell education loans during the remainder of 2008 and do not anticipate sales of these transferred loans in the foreseeable future.

Deposits totaled $192.9 billion at December 31, 2008, including $104 billion from the National City acquisition, compared with $82.7 billion at December 31, 2007. Interest bearing deposits represented 81% of total deposits at December 31, 2008 compared with 76% at December 31, 2007. The change in deposit composition reflected the higher proportion of certificates of deposit and other interest bearing deposits associated with National City. Borrowed funds totaled $52.2 billion at December 31, 2008 compared with $30.9 billion at December 31, 2007. Borrowed funds at December 31, 2008 included $18.2 billion of National City obligations and $2.9 billion of senior notes guaranteed under the FDICs TLGP Debt Guarantee Program that PNC issued in December 2008. The Liquidity Risk Management section of this Item 7 contains further details regarding actions we have taken which impacted our borrowed funds balances during 2008. 35 Table of Contents Capital We manage our capital position by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing debt, equity or hybrid instruments, executing treasury stock transactions, managing dividend policies and retaining earnings. On March 1, 2009, we took a proactive step to build capital and further strengthen our balance sheet as the Board of Directors decided to reduce PNCs quarterly common stock dividend from $0.66 to $0.10 per share. Total shareholders equity increased $10.6 billion, to $25.4 billion, at December 31, 2008 compared with December 31, 2007 and reflected the following: The December 2008 issuance of $7.6 billion of preferred stock and a common stock warrant to the US Department of Treasury under the TARP Capital Purchase Program, The December 2008 issuance of $5.6 billion of common stock in connection with the National City acquisition, The May 2008 issuance of $500 million of Series K preferred stock, The April 2008 issuance of $312 million of common stock in connection with the Sterling acquisition, and The December 2008 issuance of $150 million of Series L preferred stock in connection with the National City acquisition. These factors were partially offset by the $3.8 billion increase from December 31, 2007 in accumulated other comprehensive loss which included $3.5 billion of net unrealized securities losses. The Investment Securities section of this Consolidated Balance Sheet Review includes additional information regarding these unrealized losses. Common shares outstanding were 443 million at December 31, 2008 and 341 million at December 31, 2007. PNC issued approximately 95 million common shares in December 2008 and 4.6 million common shares in April 2008 in connection with the closings of the National City and Sterling acquisitions, respectively. Our current common stock repurchase program permits us to purchase up to 25 million shares of PNC common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. This program will remain in effect until fully utilized or until modified, superseded or terminated. The extent and timing of share repurchases under this program will depend on a number of factors including, among others, market and general economic conditions, economic and regulatory capital considerations, alternative uses of capital, regulatory and contractual limitations, and the potential impact on our credit ratings. We did not purchase any shares during 2008 under this program. During 2007, we purchased 11 million common shares under our current and prior common stock repurchase programs at a total cost of approximately $800 million. Under the TARP Capital Purchase Program, there are restrictions on dividends and common share repurchases associated with the preferred stock that we issued to the US Treasury in accordance with that program. As is typical with cumulative preferred stock, dividend payments for this preferred stock must be current before dividends can be paid on junior shares, including our common stock, or junior shares can be repurchased or redeemed. Also, the US Treasurys consent will be required for any increase in common dividends per share above the most recent level prior to October 14, 2008 until the third anniversary of the preferred stock issuance as long as the US Treasury continues to hold any of the preferred stock. Further, during that same period, the US Treasurys consent will be required, unless the preferred stock is no longer held by the US Treasury, for any share repurchases with limited exceptions, most significantly purchases of common shares in connection with any benefit plan in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.

The increase in the ratio from December 31, 2007 included the issuance of Tier 1 eligible securities during the first half of 2008 totaling $1.3 billion, including REIT preferred, noncumulative perpetual preferred, and trust preferred securities. The Perpetual Trust Securities and PNC Capital Trust E Trust Preferred Securities portions of the Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and VIEs section of this Item 7 and Note 19 Shareholders Equity in Item 8 of this Report have additional information regarding these securities. In addition, $7.6 billion of preferred stock and a common stock warrant was issued to the US Department of the Treasury under the TARP Capital Purchase Program on December 31, 2008. Tier 1 risk based capital further increased as a result of $5.6 billion of common stock issued in the National City acquisition and PNCs assumption of $2.6 billion of Tier 1 qualifying capital securities previously issued by National City. These increases in capital were partially offset by the deduction of higher acquisition related intangible assets. The positive effect on the Tier 1 ratio of the net increase in capital was somewhat offset by an increase in risk weighted assets primarily related to acquisitions, including National City. The leverage ratio at December 31, 2008 reflected the favorable impact on Tier 1 risk based capital from the issuance of securities under TARP and the issuance of PNC common stock in connection with the National City acquisition, both of which occurred on December 31, 2008. In addition, the ratio as of that date did not reflect any impact of National City on PNCs adjusted average total assets. PNCs tangible common equity ratio was 2.9% at December 31, 2008 compared with 4.7% at December 31, 2007. The decrease in the ratio from the prior year was the result of the decline in the value of the securities available for sale portfolio and the value of assets in our pension plan. We expect PNCs tangible common equity ratio to be less sensitive to the impact of widening credit spreads on accumulated other comprehensive loss going forward primarily due to the composition of the securities available for sale portfolio acquired from National City and a substantially higher level of common equity in the combined company. The access to, and cost of, funding new business initiatives including acquisitions, the ability to engage in expanded business activities, the ability to pay dividends, the level of deposit insurance costs, and the level and nature of regulatory oversight depend, in part, on a financial institutions capital strength. At December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, each of our domestic bank subsidiaries was considered well capitalized based on US regulatory capital ratio requirements. See the Supervision And Regulation section of Item 1 of this Report and Note 23 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. We believe our bank subsidiaries will continue to meet these requirements in 2009. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND VIES We engage in a variety of activities that involve unconsolidated entities or that are otherwise not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet that are generally referred to as off balance sheet arrangements. The following sections of this Report provide further information on these types of activities: Commitments, including contractual obligations and other commitments, included within the Risk Management section of this Item 7, and Note 10 Securitization Activity and Note 25 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. The following provides a summary of variable interest entities (VIEs), including those that we have consolidated and those in which we hold a significant variable interest but have not consolidated into our financial statements as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007.

The comparable amounts were $8.8 billion and $.2 billion at December 31, 2007. These liquidity commitments are included in the Net Unfunded Credit Commitments table in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Report. (b) Amounts reported primarily represent low income housing projects. (c) Amounts include the impact of National City. (d) Aggregate assets and aggregate liabilities at December 31, 2008 represent approximate balances due to limited availability of financial information associated with the acquired National City partnerships that we did not sponsor. Market Street Market Street Funding LLC (Market Street) is a multi seller asset backed commercial paper conduit that is owned by an independent third party. Market Streets activities primarily involve purchasing assets or making loans secured by interests in pools of receivables from US corporations that desire access to the commercial paper market. Market Street funds the purchases of assets or loans by issuing commercial paper which has been rated A1/P1 by Standard & Poors and Moodys, respectively, and is supported by pool specific credit enhancements, liquidity facilities and program level credit enhancement. Generally, Market Street mitigates its potential interest rate risk by entering into agreements with its borrowers that reflect interest rates based upon its weighted average commercial paper cost of funds. During 2007 and 2008, Market Street met all of its funding needs through the issuance of commercial paper. Market Street commercial paper outstanding was $4.4 billion at December 31, 2008 and $5.1 billion at December 31, 2007. The weighted average maturity of the commercial paper was 24 days at December 31, 2008 compared with 32 days at December 31, 2007. Effective October 28, 2008, Market Street was approved to participate in the Federal Reserves CPFF authorized under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. The CPFF commitment to purchase up to $5.4 billion of three month Market Street commercial paper expires on October 30, 2009. As of December 31, 2008, Market Streets participation in this program totaled $445 million. These trades matured at the end of January 2009 and were replaced with commercial paper sold to investors. In the ordinary course of business during 2008, PNC Capital Markets, acting as a placement agent for Market Street, held a maximum daily position in Market Street commercial paper of $75 million with an average of $12 million. This compares with a maximum daily position of $113 million with an average of $27 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. PNC Capital Markets owned no Market Street commercial paper at December 31, 2008 and owned less than $1 million of such commercial paper at December 31, 2007. PNC Bank, National Association (PNC Bank, N.A.) purchased overnight maturities of Market Street commercial paper on two days during September 2008 in the amounts of $197 million and $531 million and one day during October 2008 in the amount of $278 million due to illiquidity in the commercial paper market. We considered these transactions as part of our evaluation of Market Street described below to determine that we are not the primary beneficiary. PNC made no other purchases of Market Street commercial paper during 2007 or 2008. PNC Bank, N.A. provides certain administrative services, the program level credit enhancement and 99% of liquidity facilities to Market Street in exchange for fees negotiated based on market rates. PNC recognized program administrator fees and commitment fees related to PNCs portion of the liquidity facilities of $21 million and $4 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2008. The comparable amounts were $13 million and $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The commercial paper obligations at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 were effectively collateralized by Market Streets assets. While PNC may be obligated to fund under the $6.4 billion of liquidity facilities for events such as commercial paper market disruptions, borrower bankruptcies, collateral deficiencies or covenant violations, our credit risk under the liquidity facilities is secondary to the risk of first loss provided by the borrower or another third party in the form of deal specific credit enhancement, such as by the over collateralization of the assets. Deal specific credit enhancement that supports the commercial paper issued by Market Street is generally structured to cover a multiple of expected losses for the pool of assets and is sized to generally meet rating agency standards for comparably structured transactions. In addition, PNC would be required to fund $1.0 billion of the liquidity facilities if the underlying assets are in default. See Note 25 Commitments And Guarantees included in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report for additional information. PNC provides program level credit enhancement to cover net losses in the amount of 10% of commitments, excluding explicitly rated AAA/Aaa facilities. PNC provides 100% of the enhancement in the form of a cash collateral account funded by a loan facility. This facility expires in March 2013. Until November 25, 2008, PNC provided only 25% of the enhancement in the form of a cash collateral account funded by a loan facility and provided a liquidity facility for the remaining 75% of program level enhancement. Market Street has entered into a Subordinated Note Purchase Agreement (Note) with an unrelated third party. The Note provides first loss coverage whereby the investor absorbs losses up to the amount of the Note, which was $6.6 million as of December 31, 2008. Proceeds from the issuance of the Note are held by Market Street in a first loss reserve account that will be used to reimburse any losses incurred by Market Street, PNC Bank, N.A. or other providers under the liquidity facilities and the credit enhancement arrangements. 38 Table of Contents Assets of Market Street Funding LLC In millions Outstanding Commitments WeightedAverageRemainingMaturity InYears December 31, 2008 (a) Trade receivables $ 1,516 $ 3,370 2.34 Automobile financing 992 992 3.94 Collateralized loan obligations 306 405 1.58 Credit cards 400 400 .19 Residential mortgage 14 14 27.00 Other 1,168 1,325 1.76 Cash and miscellaneous receivables 520 Total $ 4,916 $ 6,506 2.34 December 31, 2007 (a) Trade receivables $ 1,375 $ 2,865 2.63 Automobile financing 1,387 1,565 4.06 Collateralized loan obligations 519 1,257 2.54 Credit cards 769 775 .26 Residential mortgage 37 720 .90 Other 1,031 1,224 1.89 Cash and miscellaneous receivables 186 Total $ 5,304 $ 8,406 2.41 (a) Market Street did not recognize an asset impairment charge or experience any material rating downgrades during 2007 or 2008.

All facilities are structured to meet rating agency standards for applicable rating levels. We evaluated the design of Market Street, its capital structure, the Note, and relationships among the variable interest holders under the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46, (Revised 2003) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R). Based on this analysis, we are not the primary beneficiary as defined by FIN 46R and therefore the assets and liabilities of Market Street are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We would consider changes to the variable interest holders (such as new expected loss note investors and changes to program level credit enhancement providers), terms of expected loss notes, and new types of risks related to Market Street as reconsideration events. We review the activities of Market Street on at least a quarterly basis to determine if a reconsideration event has occurred. Based on current accounting guidance, we are not required to consolidate Market Street into our consolidated financial statements. However, if PNC would be determined to be the primary beneficiary under FIN 46R, we would consolidate the commercial paper conduit at that time. Based on current accounting guidance, to the extent that the par value of the assets in Market Street exceeded the fair value of the assets upon consolidation, the difference would be recognized by PNC as a loss in our Consolidated Income Statement in that period. Based on the fair value of the assets held by Market Street at December 31, 2008, the consolidation of Market Street would not have had a material impact on our risk based capital ratios or debt covenants. Low Income Housing Projects We make certain equity investments in various limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects utilizing the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) pursuant to Sections 42 and 47 of the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital, to facilitate the sale of additional affordable housing product offerings and to assist us in achieving goals associated with the Community Reinvestment Act. The primary activities of the limited partnerships include the identification, development and operation of multi family housing that is leased to qualifying residential tenants. Generally, these types of investments are funded through a combination of debt and equity. We typically invest in these partnerships as a limited partner. Also, we are a national syndicator of affordable housing equity (together with the investments described above, the LIHTC investments). In these syndication transactions, we create funds in which our subsidiaries are the general partner and sell limited partnership interests to third parties, and in some cases may also purchase a limited partnership interest in the fund. The purpose of this business is to generate income from the syndication of these funds and to generate servicing fees by managing the funds. General partner activities include selecting, evaluating, structuring, negotiating, and closing the fund investments in operating limited partnerships, as well as oversight of the ongoing operations of the fund portfolio. We evaluate our interests and third party interests in the limited partnerships in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary determination is based on which party absorbs a majority of the variability. The primary sources of variability in LIHTC investments are the tax credits, tax benefits of losses on the investments and development and operating cash flows. We have consolidated LIHTC investments in which we absorb a majority of the variability and thus are considered the primary beneficiary. The assets are primarily included in Equity Investments and Other Assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet with the liabilities primarily classified in Other Liabilities and Minority 39 Table of Contents Interest. Neither creditors nor equity investors in the LIHTC investments have any recourse to our general credit. The consolidated aggregate assets and liabilities of these LIHTC investments are provided in the Consolidated VIEs PNC Is Primary Beneficiary table and reflected in the Other business segment. We also have LIHTC investments in which we are not the primary beneficiary, but are considered to have a significant variable interest based on our interests in the partnership. These investments are disclosed in the Non Consolidated VIEs Significant Variable Interests table. The table also reflects our maximum exposure to loss. Our maximum exposure to loss is equal to our legally binding equity commitments adjusted for recorded impairment and partnership results. We use the equity and cost methods to account for our investment in these entities with the investments reflected in Equity Investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. In addition, we increase our recognized investments and recognize a liability for all legally binding unfunded equity commitments. These liabilities are reflected in Other Liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Credit Risk Transfer Transaction National City Bank (NCB) sponsored a special purpose entity (SPE) trust and concurrently entered into a credit risk transfer agreement with an independent third party to mitigate credit losses on a pool of nonconforming mortgage loans originated by its former First Franklin business unit. The SPE was formed with a small contribution from NCB and was structured as a bankruptcy remote entity so that its creditors have no recourse to NCB. In exchange for a perfected security interest in the cash flows of the nonconforming mortgage loans, the SPE issued to NCB asset backed securities in the form of senior, mezzanine, and subordinated equity notes. NCB has incurred credit losses equal to the subordinated equity notes. NCB currently holds the right to put the mezzanine notes to the independent third party at par. As of December 31, 2008, the value of the mezzanine notes was $169 million. NCB holds the senior notes and will be responsible for credit losses in excess of this amount. The SPE was deemed to be a VIE as its equity was not sufficient to finance its activities. NCB was determined to be the primary beneficiary of the SPE as it would absorb the majority of the expected losses of the SPE through its holding of all of the asset backed securities. Accordingly, this SPE was consolidated and all of the entitys assets, liabilities, and equity are intercompany balances and are eliminated in consolidation. Nonconforming mortgage loans, including foreclosed properties, pledged as collateral to the SPE remain on the balance sheet and totaled $719 million at December 31, 2008 reflecting the impact of fair value adjustments recorded by PNC in conjunction with the acquisition. In January 2009, cumulative credit losses in the mortgage loan pool surpassed the principal balance of subordinated equity notes, giving PNC the right to put the first mezzanine note to the independent third party in accordance with the credit risk transfer agreement. In February 2009, PNC exercised its put option and received $16 million for the mezzanine note. Prior to this reconsideration event, management evaluated what impact this transaction would have on determining whether we would remain the primary beneficiary of the SPE. Management concluded, through reassessment of the expected losses and residual returns of the SPE, that we would remain the primary beneficiary and accordingly should continue to consolidate the SPE. Perpetual Trust Securities We issue certain hybrid capital vehicles that qualify as capital for regulatory and rating agency purposes. In February 2008, PNC Preferred Funding LLC (the LLC), one of our indirect subsidiaries, sold $375 million of 8.700% Fixed to Floating Rate Non Cumulative Exchangeable Perpetual Trust Securities of PNC Preferred Funding Trust III (Trust III) to third parties in a private placement. In connection with the private placement, Trust III acquired $375 million of Fixed to Floating Rate Non Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Securities of the LLC (the LLC Preferred Securities). The sale was similar to the March 2007 private placement by the LLC of $500 million of 6.113% Fixed to Floating Rate Non Cumulative Exchangeable Trust Securities (the Trust II Securities) of PNC Preferred Funding Trust II (Trust II) in which Trust II acquired $500 million of LLC Preferred Securities and to the December 2006 private placement by PNC REIT Corp. of $500 million of 6.517% Fixed to Floating Rate Non Cumulative Exchangeable Perpetual Trust Securities (the Trust I Securities) of PNC Preferred Funding Trust I (Trust I) in which Trust I acquired $500 million of LLC Preferred Securities. Each Trust III Security is automatically exchangeable into a share of Series J Non Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of PNC, each Trust II Security is automatically exchangeable into a share of Series I Non Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of PNC (Series I Preferred Stock), and each Trust I Security is automatically exchangeable into a share of Series F Non Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of PNC Bank, N.A. (PNC Bank Preferred Stock), in each case under certain conditions relating to the capitalization or the financial condition of PNC Bank, N.A. and upon the direction of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. We entered into a replacement capital covenant in connection with the closing of the Trust I Securities sale (the Trust RCC) whereby we agreed that neither we nor our subsidiaries (other than PNC Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries) would 40 Table of Contents purchase the Trust Securities, the LLC Preferred Securities or the PNC Bank Preferred Stock unless such repurchases or redemptions are made from the proceeds of the issuance of certain qualified securities and pursuant to the other terms and conditions set forth in the replacement capital covenant with respect to the Trust RCC. We also entered into a replacement capital covenant in connection with the closing of the Trust II Securities sale (the Trust II RCC) whereby we agreed until March 29, 2017 that neither we nor our subsidiaries would purchase or redeem the Trust II Securities, the LLC Preferred Securities or the Series I Preferred Stock unless such repurchases or redemptions are made from the proceeds of the issuance of certain qualified securities and pursuant to the other terms and conditions set forth in the replacement capital covenant with respect to the Trust RCC. As of December 31, 2008, each of the Trust RCC and the Trust II RCC are for the benefit of holders of our $200 million of Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Notes issued in June 1998. We filed a copy of each of the Trust RCC and the Trust II RCC with the SEC as Exhibit 99.1 to PNCs Form 8 K filed on December 8, 2006 and as Exhibit 99.1 to PNCs Form 8 K filed on March 30, 2007, respectively. PNC has contractually committed to Trust II and Trust III that if full dividends are not paid in a dividend period on the Trust II Securities or the Trust III Securities, as applicable, or the LLC Preferred Securities held by Trust II or Trust III, as applicable, PNC will not declare or pay dividends with respect to, or redeem, purchase or acquire, any of its equity capital securities during the next succeeding dividend period, other than: (i) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of capital stock of PNC in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or consultants, (ii) purchases of shares of common stock of PNC pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to buy stock existing prior to the commencement of the extension period, including under a contractually binding stock repurchase plan, (iii) any dividend in connection with the implementation of a shareholders rights plan, or the redemption or repurchase of any rights under any such plan, (iv) as a result of an exchange or conversion of any class or series of PNCs capital stock for any other class or series of PNCs capital stock, (v) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of PNC capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such stock or the security being converted or exchanged or (vi) any stock dividends paid by PNC where the dividend stock is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid. PNC Bank, N.A. has contractually committed to Trust I that if full dividends are not paid in a dividend period on the Trust I Securities, LLC Preferred Securities or any other parity equity securities issued by the LLC, neither PNC Bank, N.A. nor its subsidiaries will declare or pay dividends or other distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase or acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its equity capital securities during the next succeeding period (other than to holders of the LLC Preferred Securities and any parity equity securities issued by the LLC) except: (i) in the case of dividends payable to subsidiaries of PNC Bank, N.A., to PNC Bank, N.A. or another wholly owned subsidiary of PNC Bank, N.A. or (ii) in the case of dividends payable to persons that are not subsidiaries of PNC Bank, N.A., to such persons only if, (A) in the case of a cash dividend, PNC has first irrevocably committed to contribute amounts at least equal to such cash dividend or (B) in the case of in kind dividends payable by PNC REIT Corp., PNC has committed to purchase such in kind dividend from the applicable PNC REIT Corp. holders in exchange for a cash payment representing the market value of such in kind dividend, and PNC has committed to contribute such in kind dividend to PNC Bank, N.A. PNC Capital Trust E Trust Preferred Securities In February 2008, PNC Capital Trust E issued $450 million of 7.75% Trust Preferred Securities due March 15, 2068 (the Trust E Securities). PNC Capital Trust Es only assets are $450 million of 7.75% Junior Subordinated Notes due March 15, 2068 and issued by PNC (the JSNs). The Trust E Securities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by PNC. We may, at our option, redeem the JSNs at 100% of their principal amount on or after March 15, 2013. In connection with the closing of the Trust E Securities sale, we agreed that, if we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments on the JSNs or a related deferral period is continuing, then PNC would be subject during such period to restrictions on dividends and other provisions protecting the status of the JSN debenture holder similar to or in some ways more restrictive than those potentially imposed under the Exchange Agreements with Trust II and Trust III, as described above. PNC Capital Trusts C and D have similar protective provisions with respect to $500 million in principal amount of junior subordinated debentures. Also, in connection with the closing of the Trust E Securities sale, we entered into a replacement capital covenant, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 99.1 to PNCs Form 8 K filed on February 13, 2008 and which is described in Note 14 Capital Securities of Subsidiary Trusts in Item 8 of this Report. Acquired Entity Trust Preferred Securities As a result of the National City acquisition, we assumed obligations with respect to $2.4 billion in principal amount of junior subordinated debentures issued by the acquired entity. As a result of the Mercantile, Yardville and Sterling acquisitions, we assumed obligations with respect to $158 million in principal amount of junior subordinated debentures issued by the acquired entities. Under the terms of these debentures, if there is an event of default under the debentures or PNC exercises its right to defer payments on the related trust preferred securities issued by the statutory trusts or there is a default under PNCs guarantee of such payment 41 Table of Contents obligations, PNC would be subject during the period of such default or deferral to restrictions on dividends and other provisions protecting the status of the debenture holders similar to or in some ways more restrictive than those potentially imposed under the Exchange Agreements with Trust II and Trust III, as described above. We are subject to replacement capital covenants (RCCs) with respect to four tranches of junior subordinated debentures inherited from National City, copies of which RCCs were attached, respectively, as Exhibit 99.2 to the National City Form 8 K filed on February 4, 2008 and Exhibit 99.1 to the National City Forms 8 K filed on November 9, 2006, May 25, 2007 and August 30, 2007. See Note 14 Capital Securities of Subsidiary Trusts. Similarly, we are subject to a replacement capital covenant with respect to our Series L Preferred Stock, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 99.1 to National Citys Form 8 K filed on February 4, 2008. See Note 19 Shareholders Equity in Item 8 of this Report. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND FAIR VALUE OPTION We adopted SFAS 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), and SFAS 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS 159), on January 1, 2008. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. Under SFAS 159, we elected to fair value certain commercial mortgage loans classified as held for sale and certain customer resale agreements and bank notes to align the accounting for the changes in the fair value of these financial instruments with the changes in the value of their related hedges. See Note 8 Fair Value in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Report for further information. At December 31, 2008, fair value assets represented 13% of total assets and fair value liabilities represented 2% of total liabilities. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including instruments for which PNC has elected the fair value option, are summarized below. As prescribed by SFAS 157, the assets and liabilities of National City acquired in a purchase business combination on December 31, 2008 were excluded from the table below and related disclosures.

(e) Included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. (f) Included in other borrowed funds on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Valuation Hierarchy The following is an outline of the valuation methodologies used for measuring fair value under SFAS 157 for the major items above. SFAS 157 focuses on the exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants and establishes a reporting hierarchy to maximize the use of observable inputs. The fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3) is described in detail in Note 8 Fair Value in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Report. We characterize active markets as those where transaction volumes are sufficient to provide objective pricing information, with reasonably narrow bid/ask spreads and where dealer quotes received do not vary widely. Inactive markets are characterized by low transaction volumes, price quotations which vary substantially among market participants, or in which minimal information is released publicly. We also consider nonperformance risks including credit risk as part of our valuation methodology for all assets measured at fair value. Any models used to determine fair values or to validate dealer quotes based on the descriptions 42 Table of Contents below are subject to review and independent testing as part of our model validation and internal control testing processes. Significant models are tested by our Model Validation Committee on at least an annual basis. In addition, we have teams, independent of the traders, verify marks and assumptions used for valuations at each period end. Securities Securities include both the available for sale and trading portfolios. We use prices sourced from pricing services, dealer quotes or recent trades to determine the fair value of securities. Approximately 75% of our positions are valued using pricing services provided by the Lehman Index and IDC. Lehman Index prices are set with reference to market activity for highly liquid assets such as agency mortgage backed securities, and matrix priced for other assets, such as CMBS and asset backed securities. IDC primarily uses matrix pricing for the instruments we value using this service, such as agency adjustable rate mortgage securities, agency CMOs and municipal bonds. Dealer quotes received are typically non binding and corroborated with other dealers quotes, by reviewing valuations of comparable instruments, or by comparison to internal valuations. The majority of our securities are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. In circumstances where market prices are limited or unavailable, valuations may require significant management judgments or adjustments to determine fair value. In these cases, the securities are classified as Level 3. The primary valuation technique for securities classified as Level 3 is to identify a proxy security, market transaction or index. The proxy selected generally has similar credit, tenor, duration, pricing and structuring attributes to the PNC position. The price, market spread, or yield on the proxy is then used to calculate an indicative market price for the security. Depending on the nature of the PNC position and its attributes relative to the proxy, management may make additional adjustments to account for market conditions, liquidity, and nonperformance risk, based on various inputs including recent trades of similar assets, single dealer quotes, and or other observable and unobservable inputs.

The agency securities are generally collateralized by 1 4 family, conforming, fixed rate residential mortgages. The private issuer securities are also generally collateralized by 1 4 family residential mortgages. The mortgage loans underlying the private issuer securities are generally 43 Table of Contents non conforming (i.e., original balances in excess of the amount qualifying for agency securities) and predominately have interest rates that are fixed for a period of time, after which the rate adjusts to a floating rate based upon a contractual spread that is indexed to a market rate (i.e., a hybrid ARM). Substantially all of the securities are senior tranches in the subordination structure and have credit protection in the form of credit enhancement, over collateralization and or excess spread accounts. At December 31, 2008, $419 million, or 6%, of private issuer securities were rated below BBB by at least one national rating agency or not rated. For eight securities, we recorded other than temporary impairment charges of $151 million in 2008. Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities The commercial mortgage backed securities portfolio was $3.4 billion fair value at December 31, 2008 (all classified as available for sale), and consisted of fixed rate, private issuer securities collateralized by non residential properties, primarily retail properties, office buildings, and multi family housing. Substantially all of the securities are the most senior tranches in the subordination structure. At December 31, 2008, $18 million, or 1%, of the commercial mortgage backed securities were not rated. We recorded no other than temporary impairment charges on commercial mortgage backed securities in 2008. Other Asset Backed Securities The asset backed securities portfolio was $1.5 billion fair value at December 31, 2008 (all classified as available for sale), and consisted of fixed rate and floating rate, private issuer securities collateralized primarily by various consumer credit products, including first lien residential mortgage loans, credit cards, and automobile loans. Substantially all of the securities are senior tranches in the subordination structure and have credit protection in the form of credit enhancement, over collateralization and or excess spread accounts. At December 31, 2008, $184 million, or 12%, of the asset backed securities were rated below BBB by at least one national rating agency or not rated. For seven asset backed securities, we recorded other than temporary impairment charges totaling approximately $87 million in 2008. Financial Derivatives Exchange traded derivatives are valued using quoted market prices and are classified as Level 1. However, the majority of derivatives that we enter into are executed over the counter and are valued using internal techniques. Readily observable market inputs to these models can be validated to external sources, including industry pricing services, or corroborated through recent trades, dealer quotes, yield curves, implied volatility or other market related data. Certain derivatives, such as total rate of return swaps, are corroborated to the CMBX index. These derivatives are classified as Level 2. Derivatives priced using significant management judgment or assumptions are classified as Level 3. The fair values of our derivatives are adjusted for nonperformance risk including credit risk as appropriate. Our nonperformance risk adjustment is computed using internal assumptions based primarily on historical default and recovery observations. The credit risk adjustment is not currently material to the overall derivatives valuation. Commercial Mortgage Loans and Commitments Held for Sale Effective January 1, 2008, we elected to account for commercial mortgage loans classified as held for sale and intended for securitization at fair value under the provisions of SFAS 159. Based on the significance of unobservable inputs, we classify this portfolio as Level 3. As such, a synthetic securitization methodology was used historically to value the loans and the related unfunded commitments on an aggregate basis based upon current commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) market structures and conditions. The election of the fair value option aligns the accounting for the commercial mortgages with the related hedges. It also eliminates the requirements of hedge accounting under SFAS 133. Due to the inactivity in the CMBS securitization market in 2008, we determined the fair value of commercial mortgage loans held for sale by using a whole loan methodology. Based on the significance of unobservable inputs, we classify this portfolio as Level 3. Valuation assumptions included observable inputs based on whole loan sales, both observed in the market and actual sales from our portfolio and new loan origination spreads during the quarter. Adjustments were made to the assumptions to account for uncertainties, including market conditions, and liquidity. Credit risk was included as part of our valuation process for these loans by considering expected rates of return for market participants for similar loans in the marketplace. Customer Resale Agreements Effective January 1, 2008, we elected to account for structured resale agreements at fair value, which are economically hedged using free standing financial derivatives. The fair value for structured resale agreements is determined using a model which includes observable market data as inputs such as interest rates. Readily observable market inputs to this model can be validated to external sources, including yield curves, implied volatility or other market related data. Equity Investments The valuation of direct and indirect private equity investments requires significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long term nature of such investments. The carrying values of 44 Table of Contents direct and affiliated partnership interests reflect the expected exit price and are based on various techniques including publicly traded price, multiples of adjusted earnings of the entity, independent appraisals, anticipated financing and sale transactions with third parties, or the pricing used to value the entity in a recent financing transaction. Indirect investments in private equity funds are valued based on the financial statements that we receive from their managers. Due to the time lag in our receipt of the financial information and based on a review of investments and valuation techniques applied, adjustments to the manager provided value are made when available recent portfolio company information or market information indicates a significant change in value from that provided by the manager of the fund. These investments are classified as Level 3. Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Under SFAS 157, financial instruments are considered Level 3 when their values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable. At December 31, 2008, Level 3 fair value assets of $7.012 billion represented 19% of total assets at fair value and 2% of total assets. Level 3 fair value liabilities of $22 million at December 31, 2008 represented less than 1% of total liabilities at fair value and less than 1% of total liabilities at that date. During 2008, securities transferred into Level 3 from Level 2 exceeded securities transferred out by $4.3 billion. These primarily related to private issuer asset backed securities, auction rate securities, residential mortgage backed securities and corporate bonds and occurred due to reduced volume of recently executed transactions and the lack of corroborating market price quotations for these instruments. Other Level 3 assets include commercial mortgage loans held for sale, private equity investments and other assets. Total securities measured at fair value at December 31, 2008 included securities available for sale and trading securities consisting primarily of residential and commercial mortgage backed securities and other asset backed securities. Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities do not impact liquidity or risk based capital. However, reductions in the credit ratings of these securities would have an impact on the determination of risk weighted assets which could reduce our regulatory capital ratios. In addition, other than temporary impairments on available for sale securities would reduce our regulatory capital ratios. BUSINESS SEGMENTS REVIEW In 2008 and 2007, we had four major businesses engaged in providing banking, asset management and global fund processing products and services. Business segment results, including inter segment revenues, and a description of each business are included in Note 27 Segment Reporting included in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Report. Certain revenue and expense amounts included in this Business Segments Review differ from the amounts shown in Note 27 due to the presentation in this Business Segments Review of business revenue on a taxable equivalent basis, income statement classification differences related to Global Investment Servicing, the inclusion of the results of Hilliard Lyons, including the March 2008 gain on sale, in the Other category, and the inclusion of 2008 Albridge Solutions and Coates Analytics and 2007 BlackRock/MLIM transaction integration costs in the Other category. Results of individual businesses are presented based on our management accounting practices and management structure. There is no comprehensive, authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to GAAP; therefore, the financial results of our individual businesses are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company. We refine our methodologies from time to time as our management accounting practices are enhanced and our businesses and management structure change. Financial results are presented, to the extent practicable, as if each business operated on a stand alone basis. As permitted under GAAP, we have aggregated the business results for certain similar operating segments for financial reporting purposes. Assets receive a funding charge and liabilities and capital receive a funding credit based on a transfer pricing methodology that incorporates product maturities, duration and other factors. Capital is intended to cover unexpected losses and is assigned to the banking and servicing businesses using our risk based economic capital model. We have assigned capital equal to 6% of funds to Retail Banking to reflect the capital required for well capitalized domestic banks and to approximate market comparables for this business. The capital assigned for Global Investment Servicing reflects its legal entity shareholders equity. We have allocated the allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit based on our assessment of risk inherent in the business segment loan portfolios. Our allocation of the costs incurred by operations and other shared support areas not directly aligned with the businesses is primarily based on the use of services. 45 Table of Contents Total business segment financial results differ from total consolidated results. The impact of these differences is reflected in the Other category. Other for purposes of this Business Segments Review and the Business Segment Highlights in the Executive Summary includes residual activities that do not meet the criteria for disclosure as a separate reportable business, such as gains or losses related to BlackRock transactions including LTIP share distributions and obligations, earnings and gains or losses related to Hilliard Lyons, integration costs, asset and liability management activities including net securities gains or losses and certain trading activities, equity management activities, differences between business segment performance reporting and financial statement reporting (GAAP), intercompany eliminations, and most corporate overhead. Employee data as reported by each business segment in the tables that follow reflect PNC legacy staff directly employed by the respective businesses and excludes corporate and shared services employees. National City legacy employees totaling 31,374 at December 31, 2008 are not included in any of PNCs business segment tables. Beginning in the first quarter of 2009, PNC expects to have three new reportable business segments which are described in Note 28 Subsequent Event included in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Report.

The acquisition of National City on December 31, 2008 added 1,441 branches, including 61 branches that we committed to divest, and 2,191 ATMs to our distribution network. Including the impact of National City, our network grew to 2,589 branches and 6,232 ATM machines, giving PNC one of the largest distribution networks among US banks. The acquisition also added $53 billion of assets under management to give the combined company $110 billion in assets under management. All other Retail Banking business segment disclosures in this Item 7 exclude any impact of National City. Retail Bankings earnings were $429 million for 2008 compared with $876 million for 2007. The decline in earnings over the prior year was primarily driven by increases in the provision for credit losses and noninterest expense. The 2008 revenue growth was negatively impacted by a lower interest credit attributed to deposits in the declining rate environment and was therefore not reflective of the solid growth in customers and deposits. Highlights of Retail Bankings performance during 2008 include the following: Retail Banking expanded the number of customers it serves and grew checking relationships. Total checking relationships increased by a net 160,000 since December 31, 2007, which includes both the conversion of Yardville and Sterling accounts as well as the addition of new relationships through organic growth. Excluding relationships added from acquisitions, net new consumer and business checking relationships grew by 72,000 in 2008 compared with 32,000 a year earlier. Average deposit balances increased $3.7 billion or 7% primarily as a result of strong money market deposit growth and the benefits of the acquisitions. Our investment in online banking capabilities continued to pay off. Since December 31, 2007, the percentage of consumer checking households using online bill payment increased from 33% to 41%. We continue to seek customer growth by expanding our use of technology, such as the recent launch of our Virtual Wallet online banking product. Recently, Virtual Wallet received a Best of the Web award for 2008 from Online Banking Report. Retail Banking continued to invest in the branch network. During 2008, we opened 19 new branches, consolidated 45 branches, and acquired 65 branches for a total of 1,148 branches at December 31, 2008. We continue to work to optimize our network by opening new branches in high growth areas, relocating branches to areas of higher market opportunity, and consolidating branches in areas of declining opportunity. We relocated 8 branches during 2008. In October 2008 we announced an exclusive agreement under which we will provide banking services in Giant Food LLC supermarket locations across Virginia, Maryland, Delaware and the District of Columbia. In 2009, we expect to open approximately 40 new in store branches and install approximately 180 ATMs. Additional locations are expected to open in subsequent years. Total revenue for 2008 was $3.608 billion, a 1% increase compared with $3.580 billion for 2007. Net interest income of $1.992 billion decreased $70 million, or 3%, compared with 2007. This decline was primarily driven by a lower value attributed to deposits in the declining rate environment partially offset by benefits from earlier acquisitions. Noninterest income increased $98 million, or 6%, compared with 2007. This growth was attributed primarily to the following: A gain of $95 million from the redemption of a portion of our Visa Class B common shares related to Visas March 2008 initial public offering, The Mercantile, Yardville and Sterling acquisitions, Increased volume related consumer fees including debit card, credit card, and merchant revenue, and Increased brokerage account activities. These increases were partially offset by lower asset management fees as a result of lower equity markets and by other business gains in the prior year. The Market Risk Management Equity and Other Investment Risk section of this Financial Review includes further information regarding Visa. The provision for credit losses for 2008 was $612 million compared to $138 million for 2007. Net charge offs were $368 million for 2008 and $131 million in 2007. Asset quality continued to migrate at an accelerated pace in the very challenging economic and credit environment. The increases in provision and net charge offs were primarily a result of the following: Downward credit migration of residential real estate development and related sectors, commercial real estate, and commercial and industrial loan portfolios, and Increased levels of consumer and commercial charge offs given the current credit environment. 48 Table of Contents Based upon the current environment and the acquisition of National City, we believe the provision and nonperforming assets will continue to increase in 2009 versus 2008 levels. Noninterest expense for 2008 totaled $2.284 billion, an increase of $239 million compared with 2007. Approximately 76% of this increase was attributable to acquisitions and continued investments in the business such as the branch network and innovation. Full time employees at December 31, 2008 totaled 11,481, an increase of 459 over the prior year. Part time employees have increased by 65 since December 31, 2007. The increase in full time and part time employees was primarily the result of the Yardville and Sterling acquisitions. Growing core checking deposits as a lower cost funding source and as the cornerstone product to build customer relationships is the primary objective of our deposit strategy. Furthermore, core checking accounts are critical to our strategy of expanding our payments business. Average total deposits increased $3.7 billion, or 7%, compared with 2007. Average money market deposits increased $2.9 billion, and average certificates of deposits declined $.2 billion. Money market deposits experienced core growth and both deposit categories benefited from the acquisitions. The decline in certificates of deposits was a result of a focus on relationship customers rather than pursuing higher rate single service customers. The deposit strategy of Retail Banking is to remain disciplined on pricing, target specific products and markets for growth, and focus on the retention and growth of balances for relationship customers. Average demand deposit growth of $1.1 billion, or 5%, was primarily driven by acquisitions as organic growth was impacted by current economic conditions, such as lower average balances per account. Currently, we are focused on a relationship based lending strategy that targets specific customer sectors (homeowners, students, small businesses and auto dealerships) while seeking a moderate risk profile for the loans that we originate. Average commercial and commercial real estate loans grew $2.1 billion, or 17%, compared with 2007. The increase was primarily attributable to acquisitions. Organic loan growth reflecting the strength of increased small business loan demand from existing customers and the acquisition of new relationships through our sales efforts was also a factor in the increase. At December 31, 2008, commercial and commercial real estate loans totaled $14.6 billion. This portfolio included $3.2 billion of commercial real estate loans, of which approximately $2.4 billion were related to our expansion from earlier acquisitions into the greater Maryland and Washington, DC markets. Approximately $.4 billion of the commercial real estate loans were in residential real estate development. Average home equity loans grew $469 million, or 3%, compared with 2007 primarily due to acquisitions. Our home equity loan portfolio is relationship based, with 93% of the portfolio attributable to borrowers in our primary geographic footprint. We monitor this portfolio closely and the nonperforming assets and charge offs that we have experienced are within our expectations given current market conditions. Average education loans grew $1.9 billion compared with 2007. The increase was primarily the result of the transfer of approximately $1.8 billion of education loans previously held for sale to the loan portfolio during the first quarter of 2008. The Loans Held For Sale portion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial Review includes additional information related to this transfer. Average residential mortgage loans increased $370 million primarily due to the addition of loans from acquisitions. Assets under management of $57 billion at December 31, 2008 decreased $12 billion compared with the balance at December 31, 2007. The decline in assets under management was primarily due to comparatively lower equity markets partially offset by the Sterling acquisition and positive net inflows. New business sales efforts and new client acquisition and growth were ahead of our expectations. Nondiscretionary assets under administration of $87 billion at December 31, 2008 decreased $25 billion compared with the balance at December 31, 2007. This decline was primarily driven by comparatively lower equity markets and net outflows resulting from the reduction in several significant relationships. 49 Table of Contents CORPORATE & INSTITUTIONAL BANKING (a) Year ended December 31 Dollars in millions except as noted 2008 2007 INCOME STATEMENT Net interest income $1,037 $818 Noninterest income Corporate service fees 545 564 Other (51 ) 156 Noninterest income 494 720 Total revenue 1,531 1,538 Provision for credit losses 366 125 Noninterest expense 882 818 Pretax earnings 283 595 Income taxes 58 163 Earnings $225 $432 AVERAGE BALANCE SHEET Loans Corporate (b) $12,485 $9,930 Commercial real estate 5,631 4,408 Commercial real estate related 3,022 2,390 Asset based lending 5,274 4,595 Total loans (b) 26,412 21,323 Goodwill and other intangible assets 2,247 1,919 Loans held for sale 2,053 1,319 Other assets 6,282 4,491 Total assets $36,994 $29,052 Deposits Noninterest bearing demand $7,598 $7,301 Money market 5,216 4,784 Other 2,286 1,325 Total deposits 15,100 13,410 Other liabilities 5,479 3,347 Capital 2,616 2,152 Total funds $23,195 $18,909 PERFORMANCE RATIOS Return on average capital 9 % 20 % Noninterest income to total revenue 32 47 Efficiency 58 53 COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE SERVICING PORTFOLIO (in billions) Beginning of period $243 $200 Acquisitions/additions 31 88 Repayments/transfers (25 ) (45 ) End of period $249 $243 OTHER INFORMATION Consolidated revenue from (c): Treasury management $545 $476 Capital markets $336 $290 Commercial mortgage loan sales and valuations (d) $(115 ) $19 Commercial mortgage loan servicing (e) 180 233 Commercial mortgage banking activities $65 $252 Total loans (f) $28,996 $23,861 Nonperforming assets (f) (g) $749 $243 Net charge offs $168 $70 Full time employees (f) 2,294 2,290 Net carrying amount of commercial mortgage servicing rights (f) $654 $694 (a) Information for all periods presented excludes the impact of National City, which PNC acquired on December 31, 2008.

(g) Includes nonperforming loans of $747 million at December 31, 2008 and $222 million at December 31, 2007. Corporate & Institutional Banking earned $225 million in 2008 compared with $432 million in 2007. The 48% decline in earnings over 2007 was primarily driven by an increase in the provision for credit losses and by higher valuation losses on commercial mortgage loans held for sale, net of hedges. Net interest income grew $219 million, or 27%, in 2008 compared with 2007. The increase over the prior year was primarily a result of an increase in commercial mortgage loans held for sale, organic loan growth and acquisitions. Corporate service fees decreased $19 million compared with 2007 to $545 million. The fourth quarter of 2008 included a $35 million impairment charge on commercial mortgage servicing rights due to the effect of lower interest rates. Increases in treasury management, structured finance and syndication fees more than offset declines in commercial mortgage servicing fees, net of amortization, and merger and acquisition advisory fees. Other noninterest income was negative $51 million for 2008 compared with income of $156 million in 2007. Losses of $197 million on commercial mortgage loans held for sale, net of hedges, were included in other noninterest income for 2008 compared with gains of $3 million in 2007. These non cash valuation losses reflected illiquid market conditions which began in the latter part of 2007. PNC adopted SFAS 159 beginning January 1, 2008 and elected to account for its loans held for sale and intended for securitization at fair value. We stopped originating these loans during the first quarter of 2008. We intend to continue pursuing opportunities to reduce our loans held for sale position at appropriate prices. We sold and or securitized $.6 billion of commercial mortgage loans held for sale carried at fair value in 2008 reducing these fair value assets to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2008. The provision for credit losses was $366 million in 2008 compared with $125 million in 2007. The increase in the provision was primarily due to credit quality migration mainly related to residential real estate development and related sectors along with growth in total credit exposure. Nonperforming 50 Table of Contents assets increased $506 million in the comparison. The largest component of the increase was in commercial real estate and commercial real estate related loans. Based upon the current environment and the acquisition of National City, we believe the provision will continue to increase in 2009 versus 2008 levels. Noninterest expense increased $64 million, or 8%, compared with 2007. The increase was primarily due to the impact of the 2007 ARCS Commercial Mortgage and Mercantile acquisitions, expenses associated with revenue related activities, growth initiatives mainly in treasury management, higher passive losses associated with low income housing tax credit investments, and write downs of other real estate owned. Average loan balances increased $5.1 billion, or 24%, compared with 2007. The increase in corporate and commercial real estate loans resulted from higher utilization of credit facilities, organic growth from new and existing clients, and the impact of the Mercantile and Yardville acquisitions. Average deposit balances increased $1.7 billion, or 13%, compared with 2007. The increase resulted primarily from higher time deposits and the impact of acquisitions. The commercial mortgage servicing portfolio was $249 billion at December 31, 2008, an increase of $6 billion from December 31, 2007. Servicing portfolio additions were modest during 2008 due to the declining volumes in the commercial mortgage securitization market. Average other assets and other liabilities increased $1.8 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. These increases were due to customer driven trading and related hedging transactions. In addition, an increase in customer driven money management activities contributed to the higher other liabilities balance. See the additional revenue discussion regarding treasury management, capital markets related products and services, and commercial mortgage banking activities on pages 29 and 30. 51 Table of Contents BLACKROCK Our BlackRock business segment earned $207 million in 2008 and $253 million in 2007. These results reflect our approximately 33% share of BlackRocks reported GAAP earnings and the additional income taxes on these earnings incurred by PNC. PNCs investment in BlackRock was $4.2 billion at December 31, 2008 and $4.1 billion at December 31, 2007. The book value per share was $98.32 at December 31, 2008. BLACKROCK LTIP PROGRAMS AND EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS BlackRock adopted the 2002 LTIP program to help attract and retain qualified professionals. At that time, PNC agreed to transfer up to four million of the shares of BlackRock common stock then held by us to help fund the 2002 LTIP and future programs approved by BlackRocks board of directors, subject to certain conditions and limitations. Prior to 2006, BlackRock granted awards of approximately $233 million under the 2002 LTIP program, of which approximately $208 million were paid on January 30, 2007. The award payments were funded by 17% in cash from BlackRock and approximately one million shares of BlackRock common stock transferred by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. We recognized a pretax gain of $82 million in the first quarter of 2007 from the transfer of BlackRock shares. The gain was included in other noninterest income and reflected the excess of market value over book value of the one million shares transferred in January 2007. Additional BlackRock shares were distributed to LTIP participants during the first quarter of 2008, resulting in a $3 million pretax gain in other noninterest income, and during January 2009, resulting in a $1 million pretax gain. BlackRock granted awards in 2007 under an additional LTIP program, all of which are subject to achieving earnings performance goals prior to the vesting date of September 29, 2011. Of the shares of BlackRock common stock that we have agreed to transfer to fund their LTIP programs, approximately 1.6 million shares have been committed to fund the awards vesting in 2011 and the amount remaining would then be available for future awards. PNCs noninterest income for 2008 included a $243 million pretax gain related to our commitment to fund additional BlackRock LTIP programs. This gain represented the mark to market adjustment related to our remaining BlackRock LTIP common shares obligation as of December 31, 2008 and resulted from the decrease in the market value of BlackRock common shares for 2008. PNCs noninterest income for 2007 included a pretax charge of $209 million for an increase in the market value of BlackRock common shares for that period. As further described in PNCs Current Report on Form 8 K filed December 30, 2008, PNC entered into an Exchange Agreement with BlackRock on December 26, 2008. The transactions contemplated by this agreement will restructure PNCs ownership of BlackRock equity without altering, to any meaningful extent, PNCs economic interest in BlackRock. PNC will continue to be subject to the limitations on its voting rights in its existing agreements with BlackRock. These transactions will also allow PNC to reduce its net income volatility associated with the quarterly marking to market of obligations related to PNCs delivery of BlackRock stock under the BlackRock LTIP. Also on December 26, 2008, BlackRock entered into an Exchange Agreement with Merrill Lynch in anticipation of the consummation of the merger of Bank of America Corporation and Merrill Lynch which was completed on January 1, 2009. The PNC and Merrill Lynch Exchange Agreements restructured PNCs and Merrill Lynchs respective ownership of BlackRock common and preferred equity. The exchange was completed on February 27, 2009. PNC will continue to account for its investment in BlackRock under the equity method of accounting, with its share of BlackRocks earnings reduced from approximately 33% to 31%, solely as a result of the exchange of 2.9 million of its shares of BlackRock common stock for new BlackRock Series C Preferred Stock. The Series C Preferred Stock will not be taken into consideration in determining PNCs share of BlackRock earnings under the equity method. PNCs percentage ownership of BlackRock common stock is expected to increase from approximately 36.5% to 46.5%. The increase will result from a substantial exchange of Merrill Lynchs BlackRock common stock for BlackRock preferred stock. As a result of the BlackRock preferred stock currently held by Merrill Lynch and the new BlackRock preferred stock being issued to Merrill Lynch and PNC under the Exchange Agreements, PNCs share of BlackRock common stock has been, and will continue to be, higher than its overall share of BlackRocks equity and earnings. On February 27, 2009, PNCs obligation to deliver BlackRock common shares was replaced with an obligation to deliver shares of BlackRocks new Series C Preferred Stock. PNC will account for these preferred shares at fair value as permitted under SFAS 159, which will offset the impact of marking to market the liability to deliver these shares to BlackRock. The transactions related to the Exchange Agreements will not affect our right to receive dividends declared by BlackRock. 52 Table of Contents QUELLOS TRANSACTION On October 1, 2007, BlackRock acquired the fund of funds business of Quellos Group, LLC (Quellos). The combined fund of funds platform operates under the name BlackRock Alternative Advisors and is one of the largest fund of funds platforms in the world. In connection with the acquisition, BlackRock paid $562 million in cash to Quellos and placed 1.2 million shares of BlackRock common stock into an escrow account. The shares of BlackRock common stock will be held in the escrow account for up to three years and will be available to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of Quellos under the asset purchase agreement. In April 2008, 280,519 common stock shares were released to Quellos in accordance with the Quellos asset purchase agreement, which resulted in an adjustment to the recognized purchase price. In addition, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. 53 Table of Contents GLOBAL INVESTMENT SERVICING Year ended December 31 Dollars in millions except as noted 2008 2007 INCOME STATEMENT Servicing revenue (a) $947 $863 Operating expense (a) 728 637 Operating income 219 226 Debt financing 34 38 Nonoperating income (b) 3 6 Pretax earnings 188 194 Income taxes 66 66 Earnings $122 $128 PERIOD END BALANCE SHEET Goodwill and other intangible assets $1,301 $1,315 Other assets 3,977 1,161 Total assets $5,278 $2,476 Debt financing $850 $989 Other liabilities 3,737 865 Shareholders equity 691 622 Total funds $5,278 $2,476 PERFORMANCE RATIOS Return on average equity 18 % 23 % Operating margin (c) 23 26 SERVICING STATISTICS (at December 31) Accounting/administration net fund assets(in billions) (d) Domestic $764 $869 Offshore 75 121 Total $839 $990 Asset type (in billions) Money market $431 $373 Equity 227 390 Fixed income 103 123 Other 78 104 Total $839 $990 Custody fund assets (in billions) $379 $500 Shareholder accounts (in millions) Transfer agency 14 19 Subaccounting 58 53 Total 72 72 OTHER INFORMATION Full time employees (at December 31) 4,934 4,784 (a) Certain out of pocket expense items which are then client billable are included in both servicing revenue and operating expense above, but offset each other entirely and therefore have no effect on operating income.

(b) Net of nonoperating expense. (c) Total operating income divided by total servicing revenue. (d) Includes alternative investment net assets serviced. Global Investment Servicing earned $122 million for 2008 and $128 million for 2007. Results for 2008 were negatively impacted by declines in asset values and fund redemptions as a result of severe deterioration of the financial markets during the fourth quarter. Highlights of Global Investment Servicings performance for 2008 included: Initiatives in the offshore arena resulted in a 13% increase in offshore servicing revenue. This included the start up of a new servicing location in Poland which employed 69 individuals at year end. Assets serviced, however, decreased by 38% as a direct result of the unsettled global equity markets and the resultant high redemption activity in the latter part of the year. Subaccounting shareholder accounts rose by 5 million, or 9%, to 58 million, as existing clients continued to convert additional fund families to this platform. Global Investment Servicing remains a leading provider of subaccounting services. A prominent new client was won during 2008 due to the combined subaccounting services and wealth reporting capabilities that Global Investment Servicing can now provide as a result of its acquisition of Albridge Solutions in December 2007. Total accounting/administration funds serviced increased 7% over the prior year. However, assets serviced decreased 15% due to declines in asset values and fund outflows resulting from market conditions, primarily in the fourth quarter of 2008. Servicing revenue for 2008 reached $947 million, an increase of $84 million, or 10%, over 2007. This increase resulted primarily from the acquisitions of Albridge Solutions and Coates Analytics, LP in December 2007, growth in offshore operations, and increased securities lending activities afforded by the volatility in the markets. Operating expense increased $91 million, or 14%, to $728 million, in 2008 compared with 2007. Investments in technology, a larger employee base to support business growth, and costs related to the acquisitions made in December 2007 drove the higher expense level. Debt financing costs and nonoperating income were both lower than prior year levels due to the much lower interest rate environment and principal payments on debt during the year. Global Investment Servicings balance sheet was also impacted by the market turmoil at year end as clients chose to leave cash balances uninvested. Total assets serviced by Global Investment Servicing totaled $2.0 trillion at December 31, 2008 compared with $2.5 trillion at December 31, 2007. The decline in assets serviced was a direct result of global market declines. 54 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS Our consolidated financial statements are prepared by applying certain accounting policies. Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report describes the most significant accounting policies that we use. Certain of these policies require us to make estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or be subject to variations that may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods. Fair Value Measurements We must use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value. This includes the initial measurement at fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions qualifying as business combinations under SFAS 141 or SFAS 141(R), Business Combinations. The valuation of both financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities in these transactions require numerous assumptions and estimates and the use of third party sources including appraisers and valuation specialists. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including those elected under SFAS 159, include available for sale and trading securities, financial derivatives, certain commercial and residential mortgage loans held for sale, customer resale agreements, private equity investments, and residential mortgage servicing rights. Fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on either quoted market prices or are provided by other independent third party sources, when available. When such third party information is not available, we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations. Effective January 1, 2008, PNC adopted SFAS 157. SFAS 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. SFAS 157 established a three level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used in the measurement are observable or unobservable. The following sections of this Report provide further information on this type of activity: Fair Value Measurements and Fair Value Option included within this Item 7, and Note 8 Fair Value included in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. Allowances For Loan And Lease Losses And Unfunded Loan Commitments And Letters Of Credit We maintain allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit at levels that we believe to be adequate to absorb estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. We determine the adequacy of the allowances based on periodic evaluations of the loan and lease portfolios and other relevant factors. However, this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates, all of which may be susceptible to significant change, including, among others: Probability of default, Loss given default, Exposure at date of default, Amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, Value of collateral, Historical loss exposure, and Amounts for changes in economic conditions that may not be reflected in historical results. In determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses, we make specific allocations to impaired loans, allocations to pools of watchlist and non watchlist loans, and allocations to consumer and residential mortgage loans. We also allocate reserves to provide coverage for probable losses not covered in specific, pool and consumer reserve methodologies related to qualitative factors. While allocations are made to specific loans and pools of loans, the total reserve is available for all credit losses. Commercial lending is the largest category of credits and is the most sensitive to changes in assumptions and judgments underlying the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses. We have allocated approximately $2.6 billion, or 67%, of the allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2008 to the commercial lending category. Consumer and residential mortgage loan allocations are made at a total portfolio level based on historical loss experience adjusted for portfolio activity. Approximately $1.2 billion, or 32%, of the allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2008 have been allocated to these consumer lending categories. The remainder of the allowance is allocated to the other loans category.  55 Table of Contents To the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates, additional provision for credit losses may be required that would reduce future earnings. See the following for additional information: Allowances For Loan And Lease Losses And Unfunded Loan Commitments And Letters Of Credit in the Credit Risk Management section of this Item 7 (which includes an illustration of the estimated impact on the aggregate of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit assuming we increased pool reserve loss rates for certain loan categories), and Note 5 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report, and Allocation Of Allowance For Loan And Lease Losses in the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section. Estimated Cash Flows on Impaired Loans AICPA Statement of Position 03 3, Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer (SOP 03 3) provides guidance for accounting for certain loans that have experienced a deterioration of credit quality at the time of acquisition for which it is probable that the investor will be unable to collect all contractually required payments. The application of this guidance requires a two step process: the determination of which loans qualify due to credit quality deterioration and the determination of fair value and undiscounted expected cash flows for the loans that are in the scope of SOP 03 3. SOP 03 3 prohibits carrying over or creation of an allowance for loan losses in the initial accounting of all loans in scope. In our assessment of credit quality deterioration, we must make numerous assumptions, interpretations and judgments, based on internal and third party credit quality information and ultimately determine whether we believe it is probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due, including both principal and interest, according to the contractual terms of the loans. This is a point in time assessment and inherently subjective due to the nature of the available information and judgment involved. For those loans that qualify under SOP 03 3, the valuation process involves estimating the fair value of each loan at acquisition and determining the undiscounted expected cash flows to be realized from the loan both at acquisition and periodically throughout the life of the loan. Measurement of the fair value of the loan is based on the provisions of SFAS 157 as discussed above. The measurement of undiscounted expected cash flows involves assumptions and judgments as to credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, default rates, loss severity, payment speeds and collateral values. All of these factors are inherently subjective and can result in significant changes in the cash flow estimates over the life of the loan. Such changes increase future earnings volatility due to increases or decreases in the accretable yield (i.e., difference between the undiscounted expected cash flows and the fair value) recognized on the loan or the requirement to record a provision for credit losses if the decline in expected cash flows is attributable to a decline in credit quality. Goodwill Goodwill arising from business acquisitions represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired. Most of our goodwill relates to value inherent in the Retail Banking, Corporate & Institutional Banking and Global Investment Servicing businesses. The value of this goodwill is dependent upon our ability to provide quality, cost effective services in the face of competition from other market participants on a national and international basis. We also rely upon continuing investments in processing systems, the development of value added service features, and the ease of access by customers to our services. As such, the value of goodwill is ultimately supported by earnings, which is driven by transaction volume and, for certain businesses, the market value of assets under administration or for which processing services are provided. Lower earnings resulting from a lack of growth or our inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill, which could result in a current period charge to earnings. At least annually, management reviews the current operating environment and strategic direction of each reporting unit taking into consideration any events or changes in circumstances that may have an effect on the unit. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. This input is then used to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, which is compared to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then the goodwill of that reporting unit is not considered impaired. During the fourth quarter 2008, and the first quarter of 2009, PNC considered whether the decline in the fair value of our market capitalization due to market conditions is an indicator of declines in the fair value of the reporting units. Although the fair values of the reporting units decreased, their estimated fair values are still considered to be in excess of their respective carrying values. Based on the results of our analysis, there have been no impairment charges related to goodwill. See Note 9 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. Lease Residuals We provide financing for various types of equipment, aircraft, energy and power systems, and rolling stock through a variety of lease arrangements. Direct financing leases are carried at the sum of lease payments and the estimated residual value of the leased property, less unearned income. Residual value insurance or guarantees by governmental entities provide support for a significant portion of the residual value. Residual 56 Table of Contents values are subject to judgments as to the value of the underlying equipment that can be affected by changes in economic and market conditions and the financial viability of the residual guarantors and insurers. To the extent not guaranteed or assumed by a third party, or otherwise insured against, we bear the risk of ownership of the leased assets. This includes the risk that the actual value of the leased assets at the end of the lease term will be less than the residual value, which could result in an impairment charge and reduce earnings in the future. Residual values are reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis. Revenue Recognition We derive net interest and noninterest income from various sources, including: Lending, Securities portfolio, Asset management and fund servicing, Customer deposits, Loan servicing, Brokerage services, Merger and acquisition advisory services, Sale of loans and securities, Certain private equity activities, and Securities and derivatives trading activities including foreign exchange. We also earn fees and commissions from issuing loan commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, selling various insurance products, providing treasury management services and participating in certain capital markets transactions. Revenue earned on interest earning assets including the accretion of fair value adjustments on discounts for purchased loans is recognized based on the effective yield of the financial instrument. The timing and amount of revenue that we recognize in any period is dependent on estimates, judgments, assumptions, and interpretation of contractual terms. Changes in these factors can have a significant impact on revenue recognized in any period due to changes in products, market conditions or industry norms. Income Taxes In the normal course of business, we and our subsidiaries enter into transactions for which the tax treatment is unclear or subject to varying interpretations. In addition, filing requirements, methods of filing and the calculation of taxable income in various state and local jurisdictions are subject to differing interpretations. We evaluate and assess the relative risks and merits of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions, filing positions, filing methods and taxable income calculations after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent, and other information, and maintain tax accruals consistent with our evaluation of these relative risks and merits. The result of our evaluation and assessment is by its nature an estimate. We and our subsidiaries are routinely subject to audit and challenges from taxing authorities. In the event we resolve a challenge for an amount different than amounts previously accrued, we will account for the difference in the period in which we resolve the matter. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on the following recent accounting pronouncements that are relevant to our business, including a description of each new pronouncement, the required date of adoption, our planned date of adoption, and the expected impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Benefits are derived from a cash balance formula based on compensation levels, age and length of service. Pension contributions are based on an actuarially determined amount necessary to fund total benefits payable to plan participants. Consistent with our investment strategy, plan assets are primarily invested in equity investments and fixed income instruments. Plan fiduciaries determine and review the plans investment policy. We calculate the expense associated with the pension plan in accordance with SFAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and we use assumptions and methods that are compatible with the requirements of SFAS 87, including a policy of reflecting trust assets at their fair market value. On an annual basis, we review the actuarial assumptions related to the pension plan, including the discount rate, the rate of compensation increase and the expected return on plan assets. The discount rate and compensation increase assumptions do not significantly affect pension expense. However, the expected long term return on assets assumption does significantly affect pension expense. The expected long term return on plan assets for determining net periodic pension cost for 2008 was 8.25%, unchanged from 2007. Under current accounting rules, the difference between expected long term returns and actual returns is accumulated and amortized to pension expense over future periods. Each one percentage point difference in actual return compared with our expected return causes expense in subsequent years to change by up to $7 million as the impact is amortized into results of operations. The table below reflects the estimated effects on pension expense of certain changes in annual assumptions, using 2009 estimated expense as a baseline. Change in Assumption EstimatedIncrease to 2009PensionExpense (In millions) .5% decrease in discount rate (a) .5% decrease in expected long term return on assets $ 16 .5% increase in compensation rate $ 2 (a) De minimis. We currently estimate a pretax pension expense of $124 million in 2009 compared with a pretax benefit of $32 million in 2008. The 2009 values and sensitivities shown above include the qualified defined benefit plan maintained by National City that we merged into the PNC plan as of December 31, 2008. The expected increase in pension cost is attributable not only to the National City acquisition, but also to the significant variance between 2008 actual investment returns and long term expected returns. Our pension plan contribution requirements are not particularly sensitive to actuarial assumptions. Investment performance has the most impact on contribution requirements and will drive the amount of permitted contributions in future years. Also, current law, including the provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, sets limits as to both minimum and maximum contributions to the plan. We expect that the minimum required contributions under the law will be zero for 2009. We maintain other defined benefit plans that have a less significant effect on financial results, including various nonqualified supplemental retirement plans for certain employees. See Note 15 Employee Benefit Plans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. RISK MANAGEMENT We encounter risk as part of the normal course of our business and we design risk management processes to help manage these risks. This Risk Management section first provides an overview of the risk measurement, control strategies, and monitoring aspects of our corporate level risk management processes. Following that discussion is an analysis of the risk management process for what we view as our primary areas of risk: credit, operational, liquidity, and market. The discussion of market risk is further subdivided into interest rate, trading, and equity and other investment risk areas. Our use of financial derivatives as part of our overall asset and liability risk management process is also addressed within the Risk Management section of this Item 7. In appropriate places within this section, historical performance is also addressed. 58 Table of Contents OVERVIEW As a financial services organization, we take a certain amount of risk in every business decision. For example, every time we open an account or approve a loan for a customer, process a payment, hire a new employee, or implement a new computer system, we incur a certain amount of risk. As an organization, we must balance revenue generation and profitability with the risks associated with our business activities. Risk management is not about eliminating risks, but about identifying and accepting risks and then effectively managing them so as to optimize shareholder value. The key to effective risk management is to be proactive in identifying, measuring, evaluating, and monitoring risk on an ongoing basis. Risk management practices support decision making, improve the success rate for new initiatives, and strengthen the markets confidence in an organization. We manage risk toward an overall moderate risk profile. The current economic environment, combined with our acquisition of National City, has increased our risk profile above that desired level. We remain committed to a moderate risk profile and are working to return to that level of overall risk. CORPORATE LEVEL RISK MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW We support risk management through a governance structure involving the Board, senior management and a corporate risk management organization. Although our Board as a whole is responsible generally for oversight of risk management, committees of the Board provide oversight to specific areas of risk with respect to the level of risk and risk management structure. We use management level risk committees to help ensure that business decisions are executed within our desired risk profile. The Executive Committee (EC), consisting of senior management executives, provides oversight for the establishment and implementation of new comprehensive risk management initiatives, reviews enterprise level risk profiles and discusses key risk issues. The corporate risk management organization has the following key roles: Facilitate the identification, assessment and monitoring of risk across PNC, Provide support and oversight to the businesses, and Identify and implement risk management best practices, as appropriate. Risk Measurement We conduct risk measurement activities specific to each area of risk. The primary vehicle for aggregation of enterprise wide risk is a comprehensive risk management methodology that is based on economic capital. This primary risk aggregation measure is supplemented with secondary measures of risk to arrive at an estimate of enterprise wide risk. The economic capital framework is a measure of potential losses above and beyond expected losses. Potential one year losses are capitalized to a level commensurate with a financial institution with an A rating by the credit rating agencies. Economic capital incorporates risk associated with potential credit losses (Credit Risk), fluctuations of the estimated market value of financial instruments (Market Risk), failure of people, processes or systems (Operational Risk), and income losses associated with declining volumes, margins and or fees, and the fixed cost structure of the business (Business Risk). We estimate credit and market risks at an exposure level while we estimate the remaining risk types at an institution or business segment level. We routinely compare the output of our economic capital model with industry benchmarks. Risk Control Strategies We centrally manage policy development and exception oversight through corporate level risk management. Corporate risk management is authorized to take action to either prevent or mitigate exceptions to policies and is responsible for monitoring compliance with risk management policies. The Corporate Audit function performs an independent assessment of the internal control environment. Corporate Audit plays a critical role in risk management, testing the operation of the internal control system and reporting findings to management and to the Audit Committee of the Board. Risk Monitoring Corporate risk management reports on a regular basis to our Board regarding the enterprise risk profile of the Corporation. These reports aggregate and present the level of risk by type of risk and communicate significant risk issues, including performance relative to risk tolerance limits. Both the Board and the EC provide guidance on actions to address key risk issues as identified in these reports. CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT Credit risk represents the possibility that a customer, counterparty or issuer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms. Credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from extending credit to customers, purchasing securities, and entering into financial derivative transactions and certain guarantee contracts. Credit risk is one of our most significant risks. Approved risk tolerances, in addition to credit policies and procedures, set portfolio objectives for the level of credit risk. We have established guidelines for problem loans, acceptable levels of total borrower exposure, and other credit measures. We seek to achieve our credit portfolio objectives by maintaining a customer base that is diverse in borrower exposure and industry types. We use loan participations with third parties, loan sales and syndications, and the purchase of credit derivatives to reduce risk concentrations. The credit granting businesses maintain direct responsibility for monitoring credit risk within PNC. The Corporate Credit 59 Table of Contents Policy area provides independent oversight to the measurement, monitoring and reporting of our credit risk and reports to the Chief Administrative Officer. Corporate Audit also provides an independent assessment of the effectiveness of the credit risk management process. Nonperforming, Past Due And Potential Problem Assets See the Nonperforming Assets And Related Information table in the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section of Item 8 of this Report and included here by reference for details of the types of nonperforming assets that we held at December 31 of each of the past five years. In addition, certain performing assets have interest payments that are past due or have the potential for future repayment problems. Credit quality migration reflected a rapidly weakening economy during 2008, but remained manageable as we were able to maintain a strong capital position and generate positive operating leverage. We remained focused on returning to a moderate risk profile.

Nonperforming assets of National City are comprised of $250 million of nonperforming loans, including $154 million related to commercial lending and $96 million related to consumer lending, and $472 million of foreclosed and other assets. (b) Includes loans related to customers in the real estate and construction industries. (c) We have adjusted the December 31, 2007 amounts to be consistent with the current methodology for recognizing nonaccrual residential mortgage loans serviced under master servicing arrangements. (d) Excludes equity management assets carried at estimated fair value of $42 million at December 31, 2008 and $4 million at December 31, 2007. (e) Excludes loans held for sale carried at lower of cost or market value of $78 million at December 31, 2008 (amount includes troubled debt restructured assets of $5 million) and $25 million at December 31, 2007. Nonperforming loans at December 31, 2008 included $537 million related to the distressed loan portfolio, of which $103 million were attributable to National City. Details of these nonperforming loans follow.

Total nonperforming assets at December 31, 2008 increased $1.670 billion, to $2.165 billion, from the balance at December 31, 2007. Our nonperforming assets represented .74% of total assets at December 31, 2008 compared with .36% at December 31, 2007. The increase in nonperforming assets reflected higher nonaccrual residential real estate development loans and loans in related sectors, and the addition of $722 million of nonperforming assets related to National City. Nonperforming assets added with the National City acquisition exclude those loans that we impaired in accordance with SOP 03 3. 60 Table of Contents We recorded such loans at estimated fair value and considered them to be performing, even if contractually past due (or if we do not expect to receive payment in full based on the original contractual terms), since certain purchase accounting adjustments will be accreted to interest income over time. The accretion will represent the discount associated with the difference between the expected cash flows and estimated fair value of the loans. This accounting treatment resulted in the return to performing status of $3.2 billion of loans previously classified as nonperforming by National City. The purchase accounting adjustments were estimated as of December 31, 2008 and such estimates may be refined during the first quarter of 2009. At December 31, 2008, our largest nonperforming asset was approximately $36 million and our average nonperforming loan associated with commercial lending was less than $1 million. The amount of nonperforming loans that was current as to principal and interest was $555 million at December 31, 2008 and $178 million at December 31, 2007.

Allowances For Loan And Lease Losses And Unfunded Loan Commitments And Letters Of Credit We maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses to absorb losses from the loan portfolio. We determine the allowance based on quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio. While we make allocations to specific loans and pools of loans, the total reserve is available for all loan and lease losses. In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we maintain an allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. We report this allowance as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We determine this amount using estimates of the probability of the ultimate funding and losses related to those credit exposures. This methodology is similar to the one we use for determining the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses. We refer you to Note 5 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report regarding changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses and in the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. Also see the Allocation Of Allowance For Loan And Lease Losses table in the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section of Item 8 of this Report for additional information included herein by reference. We establish specific allowances for loans considered impaired using a method prescribed by SFAS 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan. All impaired loans except leases and large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans which may include but are not limited to credit card, residential mortgage, and consumer installment loans are subject to SFAS 114 analysis. Specific allowances for individual loans over a set dollar threshold are determined by our Special Asset Committee based on an analysis of the present value of expected future cash flows from the loans discounted at their effective interest rate, observable market price, or the fair value of the underlying collateral. We establish specific allowance on all other impaired loans based on the loss given default credit risk rating. Allocations to non impaired commercial and commercial real estate loans (pool reserve allocations) are assigned to pools of loans as defined by our business structure and are based on internal probability of default and loss given default credit risk ratings. Key elements of the pool reserve methodology include: Probability of default (PD), which is primarily based on historical default analyses and is derived from the borrowers internal PD credit risk rating; Exposure at default (EAD), which is derived from historical default data; and Loss given default (LGD), which is based on historical loss data, collateral value and other structural factors that may affect our ultimate ability to collect on the loan and is derived from the loans internal LGD credit risk rating. Our pool reserve methodology is sensitive to changes in key risk parameters such as PDs, LGDs and EADs. In general, a given change in any of the major risk parameters will have a corresponding change in the pool reserve allocations for non impaired commercial loans. Our commercial loans are the largest category of credits and are most sensitive to changes in the key risk parameters and pool reserve loss rates. To illustrate, if we increase the pool reserve loss rates by 5% for all categories of non impaired commercial loans, then the 61 Table of Contents aggregate of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit would increase by $128 million. Additionally, other factors such as the rate of migration in the severity of problem loans will contribute to the final pool reserve allocations. We make consumer (including residential mortgage) loan allocations at a total portfolio level by consumer product line based on historical loss experience. We compute a four quarter average loss rate from net charge offs for the prior four quarters as a percentage of the average loans outstanding in those quarters. We apply this loss rate to loans outstanding at the end of the current period and make certain qualitative adjustments to determine the consumer loan allocation. The provision for credit losses totaled $1.517 billion for 2008 compared with $315 million for 2007. Of the total 2008 provision, $990 million was recorded in the fourth quarter, including $504 million of additional provision recorded at December 31, 2008 to conform the National City loan reserving methodology with ours. The differences in methodology include granularity of loss computations, statistical and quantitative factors rather than qualitative assessment, and the extent of current appraisals and risk assessments. In addition to the impact of National City, the higher provision in 2008 compared with the prior year was driven by general credit quality migration, including residential real estate development and commercial real estate exposure, an increase in net charge offs, and growth in nonperforming loans. Growth in our total credit exposure also contributed to the higher provision amounts in both comparisons. In addition, the provision for credit losses for 2008 and the evaluation of the allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit as of December 31, 2008 reflected loan and total credit exposure growth, changes in loan portfolio composition, and other changes in asset quality. The provision includes amounts for probable losses on loans and credit exposure related to unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. With a deteriorating economy, we expect credit migration will continue throughout 2009 as credit quality improvements will lag any economic turnaround. The allowance as a percent of nonperforming loans was 236% and as a percent of total loans was 2.23% at December 31, 2008. These percentages excluding the impact of the National City acquisition were 95% and 1.77%, respectively. We provide a reconciliation of these percentages excluding the National City impact to the GAAP basis percentages in the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section in Item 8 of this Report. The comparable percentages at December 31, 2007 were 183% and 1.21%. We expect to continue to increase our allowance as a percent of total loans as the market and our credit quality migration dictates.

The amount of reserves for these qualitative factors is assigned to loan categories and to business segments primarily based on the relative specific and pool allocation amounts. The amount of reserve allocated for qualitative factors represented 1.76% of the total allowance and .04% of total loans at December 31, 2008. CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS From a credit risk management perspective, we buy and sell credit loss protection via the use of credit derivatives. When we buy loss protection by purchasing a credit default swap (CDS), we pay a fee to the seller, or CDS counterparty, in return for the right to receive a payment if a specified credit event occurs for a particular obligor or reference entity. We purchase CDSs to mitigate the risk of economic loss on a portion of our loan exposures. We also sell loss protection to mitigate the net premium cost and the impact of fair value accounting on the CDS in cases where we buy protection to hedge the loan portfolio and for trading purposes. These activities represent additional risk positions rather than hedges of risk. 62 Table of Contents We approve counterparty credit lines for all of our trading activities, including CDSs. Counterparty credit lines are approved based on a review of credit quality in accordance with our traditional credit quality standards and credit policies. The credit risk of our counterparties is monitored in the normal course of business. In addition, all counterparty credit lines are subject to collateral thresholds and exposures above these thresholds are secured. Credit default swaps are included in the Free Standing Derivatives table in the Financial Derivatives section of this Risk Management discussion. Net gains from credit default swaps for proprietary trading positions, reflected in other noninterest income in our Consolidated Income Statement, totaled $45 million for 2008 and $38 million for 2007. OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT Operational risk is defined as the risk of financial loss or other damage to us resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human factors, or from external events. Operational risk may occur in any of our business activities and manifests itself in various ways, including but not limited to the following: Errors related to transaction processing and systems, Breaches of the system of internal controls and compliance requirements, and Business interruptions and execution of unauthorized transactions and fraud by employees or third parties. Operational losses may arise from legal actions due to operating deficiencies or noncompliance with contracts, laws or regulations. To monitor and control operational risk, we maintain a comprehensive framework including policies and a system of internal controls that is designed to manage risk and to provide management with timely and accurate information about the operations of PNC. Management at each business unit is primarily responsible for its operational risk management program, given that operational risk management is integral to direct business management and most easily effected at the business unit level. Corporate Operational Risk Management oversees day to day operational risk management activities. Technology Risk The technology risk management program is a significant component of the operational risk framework. We have an integrated security and technology risk management framework designed to help ensure a secure, sound, and compliant infrastructure for information management. The technology risk management process is aligned with the strategic direction of the businesses and is integrated into the technology management culture, structure and practices. The application of this framework across the enterprise helps to support comprehensive and reliable internal controls. Our business resiliency program manages the organizations capabilities to provide services in the case of an event that results in material disruption of business activities. Prioritization of investments in people, processes, technology and facilities is based on different types of events, business risk and criticality. Comprehensive testing validates our resiliency capabilities on an ongoing basis, and an integrated governance model is designed to help assure transparent management reporting. Insurance As a component of our risk management practices, we purchase insurance designed to protect us against accidental loss or losses which, in the aggregate, may significantly affect personnel, property, financial objectives, or our ability to continue to meet our responsibilities to our various stakeholder groups. PNC, through subsidiary companies, Alpine Indemnity Limited and Advent Guaranty Corporation, provides insurance coverage for its general liability, automobile liability, management liability, fidelity, employment practices liability, special crime, workers compensation, property and terrorism programs. PNCs risks associated with its participation as an insurer for these programs are mitigated through policy limits and annual aggregate limits. Risks in excess of Alpine and Advent policy limits and annual aggregates are mitigated through the purchase of direct coverage provided by various insurers up to limits established by PNCs Corporate Insurance Committee. LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT Liquidity risk is the risk of potential loss if we were unable to meet our funding requirements at a reasonable cost. We manage liquidity risk to help ensure that we can obtain cost effective funding to meet current and future obligations under both normal business as usual and stressful circumstances. Our largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is the deposit base that comes from our retail and corporate and institutional banking activities. Other borrowed funds come from a diverse mix of short and long term funding sources. Liquid assets and unused borrowing capacity from a number of sources are also available to maintain our liquidity position. Liquid assets consist of short term investments (federal funds sold, resale agreements, trading securities, interest earning deposits with banks, and other short term investments) and securities available for sale. At December 31, 2008, our liquid assets totaled $59.6 billion, with $22.5 billion pledged as collateral for borrowings, trust, and other commitments. Bank Level Liquidity PNC Bank, N.A. and National City Bank can borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of Clevelands (Federal Reserve Bank) discount window to meet short term liquidity requirements. These borrowings are secured by securities and 63 Table of Contents commercial loans. PNC Bank, N.A. is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) Pittsburgh and as such has access to advances from FHLB Pittsburgh secured generally by residential mortgage and other mortgage related loans. At December 31, 2008, we maintained significant unused borrowing capacity from the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and FHLB Pittsburgh under current collateral requirements. In addition, National City Bank is a member of FHLB Cincinnati. Information regarding amounts pledged, for the ability to borrow if necessary, and borrowings related to the Federal Reserve Bank, FHLB Pittsburgh and FHLB Cincinnati are as follows: In billions Dec. 31,2008 Dec. 31,2007 Pledged to Federal Reserve Bank Loans $ 32.9 $ 1.6 Securities $ 11.0 $ 18.8 Combined collateral value $ 35.4 $ 18.2 Pledged to FHLB Pittsburgh Loans $ 27.1 $ 33.5 Securities $ 5.3 $ 4.3 Combined collateral value $ 16.7 $ 23.5 Pledged to FHLB Cincinnati Loans $ 22.3 Securities $ 1.1 Combined collateral value $ 6.5 Outstanding borrowings Federal Reserve Bank $ 2.0 FHLB Pittsburgh $ 8.8 $ 6.8 FHLB Cincinnati $ 6.5 Total $ 17.3 $ 6.8 Unused borrowing capacity Federal Reserve Bank $ 33.4 $ 18.2 FHLB Pittsburgh $ 7.9 16.7 FHLB Cincinnati Total $ 41.3 $ 34.9 Total FHLB borrowings were $18.1 billion at December 31, 2008 compared with $7.1 billion at December 31, 2007. We increased total FHLB borrowings during 2008 which provided us with additional liquidity at relatively attractive rates. We can also obtain funding through traditional forms of borrowing, including federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements, and short and long term debt issuances. PNC Bank, N.A. has the ability to offer up to $20 billion in senior and subordinated unsecured debt obligations with maturities of more than nine months. Through December 31, 2008, PNC Bank, N.A. had issued $6.9 billion of debt under this program. PNC Bank, N.A. also has the ability to offer up to $3.0 billion of its commercial paper. As of December 31, 2008, $327 million of commercial paper was outstanding under this program. As of December 31, 2008, there were $3.1 billion of PNC Bank, N.A. and $4.8 billion of National City Bank short and long term debt issuances, including commercial paper, with maturities of less than one year. Parent Company Liquidity Our parent companys routine funding needs consist primarily of dividends to PNC shareholders, share repurchases, debt service, the funding of non bank affiliates, and acquisitions. See the Funding and Capital Sources section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Report regarding certain restrictions on dividends and common share repurchases related to PNCs participation in the US Treasurys TARP Capital Purchase Program. Parent company liquidity guidelines are designed to help ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet these requirements over the succeeding 12 month period. In managing parent company liquidity we consider funding sources, such as expected dividends to be received from our subsidiaries and potential debt issuance, and discretionary funding uses, the most significant of which is the external dividend to be paid on PNCs stock. On March 1, 2009, the Board decided to reduce PNCs quarterly common stock dividend from $0.66 to $0.10 per share. This action will reduce the cash requirement for annual external dividends by approximately $1.0 billion. The principal source of parent company cash flow is the dividends it receives from its subsidiary banks, which may be impacted by the following: Capital needs, Laws and regulations, Corporate policies, Contractual restrictions, and Other factors. Also, there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of national banks to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to extend credit to the parent company or its non bank subsidiaries. See Note 23 Regulatory Matters in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for a further discussion of these limitations. Dividends may also be impacted by the banks capital needs and by contractual restrictions. We provide additional information on certain contractual restrictions under the Perpetual Trust Securities, PNC Capital Trust E Trust Preferred Securities, and Acquired Entity Trust Preferred Securities sections of the Off Balance Sheet Arrangements And Variable Interest Entities section of this Financial Review. The amount available for dividend payments to the parent company by PNC Bank, N.A. without prior regulatory approval was approximately $351 million at December 31, 2008. National City Bank had no statutory dividend capacity as of December 31, 2008. 64 Table of Contents In addition to dividends from PNC Bank, N.A., other sources of parent company liquidity include cash and short term investments, as well as dividends and loan repayments from other subsidiaries and dividends or distributions from equity investments. As of December 31, 2008, the parent company had approximately $4.2 billion in funds available from its cash and short term investments. We can also generate liquidity for the parent company and PNCs non bank subsidiaries through the issuance of securities in public or private markets. In December 2008, PNC Funding Corp issued the following securities totaling $2.9 billion under the FDICs Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program Debt Guarantee Program: $2 billion of fixed rate senior notes due June 2012. These notes pay interest semiannually at a fixed rate of 2.3%. $500 million of fixed rate senior notes due June 2011. These notes pay interest semiannually at a fixed rate of 1.875%. $400 million of floating rate senior notes due June 2011. Interest will be reset quarterly to 3 month LIBOR plus 28 basis points and interest will be paid quarterly. Each of these series of senior notes is guaranteed by the parent company and by the FDIC and is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States through June 30, 2012. See the Executive Summary section of this Financial Review and Note 19 Shareholders Equity in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for information regarding PNCs December 31, 2008 issuance of $7.6 billion of preferred stock and related common stock warrant to the US Treasury under the TARP Capital Purchase Program. PNC Funding Corp has the ability to offer up to $3.0 billion of commercial paper to provide the parent company with additional liquidity. As of December 31, 2008, $99 million of commercial paper was outstanding under this program. We have effective shelf registration statements which enable us to issue additional debt and equity securities, including certain hybrid capital instruments. As of December 31, 2008, there were $1.4 billion of parent company contractual obligations, including commercial paper, with maturities of less than one year. We also provide tables showing contractual obligations and various other commitments representing required and potential cash outflows as of December 31, 2008 under the heading Commitments below. Commitments The following tables set forth contractual obligations and various other commitments representing required and potential cash outflows as of December 31, 2008.

Also includes commitments related to tax credit investments of $690 million which are included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 65 Table of Contents MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW Market risk is the risk of a loss in earnings or economic value due to adverse movements in market factors such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and equity prices. We are exposed to market risk primarily by our involvement in the following activities, among others: Traditional banking activities of taking deposits and extending loans, Private equity and other investments and activities whose economic values are directly impacted by market factors, and Trading in fixed income products, equities, derivatives, and foreign exchange, as a result of customer activities, underwriting, and proprietary trading. We have established enterprise wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor, and report market risk. Market Risk Management provides independent oversight by monitoring compliance with these limits and guidelines, and reporting significant risks in the business to the Risk Committee of the Board. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT INTEREST RATE RISK Interest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates, and consumer preferences, affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities and the level of our noninterest bearing funding sources. Due to the repricing term mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these products, changes in market interest rates not only affect expected near term earnings, but also the economic values of these assets and liabilities. Asset and Liability Management centrally manages interest rate risk within limits and guidelines set forth in our risk management policies approved by the Asset and Liability Committee and the Risk Committee of the Board. Sensitivity results and market interest rate benchmarks for the fourth quarters of 2008 and 2007 follow: Interest Sensitivity Analysis FourthQuarter2008 FourthQuarter2007 Net Interest Income Sensitivity Simulation Effect on net interest income in first year from gradual interest rate change over following 12 months of: 100 basis point increase (0.7 )% (2.8 )% 100 basis point decrease (0.5 )% 2.9 % Effect on net interest income in second year from gradual interest rate change over the preceding 12 months of: 100 basis point increase 1.9 % (6.4 )% 100 basis point decrease (3.1 )% 4.4 % Duration of Equity Model Base case duration of equity (in years): NM (a) 2.1 Key Period End Interest Rates One month LIBOR .44 % 4.60 % Three year swap 1.76 % 3.91 % (a) NM not meaningful. Given the inherent limitations in certain of these measurement tools and techniques, results become less meaningful as interest rates approach zero. In addition to measuring the effect on net interest income assuming parallel changes in current interest rates, we routinely simulate the effects of a number of nonparallel interest rate environments. The following Net Interest Income Sensitivity To Alternative Rate Scenarios table reflects the percentage change in net interest income over the next two 12 month periods assuming (i) the PNC Economists most likely rate forecast, (ii) implied market forward rates, and (iii) a Two Ten Inversion (a 200 basis point inversion between two year and ten year rates superimposed on current base rates) scenario. 66 Table of Contents Net Interest Income Sensitivity To Alternative Rate Scenarios (Fourth Quarter 2008) PNCEconomist MarketForward Two TenInversion First year sensitivity 0.5 % (0.2 )% 2.3 % Second year sensitivity 4.9 % 2.4 % 2.3 % All changes in forecasted net interest income are relative to results in a base rate scenario where current market rates are assumed to remain unchanged over the forecast horizon. When forecasting net interest income, we make assumptions about interest rates and the shape of the yield curve, the volume and characteristics of new business, and the behavior of existing on and off balance sheet positions. These assumptions determine the future level of simulated net interest income in the base interest rate scenario and the other interest rate scenarios presented in the following table. These simulations assume that as assets and liabilities mature, they are replaced or repriced at market rates. The graph below presents the yield curves for the base rate scenario and each of the alternate scenarios one year forward. The results of the fourth quarter 2008 interest sensitivity analyses reflect our current best estimates of the impact of integrating National Citys balance sheet, including the preliminary effects of purchase accounting, balance sheet repositioning, and deposit pricing strategies. Going forward as these estimates and strategies are finalized or revised, the results of our analyses may change. The fourth quarter 2008 analyses also reflect the impact of the rapid decline in market interest rates that occurred during that quarter, in which period end one month LIBOR and three year swap rates declined 349 basis points and 197 basis points, respectively. The fourth quarter 2008 interest sensitivity analyses indicate that our Consolidated Balance Sheet is positioned to benefit from an increase in interest rates. We believe that we have the deposit funding base and balance sheet flexibility to adjust, where appropriate and permissible, to changing interest rates and market conditions. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT TRADING RISK Our trading activities include customer driven trading in fixed income securities, equities, derivatives, and foreign exchange contracts. They also include the underwriting of fixed income and equity securities and proprietary trading. We use value at risk (VaR) as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in trading activities. The Risk Committee of the Board establishes an enterprise wide VaR limit on our trading activities. During 2008, our VaR ranged between $5.4 million and $18.4 million, averaging $10.8 million. During 2007, our VaR ranged between $6.1 million and $12.8 million, averaging $8.5 million. The increase in VaR compared with 2007 reflected ongoing market volatility. To help ensure the integrity of the models used to calculate VaR for each portfolio and enterprise wide, we use a process known as backtesting. The backtesting process consists of comparing actual observations of trading related gains or losses against the VaR levels that were calculated at the close of the prior day. Under typical market conditions, we would expect an average of two to three instances a year in which actual losses exceeded the prior day VaR measure at the enterprise wide level. As a result of increased volatility in certain markets, there were 10 such instances during 2008 compared with two such instances in 2007. The following graph shows a comparison of enterprise wide trading related gains and losses against prior day VaR for the period. Total trading revenue for the past three years was as follows: Year end December 31 in millions 2008 2007 2006 Net interest income (expense) $ 72 $ 7 $ (6 ) Noninterest income (55 ) 104 183 Total trading revenue $ 17 $ 111 $ 177 Securities underwriting andtrading (a) $ (17 ) $ 41 $ 38 Foreign exchange 73 58 55 Financial derivatives (39 ) 12 84 Total trading revenue $ 17 $ 111 $ 177 (a) Includes changes in fair value for certain loans accounted for at fair value. 67 Table of Contents The decline in total trading revenue for 2008 primarily related to losses sustained in our proprietary trading activities. These decreases reflected the negative impact of significant widening of market credit spreads in extremely illiquid markets. We took the following steps during 2008 to reduce our proprietary trading positions: Sold Hilliard Lyons on March 31, 2008, including their proprietary trading positions; Significantly reduced the PNC Capital Markets municipal bond arbitrage book during the first half of 2008, closing it completely by August 2008; Reduced significantly proprietary risk taking within the customer focused equity derivatives book during 2008; Reduced convertible arbitrage book positions during 2008 from close to $225 million face value of bonds to close to $100 million; Terminated all derivative positions hedging municipal bond exposure in tender option bond trusts, terminated the trusts, and transferred the remaining long municipal bond position (approximately $300 million face value) to the available for sale portfolio. This transfer occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008; Sold down approximately 80% of the positions in the non agency mortgage backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities proprietary trading books during 2008. The remaining positions (market value of approximately $300 million) were transferred to the available for sale portfolio after terminating swap hedges. This transfer occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008; and Significantly reduced all other proprietary trading positions including interest rate swaps, futures, swap options and credit default swaps. Trading securities at December 31, 2008 totaled $1.7 billion, including $1 billion from National City, compared with $3.6 billion at December 31, 2007 and reflected our risk management actions outlined above. Average trading assets and liabilities for the past three years consisted of the following: Year ended in millions 2008 2007 2006 Assets Securities (a) $ 2,387 $ 2,708 $ 1,712 Resale agreements (b) 1,794 1,133 623 Financial derivatives (c) 2,389 1,378 1,148 Loans at fair value (c) 83 166 128 Total assets $ 6,653 $ 5,385 $ 3,611 Liabilities Securities sold short (d) $ 1,294 $ 1,657 $ 965 Repurchase agreements and other borrowings (e) 756 520 833 Financial derivatives (f) 2,423 1,384 1,103 Borrowings at fair value (f) 22 39 31 Total liabilities $ 4,495 $ 3,600 $ 2,932 (a) Included in Interest earning assets Other on the Average Consolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest Analysis.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENT RISK Equity investment risk is the risk of potential losses associated with investing in both private and public equity markets. In addition to extending credit, taking deposits, and underwriting and trading financial instruments, we make and manage direct investments in a variety of transactions, including management buyouts, recapitalizations, and later stage growth financings in a variety of industries. We also have investments in affiliated and non affiliated funds that make similar investments in private equity and in debt and equity oriented hedge funds. The economic and or book value of these investments and other assets such as loan servicing rights are directly affected by changes in market factors. The primary risk measurement for equity and other investments is economic capital. Economic capital is a common measure of risk for credit, market and operational risk. It is an estimate of the worst case value depreciation over one year within a 99.9% confidence level. Given the illiquid nature of many of these types of investments, it can be a challenge to determine their fair values. Market Risk Management and Finance provide independent oversight of the valuation process. Various PNC business units manage our private equity and other investment activities. Our businesses are responsible for making investment decisions within the approved policy limits and associated guidelines. BlackRock PNC owns approximately 43 million shares of BlackRock common stock, accounted for under the equity method. Our total investment in BlackRock was $4.2 billion at December 31, 2008 compared with $4.1 billion at December 31, 2007. The market value of our investment in BlackRock was $5.8 billion at December 31, 2008. The primary risk measurement, similar to other equity investments, is economic capital. The discussion of BlackRock within the Business Segments Review section of this Item 7 includes information about changes in our ownership structure of BlackRock in 2009. Tax Credit Investments Included in our equity investments are limited partnerships that sponsor tax credit investments. These investments, consisting of partnerships as well as equity investments held by consolidated partnerships, totaled $2.3 billion at December 31, 2008. Investments accounted for under the 68 Table of Contents equity method totaled $1.7 billion while investments accounted for under the cost method totaled $648 million at December 31, 2008. These investments totaled $1.0 billion at December 31, 2007, all of which were accounted for under the equity method. Visa At December 31, 2008, our remaining investment in Visa Class B common shares totaled approximately 23.2 million shares, including 19.7 million shares acquired in connection with our National City acquisition. The Visa B shares owned by National City were recorded by PNC at fair value (including a liquidity discount) as part of our acquisition. The PNC owned Visa B shares are recorded at zero book value. Considering the expected reduction in the IPO conversion ratio due to settled litigation reported by Visa, these shares would convert to approximately 14.6 million of the publicly traded Visa Class A common shares. Based on the December 31, 2008 closing price of $52.45 for the Visa shares, our remaining investment had an unrecognized pretax value of approximately $312 million at that date. The Visa Class B common shares we own generally will not be transferable until they can be converted into shares of the publicly traded class of stock, which cannot happen until the later of three years after the IPO or settlement of all of the specified litigation. As stated above, it is expected that Visa will continue to adjust the conversion ratio of Visa Class B to Class A shares in connection with settlements in excess of any amounts then in escrow for that purpose and will also reduce the conversion ratio to the extent that it adds any funds to the escrow in the future. Note 25 Commitments and Guarantees in our Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report has further information on our Visa indemnification obligation. Private Equity The private equity portfolio is comprised of equity and mezzanine investments that vary by industry, stage and type of investment. Private equity investments are reported at fair value. Changes in the values of private equity investments are reflected in our results of operations. Due to the nature of the investments, the valuations incorporate assumptions as to future performance, financial condition, liquidity, availability of capital, and market conditions, among other factors, to determine the estimated fair value of the investments. Market conditions and actual performance of the investments could differ from these assumptions. Accordingly, lower valuations may occur that could adversely impact earnings in future periods. Also, the valuations may not represent amounts that will ultimately be realized from these investments. See Note 1 Accounting Policies in Item 8 for additional information. At December 31, 2008, private equity investments carried at estimated fair value totaled $1.2 billion compared with $561 million at December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2008, $620 million was invested directly in a variety of companies and $566 million was invested indirectly through various private equity funds. Included in direct investments are investment activities of two private equity funds that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes. The minority and noncontrolling interests of these funds totaled $142 million as of December 31, 2008. Our unfunded commitments related to private equity totaled $540 million at December 31, 2008 compared with $270 million at December 31, 2007. Other Investments We also make investments in affiliated and non affiliated funds with both traditional and alternative investment strategies. The economic values could be driven by either the fixed income market or the equity markets, or both. At December 31, 2008, other investments totaled $853 million compared with $384 million at December 31, 2007. We recognized losses related to these investments of $156 million during 2008 including $76 million in the fourth quarter. Given the nature of these investments and if current market conditions affecting their valuation were to continue or worsen, we could incur future losses. Our unfunded commitments related to other investments totaled $178 million at December 31, 2008 compared with $79 million at December 31, 2007. IMPACT OF INFLATION Our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. Accordingly, future changes in prices do not affect the obligations to pay or receive fixed and determinable amounts of money. During periods of inflation, monetary assets lose value in terms of purchasing power and monetary liabilities have corresponding purchasing power gains. The concept of purchasing power, however, is not an adequate indicator of the effect of inflation on banks because it does not take into account changes in interest rates, which are an important determinant of our earnings. FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES We use a variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage interest rate, market and credit risk inherent in our business activities. Substantially all such instruments are used to manage risk related to changes in interest rates. Interest rate and total return swaps, interest rate caps and floors and futures contracts are the primary instruments we use for interest rate risk management. Financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, interest rate, market and credit risk. For interest rate swaps and total return swaps, options and futures contracts, only periodic cash payments and, with respect to options, premiums are exchanged. Therefore, cash requirements and exposure to credit risk are significantly less than the notional amount on these instruments. Further information on our financial derivatives is presented in Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 17 Financial Derivatives in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. 69 Table of Contents Not all elements of interest rate, market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial or other derivatives, and such instruments may be ineffective for their intended purposes due to unanticipated market characteristics, among other reasons. The following tables provide the notional or contractual amounts and estimated net fair value of financial derivatives used for risk management and designated as accounting hedges as well as free standing derivatives at December 31, 2008 and 2007. Weighted average interest rates presented are based on contractual terms, if fixed, or the implied forward yield curve at each respective date, if floating.

NM Not meaningful 71 Table of Contents 2007 VERSUS 2006 CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW Summary Results Consolidated net income for 2007 was $1.467 billion or $4.35 per diluted share and for 2006 was $2.595 billion or $8.73 per diluted share. Net income for 2006 included the after tax impact of the following items: The third quarter gain on the BlackRock/MLIM transaction of $1.3 billion, or $4.36 per diluted share; The third quarter securities portfolio rebalancing loss of $127 million, or $.43 per diluted share; BlackRock/MLIM transaction integration costs of $47 million, or $.16 per diluted share, and The third quarter mortgage loan portfolio repositioning loss of $31 million, or $.10 per diluted share. The aggregate impact of these items increased 2006 net income by $1.1 billion, or $3.67 per diluted share. Net Interest Income Net interest income was $2.915 billion for 2007 and $2.245 billion for 2006, an increase of $670 million, or 30%. This increase was consistent with the $20.3 billion, or 26%, increase in average interest earning assets during 2007 compared with 2006. The net interest margin was 3.00% in 2007 and 2.92% for 2006, an increase of 8 basis points. Provision For Credit Losses The provision for credit losses totaled $315 million for 2007 and $124 million for 2006. Of the total 2007 provision, $188 million was recorded in the fourth quarter, including approximately $45 million related to our Yardville acquisition. The higher provision in 2007 was also impacted by an increase in our real estate portfolio, including residential real estate development exposure, and growth in total credit exposure. Total residential real estate development outstandings were approximately $2.1 billion at December 31, 2007. Noninterest Income Summary Noninterest income was $3.790 billion for 2007 and $6.327 billion for 2006. Noninterest income for 2007 included the impact of an $83 million gain recognized in connection with our transfer of BlackRock shares to satisfy a portion of PNCs LTIP obligation and a $210 million net loss representing the mark to market adjustment on our LTIP obligation. Noninterest income for 2006 included the impact of the following items: The gain on the BlackRock/MLIM transaction, which totaled $2.078 billion, The effects of our third quarter 2006 balance sheet repositioning activities that resulted in charges totaling $244 million, and PNC consolidated BlackRock in its results for the first nine months of 2006 but accounted for BlackRock on the equity method for the fourth quarter of 2006 and all of 2007. Had our BlackRock investment been on the equity method for all of 2006, BlackRocks noninterest income reported by us would have been lower by $943 million for that year. Apart from the impact of these items, noninterest income increased $367 million, or 10%, in 2007 compared with 2006 largely as a result of the Mercantile acquisition and growth in several fee income categories. Additional analysis Fund servicing fees declined $58 million in 2007, to $835 million, compared with $893 million in the prior year. Amounts for 2006 included $117 million of distribution fee revenue at Global Investment Servicing. Effective January 1, 2007, we refined our accounting and reporting of Global Investment Servicings distribution fee revenue and related expense amounts and present these amounts net on a prospective basis. Prior to 2007, the distribution amounts were shown on a gross basis within fund servicing fees and within other noninterest expense and offset each other entirely with no impact on earnings. Apart from the impact of the distribution fee revenue included in the 2006 amounts, fund servicing fees increased $59 million in 2007 compared with the prior year. Higher revenue from offshore operations, transfer agency, managed accounts and alternative investments contributed to the increase in 2007, reflecting net new business and growth from existing clients. Asset management fees totaled $784 million for 2007 and $1.420 billion for 2006. Our equity income from BlackRock has been included in asset management fees beginning with the fourth quarter of 2006. Asset management fees were higher in 2006 as the first nine months of 2006 reflected the impact of BlackRocks revenue on a consolidated basis. Assets managed at December 31, 2007 totaled $74 billion compared with $54 billion at December 31, 2006. This increase resulted primarily from the Mercantile acquisition. Consumer services fees increased $81 million, or 13%, to $692 million in 2007 compared with 2006. The increase reflected the impact of Mercantile, higher brokerage fees, higher debit card revenues resulting from higher transaction volumes, and fees from the credit card business that began in the latter part of 2006. Corporate services revenue was $713 million for 2007, an increase of $87 million, or 14%, over 2006. Higher revenue 72 Table of Contents from commercial mortgage servicing including the impact of the ARCS acquisition, treasury management, third party consumer loan servicing activities and the Mercantile acquisition contributed to the increase in 2007 over the prior year. Service charges on deposits increased $35 million, or 11%, to $348 million for 2007 compared with 2006. The increase was primarily due to the impact of Mercantile. Net securities losses totaled $5 million in 2007 and $207 million in 2006. We took actions during the third quarter of 2006 that resulted in the sale of approximately $6 billion of investment securities at an aggregate pretax loss of $196 million during that quarter. Other noninterest income decreased $170 million, to $423 million, in 2007 compared with 2006. Net losses of $127 million in 2007 representing the net of the mark to market adjustment on our LTIP obligation and gain recognized in connection with our transfer of shares to satisfy a portion of our LTIP obligation, compared with a net loss of $12 million on our LTIP shares obligation in 2006, where such obligation was applicable in the fourth quarter. Noninterest revenue from trading activities totaled $104 million in 2007 compared with $183 million in 2006. While customer trading income increased in comparison, total trading revenue declined in 2007 largely due to the lower economic hedging gains associated with commercial mortgage loan activity and economic hedging losses associated with structured resale agreements. Other noninterest income for 2006 included a $48 million loss incurred in the third quarter in connection with the rebalancing of our residential mortgage portfolio. Noninterest income for 2006 also included the $2.078 billion gain on the BlackRock/MLIM transaction, whereas there was no similar transaction in 2007. Noninterest Expense Total noninterest expense was $4.296 billion for 2007, a decrease of $147 million compared with $4.443 billion for 2006. Noninterest expense for 2007 included the following: Acquisition integration costs of $102 million, and A charge of $82 million for an indemnification obligation related to certain Visa litigation. Noninterest expense for 2006 included the following: The first nine months of 2006 included $765 million of expenses related to BlackRock, which was still consolidated during that time, and BlackRock/MLIM transaction integration costs totaling $91 million. Apart from the impact of these items, noninterest expense increased $525 million, or 15%, in 2007 compared with 2006. These increases were largely a result of the acquisition of Mercantile. Investments in growth initiatives were mitigated by disciplined expense management. EFFECTIVE TAX RATE Our effective tax rate was 29.9% for 2007 and 34% for 2006. The lower effective tax rate in 2007 compared with the prior year reflected the impact of the following matters: An increase in income taxes related to the gain from, and a $57 million cumulative adjustment to increase deferred income taxes in connection with, the BlackRock/MLIM transaction in 2006, and Lower pretax income for the fourth quarter of 2007 had the impact of reducing the effective tax rate for the full year. CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET REVIEW Loans Loans increased $18.2 billion, or 36%, as of December 31, 2007 compared with December 31, 2006. Our Mercantile acquisition added $12.4 billion of loans including $4.9 billion of commercial, $4.8 billion of commercial real estate, $1.6 billion of consumer and $1.1 billion of residential mortgage loans. Our Yardville acquisition added $1.9 billion of loans. Securities Total securities at December 31, 2007 were $30.2 billion compared with $23.2 billion at December 31, 2006. Securities represented 22% of total assets at December 31, 2007 and 23% of total assets at December 31, 2006. Our acquisition of Mercantile included approximately $2 billion of securities classified as available for sale. The increase in total securities compared with December 31, 2006 was primarily due to higher balances in residential mortgage backed, commercial mortgage backed and asset backed securities. At December 31, 2007, the investment securities balance included a net unrealized loss of $265 million, which represented the difference between fair value and amortized cost. The comparable amount at December 31, 2006 was a net unrealized loss of $142 million. The expected weighted average life of investment securities (excluding corporate stocks and other) was 3 years and 6 months at December 31, 2007 and 3 years and 8 months at December 31, 2006. Loans Held For Sale Loans held for sale totaled $3.9 billion at December 31, 2007 compared with $2.4 billion at December 31, 2006. Loans held for sale included commercial mortgage loans intended for securitization totaling $2.1 billion at December 31, 2007 and $.9 billion at December 31, 2006. The balance at December 31, 2007 increased as market conditions were not conducive to completing securitization transactions during the fourth quarter of 2007. 73 Table of Contents Loans held for sale also included education loans held for sale of $1.5 billion at December 31, 2007 and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2006. Gains on sales of education loans totaled $24 million in 2007 and $33 million for 2006. These gains are reflected in the other noninterest income line item in our Consolidated Income Statement and in the results of the Retail Banking business segment. Asset Quality Total nonperforming assets at December 31, 2007 increased $311 million, to $495 million, compared with December 31, 2006. Nonperforming loans, the largest component of nonperforming assets, increased $294 million, to $454 million, at December 31, 2007 compared with December 31, 2006. Of this increase in nonperforming loans, $192 million occurred during the fourth quarter of 2007. The increase was primarily due to higher nonaccrual commercial real estate loans primarily related to residential real estate development exposure. At December 31, 2007, our largest nonperforming asset was approximately $20 million and our average nonperforming loan associated with commercial lending was approximately $0.5 million. The ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets rose to .36% at December 31, 2007 compared with .18% at December 31, 2006. The allowance for loan and lease losses was $830 million and represented 1.21% of total loans and 183% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2007. The comparable amounts were $560 million, 1.12% and 350%, respectively, at December 31, 2006. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The sum of goodwill and other intangible assets increased $5.5 billion at December 31, 2007 compared with the prior year end, to $9.6 billion. We added $4.7 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the Mercantile acquisition. In addition, our acquisitions of ARCS, Yardville and Albridge collectively added $.9 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets during 2007. Funding Sources Total funding sources were $113.6 billion at December 31, 2007 and $81.3 billion at December 31, 2006. Funding sources increased $32.3 billion in the comparison as total deposits increased $16.4 billion and total borrowed funds increased $15.9 billion. Our acquisition of Mercantile added $12.5 billion of deposits and $2.1 billion of borrowed funds. The Yardville acquisition resulted in $2.0 billion of deposits. During the first quarter of 2007 we issued borrowings to fund the $2.1 billion cash portion of the Mercantile acquisition. The remaining increase in borrowed funds was the result of growth in loans and securities and the need to fund other net changes in our balance sheet. During the second half of 2007 we substantially increased Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, which provided us with additional liquidity at relatively attractive rates. Shareholders Equity Total shareholders equity increased $4.1 billion, to $14.9 billion, at December 31, 2007 compared with December 31, 2006. In addition to the net impact of earnings and dividends in 2007, this increase reflected a $2.5 billion reduction in treasury stock and a $1.0 billion increase in capital surplus, largely due to the issuance of PNC common shares for the Mercantile and Yardville acquisitions. Regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2007 were 6.2% for leverage, 6.8% for Tier 1 risk based and 10.3% for total risk based capital. At December 31, 2006, the regulatory capital ratios were 9.3% for leverage, 10.4% for Tier 1 risk based and 13.5% for total risk based capital. Glossary of Terms Accounting/administration net fund assets Net domestic and foreign fund investment assets for which we provide accounting and administration services. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Adjusted average total assets Primarily comprised of total average quarterly (or annual) assets plus (less) unrealized losses (gains) on investment securities, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (net of eligible deferred taxes). Annualized Adjusted to reflect a full year of activity. Assets under management Assets over which we have sole or shared investment authority for our customers/clients. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Basis point One hundredth of a percentage point. Charge off Process of removing a loan or portion of a loan from our balance sheet because it is considered uncollectible. We also record a charge off when a loan is transferred to held for sale by reducing the carrying amount by the allowance for loan losses associated with such loan or, if the market value is less than its carrying amount, by the amount of that difference. Common shareholders equity to total assets Common shareholders equity divided by total assets. Common shareholders equity equals total shareholders equity less the liquidation value of preferred stock. Credit derivatives Contractual agreements, primarily credit default swaps, that provide protection against a credit event of one or more referenced credits. The nature of a credit event is established by the protection buyer and protection seller at the inception of a transaction, and such events include bankruptcy, insolvency and failure to meet payment obligations when due. The buyer of the credit derivative pays a periodic fee in return for a payment by the protection seller upon the occurrence, if any, of a credit event. 74 Table of Contents Credit spread The difference in yield between debt issues of similar maturity. The excess of yield attributable to credit spread is often used as a measure of relative creditworthiness, with a reduction in the credit spread reflecting an improvement in the borrowers perceived creditworthiness. Custody assets Investment assets held on behalf of clients under safekeeping arrangements. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Investment assets held in custody at other institutions on our behalf are included in the appropriate asset categories on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as if physically held by us. Derivatives Financial contracts whose value is derived from publicly traded securities, interest rates, currency exchange rates or market indices. Derivatives cover a wide assortment of financial contracts, including forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Distressed loan portfolio Includes residential real estate development loans, cross border leases, subprime residential mortgage loans, brokered home equity loans and certain other residential real estate loans. These loans require special servicing and management oversight given current market conditions. The majority of these loans are from acquisitions, primarily National City. Duration of equity An estimate of the rate sensitivity of our economic value of equity. A negative duration of equity is associated with asset sensitivity (i.e., positioned for rising interest rates), while a positive value implies liability sensitivity (i.e., positioned for declining interest rates). For example, if the duration of equity is +1.5 years, the economic value of equity declines by 1.5% for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates. Earning assets Assets that generate income, which include: federal funds sold; resale agreements; trading securities; interest earning deposits with banks; other short term investments; loans held for sale; loans, net of unearned income; investment securities; and certain other assets. Economic capital Represents the amount of resources that a business segment should hold to guard against potentially large losses that could cause insolvency. It is based on a measurement of economic risk, as opposed to risk as defined by regulatory bodies. The economic capital measurement process involves converting a risk distribution to the capital that is required to support the risk, consistent with our target credit rating. As such, economic risk serves as a common currency of risk that allows us to compare different risks on a similar basis. Effective duration A measurement, expressed in years, that, when multiplied by a change in interest rates, would approximate the percentage change in value of on and off balance sheet positions. Efficiency Noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income (GAAP basis) and noninterest income. Fair value The price that would be received to sell an asset or the price that would be paid to transfer a liability on the measurement date using the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants. Foreign exchange contracts Contracts that provide for the future receipt and delivery of foreign currency at previously agreed upon terms. Funds transfer pricing A management accounting methodology designed to recognize the net interest income effects of sources and uses of funds provided by the assets and liabilities of a business segment. We assign these balances LIBOR based funding rates at origination that represent the interest cost for us to raise/invest funds with similar maturity and repricing structures. Futures and forward contracts Contracts in which the buyer agrees to purchase and the seller agrees to deliver a specific financial instrument at a predetermined price or yield. May be settled either in cash or by delivery of the underlying financial instrument. GAAP Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Impaired loans Acquired loans determined to be credit impaired under AICPA Statement of Position 03 3, Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer. Loans are determined to be impaired if there is evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected. Interest rate floors and caps Interest rate protection instruments that involve payment from the protection seller to the protection buyer of an interest differential, which represents the difference between a short term rate (e.g., three month LIBOR) and an agreed upon rate (the strike rate) applied to a notional principal amount. Interest rate swap contracts Contracts that are entered into primarily as an asset/liability management strategy to reduce interest rate risk. Interest rate swap contracts are exchanges of interest rate payments, such as fixed rate payments for floating rate payments, based on notional principal amounts. Intrinsic value The amount by which the fair value of an underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of an option on that stock. Investment securities Collectively, securities available for sale and securities held to maturity. 75 Table of Contents Leverage ratio Tier 1 risk based capital divided by adjusted average total assets. LIBOR Acronym for London InterBank Offered Rate. LIBOR is the average interest rate charged when banks in the London wholesale money market (or interbank market) borrow unsecured funds from each other. LIBOR rates are used as a benchmark for interest rates on a global basis. Net interest income from loans and deposits A management accounting assessment, using funds transfer pricing methodology, of the net interest contribution from loans and deposits. Net interest margin Annualized taxable equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets. Nondiscretionary assets under administration Assets we hold for our customers/clients in a non discretionary, custodial capacity. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Noninterest income to total revenue Noninterest income divided by the sum of net interest income (GAAP basis) and noninterest income. Nonperforming assets Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructured loans, foreclosed assets and other assets. We do not accrue interest income on assets classified as nonperforming. Nonperforming loans Nonperforming loans include loans to commercial, commercial real estate, equipment lease financing, consumer, and residential mortgage customers and construction customers as well as troubled debt restructured loans. Nonperforming loans do not include loans held for sale or foreclosed and other assets. We do not accrue interest income on loans classified as nonperforming. Notional amount A number of currency units, shares, or other units specified in a derivatives contract. Operating leverage The period to period dollar or percentage change in total revenue (GAAP basis) less the dollar or percentage change in noninterest expense. A positive variance indicates that revenue growth exceeded expense growth (i.e., positive operating leverage) while a negative variance implies expense growth exceeded revenue growth (i.e., negative operating leverage). Options Contracts that grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right, but not the obligation, to either purchase or sell the associated financial instrument at a set price during a specified period or at a specified date in the future. Other than temporary impairment Impairment occurs when the fair value of a security is less than its cost. The impairment is considered other than temporary when it is probable that the holder will be unable to collect all amounts due according to contractual terms of a debt security at acquisition. A few factors that are considered to determine whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary may include a) the length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost; b) the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer such as changes in technology that may impair the earnings potential of the investment or the discontinuance of a segment of the business that may affect the future earnings potential; or c) the intent and ability of the holder to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. Securities determined to be other than temporary impaired are written down to fair value with the loss recognized in income during the period in which the assessment is made. The fair value would take into account credit and liquidity risk. Recovery Cash proceeds received on a loan that we had previously charged off. We credit the amount received to the allowance for loan and lease losses. Return on average assets Annualized net income divided by average assets. Return on average capital Annualized net income divided by average capital. Return on average common shareholders equity Annualized net income less preferred stock dividends divided by average common shareholders equity. Return on average tangible common shareholders equity Annualized net income less preferred stock dividends divided by average common shareholders equity less goodwill and other intangible assets (net of deferred taxes for both taxable and nontaxable combinations), and excluding mortgage servicing rights. Risk weighted assets Primarily computed by the assignment of specific risk weights (as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) to assets and off balance sheet instruments. Securitization The process of legally transforming financial assets into securities. Servicing rights An intangible asset or liability created by an obligation to service assets for others. Typical servicing rights include the right to receive a fee for collecting and forwarding payments on loans and related taxes and insurance premiums held in escrow. Swaptions Contracts that grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right, but not the obligation, to enter into an interest rate swap agreement during a specified period or at a specified date in the future. 76 Table of Contents Tangible common equity ratio Period end common shareholders equity less goodwill and other intangible assets (net of deferred taxes), and excluding mortgage servicing rights, divided by period end assets less goodwill and other intangible assets (net of deferred taxes), and excluding mortgage servicing rights. Taxable equivalent interest The interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of yields and margins for all interest earning assets, we use interest income on a taxable equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margins by increasing the interest income earned on tax exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on other taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated Income Statement. Tier 1 risk based capital Tier 1 risk based capital equals: total shareholders equity, plus trust preferred capital securities, plus certain minority interests that are held by others; less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (net of eligible deferred taxes relating to taxable and nontaxable combinations), less equity investments in nonfinancial companies less ineligible servicing assets and less net unrealized holding losses on available for sale equity securities. Net unrealized holding gains on available for sale equity securities, net unrealized holding gains (losses) on available for sale debt securities and net unrealized holding gains (losses) on cash flow hedge derivatives are excluded from total shareholders equity for Tier 1 risk based capital purposes. Tier 1 risk based capital ratio Tier 1 risk based capital divided by period end risk weighted assets. Total fund assets serviced Total domestic and offshore fund investment assets for which we provide related processing services. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Total return swap A non traditional swap where one party agrees to pay the other the total return of a defined underlying asset (e.g., a loan), usually in return for receiving a stream of LIBOR based cash flows. The total returns of the asset, including interest and any default shortfall, are passed through to the counterparty. The counterparty is therefore assuming the credit and economic risk of the underlying asset. Total risk based capital Tier 1 risk based capital plus qualifying subordinated debt and trust preferred securities, other minority interest not qualified as Tier 1, eligible gains on available for sale equity securities and the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to certain limitations. Total risk based capital ratio Total risk based capital divided by period end risk weighted assets. Transaction deposits The sum of money market and interest bearing demand deposits and demand and other noninterest bearing deposits. Value at risk (VaR) A statistically based measure of risk which describes the amount of potential loss which may be incurred due to severe and adverse market movements. The measure is of the maximum loss which should not be exceeded on 99 out of 100 days. Watchlist A list of criticized loans, credit exposure or other assets compiled for internal monitoring purposes. We define criticized exposure for this purpose as exposure with an internal risk rating of other assets especially mentioned, substandard, doubtful or loss. Yield curve A graph showing the relationship between the yields on financial instruments or market indices of the same credit quality with different maturities. For example, a normal or positive yield curve exists when long term bonds have higher yields than short term bonds. A flat yield curve exists when yields are the same for short term and long term bonds. A steep yield curve exists when yields on long term bonds are significantly higher than on short term bonds. An inverted or negative yield curve exists when short term bonds have higher yields than long term bonds. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION We make statements in this Report, and we may from time to time make other statements, regarding our outlook or expectations for earnings, revenues, expenses, capital levels, liquidity levels, asset quality and or other matters regarding or affecting PNC that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward looking statements are typically identified by words such as believe, expect, anticipate, intend, outlook, estimate, forecast, will, project and other similar words and expressions. Forward looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. We do not assume any duty and do not undertake to update our forward looking statements. Actual results or future events could differ, possibly materially, from those that we anticipated in our forward looking statements, and future results could differ materially from our historical performance. Our forward looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties. We provide greater detail regarding some of these factors elsewhere in this Report, 77 Table of Contents including in the Risk Factors and Risk Management sections. Our forward looking statements may also be subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those discussed elsewhere in this Report or in our other filings with the SEC. Our businesses and financial results are affected by business and economic conditions, both generally and specifically in the principal markets in which we operate. In particular, our businesses and financial results may be impacted by: Changes in interest rates and valuations in the debt, equity and other financial markets. Disruptions in the liquidity and other functioning of financial markets, including such disruptions in the markets for real estate and other assets commonly securing financial products. Actions by the Federal Reserve and other government agencies, including those that impact money supply and market interest rates. Changes in our customers, suppliers and other counterparties performance in general and their creditworthiness in particular. Changes in customer preferences and behavior, whether as a result of changing business and economic conditions or other factors. A continuation of recent turbulence in significant portions of the US and global financial markets, particularly if it worsens, could impact our performance, both directly by affecting our revenues and the value of our assets and liabilities and indirectly by affecting our counterparties and the economy generally. Our business and financial performance could be impacted as the financial industry restructures in the current environment, both by changes in the creditworthiness and performance of our counterparties and by changes in the competitive landscape. Given current economic and financial market conditions, our forward looking financial statements are subject to the risk that these conditions will be substantially different than we are currently expecting. These statements are based on our current expectations that interest rates will remain low through 2009 with continued wide market credit spreads, and our view that national economic trends currently point to a continuation of severe recessionary conditions in 2009 followed by a subdued recovery. Legal and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses or our financial condition or results of operations or our competitive position or reputation. Reputational impacts, in turn, could affect matters such as business generation and retention, our ability to attract and retain management, liquidity, and funding. These legal and regulatory developments could include: Changes resulting from the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and other developments in response to the current economic and financial industry environment, including current and future conditions or restrictions imposed as a result of our participation in the TARP Capital Purchase Program. Legislative and regulatory reforms generally, including changes to laws and regulations involving tax, pension, bankruptcy, consumer protection, and other aspects of the financial institution industry. Increased litigation risk from recent regulatory and other governmental developments. Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or regulatory and other governmental inquiries. The results of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy the requirements of agreements with governmental agencies. Changes in accounting policies and principles. Our issuance of securities to the US Department of the Treasury may limit our ability to return capital to our shareholders and is dilutive to our common shares. If we are unable previously to redeem the shares, the dividend rate increases substantially after five years. Our business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where appropriate, through the effective use of third party insurance, derivatives, and capital management techniques. The adequacy of our intellectual property protection, and the extent of any costs associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others, can impact our business and operating results. Our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can have an impact on our ability to respond to customer needs and to meet competitive demands. Our ability to implement our business initiatives and strategies could affect our financial performance over the next several years. Competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention, as well as on our credit spreads and product pricing, which can affect market share, deposits and revenues. Our business and operating results can also be affected by widespread natural disasters, terrorist activities or international hostilities, either as a result of the impact on the economy and capital and other financial markets generally or on us or on our customers, suppliers or other counterparties specifically. Also, risks and uncertainties that could affect the results anticipated in forward looking statements or from historical performance relating to our equity interest in BlackRock, Inc. are discussed in more detail in BlackRocks filings with the SEC, including in the Risk Factors sections of BlackRocks reports. BlackRocks SEC filings are accessible on the SECs website and on or through BlackRocks website at www.blackrock.com. 78 Table of Contents This material is referenced for informational purposes only and should not be deemed to constitute a part of this report. In addition, our recent acquisition of National City Corporation (National City) presents us with a number of risks and uncertainties related both to the acquisition transaction itself and to the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC. These risks and uncertainties include the following: The transaction may be substantially more expensive to complete (including the required divestitures and the integration of National Citys businesses) and the anticipated benefits, including anticipated cost savings and strategic gains, may be significantly harder or take longer to achieve than expected or may not be achieved in their entirety as a result of unexpected factors or events. Our ability to achieve anticipated results from this transaction is dependent on the state going forward of the economic and financial markets, which have been under significant stress recently. Specifically, we may incur more credit losses from National Citys loan portfolio than expected. Other issues related to achieving anticipated financial results include the possibility that deposit attrition or attrition in key client, partner and other relationships may be greater than expected. Litigation and governmental investigations currently pending against National City, as well as others that may be filed or commenced relating to National Citys business and activities before the acquisition could adversely impact our financial results. Our ability to achieve anticipated results is also dependent on our ability to bring National Citys systems, operating models, and controls into conformity with ours and to do so on our planned time schedule. The integration of National Citys business and operations into PNC, which will include conversion of National Citys different systems and procedures, may take longer than anticipated or be more costly than anticipated or have unanticipated adverse results relating to National Citys or PNCs existing businesses. PNCs ability to integrate National City successfully may be adversely affected by the fact that this transaction will result in PNC entering several markets where PNC did not previously have any meaningful retail presence. In addition to the National City transaction, we grow our business from time to time by acquiring other financial services companies. Acquisitions in general present us with risks, in addition to those presented by the nature of the business acquired, similar to some or all of those described above relating to the National City acquisition. ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK This information is set forth in the Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report.
